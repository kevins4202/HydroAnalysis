10395,soil mulching can effectively modify crop growth environments and increase crop productivity in rainfed agriculture and the knowledge about water ﬂuxes within the soil crop atmosphere ecosystem is essential for improving water productivity wp in water limited regions such as northwest china this study systematically investigated seasonal and inter annual dynamics of evapotranspiration et partitioning into canopy interception ic soil evaporation es and plant transpiration tp in rainfed maize fields under four mulching conditions nm non mulching sm straw mulching rpbf plastic mulched ridge with bare furrow and rpsf plastic mulched ridge with straw mulched furrow from june to october in 2015 2016 and 2017 characterized by various seasonal rainfall distributions the results showed that seasonal et was slightly higher under mulching conditions compared with nm during each growing season but the difference was not statistically significant soil mulching decreased es et 22 0 29 8 14 3 19 5 and 11 3 15 1 under sm rpbf and rpsf respectively relative to nm 27 6 34 5 while it increased tp et 55 8 63 7 63 0 71 0 and 65 6 73 2 respectively and ic et 13 2 16 0 14 7 17 4 and 15 4 19 3 respectively relative to nm 52 4 58 7 and 13 0 15 7 respectively differences in et partitioning under contrasting mulching conditions were related largely to variations in leaf area index and soil water stress although seasonal et under various mulching conditions varied among the three seasons 264 8 286 6 mm in 2015 241 2 242 5 mm in 2016 and 296 6 324 4 mm in 2017 the proportions of ic 13 0 15 4 13 3 19 3 and 15 7 17 7 es 11 3 28 3 15 1 34 5 and 11 4 27 6 and tp 58 7 73 2 52 4 65 6 and 56 7 70 9 to total et were similar soil mulching greatly enhanced maize yield by 9 5 26 1 27 0 186 5 and 30 8 209 7 under sm rpbf and rpsf compared with nm respectively resulting in 1 5 15 8 19 0 184 7 and 20 8 214 8 higher wp respectively it was concluded that soil mulching largely promoted tp and restrained es in spite of slight increase in ic thereby improving maize yield and wp during the three seasons the present study gives a better understanding of rainwater cycle and crop water use which is critical to sustainable management of rainfed agriculture keywords rainfed maize canopy interception soil evaporation plant transpiration water productivity 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a dominant component of hydrological cycle in agricultural systems consisting of canopy interception ic evaporation from soil surface es and transpiration by plants tp ic is considered as the part of rainfall that is retained by crop canopy and finally returned to the atmosphere during and after rainfall fan et al 2014 which is generally obtained by subtracting throughfall and stemflow from gross rainfall although some previous studies have shown that ic can absorb available energy which will evaporate the water residing on leaf surfaces in the farmland or decrease the transpiration rate by increasing atmospheric water vapor content near the crop canopy and reducing the water pressure difference kraus 1966 stewart 1977 wang et al 2007 it can decrease the availability of total rainwater input that reaches the soil surface leading to great water losses in the agricultural ecosystem many studies on canopy rainfall interception have been conducted on crops especially on maize plants all of which clearly indicated that rainfall interception could not be ignored han et al 2014 zheng et al 2018a b therefore it is essential to consider canopy interception loss separately from total et es is another important part of the surface water balance but it does not enhance crop productivity micro lysimeters have been widely used for determining es from the bare soil in field experiments wang and liu 2007 zhang et al 2011 anapalli et al 2016 consoli et al 2017 liu et al 2018 gonzalez dugo et al 2019 and it is reported that about 20 30 of growing season et participates in this water loss process for annual crops allen 2011 tp refers to a substantial portion of et through which soil water returns to the air from plant stomata which is a contributing factor to crop yield heat balance based sap flow probes are useful tools to measure plant water use and many studies have suggested that they are suitable for estimating plant transpiration for small stems with low sap flow rates e g maize plants zhang et al 2016 fan et al 2018 partitioning et into ic es and tp is desirable to improve the understanding of soil water loss processes and then to increase crop production through maximizing transpiration and reducing evaporation yimam et al 2015 maize zea mays l is one of the major crops cultivated in summer in northwest china huang et al 2011 soil water supplied by rainfall is the main factor that limits the physiological development and reproduction of rainfed maize in this region it is therefore essential to conserve soil moisture and enhance crop water productivity wp by changing the balance of ic es and tp through appropriate agronomic practices field management practices have been extensively applied to maintain crop production especially plastic or straw mulching which can efficiently improve soil water and temperature regimes and crop growth conditions li et al 2013a b liu et al 2015 li et al 2017 mo et al 2018 jia et al 2018 ding et al 2018 2019a zheng et al 2020 however the effects of various mulching patterns on et remain inconsistent li et al 2018 reported that mulching techniques plastic film gravel sand and straw generally reduced total et during the growth seasons of summer maize compared with non mulching however li et al 2013a concluded that the ridge and furrow mulching reduced et at the early growth stage of spring maize but increased et at the middle growth stages and et showed no obvious pattern at the later growth stage among different treatments thus process based investigation on the effects of mulching especially water consumption mechanisms as a result of mulching is important for improving wp in rainfed farming systems soil mulching can modify the partitioning of et into ic es and tp by affecting soil moisture soil temperature and subsequently maize growth for instance zheng et al 2018a b measured throughfall stemflow gross rainfall and further estimated ic of summer maize using the water balance method they found that seasonal ic accounted for 7 4 21 4 of gross rainfall under various mulching patterns and planting densities li et al 2008 estimated maize et and es under plastic film mulched condition at the shiyanghe station in wuwei gansu province of northwest china by using eddy covariance and micro lysimeters they indicated that plastic mulching resulted in high kcb and low ke ranging from 0 to 1 2 and 0 to 0 3 over the whole season which was related to plant growth and soil moisture gong et al 2017 suggested that partial plastic mulching decreased average es et of rainfed maize by 11 2 compared with non mulching and the ratio of es et changed as a logistic function of green leaf area index wang et al 2019b quantified the influence of plastic mulch on et partitioning using an improved multisource energy balance model at daman superstation located in gansu province of china they found that mulching increased transpiration fraction and the effects of mulching on et partitioning varied with leaf development feng et al 2019 monitored et on different time scales in non mulched ck and plastic mulched pm seed maize field in eastern loess plateau of china they found that plastic mulching altered et components decreasing es et from 39 9 42 8 under ck to 23 8 34 9 under pm it also increased tp by 9 8 33 3 at the leaf scale and increased plant sap flow by 1 4 34 5 compared with ck under contrasting climatic conditions although previous studies have tried to quantify soil mulching effects on et partitioning in rainfed maize fields most of them mainly concentrated the flux separation under a specific mulching pattern and few studies have investigated et partitioning under various mulching conditions particularly during maize growing seasons characterized by various temporal rainfall distributions what s more importantly issues related to et partitioning into rainfall intercepted by canopies vapour fluxes of plant transpiration and soil evaporation have been extensively studied for forested ecosystems raz yaseef et al 2012 fan et al 2015 benyon and doody 2015 wang and wang 2017 but studies on maize et partitioning have overlooked the effect of ic which reflects the influence of plants on the hydrological cycle in water limited environments to our knowledge little attention has been paid to systematically determine the contributions of the three components ic es and tp to total et in rainfed maize fields over the whole growing season under various mulching conditions therefore the objectives of the present three year study were to 1 examine the seasonal and inter annual variations of the three components of et ic es and tp under various mulching patterns during the maize growing seasons of 2015 2016 and 2017 2 identify the main environmental and meteorological conditions influencing et partitioning in this region and 3 compare the influence of various mulching patterns on the contributions of ic es and tp to total et 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and design the field experiments were performed during the maize growing seasons of 2015 2017 at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and

pieces and spread on the soil surface under sm and in the furrow under rpsf at an application rate of 9000 kg ha 1 the maize hybrid zhengdan958 a widely cultivated maize variety in this region was planted at a population density of 67 500 plants ha 1 60 cm 25 cm on june 15th 2015 june 12th 2016 and june 14th 2017 and harvested on september 30th 2015 october 4th 2016 and october 6th 2017 respectively all the fertilizers i e urea n 46 180 kg ha 1 calcium superphosphate p2o5 16 120 kg ha 1 and potassium sulphate k2o 51 60 kg ha 1 were applied before maize planting irrigation was not applied over the whole maize growing seasons and pest and weed control was performed as necessary 2 2 field measurements 2 2 1 leaf area index three plants per experimental plot were sampled to determine leaf length and leaf width at 5 10 day intervals the area of each leaf was calculated by multiplying leaf length width and a coefficient of 0 75 mckee 1964 the leaf area of each plant was determined as the sum of each plant and its occupying land area 60 cm 25 cm continuous lai was obtained by fitting the equation proposed by ding et al 2013a 1 l a i a d a s b e x p r d a s where das

evapotranspiration et0 penman 1948 monteith 1981 allen et al 1998 2 2 3 canopy interception throughfall tr was collected using fifteen rainfall collectors under four neighboring maize plants at each experimental plot zheng et al 2019 the depth of throughfall was then determined by the volume of collected rainwater dividing the cross sectional area of throughfall collectors stemflow s was sampled on six maize plants with collars made by plastic plates which were attached around the maize stems stemflow water in collars was drained to collectors using a slot with a transfer hose lamm and manges 2000 the depth of stemflow was determined as the ratio of stemflow volume and stemflow catchment area 60 cm 25 cm the detailed measurements of tr and s can be found in zheng et al 2019 ic was calculated as the difference between gr tr and s as follows 2 i c g r t r s in addition relative canopy interception was defined as the ratio of ic to gross rainfall 2 2 4 soil evaporation and sap flow rate soil evaporation es was observed by micro lysimeters made from pvc pipes with a height of 20 cm and a diameter of 10 5 cm boast and robertson 1982 two ml cylinders were installed at each plot for flat cultivation one was installed in the planting row and the other in between two neighboring rows for cultivation with ridge and furrow one was located on the ridge and the other in the furrow the micro lysimeters were changed and refilled with undisturbed soil samples every seven days or within one day following heavy rainfall 5 mm day 1 liu et al 2012 balwinder singh et al 2016 wang and wang 2017 daily es was calculated as the difference in micro lysimeter weight between the beginning and ending points of the day 18 00 pm soil evaporation could not be measured on rainy days due to the influence of rainfall over the micro lysimeters so we assumed that soil evaporation was zero on rainy days in this study similar to wang and wang 2017 the heat balance based dynagage flow32 1 k system model sga5 9 13 19 25 ws dynamax houston tx usa was used to measure sap flow rates jiang et al 2016 the sensors were installed on three maize stems in each mulching treatment one sensor per each plot after july 1 the sensors were insulated with silica gel and aluminum foil for minimizing energy exchange and preventing from rainfall the sensors were moved to various maize plants every 10 15 days to minimize maize damage from high temperatures of sap flow sensors the sensors output was measured at 60 s intervals and recorded every 30 min as the average value the measured sap flow rate was corrected using the calibration equation of wang et al 2017 the hourly sap flow rate for each maize plant under various mulching patterns was then calculated as the average sap flow rate for the three sample plants qh g h 1 plant 1 the daily plant water use was the sum of qh in a day qd l day 1 plant 1 maize plant water use qd l day 1 plant 1 was then upscaled to tp mm d 1 using the following equation 3 t p q d a where a is the average ground area occupied by a maize plant m2 2 2 5 soil water content fine roots of summer maize are mainly concentrated within the 0 60 cm soil profile liu et al 2017 soil water content was thus measured using calibrated ech2o 5te sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa usa at 10 20 30 and 50 cm depths data were recorded at 15 min intervals by data loggers and daily average swc was calculated by averaging 15 min values two sets of sensors were installed under nm and sm one in the maize row and the other in between two neighboring rows three sets of sensors were used under rpbf and rpsf which were installed in between two furrows in between two ridges and at the boundary of two neighboring ridge and furrow respectively averaged daily soil moisture in the top 50 cm soil layer was calculated by averaging observed swc at different soil depths and locations for further data analyses gravimetric soil water content was also measured in the 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 100 125 125 150 cm soil layers before sowing and after harvesting to calculate changes in soil water storage throughout the growing seasons and then obtain wp of maize volumetric water content was attained by multiplying gravimetric water content and dry bulk density obtained from oven dried weights dried at 105 c 2 2 6 grain yield and water productivity the grain yield of maize was determined after harvest at a 12 5 moisture based on the four central rows of the plots excluding two plants at the row ends seasonal et was obtained from two approaches i e soil water balance method etwb and the sum of ic es and tp etiet seasonal etwb was obtained using the equation etwb gr δs where gr is the gross rainfall over the maize growing season and δs is the change in soil water storage in the 150 cm soil profile no surface runoff was considered as a result of the flat land surface and the deep percolation was also neglected considering the small rainfall input to the soil and large soil water holding capability seasonal etisp was determined by summing canopy interception ic es from ml and tp from sap flow i e etisp ic es tp wp was determined as the ratio of grain yield gy and etisp i e wp gy etisp 2 3 data analysis the path analysis method was employed to assess the relationships between y es daily soil evaporation and tp daily plant transpiration and x rs ta vpd rh u2 lai and swc using the spss 16 0 software spss inc chicago usa only 234 days of es data and influencing factors were used for path analysis in table 2 due to rainy days the spss software was also used for statistical analysis and regressions one way anova analysis significant at the p 0 05 level was used to test the statistical differences of maize yield the ratios of ic es and tp to total et and wp among different mulching patterns all of the figures were plotted using sigmaplot 10 0 systat software san jose ca 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions and leaf area index dynamics of daily climatic parameters during the growing seasons of summer maize from 2015 to 2017 are presented in fig 2 average daily rs during the three seasons were 203 24 209 62 and 217 44 w m 2 respectively average ta and vpd were slightly higher in 2016 25 6 0 94 k pa than those in 2015 24 2 1 07 k pa and 2017 24 8 1 05 k pa however average rh was slightly higher in 2015 71 1 and 2017 70 8 than that in 2016 69 3 wind speed u2 ranged 0 3 2 5 0 5 4 1 and 0 5 3 1 m s 1 during the three seasons respectively total et0 were 413 0 483 1 and 472 3 mm during the three seasons respectively fig 3 presents the trends in rainfall and averaged volumetric soil water content swc 0 50 cm during the three seasons gross rainfall was 269 9 261 1 and 287 4 mm during the growing seasons of 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively although similar total rainfall amount was observed the seasonal temporal rainfall distribution differed greatly in 2015 rainfall distributed at the four growth stages accounted for 31 4 15 6 23 0 and 30 0 respectively however only 4 4 of total rainfall was spread from tasseling to grain filling stage in 2016 and 7 1 from seedling to jointing stage in 2017 swc under all treatments showed similar trends but swc with soil mulching was generally higher than that of non mulching seasonal average swc under nm sm rpbf and rpsf was 23 1 23 7 23 4 and 23 2 in 2015 20 4 21 2 21 9 and 22 0 in 2016 and 22 1 22 9 23 3 and 23 4 in 2017 long intervals between rainfall events in august 2016 allowed swc to dramatically decline fig 3 as maize grew leaf area index lai increased rapidly after 40 das and obtained the maximum value 60 70 das with maximal lai of 3 56 nm 4 14 sm 4 42 rpbf and 5 09 rpsf m2 m 2 in 2015 5 33 nm 5 58 sm 6 00 rpbf and 6 24 rpsf m2 m 2 in 2016 and 3 46 nm 4 11 sm 4 60 rpbf and 5 00 rpsf m2 m 2 in 2017 fig 4 lai declined after 70 das during the three seasons and the decrease in lai at the late growth stage of 2016 was larger than those in 2015 and 2017 fig 3 3 2 canopy interception and its influencing factors number of rainfall events rainfall depth and canopy interception ic under various mulching patterns at each maize growth stage in 2015 2016 and 2017 are shown in table 1 total growing season canopy interception was 34 37 37 66 41 48 and 44 24 mm 32 01 34 96 42 28 and 45 82 mm and 46 44 51 75 54 58 and 57 56 mm under nm sm rpbf and rpsf in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively it was always in the order of nm sm rpbf rpsf during the three growing seasons although there was no significant difference among various mulching patterns in 2015 and 2017 canopy interception at various growth stages was similar to the variation of growing season canopy interception which was always lower under nm and higher under rpsf generally ic increased with increasing gross rainfall gr amount under all mulching patterns during 2015 2017 fig 4 at the seedling to jointing stage ic showed weaker relationships with gr than those at the other stages which was mainly resulted from the much smaller lai at this growth stage ic was higher under soil mulching when gr was the same the relative canopy interception generally decreased with increasing rainfall amount and tended to be constant for larger rainfall events these power regression lines also showed that ic was in the order of nm sm rpbf rpfs which was mainly due to the differences in lai among the four mulching conditions the relationship between canopy interception amount and lai was not obvious among the four mulching patterns at different rainfall classes during 2015 2017 fig 5 however obvious positive power correlations were found between the relative canopy interception and lai r2 0 66 for all rainfall events these fitted equations were similar under nm sm rpbf and rpsf confirming that soil mulching enhanced canopy interception by directly increasing lai 3 3 soil evaporation dynamics the dynamics of soil evaporation during the growing seasons of 2015 2017 are shown in fig 6 daily soil evaporation varied over the experimental periods which showed a relatively high daily evaporation rate of 0 68 mm d 1 from seedling to tasseling and dropped at the end of the tasseling stage to 0 36 mm d 1 from tasseling to maturity soil mulching can significantly restrain the soil evaporation daily soil evaporation was always higher under nm and lower under rpsf during the three growing seasons maximum daily soil evaporation was 2 47 2 32 and 2 12 mm d 1 under nm 2 09 1 90 and 1 95 mm d 1 under sm 1 41 1 39 and 1 22 mm d 1 under rpbf and 1 28 1 16 and 1 02 mm d 1 under rpsf in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively daily mean soil evaporation under nm sm rpbf and rpsf was 0 71 0 62 0 38 and 0 31 mm d 1 in 2015 0 76 0 66 0 43 and 0 33 mm d 1 in 2016 0 73 0 63 0 42 and 0 33 mm d 1 in 2017 respectively the seasonal total soil evaporation under nm sm rpbf and rpsf was 74 9 66 2 40 4 and 32 5 mm in 2015 82 9 72 0 47 4 and 35 8 mm in 2016 and 81 9 71 0 47 5 and 36 8 mm in 2017 respectively 3 4 plant transpiration dynamics fig 7 presents the diurnal variation of sap flow rate during the representative sunny cloudy and rainy days under the four mulching patterns in 2017 sap flow rate had an obvious day night rhythm synchronous with solar radiation on sunny days august 5 and august 9 12 maize sap flow rate enhanced to mid day and then declined with the mean sap flow rates of 29 5 35 0 37 4 and 40 5 g h 1 under nm sm rpbf and rpsf respectively however it slightly decreased around 14 00 and then recovered which was extremely obvious on august 9 10 there were 2 4 31 7 and 0 1 mm rainfalls from august 6 8 respectively causing lower sap flow on these days nevertheless fluxes obviously increased after rain cessation compared to fluxes on august 5 sunny day and reached higher values on august 9 then decreased with the soil drying on rainy and cloudy days august 6 7 and august 18 22 rs had a wide range of fluctuations and sap flow rate also showed fluctuating increase decrease trends with average sap flow rates of 8 1 10 1 11 0 and 11 6 g h 1 under nm sm rpbf and rpsf respectively daily plant transpiration varied over the experimental periods which increased rapidly from seedling with average value of 1 52 mm d 1 kept at higher values 2 65 mm d 1 at the middle stage and decreased gradually at the later stage 0 88 mm d 1 during the three seasons having similar variations with et fig 1 fig 8 the maximum daily transpiration of summer maize appeared on 22 august in 2015 29 july in 2016 and 9 august in 2017 with values of 4 38 5 26 and 6 62 mm d 1 under nm 5 11 5 69 and 6 83 mm d 1 under sm 5 34 5 95 and 8 38 mm d 1 under rpbf and 5 39 6 01 8 62 mm d 1 under rpsf in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively the cumulative water consumption through plant transpiration was significantly enhanced by soil mulching total plant transpiration under nm sm rpbf and rpsf treatment were 155 50 181 86 200 58 and 209 95 mm in 2015 126 68 134 94 152 91 and 155 53 mm in 2016 and 168 30 200 43 220 96 and 230 04 mm in 2017 respectively it should be noted that the difference in daily plant transpiration among the four mulching modes was larger at the middle stage than that at the earlier and later stages 3 5 controlling factors of es and tp fig 9 presents relationships between daily es tp against et0 under various mulching patterns during 2015 2017 there were positive correlations between es tp and et0 during the three seasons p 0 001 et0 was directly affected by meteorological variables therefore rs ta vpd rh u2 lai and swc were selected to analyze the controlling factors of soil evaporation es and plant transpiration tp using the path analysis method with regard to the correlation between each factor to es the highest correlation was observed for rs 0 499 followed by rh 0 400 vpd 0 398 lai 0 398 ta 0 337 u2 0 301 and swc 0 170 where the coefficients of determination were 0 213 0 090 0 239 0 152 0 117 0 039 and 0

were observed for rs ta vpd and rh 0 659 0 536 0 517 and 0 498 respectively and lower correlations for u2 lai and swc 0 085 0 119 and 0 032 respectively with no significant influence of swc p 0 143 the coefficients of determination for tp based on rs ta vpd rh u2 lai and swc were 0 385 0 132 0 044 0 041 0 002 0 049 and 0 008 respectively the direct coefficients were 0 584 0 246 0 086 0 083 0 025 0 408 and 0 235 respectively the direct coefficient of vpd rh and u2 were not significant p 0 05 but the indirect effects of vpd and rh on tp through rs were high 0 447 and 0 447 respectively under various mulching conditions lai and swc were responsible for the difference of es and tp because of the same climatic conditions during the experimental periods in which the influence of lai was higher than swc and the influence of swc was more complex bi 0 074 pi 0 05 rij 0 170 pij 0 001 for es bi 0 235 pi 0 001 rij 0 032 pij 0 05 for tp 3 6 variations in proportions of ic es and tp to total et the ratios of ic es and tp to total et differed among the four mulching patterns during the maize growing seasons of 2015 2017 table 3 fig 10 the variation of tp et displayed a strong seasonal pattern it increased continuously at the early growth stage and became relatively constant from jointing to grain filling and then experienced a decrease after grain filling at most growth stages the contribution of tp to total et was significantly enhanced by soil mulching es et showed an opposite trend to tp et in 2015 and 2017 which decreased from late june to august stabilized at low level and increased slightly at the late growth stage the value of es et was nearly zero at the tg ii stage in 2017 due to continuous rainfall from august 25th to september 5th in addition es et from jointing to grain filling in 2016 was different from those during the other two seasons at the same growth stage maintaining relatively high level the variation of ic et had no obvious consistent pattern and the contribution of ic to et showed almost no significant difference among various mulching conditions throughout the three seasons during the whole growing season es was always in the order of rpsf rpbf sm nm ranging from 11 3 to 34 4 under various mulching patterns during 2015 2017 table 3 ic was the smallest component ranging from 13 0 to 19 3 during the three seasons tp represented the greatest proportion of et ranging from 52 4 to 73 2 the ratios of ic and tp to et were largest under rpsf followed by rpbf sm and nm 3 7 grain yield and water productivity among the three growing seasons grain yield and et were 1366 9 9073 9 kg ha 1 and 237 13 324 44 mm in various mulching treatments respectively table 3 there were significant differences in gy among mulching treatments but et was not signiﬁcantly affected compared with nm soil mulching increased grain yield by 138 5 2999 0 kg ha 1 and et by 4 0 27 8 mm water productivity wp under nm sm rpbf and rpsf were 22 42 22 75 26 69 and 27 08 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2015 5 67 6 22 16 14 and 17 85 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2016 and 20 48 23 71 26 76 and 27 97 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2017 respectively it can be found that etisp were higher than etwb by 23 29 37 27 mm in 2015 by 20 75 32 87 mm in 2016 and by 38 02 43 18 mm in 2017 with relative error of 9 3 15 3 in 2015 9 4 16 1 in 2016 and 13 3 15 9 in 2017 this indicated that et values obtained from throughfall stemflow micro lysimeter and sap flow measurements were comparable to those from the water balance method 4 discussion 4 1 canopy interception growing season ic was in the order of nm sm rpbf rpsf due to the good growth conditions when applying soil mulching gross rainfall firstly arrives leaf surfaces and part of rainfall is intercepted and returns back to the air through evaporation therefore leaf area is a significant factor affecting canopy interception a positive relationship between canopy interception and maize lai was found in this study which agrees well with the finding of zheng et al 2012 compared with nm there was more water available under straw and plastic film mulching fig 3 which promoted maize growth and development in rainfed regions and resulted in greater lai and subsequently canopy interception when lai was large the increasing rate of relative canopy interception slowed down since the leaf overlapping slowed increasing canopy coverage maize canopy interception accounted for 12 3 20 0 of gross rainfall during 2015 2017 in this study which was higher than those reported previously 7 5 13 3 lin et al 2011 han et al 2014 zheng et al 2012 this can be attributed to the much higher lai in our study as a result of higher planting density compared with previous studies laimax 2 2 3 2 m2 m 2 canopy interception also depends on meteorological factors especially rainfall characteristics our results showed that ic increased slowly and gradually stabilized as gr continued to increase suggesting that maize canopy was gradually saturated with regard to the fitting relation between ic and gr power function seemed to the most reasonable which agrees with the findings of yan et al 2005 and li et al 2009 the percentage of canopy interception first decreased sharply and then began to be stable with increasing gr implying that larger canopy interception would occur during small rainfall events zhang et al 2015 this also indicated that canopy attained its maximum evaporation loss during rainfall with increasing gr and after saturation of canopy zhang et al 2015 also revealed that the percentage of ic decreased with the increase if rainfall intensity in the semi humid but drought prone region rainfall intensity was generally smaller than that under artificially rainfall conditions han et al 2014 leading to great rainfall interception and evaporation in our study 4 2 soil evaporation growing season soil evaporation decreased with varying degrees when covered with wheat straw or plastic film on the soil surface in the present study the path analysis showed that es was significantly affected by all the investigated factors in spite of low correlation in swc table 2 the climatic conditions were the same in the four mulching treatments so lai and swc were mainly responsible for the difference in soil evaporation our results showed that positive relationship existed between daily es and swc rij 0 170 pij 0 001 during the three growing seasons of summer maize however bi based on swc was 0 074 with pi of 0 026 0 005 further reflecting the complex mechanism of swc on es for instance although soil mulching improved soil water condition lower soil evaporation was observed with mulching li et al 2013b indicated that straw mulching as a barrier reduced the rate of water flux changed from liquid to vapor forms from the soil and prevented the diffusion of water vapor through the straw segments also straw mulching has lower thermal conductivity which will reduce the quantity of direct solar radiation arriving at the land surface and the magnitudes of the increase in soil temperatures horton et al 1996 therefore water in the soil profile is difficult to convert into vapor due to the reduced amount of energy available all these will consequently reduce the rate of water loss through straw mulching compared with the bare soil plastic film another barrier material can prevent es by blocking the way of water vapor migration to the atmosphere crop canopy plays a significant role in reducing es todd et al 1991 which was in a good agreement with negative relationship between es and lai found in our study rij 0 398 pij 0 001 bi 0 381 pi 0 001 raz yaseef et al 2010 indicated that es of yatir ecosystem decreased from 150 to 86 mm y 1 from undeveloped canopy cover of 10 to full canopy closure li et al 2013b found that merely 20 mm water was lost through soil evaporation in plastic mulched maize fields due to large canopy shading larger shaded under canopy fraction resulted from higher lai can also provide another explanation for the decreased es with soil mulching in our observations declining trend in daily soil evaporation from early to middle stage was also observed which was primarily due to the variation of lai however unlike other studies conducted in maize fields li et al 2008 alberto et al 2014 the senescence of green leaf did not cause the increase in es during the late season this may be attributed to the decrease in solar radiation ta vpd and et0 as well as the increase in rh due to the importance of soil evaporation in water loss many studies have been done to estimate soil evaporation kang et al 2003 reported that seasonal es accounted for 26 of et of summer maize in three lysimeters in a semi humid and drought prone region ding et al 2013b revealed that es of non mulched maize in northwest china occupied 31 of et while it only accounted for 14 4 of et when plastic film mulching was applied our experiments found that es averaged over the three growing seasons accounted for 30 11 24 97 16 17 and 12 59 of the total et of summer maize under nm sm rpbf and rpsf respectively which was generally consistent with previous results 4 3 plant transpiration tp was the major portion of growing season et the relationship between daily plant transpiration and et0 was linear since et0 is a comprehensive meteorological index which agrees with the findings of liu et al 2012 and jiang et al 2016 path analysis showed that rs was the main meteorological factor controlling tp with bi of 0 584 rij of 0 659 and ri 2 of 0 385 tp enhanced as rs increased typical diurnal increase decrease variations of plant transpiration were in accordance to the variation of rs but lagged around 1 h behind the radiation due to adaption to rs changes zhang et al 2016 the second factor was ta with bi of 0 347 rij of 0 536 and ri 2 of 0 132 zhang et al 2016 and feng et al 2017 also pointed out that air temperature had an important influence on plant transpiration when vpd surpassed a threshold physiological and transpiration activities of maize were restricted oren et al 2001 zhou et al 2004 which resulted in complex responses of tp to vpd with positive rij and rijbj of 0 517 and 0 603 but negative bi of 0 086 in our results table 2 among the meteorological variables the influence of u2 was minimal the weak relationship between tp and u2 in our study may result from concentrated wind distribution in the experimental region in table 2 rij of swc was 0 032 but the influence was not significant pij 0 05 however the positive direct action of swc was extremely significant bi 0 235 ri 0 001 in all maize plants appeared to reduce stomata opening in leaves and then plant transpiration when swc dropped below a critical threshold guyot et al 2017 above this threshold there was no water stress and plant transpiration mainly depended on atmospheric evaporation demand fu et al 2016 since tp is lost primarily through plant stomata the transpiration rate is closely linked to leaf area taiz and zeigher 2006 the direct coefficient of lai was 0 408 and the positive relationship between tp and lai has also been demonstrated in previous studies liu et al 2012 jiang et al 2016 enhanced swc and lai under straw or plastic film mulching were primarily responsible for the higher plant transpiration when the meteorological conditions were the same as that of non mulching treatment at the tg i stage in 2016 tp declined dramatically although measured green lai at this stage was still high this can be largely because much less rainfall and higher temperature led to much drier soil conditions making it difficult for maize roots to absorb soil water and stimulating the production of abscisic acid aba in the root increased aba can restrict stomatal aperture which restrains tp of crops zhang et al 1987 at the tg ii and subsequent growth stages continuous drought caused leaf drying and yellowing leading to fast decline in lai and low level of daily plant transpiration alberto et al 2014 reported that seasonal tp accounted for 66 74 of maize et under overhead sprinkler irrigation kang et al 2003 found that 74 0 of water was lost by maize transpiration throughout the whole growing season in general our observation of seasonal plant transpiration 52 4 73 2 was slightly lower or similar to previously published values because maximum maize lai 3 5 6 2 m2 m 2 in our results was lower than or similar to those reported 5 0 or 7 5 m2 m 2 4 4 evapotranspiration daily et was controlled by climatic conditions such as solar radiation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity wang and wang 2017 climatic conditions also affect the partitioning of et and rainfall was one of the most direct factors influencing sunshine duration and vapor pressure deficit at each maize growth stage i e sj i sj ii jt i jt ii tg i tg ii gm i and gm ii in fig 10 higher values of ic et occurred where greater gross rainfall occurred which was opposite to the variations of es et that is to say ic accounted for relative larger portion of et under high rainfall amounts but relative lower es et would be obtained due to the missing soil evaporation data resulted from the fact that evaporation was theoretically negligible during great rainfall events 5 mm day 1 the partitioning was more influenced by plant growth process especially plant transpiration the seasonal variations of es and tp to total et during the three maize growing seasons were basically in accordance with previous studies li et al 2008 alberto et al 2014 it should be acknowledged that there were uncertainties and errors in et due to the point and touch measurements in this study for example micro lysimeters are unable to measure soil evaporation during rainy days and have constraints in temporal resolution as a result of manual weighing kool et al 2014 heat balance sap flow sensors are subject to errors due to temperature heterogeneity across the plant stem and limited representation of field conditions because of small number of samples wang et al 2017 the collections of throughfall and stemflow may be affected by meteorological factors such as wind speed leading to biases in canopy interception zheng et al 2018b however small relative errors of 9 3 16 1 over the three growing seasons between etwb and etisp confirmed the satisfactory performances of canopy interception micro lysimeter and sap flow measurements to partition et in our research in addition many previous studies also showed that the measurement methods applied in our study can offer convincible evaluation of the three components lamm and manges 2000 wang et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 growing season et of summer maize in our study 237 1 324 4 mm were close to or smaller than those reported by yang et al 2015 in hunag huai hai plain 239 4 552 3 mm and by yan et al 2017 in guanzhong plain 299 3 383 0 mm different evaporative demand in different years and at different sites may cause these differences apart from this these can be also attributed to the lower rainfall input and lack of irrigation in our study compared to these studies the difference in total et among the three seasons was mainly resulted from the maize growth and climatic conditions particularly the difference in temporal rainfall distribution tanaka et al 2008 lei and yang 2010 total seasonal et exhibited no detectable trend under various mulching patterns the partitioning of canopy interception soil evaporation and plant transpiration particularly influenced the ultimate et when maize plants were small more soil surface exposed into air resulting in the increase of soil evaporation under non mulching as maize grew plant transpiration became the dominant component of et also higher canopy interception with higher leaf area index was observed based on our previous results zheng et al 2018a all these led to the higher et under soil mulching at the middle and later maize growth stages because the factors influencing canopy interception soil evaporation and plant transpiration interacted with each other accumulative et tended to be irregular throughout the whole growth season our results of et under different mulching patterns were similar to that of lin et al 2016 who also observed no significant differences in et among different mulching treatments 4 5 grain yield and water productivity changing the components of et is one of the effective approaches for improving crop yield in water limited areas particularly maximizing soil water use for plant transpiration is significant for enhancing wp blum 2009 rafi et al 2019 our results revealed that ic et increased from 12 98 to 15 66 under nm to 15 43 17 74 under rpsf while es et decreased from 27 60 34 46 to 11 32 15 09 and tp et enhanced from 52 36 58 73 to 65 59 73 24 these indicated that soil mulching slightly increased canopy interception loss but significantly declined the proportion of soil evaporation and improved plant transpiration contrasting mulching conditions changed the ways of maize root water uptake by converting more water from unproductive soil evaporation to plant transpiration which thus increased maize yield and wp many studies have found that straw and plastic film mulching can greatly enhance crop yields li et al 2013a b which was in a good agreement with our results table 3 in rainfed agriculture natural rainfall is usually inadequate to meet crop water requirements e g et and restricts the grain yield the growing season gross rainfall was very similar among the three growth seasons but their seasonal rainfall distributions differed significantly total rainfall in august of 2016 was only 15 7 mm which was 82 8 and 80 3 lower than those in 2015 and 2017 respectively fig 3 shortage of rainfall at the flowering stage august 2016 was detrimental to the reproductive development of summer maize wang et al 2011 which explained 60 3 and 65 0 lower average yield in 2016 compared with those in 2015 and 2017 respectively moreover average maize yield obtained in 2017 was 13 4 higher than that in 2015 in our study which was largely due to 11 greater rainfall in september 2017 than that in 2015 abundant soil water during this period could increase the grain filling rate grain weight and subsequently enhance maize production jia et al 2018 generally the distributions of seasonal rainfall in 2015 and 2017 were more uniform than that in 2016 severe drought occurred during the reproductive period of maize in 2016 better manifested the beneficial effect of ridge furrow planting for stabling grain yield under extreme climate many studies have shown that the effect of this cultivation pattern on crop yield was more obvious when rainfall further decreased the ridge furrow mulching system could promote infiltration by collecting rainwater from ridges and conserve more soil water in deep soil to sustain the root zone soil moisture availability to a certain degree when confronting severe drought zhou et al 2009 although flat planting with straw mulching has been found to be effective in reducing unproductive evaporation lin et al 2016 it has no promotive effect on rainwater infiltration and even intercepts rainwater to prevent it from infiltrating to the soil which might cause less available water storage for maize growth in august and thus the much lower increment under sm compared to rpbf and rpsf in 2016 these results indicated that the ridge furrow planting system was more favorable to maize transpiration and thus the ultimate maize yield and wp rpsf is more favorable than rpbf resulting from a further decrease in soil evaporation in the furrow while maintaining rainfall coupled runoff in the furrow hu et al 2019 also concluded that ridge furrow planting with film mulching on the ridge and wheat straw mulching in the furrow was an effective management practice to increase summer maize yield and wp in the sub humid but drought prone region of northwest china 5 conclusions canopy interception ic was an important part of water losses in rainfed agriculture ecosystem which accounted for 12 3 20 0 of gross rainfall over the three growing seasons of summer maize during 2015 2017 soil mulching decreased total es by 11 6 56 8 compared with nm over the three growing seasons however seasonal ic and tp increased from 32 0 46 4 mm and 126 7 168 3 mm under nm to 44 2 57 6 mm and 155 5 230 0 mm under rpsf respectively the ratios of ic es and tp to total et also differed under contrasting mulching conditions ic et increased from 12 98 15 66 under nm to 15 43 17 74 under rpsf while es et decreased from 27 60 34 46 to 11 32 15 09 and tp et increased from 52 36 58 73 to 65 59 73 24 soil mulching provided more soil water for maize growth by largely decreasing the proportion of soil evaporation even though the loss of canopy interception showed little increase relative to nm grain yield under the three mulching patterns increased by 9 5 30 8 in 2015 10 1 209 7 in 2016 and 26 1 49 4 in 2017 while wp increased by 1 5 20 8 in 2015 9 7 214 8 in 2016 and 15 8 36 6 in 2017 our results are useful for accurately determining et partitioning and improving the understanding of the mechanism of how contrasting soil mulching patterns make full use of limited rainwater to increase maize yield and water productivity in northwest china however the differences of maize species and site characteristics may also have important impacts on et partitioning which have not been explored in the present study further studies are thus needed on more maize cultivars across various rainfed regions in northwest china to verify the results and its application declaration of competing interest the authors reported no

10395,soil mulching can effectively modify crop growth environments and increase crop productivity in rainfed agriculture and the knowledge about water ﬂuxes within the soil crop atmosphere ecosystem is essential for improving water productivity wp in water limited regions such as northwest china this study systematically investigated seasonal and inter annual dynamics of evapotranspiration et partitioning into canopy interception ic soil evaporation es and plant transpiration tp in rainfed maize fields under four mulching conditions nm non mulching sm straw mulching rpbf plastic mulched ridge with bare furrow and rpsf plastic mulched ridge with straw mulched furrow from june to october in 2015 2016 and 2017 characterized by various seasonal rainfall distributions the results showed that seasonal et was slightly higher under mulching conditions compared with nm during each growing season but the difference was not statistically significant soil mulching decreased es et 22 0 29 8 14 3 19 5 and 11 3 15 1 under sm rpbf and rpsf respectively relative to nm 27 6 34 5 while it increased tp et 55 8 63 7 63 0 71 0 and 65 6 73 2 respectively and ic et 13 2 16 0 14 7 17 4 and 15 4 19 3 respectively relative to nm 52 4 58 7 and 13 0 15 7 respectively differences in et partitioning under contrasting mulching conditions were related largely to variations in leaf area index and soil water stress although seasonal et under various mulching conditions varied among the three seasons 264 8 286 6 mm in 2015 241 2 242 5 mm in 2016 and 296 6 324 4 mm in 2017 the proportions of ic 13 0 15 4 13 3 19 3 and 15 7 17 7 es 11 3 28 3 15 1 34 5 and 11 4 27 6 and tp 58 7 73 2 52 4 65 6 and 56 7 70 9 to total et were similar soil mulching greatly enhanced maize yield by 9 5 26 1 27 0 186 5 and 30 8 209 7 under sm rpbf and rpsf compared with nm respectively resulting in 1 5 15 8 19 0 184 7 and 20 8 214 8 higher wp respectively it was concluded that soil mulching largely promoted tp and restrained es in spite of slight increase in ic thereby improving maize yield and wp during the three seasons the present study gives a better understanding of rainwater cycle and crop water use which is critical to sustainable management of rainfed agriculture keywords rainfed maize canopy interception soil evaporation plant transpiration water productivity 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a dominant component of hydrological cycle in agricultural systems consisting of canopy interception ic evaporation from soil surface es and transpiration by plants tp ic is considered as the part of rainfall that is retained by crop canopy and finally returned to the atmosphere during and after rainfall fan et al 2014 which is generally obtained by subtracting throughfall and stemflow from gross rainfall although some previous studies have shown that ic can absorb available energy which will evaporate the water residing on leaf surfaces in the farmland or decrease the transpiration rate by increasing atmospheric water vapor content near the crop canopy and reducing the water pressure difference kraus 1966 stewart 1977 wang et al 2007 it can decrease the availability of total rainwater input that reaches the soil surface leading to great water losses in the agricultural ecosystem many studies on canopy rainfall interception have been conducted on crops especially on maize plants all of which clearly indicated that rainfall interception could not be ignored han et al 2014 zheng et al 2018a b therefore it is essential to consider canopy interception loss separately from total et es is another important part of the surface water balance but it does not enhance crop productivity micro lysimeters have been widely used for determining es from the bare soil in field experiments wang and liu 2007 zhang et al 2011 anapalli et al 2016 consoli et al 2017 liu et al 2018 gonzalez dugo et al 2019 and it is reported that about 20 30 of growing season et participates in this water loss process for annual crops allen 2011 tp refers to a substantial portion of et through which soil water returns to the air from plant stomata which is a contributing factor to crop yield heat balance based sap flow probes are useful tools to measure plant water use and many studies have suggested that they are suitable for estimating plant transpiration for small stems with low sap flow rates e g maize plants zhang et al 2016 fan et al 2018 partitioning et into ic es and tp is desirable to improve the understanding of soil water loss processes and then to increase crop production through maximizing transpiration and reducing evaporation yimam et al 2015 maize zea mays l is one of the major crops cultivated in summer in northwest china huang et al 2011 soil water supplied by rainfall is the main factor that limits the physiological development and reproduction of rainfed maize in this region it is therefore essential to conserve soil moisture and enhance crop water productivity wp by changing the balance of ic es and tp through appropriate agronomic practices field management practices have been extensively applied to maintain crop production especially plastic or straw mulching which can efficiently improve soil water and temperature regimes and crop growth conditions li et al 2013a b liu et al 2015 li et al 2017 mo et al 2018 jia et al 2018 ding et al 2018 2019a zheng et al 2020 however the effects of various mulching patterns on et remain inconsistent li et al 2018 reported that mulching techniques plastic film gravel sand and straw generally reduced total et during the growth seasons of summer maize compared with non mulching however li et al 2013a concluded that the ridge and furrow mulching reduced et at the early growth stage of spring maize but increased et at the middle growth stages and et showed no obvious pattern at the later growth stage among different treatments thus process based investigation on the effects of mulching especially water consumption mechanisms as a result of mulching is important for improving wp in rainfed farming systems soil mulching can modify the partitioning of et into ic es and tp by affecting soil moisture soil temperature and subsequently maize growth for instance zheng et al 2018a b measured throughfall stemflow gross rainfall and further estimated ic of summer maize using the water balance method they found that seasonal ic accounted for 7 4 21 4 of gross rainfall under various mulching patterns and planting densities li et al 2008 estimated maize et and es under plastic film mulched condition at the shiyanghe station in wuwei gansu province of northwest china by using eddy covariance and micro lysimeters they indicated that plastic mulching resulted in high kcb and low ke ranging from 0 to 1 2 and 0 to 0 3 over the whole season which was related to plant growth and soil moisture gong et al 2017 suggested that partial plastic mulching decreased average es et of rainfed maize by 11 2 compared with non mulching and the ratio of es et changed as a logistic function of green leaf area index wang et al 2019b quantified the influence of plastic mulch on et partitioning using an improved multisource energy balance model at daman superstation located in gansu province of china they found that mulching increased transpiration fraction and the effects of mulching on et partitioning varied with leaf development feng et al 2019 monitored et on different time scales in non mulched ck and plastic mulched pm seed maize field in eastern loess plateau of china they found that plastic mulching altered et components decreasing es et from 39 9 42 8 under ck to 23 8 34 9 under pm it also increased tp by 9 8 33 3 at the leaf scale and increased plant sap flow by 1 4 34 5 compared with ck under contrasting climatic conditions although previous studies have tried to quantify soil mulching effects on et partitioning in rainfed maize fields most of them mainly concentrated the flux separation under a specific mulching pattern and few studies have investigated et partitioning under various mulching conditions particularly during maize growing seasons characterized by various temporal rainfall distributions what s more importantly issues related to et partitioning into rainfall intercepted by canopies vapour fluxes of plant transpiration and soil evaporation have been extensively studied for forested ecosystems raz yaseef et al 2012 fan et al 2015 benyon and doody 2015 wang and wang 2017 but studies on maize et partitioning have overlooked the effect of ic which reflects the influence of plants on the hydrological cycle in water limited environments to our knowledge little attention has been paid to systematically determine the contributions of the three components ic es and tp to total et in rainfed maize fields over the whole growing season under various mulching conditions therefore the objectives of the present three year study were to 1 examine the seasonal and inter annual variations of the three components of et ic es and tp under various mulching patterns during the maize growing seasons of 2015 2016 and 2017 2 identify the main environmental and meteorological conditions influencing et partitioning in this region and 3 compare the influence of various mulching patterns on the contributions of ic es and tp to total et 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and design the field experiments were performed during the maize growing seasons of 2015 2017 at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and

calculated as the difference between gr tr and s as follows 2 i c g r t r s in addition relative canopy interception was defined as the ratio of ic to gross rainfall 2 2 4 soil evaporation and sap flow rate soil evaporation es was observed by micro lysimeters made from pvc pipes with a height of 20 cm and a diameter of 10 5 cm boast and robertson 1982 two ml cylinders were installed at each plot for flat cultivation one was installed in the planting row and the other in between two neighboring rows for cultivation with ridge and furrow one was located on the ridge and the other in the furrow the micro lysimeters were changed and refilled with undisturbed soil samples every seven days or within one day following heavy rainfall 5 mm day 1 liu et al 2012 balwinder singh et al 2016 wang and wang 2017 daily es was calculated as the difference in micro lysimeter weight between the beginning and ending points of the day 18 00 pm soil evaporation could not be measured on rainy days due to the influence of rainfall over the micro lysimeters so we assumed that soil evaporation was zero on rainy days in this study similar to wang and wang 2017 the heat balance based dynagage flow32

each plot after july 1 the sensors were insulated with silica gel and aluminum foil for minimizing energy exchange and preventing from rainfall the sensors were moved to various maize plants every 10 15 days to minimize maize damage from high temperatures of sap flow sensors the sensors output was measured at 60 s intervals and recorded every 30 min as the average value the measured sap flow rate was corrected using the calibration equation of wang et al 2017 the hourly sap flow rate for each maize plant under various mulching patterns was then calculated as the average sap flow rate for the three sample plants qh g h 1 plant 1 the daily plant water use was the sum of qh in a day qd l day 1 plant 1 maize plant water use qd l day 1 plant 1 was then upscaled to tp mm d 1 using the following equation 3 t p q d a where a is the average ground area occupied by a maize plant m2 2 2 5 soil water content fine roots of summer maize are mainly concentrated within the 0 60 cm soil profile liu et al 2017 soil water content was thus measured using calibrated ech2o 5te sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa usa at 10 20 30 and 50 cm depths data were recorded at 15 min intervals by data loggers and daily average swc was calculated by averaging 15 min values two sets of sensors were installed under nm and sm one in the maize row and the other in between two neighboring rows three sets of sensors were used under rpbf and rpsf which were installed in between two furrows in between two ridges and at the boundary of two neighboring ridge and furrow respectively averaged daily soil moisture in the top 50 cm soil layer was calculated by averaging observed swc at different soil depths and locations for further data analyses gravimetric soil water content was also measured in the 0

dynamics of daily climatic parameters during the growing seasons of summer maize from 2015 to 2017 are presented in fig 2 average daily rs during the three seasons were 203 24 209 62 and 217 44 w m 2 respectively average ta and vpd were slightly higher in 2016 25 6 0 94 k pa than those in 2015 24 2 1 07 k pa and 2017 24 8 1 05 k pa however average rh was slightly higher in 2015 71 1 and 2017 70 8 than that in 2016 69 3 wind speed u2 ranged 0 3 2 5 0 5 4 1 and 0 5 3 1 m s 1 during the three seasons respectively total et0 were 413 0 483 1 and 472 3 mm during the three seasons respectively fig 3 presents the trends in rainfall and averaged volumetric soil water content swc 0 50 cm during the three seasons gross rainfall was 269 9 261 1 and 287 4 mm during the growing seasons of 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively although similar total rainfall amount was observed the seasonal temporal rainfall distribution differed greatly in 2015 rainfall distributed at the four growth stages accounted for 31 4 15 6 23 0 and 30 0 respectively however only 4 4 of total rainfall was spread from tasseling to grain filling stage in 2016 and 7 1 from seedling to jointing stage in 2017 swc under all treatments showed similar trends but swc with soil mulching was generally higher than that of non mulching seasonal average swc under nm sm rpbf and rpsf was 23 1 23 7 23 4 and 23 2 in 2015 20 4 21 2 21 9 and 22 0 in 2016 and 22 1 22 9 23 3 and 23 4 in 2017 long intervals between rainfall events in august 2016 allowed swc to dramatically decline fig 3 as maize grew leaf area index lai increased rapidly after 40 das and obtained the maximum value 60 70 das with maximal lai of 3 56 nm 4 14 sm 4 42 rpbf and 5 09 rpsf m2 m 2 in 2015 5 33 nm 5 58 sm 6 00 rpbf and 6 24 rpsf m2 m 2 in 2016 and 3 46 nm 4 11 sm 4 60 rpbf and 5 00 rpsf m2 m 2 in 2017 fig 4 lai declined after 70 das during the three seasons and the decrease in lai at the late growth stage of 2016 was larger than those in 2015 and 2017 fig 3 3 2 canopy interception and its influencing factors number of rainfall events rainfall depth and canopy interception ic under various mulching patterns at each maize growth stage in 2015 2016 and 2017 are shown in table 1 total growing season canopy interception was 34 37 37 66 41 48 and 44 24 mm 32 01 34 96 42 28 and 45 82 mm and 46 44 51 75 54 58 and 57 56 mm under nm sm rpbf and rpsf in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively it was always in the order of nm sm rpbf rpsf during the three growing seasons although there was no significant difference among various mulching patterns in 2015 and 2017 canopy interception at various growth stages was similar to the variation of growing season canopy interception which was always lower under nm and higher under rpsf generally ic increased with increasing gross rainfall gr amount under all mulching patterns during 2015 2017 fig 4 at the seedling to jointing stage ic showed weaker relationships with gr than those at the other stages which was mainly resulted from the much smaller lai at this growth stage ic was higher under soil mulching when gr was the same the relative canopy interception generally decreased with increasing rainfall amount and tended to be constant for larger rainfall events these power regression lines also showed that ic was in the order of nm sm rpbf rpfs which was mainly due to the differences in lai among the four mulching conditions the relationship between canopy interception amount and lai was not obvious among the four mulching patterns at different rainfall classes during 2015 2017 fig 5 however obvious positive power correlations were found between the relative canopy interception and lai r2 0 66 for all rainfall events these fitted equations were similar under nm sm rpbf and rpsf confirming that soil mulching enhanced canopy interception by directly increasing lai 3 3 soil evaporation dynamics the dynamics of soil evaporation during the growing seasons of 2015 2017 are shown in fig 6 daily soil evaporation varied over the experimental periods which showed a relatively high daily evaporation rate of 0 68 mm d 1 from seedling to tasseling and dropped at the end of the tasseling stage to 0 36 mm d 1 from tasseling to maturity soil mulching can significantly restrain the soil evaporation daily soil evaporation was always higher under nm and lower under rpsf during the three growing seasons maximum daily soil evaporation was 2 47 2 32 and 2 12 mm d 1 under nm 2 09 1 90 and 1 95 mm d 1 under sm 1 41 1 39 and 1 22 mm d 1 under rpbf and 1 28 1 16 and 1 02 mm d 1 under rpsf in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively daily mean soil evaporation under nm sm rpbf and rpsf was 0 71 0 62 0 38 and 0 31 mm d 1 in 2015 0 76 0 66 0 43 and 0 33 mm d 1 in 2016 0 73 0 63 0 42 and 0 33 mm d 1 in 2017 respectively the seasonal total soil evaporation under nm sm rpbf and rpsf was 74 9 66 2 40 4 and 32 5 mm in 2015 82 9 72 0 47 4 and 35 8 mm in 2016 and 81 9 71 0 47 5 and 36 8 mm in 2017 respectively 3 4 plant transpiration dynamics fig 7 presents the diurnal variation of sap flow rate during the representative sunny cloudy and rainy days under the four mulching patterns in 2017 sap flow rate had an obvious day night rhythm synchronous with solar radiation on sunny days august 5 and august 9 12 maize sap flow rate enhanced to mid day and then declined with the mean sap flow rates of 29 5 35 0 37 4 and 40 5 g h 1 under nm sm rpbf and rpsf respectively however it slightly decreased around 14 00 and then recovered which was extremely obvious on august 9 10 there were 2 4 31 7 and 0 1 mm rainfalls from august 6 8 respectively causing lower sap flow on these days nevertheless fluxes obviously increased after rain cessation compared to fluxes on august 5 sunny day and reached higher values on august 9 then decreased with the soil drying on rainy and cloudy days august 6 7 and august 18 22 rs had a wide range of fluctuations and sap flow rate also showed fluctuating increase decrease trends with average sap flow rates of 8 1 10 1 11 0 and 11 6 g h 1 under nm sm rpbf and rpsf respectively daily plant transpiration varied over the experimental periods which increased rapidly from seedling with average value of 1 52 mm d 1 kept at higher values 2 65 mm d 1 at the middle stage and decreased gradually at the later stage 0 88 mm d 1 during the three seasons having similar variations with et fig 1 fig 8 the maximum daily transpiration of summer maize appeared on 22 august in 2015 29 july in 2016 and 9 august in 2017 with values of 4 38 5 26 and 6 62 mm d 1 under nm 5 11 5 69 and 6 83 mm d 1 under sm 5 34 5 95 and 8 38 mm d 1 under rpbf and 5 39 6 01 8 62 mm d 1 under rpsf in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively the cumulative water consumption through plant transpiration was significantly enhanced by soil mulching total plant transpiration under nm sm rpbf and rpsf treatment were 155 50 181 86 200 58 and 209 95 mm in 2015 126 68 134 94 152 91 and 155 53 mm in 2016 and 168 30 200 43 220 96 and 230 04 mm in 2017 respectively it should be noted that the difference in daily plant transpiration among the four mulching modes was larger at the middle stage than that at the earlier and later stages 3 5 controlling factors of es and tp fig 9 presents relationships between daily es tp against et0 under various mulching patterns during 2015 2017 there were positive correlations between es tp and et0 during the three seasons p 0 001 et0 was directly affected by meteorological variables therefore rs ta vpd rh u2 lai and swc were selected to analyze the controlling factors of soil evaporation es and plant transpiration tp using the path analysis method with regard to the correlation between each factor to es the highest correlation was observed for rs 0 499 followed by rh 0 400 vpd 0 398 lai 0 398 ta 0 337 u2 0 301 and swc 0 170 where the coefficients of determination were 0 213 0 090 0 239 0 152 0 117 0 039 and 0 013 respectively the effects of all these factors on es were extremely significant pij 0 001 table 2 the direct coefficients between rs ta vpd rh u2 lai as well as swc and es were 0 426 0 347 0 601 0 224 0 131 0 381 and 0 074 respectively vpd had very high positive indirect effect through rs ta and rh 0 999 and swc had high positive indirect effect through lai 0 244 as for tp higher correlations were observed for rs ta vpd and rh 0 659 0 536 0 517 and 0 498 respectively and lower correlations for u2 lai and swc 0 085 0 119 and 0 032 respectively with no significant influence of swc p 0 143 the coefficients of determination for tp based on rs ta vpd rh u2 lai and swc were 0 385 0 132 0 044 0 041 0 002 0 049 and 0 008 respectively the direct coefficients were 0 584 0 246 0 086 0 083 0 025 0 408 and 0 235 respectively the direct coefficient of vpd rh and u2 were not significant p 0 05 but the indirect effects of vpd and rh on tp through rs were high 0 447 and 0 447 respectively under various mulching conditions lai and swc were responsible for the difference of es and tp because of the same climatic conditions during the experimental periods in which the influence of lai was higher than swc and the influence of swc was more complex bi 0 074 pi 0 05 rij 0 170 pij 0 001 for es bi 0 235 pi 0 001 rij 0 032 pij 0 05 for tp 3 6 variations in proportions of ic es and tp to total et the ratios of ic es and tp to total et differed among the four mulching patterns during the maize growing seasons of 2015 2017 table 3 fig 10 the variation of tp et displayed a strong seasonal pattern it increased continuously at the early growth stage and became relatively constant from jointing to grain filling and then experienced a decrease after grain filling at most growth stages the contribution of tp to total et was significantly enhanced by soil mulching es et showed an opposite trend to tp et in 2015 and 2017 which decreased from late june to august stabilized at low level and increased slightly at the late growth stage the value of es et was nearly zero at the tg ii stage in 2017 due to continuous rainfall from august 25th to september 5th in addition es et from jointing to grain filling in 2016 was different from those during the other two seasons at the same growth stage maintaining relatively high level the variation of ic et had no obvious consistent pattern and the contribution of ic to et showed almost no significant difference among various mulching conditions throughout the three seasons during the whole growing season es was always in the order of rpsf rpbf sm nm ranging from 11 3 to 34 4 under various mulching patterns during 2015 2017 table 3 ic was the smallest component ranging from 13 0 to 19 3 during the three seasons tp represented the greatest proportion of et ranging from 52 4 to 73 2 the ratios of ic and tp to et were largest under rpsf followed by rpbf sm and nm 3 7 grain yield and water productivity among the three growing seasons grain yield and et were 1366 9 9073 9 kg ha 1 and 237 13 324 44 mm in various mulching treatments respectively table 3 there were significant differences in gy among mulching treatments but et was not signiﬁcantly affected compared with nm soil mulching increased grain yield by 138 5 2999 0 kg ha 1 and et by 4 0 27 8 mm water productivity wp under nm sm rpbf and rpsf were 22 42 22 75 26 69 and 27 08 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2015 5 67 6 22 16 14 and 17 85 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2016 and 20 48 23 71 26 76 and 27 97 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2017 respectively it can be found that etisp were higher than etwb by 23 29 37 27 mm in 2015 by 20 75 32 87 mm in 2016 and by 38 02 43 18 mm in 2017 with relative error of 9 3 15 3 in 2015 9 4 16 1 in 2016 and 13 3 15 9 in 2017 this indicated that et values obtained from throughfall stemflow micro lysimeter and sap flow measurements were comparable to those from the water balance method 4 discussion 4 1 canopy interception growing season ic was in the order of nm sm rpbf rpsf due to the good growth conditions when applying soil mulching gross rainfall firstly arrives leaf surfaces and part of rainfall is intercepted and returns back to the air through evaporation therefore leaf area is a significant factor affecting canopy interception a positive relationship between canopy interception and maize lai was found in this study which agrees well with the finding of zheng et al 2012 compared with nm there was more water available under straw and plastic film mulching fig 3 which promoted maize growth and development in rainfed regions and resulted in greater lai and subsequently canopy interception when lai was large the increasing rate of relative canopy interception slowed down since the leaf overlapping slowed increasing canopy coverage maize canopy interception accounted for 12 3 20 0 of gross rainfall during 2015 2017 in this study which was higher than those reported previously 7 5 13 3 lin et al 2011 han et al 2014 zheng et al 2012 this can be attributed to the much higher lai in our study as a result of higher planting density compared with previous studies laimax 2 2 3 2 m2 m 2 canopy interception also depends on meteorological factors especially rainfall characteristics our results showed that ic increased slowly and gradually stabilized as gr continued to increase suggesting that maize canopy was gradually saturated with regard to the fitting relation between ic and gr power function seemed to the most reasonable which agrees with the findings of yan et al 2005 and li et al 2009 the percentage of canopy interception first decreased sharply and then began to be stable with increasing gr implying that larger canopy interception would occur during small rainfall events zhang et al 2015 this also indicated that canopy attained its maximum evaporation loss during rainfall with increasing gr and after saturation of canopy zhang et al 2015 also revealed that the percentage of ic decreased with the increase if rainfall intensity in the semi humid but drought prone region rainfall intensity was generally smaller than that under artificially rainfall conditions han et al 2014 leading to great rainfall interception and evaporation in our study 4 2 soil evaporation growing season soil evaporation decreased with varying degrees when covered with wheat straw or plastic film on the soil surface in the present study the path analysis showed that es was significantly affected by all the investigated factors in spite of low correlation in swc table 2 the climatic conditions were the same in the four mulching treatments so lai and swc were mainly responsible for the difference in soil evaporation our results showed that positive relationship existed between daily es and swc rij 0 170 pij 0 001 during the three growing seasons of summer maize however bi based on swc was 0 074 with pi of 0 026 0 005 further reflecting the complex mechanism of swc on es for instance although soil mulching improved soil water condition lower soil evaporation was observed with mulching li et al 2013b indicated that straw mulching as a barrier reduced the rate of water flux changed from liquid to vapor forms from the soil and prevented the diffusion of water vapor through the straw segments also straw mulching has lower thermal conductivity which will reduce the quantity of direct solar radiation arriving at the land surface and the magnitudes of the increase in soil temperatures horton et al 1996 therefore water in the soil profile is difficult to convert into vapor due to the reduced amount of energy available all these will consequently reduce the rate of water loss through straw mulching compared with the bare soil plastic film another barrier material can prevent es by blocking the way of water vapor migration to the atmosphere crop canopy plays a significant role in reducing es todd et al 1991 which was in a good agreement with negative relationship between es and lai found in our study rij 0 398 pij 0 001 bi 0 381 pi 0 001 raz yaseef et al 2010 indicated that es of yatir ecosystem decreased from 150 to 86 mm y 1 from undeveloped canopy cover of 10 to full canopy closure li et al 2013b found that merely 20 mm water was lost through soil evaporation in plastic mulched maize fields due to large canopy shading larger shaded under canopy fraction resulted from higher lai can also provide another explanation for the decreased es with soil mulching in our observations declining trend in daily soil evaporation from early to middle stage was also observed which was primarily due to the variation of lai however unlike other studies conducted in maize fields li et al 2008 alberto et al 2014 the senescence of green leaf did not cause the increase in es during the late season this may be attributed to the decrease in solar radiation ta vpd and et0 as well as the increase in rh due to the importance of soil evaporation in water loss many studies have been done to estimate soil evaporation kang et al 2003 reported that seasonal es accounted for 26 of et of summer maize in three lysimeters in a semi humid and drought prone region ding et al 2013b revealed that es of non mulched maize in northwest china occupied 31 of et while it only accounted for 14 4 of et when plastic film mulching was applied our experiments found that es averaged over the three growing seasons accounted for 30 11 24 97 16 17 and 12 59 of the total et of summer maize under nm sm rpbf and rpsf respectively which was generally consistent with previous results 4 3 plant transpiration tp was the major portion of growing season et the relationship between daily plant transpiration and et0 was linear since et0 is a comprehensive meteorological index which agrees with the findings of liu et al 2012 and jiang et al 2016 path analysis showed that rs was the main meteorological factor controlling tp with bi of 0 584 rij of 0 659 and ri 2 of 0 385 tp enhanced as rs increased typical diurnal increase decrease variations of plant transpiration were in accordance to the variation of rs but lagged around 1 h behind the radiation due to adaption to rs changes zhang et al 2016 the second factor was ta with bi of 0 347 rij of 0 536 and ri 2 of 0 132 zhang et al 2016 and feng et al 2017 also pointed out that air temperature had an important influence on plant transpiration when vpd surpassed a threshold physiological and transpiration activities of maize were restricted oren et al 2001 zhou et al 2004 which resulted in complex responses of tp to vpd with positive rij and rijbj of 0 517 and 0 603 but negative bi of 0 086 in our results table 2 among the meteorological variables the influence of u2 was minimal the weak relationship between tp and u2 in our study may result from concentrated wind distribution in the experimental region in table 2 rij of swc was 0 032 but the influence was not significant pij 0 05 however the positive direct action of swc was extremely significant bi 0 235 ri 0 001 in all maize plants appeared to reduce stomata opening in leaves and then plant transpiration when swc dropped below a critical threshold guyot et al 2017 above this threshold there was no water stress and plant transpiration mainly depended on atmospheric evaporation demand fu et al 2016 since tp is lost primarily through plant stomata the transpiration rate is closely linked to leaf area taiz and zeigher 2006 the direct coefficient of lai was 0 408 and the positive relationship between tp and lai has also been demonstrated in previous studies liu et al 2012 jiang et al 2016 enhanced swc and lai under straw or plastic film mulching were primarily responsible for the higher plant transpiration when the meteorological conditions were the same as that of non mulching treatment at the tg i stage in 2016 tp declined dramatically although measured green lai at this stage was still high this can be largely because much less rainfall and higher temperature led to much drier soil conditions making it difficult for maize roots to absorb soil water and stimulating the production of abscisic acid aba in the root increased aba can restrict stomatal aperture which restrains tp of crops zhang et al 1987 at the tg ii and subsequent growth stages continuous drought caused leaf drying and yellowing leading to fast decline in lai and low level of daily plant transpiration alberto et al 2014 reported that seasonal tp accounted for 66 74 of maize et under overhead sprinkler irrigation kang et al 2003 found that 74 0 of water was lost by maize transpiration throughout the whole growing season in general our observation of seasonal plant transpiration 52 4 73 2 was slightly lower or similar to previously published values because maximum maize lai 3 5 6 2 m2 m 2 in our results was lower than or similar to those reported 5 0 or 7 5 m2 m 2 4 4 evapotranspiration daily et was controlled by climatic conditions such as solar radiation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity wang and wang 2017 climatic conditions also affect the partitioning of et and rainfall was one of the most direct factors influencing sunshine duration and vapor pressure deficit at each maize growth stage i e sj i sj ii jt i jt ii tg i tg ii gm i and gm ii in fig 10 higher values of ic et occurred where greater gross rainfall occurred which was opposite to the variations of es et that is to say ic accounted for relative larger portion of et under high rainfall amounts but relative lower es et would be obtained due to the missing soil evaporation data resulted from the fact that evaporation was theoretically negligible during great rainfall events 5 mm day 1 the partitioning was more influenced by plant growth process especially plant transpiration the seasonal variations of es and tp to total et during the three maize growing seasons were basically in accordance with previous studies li et al 2008 alberto et al 2014 it should be acknowledged that there were uncertainties and errors in et due to the point and touch measurements in this study for example micro lysimeters are unable to measure soil evaporation during rainy days and have constraints in temporal resolution as a result of manual weighing kool et al 2014 heat balance sap flow sensors are subject to errors due to temperature heterogeneity across the plant stem and limited representation of field conditions because of small number of samples wang et al 2017 the collections of throughfall and stemflow may be affected by meteorological factors such as wind speed leading to biases in canopy interception zheng et al 2018b however small relative errors of 9 3 16 1 over the three growing seasons between etwb and etisp confirmed the satisfactory performances of canopy interception micro lysimeter and sap flow measurements to partition et in our research in addition many previous studies also showed that the measurement methods applied in our study can offer convincible evaluation of the three components lamm and manges 2000 wang et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 growing season et of summer maize in our study 237 1 324 4 mm were close to or smaller than those reported by yang et al 2015 in hunag huai hai plain 239 4 552 3 mm and by yan et al 2017 in guanzhong plain 299 3 383 0 mm different evaporative demand in different years and at different sites may cause these differences apart from this these can be also attributed to the lower rainfall input and lack of irrigation in our study compared to these studies the difference in total et among the three seasons was mainly resulted from the maize growth and climatic conditions particularly the difference in temporal rainfall distribution tanaka et al 2008 lei and yang 2010 total seasonal et exhibited no detectable trend under various mulching patterns the partitioning of canopy interception soil evaporation and plant transpiration particularly influenced the ultimate et when maize plants were small more soil surface exposed into air resulting in the increase of soil evaporation under non mulching as maize grew plant transpiration became the dominant component of et also higher canopy interception with higher leaf area index was observed based on our previous results zheng et al 2018a all these led to the higher et under soil mulching at the middle and later maize growth stages because the factors influencing canopy interception soil evaporation and plant transpiration interacted with each other accumulative et tended to be irregular throughout the whole growth season our results of et under different mulching patterns were similar to that of lin et al 2016 who also observed no significant differences in et among different mulching treatments 4 5 grain yield and water productivity changing the components of et is one of the effective approaches for improving crop yield in water limited areas particularly maximizing soil water use for plant transpiration is significant for enhancing wp blum 2009 rafi et al 2019 our results revealed that ic et increased from 12 98 to 15 66 under nm to 15 43 17 74 under rpsf while es et decreased from 27 60 34 46 to 11 32 15 09 and tp et enhanced from 52 36 58 73 to 65 59 73 24 these indicated that soil mulching slightly increased canopy interception loss but significantly declined the proportion of soil evaporation and improved plant transpiration contrasting mulching conditions changed the ways of maize root water uptake by converting more water from unproductive soil evaporation to plant transpiration which thus increased maize yield and wp many studies have found that straw and plastic film mulching can greatly enhance crop yields li et al 2013a b which was in a good agreement with our results table 3 in rainfed agriculture natural rainfall is usually inadequate to meet crop water requirements e g et and restricts the grain yield the growing season gross rainfall was very similar among the three growth seasons but their seasonal rainfall distributions differed significantly total rainfall in august of 2016 was only 15 7 mm which was 82 8 and 80 3 lower than those in 2015 and 2017 respectively fig 3 shortage of rainfall at the flowering stage august 2016 was detrimental to the reproductive development of summer maize wang et al 2011 which explained 60 3 and 65 0 lower average yield in 2016 compared with those in 2015 and 2017 respectively moreover average maize yield obtained in 2017 was 13 4 higher than that in 2015 in our study which was largely due to 11 greater rainfall in september 2017 than that in 2015 abundant soil water during this period could increase the grain filling rate grain weight and subsequently enhance maize production jia et al 2018 generally the distributions of seasonal rainfall in 2015 and 2017 were more uniform than that in 2016 severe drought occurred during the reproductive period of maize in 2016 better manifested the beneficial effect of ridge furrow planting for stabling grain yield under extreme climate many studies have shown that the effect of this cultivation pattern on crop yield was more obvious when rainfall further decreased the ridge furrow mulching system could promote infiltration by collecting rainwater from ridges and conserve more soil water in deep soil to sustain the root zone soil moisture availability to a certain degree when confronting severe drought zhou et al 2009 although flat planting with straw mulching has been found to be effective in reducing unproductive evaporation lin et al 2016 it has no promotive effect on rainwater infiltration and even intercepts rainwater to prevent it from infiltrating to the soil which might cause less available water storage for maize growth in august and thus the much lower increment under sm compared to rpbf and rpsf in 2016 these results indicated that the ridge furrow planting system was more favorable to maize transpiration and thus the ultimate maize yield and wp rpsf is more favorable than rpbf resulting from a further decrease in soil evaporation in the furrow while maintaining rainfall coupled runoff in the furrow hu et al 2019 also concluded that ridge furrow planting with film mulching on the ridge and wheat straw mulching in the furrow was an effective management practice to increase summer maize yield and wp in the sub humid but drought prone region of northwest china 5 conclusions canopy interception ic was an important part of water losses in rainfed agriculture ecosystem which accounted for 12 3 20 0 of gross rainfall over the three growing seasons of summer maize during 2015 2017 soil mulching decreased total es by 11 6 56 8 compared with nm over the three growing seasons however seasonal ic and tp increased from 32 0 46 4 mm and 126 7 168 3 mm under nm to 44 2 57 6 mm and 155 5 230 0 mm under rpsf respectively the ratios of ic es and tp to total et also differed under contrasting mulching conditions ic et increased from 12 98 15 66 under nm to 15 43 17 74 under rpsf while es et decreased from 27 60 34 46 to 11 32 15 09 and tp et increased from 52 36 58 73 to 65 59 73 24 soil mulching provided more soil water for maize growth by largely decreasing the proportion of soil evaporation even though the loss of canopy interception showed little increase relative to nm grain yield under the three mulching patterns increased by 9 5 30 8 in 2015 10 1 209 7 in 2016 and 26 1 49 4 in 2017 while wp increased by 1 5 20 8 in 2015 9 7 214 8 in 2016 and 15 8 36 6 in 2017 our results are useful for accurately determining et partitioning and improving the understanding of the mechanism of how contrasting soil mulching patterns make full use of limited rainwater to increase maize yield and water productivity in northwest china however the differences of maize species and site characteristics may also have important impacts on et partitioning which have not been explored in the present study further studies are thus needed on more maize cultivars across various rainfed regions in northwest china to verify the results and its application declaration of competing interest the authors reported no

10396,soil moisture sensors are subject to uncertainty inaccuracy in measuring soil water status that hinders various applications user groups researchers and growers advisers rely on these sensors for estimating critical agricultural water management decisions and information such as total soil water in the crop root zone tsw crop evapotranspiration etc and predicting irrigation triggers it i e when tsw is equal to or lower than readily available water there is a lack of translation of errors in sensor reported soil moisture θv into tsw etc and it which is critical to farm level decision making as well as research assessments nine soil moisture sensors based on principles of time domain reflectometry capacitance and electrical resistance were investigated in field conditions for silt loam and loamy sand soils under two installation orientations vertical and horizontal during two growing seasons 2017 and 2018 accurate representation of tsw etc and it was found to be a function of sensor type soil type as well as calibration type factory calibration f c vs site specific calibration s s c sensor installation orientation did not affect sensor accuracy uncertainties in estimation of tsw etc and it were quantified under each condition of use and sensors were comparatively ranked for effective selection it was found that all sensors underestimated etc in silt loam soil the deviation of sensor measured etc from true etc ranged from 14 to 31 which implies that the choice of sensor under a given soil type impacts the quantification of consumptive use of the soil vegetation system being monitored sensors showed both overstimation and underestimation of etc in loamy sand soil with deviations of sensor estimated etc from true etc ranging from 14 to 61 the s s c resulted in 45 and 17 improvement in tsw and etc in silt loam soil respectively and 42 80 and 86 improvement observed in tsw it and etc in loamy sand soil respectively the research findings showed that suitability of soil moisture sensors can differ when different target metrics are used as criteria these findings emphasize the need for evaluating soil moisture sensors based on practical and application oriented criteria in addition to reliance on θv accuracy to the best of authors knowledge this research is the first to translate traditional θv accuracy assessments into practical and application oriented criteria and use them to evaluate sensors for these specific applications sensor rankings and uncertainty associated with their use presented here will allow diverse users to effectively identify sensors for targeted applications in water management decision making and research keywords soil moisture sensors irrigation time domain reflectometry capacitance electrical resistance evapotranspiration 1 introduction numerous sensing methods exist for estimation of soil moisture and since they function based on diverse principles they are subject to errors and uncertainties these methods extend from manual gravimetric sampling to technology based tools including neutron scattering time domain reflectometry tdr capacitance based sensing and electric resistance based sensing er extensive research has been conducted to evaluate their accuracy across global conditions of use spanning dozens of commercial sensors and all soil textural classes evett et al 2002 leib et al 2003 baumhardt et al 2000 varble and chávez 2011 jabro et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 chow et al 2009 primarily the objectives of these research studies were to investigate the accuracy of sensor s to represent soil moisture expressed by volumetric water content or θv as well as develop appropriate correction strategies to improve θv estimation as a result useful mathematical empirical functions have been developed and proposed under various conditions of sensor use e g soil texture salinity structure etc to aid in accurate estimation of θv the research conducted in this direction evett and steiner 1995 irmak and haman 2001 heng et al 2002 quinones et al 2003 irmak and irmak 2005 jabro et al 2005 brocca et al 2007 irmak et al 2010 mittelbach et al 2012 su et al 2014 datta et al 2018 irmak 2019a zhu et al 2019 emphasizes the importance of accurate θv estimation to address the suitability of a sensor for a given application ideally a sensor is regarded acceptable if it produces accurate θv information either under factory calibration f c or a combination of the f c sensor output and a site specific calibration s s c it is crucial to reconsider and reevaluate this notion of using θv as the target metric when evaluating soil moisture sensing technology because of its limited direct use in farm level decision making or scientific research other metrics hold greater relevance for real world applications like commercial operations such as irrigation decisions and scientific research such as soil water storage and crop evapotranspiration for instance investment on a soil moisture sensor in a commercial operation non research settings is expected to add significant value to irrigation decisions rather than merely reporting an accurate θv similarly its use by a researcher in a multi plot experiment is expected to aid in acceptable estimation of total soil water tsw in the plant root zone profile and crop evapotranspiration etc so as to discern the impacts of any imposed treatments on soil water balance a sensor that does not report an accurate θv might still be valuable to make an effective irrigation decision or convey etc this is due to the fact that soil water balance calculations rely on change in the θv value or its trends rather than the absolute value itself thus it is practically logical that emphasis is laid on accurate representation of these decision making or end user targeted variables tsw etc and irrigation management in addition to θv therefore it would be ideal if the errors and uncertainties associated with these sensors are reported in terms of these variables rather than only θv so that sensor evaluation and selection can be based on metrics that will actually be used in real world applications for instance evett et al 2012 stated that errors of the magnitude 0 05 m3 m 3 in θv translated into errors of up to 50 mm day 1 in soil water flux change in soil water storage over time estimation making them unsuitable for use in water balance et and water use efficiency wue it is critical that the methodologies used to estimate these end user targeted variables are held constant so that the performance is a function of only θv obtained from the sensors investigated and not any differences in assumptions or methods adopted to the best of our knowledge extremely limited body of research has evaluated and compared several soil moisture sensors for success in representing some measure of these practical metrics to both commercial and research audiences mittelbach et al 2012 evaluated four soil moisture sensors in clay loam soil in switzerland using sensor estimated change in soil moisture storage in comparison with lysimeter measured etc walker et al 2004 used three soil moisture sensors in loam soil in australia to quantify change in soil moisture storage and compare it against a bucket water balance model paige and keefer 2008 compared three tdr and capacitance based sensors in a sandy gravelly loam site in arizona by assessing change in soil moisture storage against the same computed using a soil water balance model where etc was measured using a bowen ratio system and runoff was measured using an h flume by using different approaches these studies addressed the success or failure of soil moisture sensors to accurately represent the soil water balance in research oriented and commercial production oriented use soil moisture sensors are often expected to reflect seasonal dynamics of tsw and seasonal total etc and their ability to call irrigation triggers it irmak 2015a b djaman and irmak 2012 irmak et al 2014 kukal and irmak 2019 and any sensor technology has not been evaluated for these important applications this research aims to address these knowledge gaps in the literature by evaluating soil moisture sensors in silt loam and loamy sand soils for two complete growing seasons nine commercial sensors

determine tsw etc and it in row crop and pasture grass agricultural systems ii assess any improvement of tsw etc and it estimates when site specific calibrations s s c were used relative to factory calibrations f c and iv rank all the sensors for their success in estimating tsw etc and it for both the soil types so as to facilitate sensor selection aimed at these applications it is emphasized that in order to estimate tsw etc and it the process of conversion from θv was the same across sensors and thus the uncertainties observed in these variables are translated from uncertainties in θv only also the information presented in this manuscript should only be deemed true for silt loam and loamy sand soils as the experiments were limited to these soil textures only 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of soils vegetative characteristics and management at the experimental sites the field experiments were conducted during 2017 and 2018 growing seasons at two sites fig 1 which were selected so that the two ecosystems and agriculturally predominant soil types are represented in this research site 1 and site 2 are referred to as by their soil types i e silt loam and loamy sand respectively hereon the growing seasons for maize and soybean as well as the active photosynthetic period in the pasture grass was monitored as these periods coincide with the predominant conditions of use soil temperatures and wetting patterns primarily of soil moisture sensors the sensors were installed in 2017 growing season and remained in the soil until the end of experiment to minimize any effects arising from insufficient contact and disturbance due to repeated installation and removal silt loam site 1 the first experimental site site 1 was at the university of nebraska lincoln south central agricultural laboratory scal 40 43 n and 98 8 w at an elevation of 552 m above mean sea level near clay center nebraska the long term average annual precipitation in this area is 730 mm and the long term average growing season may 1st september 30th precipitation is 437 mm although both variables vary substantially and inter annually a wide range of soil temperatures measured with the cs655 sensor at 60 cm depth were encountered throughout 2017 and 2018 growing seasons 11 c to 26 c this site has well drained hastings silt loam soil crete fine smectitic mesic pachic argiustolls with field capacity and permanent wilting point of 0 34 m3 m 3 and 0 14 m3 m 3 respectively measured at site table 1 irrigated row crops were grown during the experimental period field maize zea mays l and soybean glycine max were grown in 2017 and 2018 respectively typical effective rooting depth of field maize and soybean at the experimental site is 1 50 m and 1 20 m respectively measured across 15 years of experiments at the site total available water holding capacity of the top 1 50 m soil profile is approximately 300 mm the experimental field 16 5 ha was irrigated using a four span hydraulic and continuous move center pivot irrigation system t l irrigation co hastings nebraska irrigation management was conducted to maintain crops at optimum growth conditions and maintain root zone 0 120 cm soil water near 40 45 of maximum allowable depletion irmak 2015a following this criterion of management total irrigation water depth of 159 mm in 2017 and 64 mm in 2018 were applied loamy sand site 2 the second experimental site site 2 was at central city 41 16 n 97 56 w at an elevation of 549 m above mean sea level approximately 10 km north of the platte river nebraska here the long term average annual and growing season precipitation is 732 mm and 464 mm respectively the soil temperature ranged from 14 c to 25 c this site has deep moderately drained and moderately permeable loamy sand ipage mixed mesic oxyaquic ustipsamments with a field capacity and permanent wilting point of 0 19 m3 m 3 and 0 05 m3 m 3 respectively measured at site table 1 this site was a rainfed native grassland approximately 70 ha in size and contains primarily buffalograss bouteloua dactyloides nutt 90 and tall fescue festuca arundinacea total available water holding capacity of the top 1 50 m soil profile is approximately 210 mm this grassland was established in 1980 and still maintains its natural establishment conditions due to rainfed conditions the vegetation experiences water stress especially during july and august it is grazed throughout most of the growing season and the grass height varies between approximately 5 and 13 cm throughout the season irmak 2010 the small area where this experiment was located within the pasture grass field was fenced and no cattle was allowed to keep the setup undisturbed uncompacted and maintain pristine infiltration characteristics that are inherent to a representative pasture grass vegetated loamy sand site nebraska has approximately 19 6 million ha of land that comprises approximately 12 million ha of grassland rangeland 1 9 million ha of irrigated maize and 0 8 million ha of irrigated soybean irmak 2010 thus the vegetative surfaces in these experiments are well representative of nebraska and other midwestern states and hence hold significance for the state and other states with similar soil texture and soil water holding characteristics and cropping systems table 1 presents some of the measured basic soil characteristics at both sites these data serve as metadata for the conditions in which this research was conducted with the intention of improving transferability of the findings and information gained from this research these data were measured using soil samples collected at the experimental sites and analyzed using standard physical and chemical properties laboratory techniques the inclusion of these two soil types in these experiments provides an opportunity to evaluate the sensors for use in conditions that are representative of a major proportion of the state s irrigated and rainfed agricultural production 2 2 soil moisture sensors investigated nine different commercial soil moisture sensors that fall into three main categories when classified by operational principles were investigated at each site two sets of each sensor were evaluated one of which was installed in horizontal parallel to the ground surface orientation and the other in vertical perpendicular to the ground surface orientation the only exceptions were jd probe which can only be installed vertically being a multi sensor probe and tdr315 l acclima which was only evaluated in horizontal orientation the lack of replication of different sensors at each site and orientation was due to 1 already extensive financial investment and 2 the need for careful consideration of minimizing the spatial moisture variability from soil crop and management factors and thus evaluating sensors in a confined small volume to further minimize probability of spatial heterogeneity moreover given a specific financial investment the goal was to include more type of commercial sensors to investigate as stakeholders have a wide range of sensor options and research should cater to that need by evaluating a wide panel of sensors in the same framework following are all the sensors included in this research under their corresponding principles of operation time domain reflectometry tdr based sensors o truetdr 315 l

all the sensors are indirect methods of soil moisture determination i e they use an intermediate soil property to indirectly estimate volumetric water content θv for example truetdr 315 l uses apparent dielectric permittivity cs616 and cs655 use oscillation frequency and consequently apparent dielectric permittivity 5te 10hs ec 5 and sm150 use dielectric constant jd field connect uses a count proportional to the sensor resonant frequency and teros 21 uses soil matrix potential these intermediate variables are related to θv via previously developed relationships such as the topp s equation topp et al 1980 all the sensors report soil moisture status as volumetric water content θv except teros 21 mps 6 which reports soil matric potential ψm kpa all ψm measurement were converted to θv using a soil specific soil water characteristic curve developed by irmak 2019b it is useful to mention here that the accuracy assessments in this manuscript are based on the final sensor θv output and ψm in teros 21 and not the intermediate soil properties that the sensing components measure the final θv or ψm output from the sensor is a function of estimation characteristics of intermediate soil property as well as effectiveness of the conversion approach used e g topp s equation since all sensors use different intermediate soil properties as well as different conversion approaches it would be challenging to systematically compare accuracy individually at intermediate and final sensor output levels moreover the approach used in this research seems the most apt in the light of the fact that most of the practical applications also rely on the final sensor output and not intermediate variables 2 3 reference moisture measurement a new troxler model 4302 neutron probe np soil moisture gauge troxler electronic laboratories inc research triangle park n c represented reference θv θvref information in the research all other sensors investigated have been compared assessed and calibrated against np measurements in order to collect data for np calibration the np was used to estimate volumetric soil water content at the soil depths of 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 and 0 90 1 20 m to be able to capture a wide range of soil water content during the calibrations at both sites aluminum access tubes were installed in the center of each plot that were established specifically for calibration process gravimetric soil samples were taken in the same vertical distance as the soil layers in which np reading were taken such that soil core samples were taken from the entire 0 30 m soil layer increments 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 and 0 90 1 20 m in each site to be able to represent the same soil area in the vertical domain as the np s sphere of influence which is approximately 0 30 m in diameter additional undisturbed soil core samples were taken in each research site at each soil layer at approximately 1 m distance from the np access tubes to quantify the soil bulk density once the soil bulk density and gravimetric soil water content on a percent weight basis were determined the volumetric soil water content was determined by multiplying the soil bulk density values with the associated weight basis water content for each soil layer the neutron probe was calibrated by correlating probe readings with volumetric water content of soil core samples 100 cm3 taken at each depth during the soil sampling procedure for calibration and bulk density a minimum to negligible amount of organic matter e g plant root was observed and visible macropores or biopores vertical infiltration channels or cracks were not present this process collecting np and gravimetric samples was carried out continuously following one major rain event and took approximately two weeks to complete the soil moisture and bulk density measurements for calibration were conducted at different periods date thus starting from near field capacity foe silt loam soil or saturation for loamy sand after a heavy rain event different range of soil water content was measured as the soil moisture was depleted by plants and or decreased due to evaporation losses which resulted in covering almost the entire range from field capacity to near permanent wilting point for the silt loam soil i e 14 35 vol and from near saturation to permanent wilting point for the loamy sand soil 5 35 vol this process also ensured that the np was calibrated for different soil layers and accounted for potential spatial variability exists in vertical direction of each experimental site fig 2 a and b clearly show that the np had an excellent accuracy in measuring volumetric soil water content for both sites with minimum error and indicating its use as a reference method to compare all other soil moisture sensing technologies is justified irmak s unpublished research notes two np access tubes were installed at each site for reference soil moisture information these tubes were installed in close vicinity of the sampling area of the sensors evaluated for example in silt loam np access tubes were installed in the inter plant spacing in the same row as other sensors ensuring fair evaluation the access tubes were covered at all times except when measuring soil moisture to avoid any interaction with ambient moisture conditions due to rain and or irrigation site specific calibration equations were developed for the np irmak s unpublished research data for both sites by correlating the factory calibrated np measurements to the gravimetric sample determined θv it was hypothesized that these calibration functions when implemented on independent soil moisture data will result in some degree of improvement in end user targeted metric estimation as has been observed when estimating θv thus these calibration functions were implemented on the original raw independently collected moisture data from 2018 the original sensor estimated tsw etc and it and those estimated post calibration were assessed against np measured tswref etcref and itref in 2018 also a measure improvement in rmse post calibration irmse to represent the percentage change in success improvement decline or no change in sensor performance to estimate tsw etc and it was computed after the calibrations were implemented relative to original rmse thus a positive irmse implies improvement and a negative irmse implies no improvement or even worsening of the estimation 2 4 installation specifications all sensors that can be installed in varying orientations were investigated under two orientations vertical and horizontal although limited research zhu et al 2019 plauborg et al 2005 caldwell et al 2018 chen et al 2020 has been conducted on this topic it has been seen that sensor installation orientation might have an effect on sensor accuracy soil profiles pits were dug at both sites for horizontal sensor orientation so that the four boundary walls of the pits were perpendicular to the pit bottom plane the soil beyond the cuboidal pit was ensured to be undisturbed and soil structure was maintained in silt loam soil the pit was dug in the furrow whereas in loamy sand soil the pit was dug in a representative grassed area for horizontal orientation the sensors were installed parallel to the ground surface against one of the pit walls at 60 cm from soil surface such that the sensing components of the sensor prongs ceramic disks etc resided in undisturbed soil volume and sampled soil moisture in undisturbed soil this depth was selected to avoid spatial heterogeneous wetting patterns at shallower depths as well as due to its coincidence with effective root volume sensor outputs are highly sensitive to the effectiveness of sensor installation requiring that extreme caution is used in the installation procedure the volume of influence for em sensors is 500 cm3 evett 2008 chen et al 2020 and thus enough inter sensor distance was allowed with an additional buffer so that these volumes are independent for each sensor and there is no overlap to avoid signal interference post installation the pit was refilled with the same volume of soil compacted to original conditions as best as possible and the same soil layers were placed back in their original depths to enable the construction of the original soil layers it has to be noted that the soil was backfilled only over the non sensing part of the sensors and thus any changes in bulk density post backfill should not affect sensor measurements for vertical orientation the sensors were installed perpendicular to the ground surface such that the sensing components completely rest in undisturbed soil volume and are below the non sensing components the geometrical mid points of the vertically installed sensors sensing components align with each other lie on a common horizontal imaginary line this installation fashion ensured that most of the sensing volume manufacturer reported was comparable across all the sensors this is a commonly known issue in soil moisture sensor evaluation setups and exists because every sensor has a different geometry of sensing components and it will be impossible to make their sensing volumes totally coincide thus the best strategy is to match the maximum proportion of each sensor s sensing volume to that of np by aligning their midpoints and this strategy was used in this research for silt loam v the imaginary horizontal line was at 30 cm from the ground surface while for loamy sand v it was 50 cm from the ground surface installation was deeper due to higher infiltration rates than silt loam for silt loam site h the sensors were installed directly under the plant row within the root zone and for silt loam v they were installed in the inter plant spacing ensuring sampling of the root zone all sensors including np access tubes were installed between the healthy maize or soybean plants in an area with uniform emergence so that representative soil moisture measurements are made similarly in loamy sand side sensors were installed in an area with healthy grass cover with uniform grass cover the jd probe being a multi depth probe had different installation specifications than those discussed above jd probes can only be vertically installed perpendicular to the soil surface and hence we were not concerned with installation orientations in this case the probe was installed into a cylindrical hole made by a snugly fitting giddings probe such that there was not any undue opportunity for preferential flow around the probe nevertheless soil slurry prepared from the soil taken from the same depth at the site was used to ensure this the jd probes were compared to np soil moisture at five different depths where the capacitors are placed i e 10 20 30 50 and 100 cm it should be noted that these depths are alterable but manufacturer default depths were used in this research all sensors and the np access tubes remained in the soil throughout the two calendar years to maintain consistency and minimize soil disturbance 2 5 soil moisture data measurement and retrieval all the sensors investigated were equipped with various manufacturer recommended data loggers that read soil moisture status every minute and output hourly averages throughout the two growing seasons it was ensured that the sub hourly sensor readings were the same do not change in such short time frame and were accurately represented by the hourly average outputs and there was no sampling time mismatch between instantaneous np measurements and hourly average sensor measurements that were used for comparison the datasets were retrieved manually except for jd probe for which telemetry system was used for data retrieval the np measurements were conducted at both access tubes at the two sites roughly every week throughout the two growing seasons at each access tube eight neutron count measurements were conducted each week each corresponding to the depths where various sensors were installed i e 10 cm jd probe 20 cm jd probe 30 cm jd probe and all sensors under silt loam v 50 cm jd probe and all sensors under loamy sand v 60 cm for all sensors under silt loam h and loamy sand h and 100 cm jd probe measurement of weekly soil moisture resulted in a broad range of soil moisture conditions encountered to test the soil moisture sensors against at both sites although there were no sensors to be investigated at 90 cm and 120 cm depths θvref was measured at these depths as well to aid in a scaling procedure which is detailed in section 2 7 2 6 statistical analysis all sensors were evaluated for their performance in estimating θv tsw etc and it using root mean squared error rmse m3 m 3 computed as in eq 1 it was aimed to compare various target variables predicted by sensors in question with those measured using true np technique 1 r m s e i 1 n e i m i 2 n where mi is sensor estimated variable ei is corresponding np reported reference variable and n is number of observations rmse was used to denote the absolute value of the error that would be associated with these sensor estimated variables if the sensor in question is used to report soil moisture status as calculated from the experimental data additionally linear regression was used among pairwise data of sensor estimated variables on the ordinate and true variables on the abscissa to quantify the estimates of slope and intercept coefficient of determination r2 2 7 scaling of sensor performance to the root zone profile the experimental evaluation of the sensors was only accomplished at one depth however the objectives of this research entail that end user targeted metrics tsw etc and it be computed which require incremental θv and measurements throughout the root zone profile for example computing tsw and etc will require implementing a soil water balance model at the root zone scale as water extraction occurs from the entire root length similarly determining it or irrigation scheduling has to account for the water deficit in the entire root zone having not measured sensor performance at multiple depths a scaling approach was used to apply the performance models quantified at the experimental depths at incremental depths in the soil profile the incremental depths were 30 cm 60 cm 90 cm and 120 cm and thus the root zone considered was 0 120 cm the scaling approach assumes that the performance of the sensors with respect to the reference np measurements does not change with depth implying that the performance of sensors installed at 60 cm with respect to np measurements can be scaled up to other depths within the root zone as mentioned in section 2 5 θvref was measured at all four incremental depths using these data site specific linear functions were developed among θvref measured at various depths namely θvref at 60 cm vs θvref at 30 cm θvref at 60 cm vs θvref at 90 cm and θvref at 60 cm vs θvref at 120 cm these functions not presented here model the relative moisture availability in the soil profile at various depths although the sensors in question are subject to errors their inter depth relative behaviour is systematic and thus should mimic the inter depth patterns demonstrated by np derived θvref thus the inter depth θvref relationships were applied to all the sensors to estimate sensor specific θv at 30 cm 90 cm and 120 cm using θv at 60 cm as an independent variable these operations resulted in sensor specific θv datasets at 30 60 90 and 120 cm at each site which thereby were used for calculation of end user targeted variables it is critical to note that these estimated θv magnitudes at three additional depths were assumed to be subject to the same degree of inaccuracy that was measured at one depth 2 8 quantification of end user targeted variables sensor measured θv data as well as np measured θvref data were each used as input to compute sensor derived and np derived tsw etc and it respectively for both growing seasons using the methodologies outlined below for all the end user targeted variables the exact same computational procedures listed in 2 8 1 2 8 3 were adopted across all the sensors the computational procedures use other variables constants and assumptions in a certain manner to deduce the end user targeted variables for example the water balance used to determine etc uses several input and output flux terms that have their own methodologies in order to not confound the signal of θv in the end user targeted variables it is critical that the methodologies are held constant across all the sensors as well as the reference values of the same variables derived from np in doing that the possibility of errors and uncertainties associated with other components of the computational procedure e g the error associated with runoff or deep percolation estimation was removed which could have impact the inferences about propagation of θv errors into tsw etc and it metrics thus any differences in tsw etc and it deductions among various sensors would only be the function of θv as other assumptions constants and variables are held stationary among investigated sensors and np and thus the effect of methodology is negated or cancelled out 2 8 1 total soil water tsw the total soil water tsw in the complete monitored soil profile 0 120 cm reflects the integration of moisture detected at individual incremental depths throughout the profile at daily scale the depth of water present in each layer 0 30 30 60 60 90 90 120 cm was calculated by multiplying θv for each layer to the depth of layer i e 300 mm 2 tsw θ v l a y e r 1 θ v l a y e r 2 θ v l a y e r 3 θ v l a y e r 4 300 where tsw is total soil water in the soil profile mm θvlayerx is θv fraction m3 m 3 at xth layer x ranges from 1 to 4 layer 1 layer 2 layer 3 and layer 4 represent 0 30 30 60 60 90 and 90 120 cm depth of soil profile respectively and 300 represents the depth of each layer in mm tsw reprsents the water storage in the soil matrix and does not account for macropore storage the jd probes sensed θv at 10 20 30 50 and 100 cm and thus unlike other sensors represented 0 100 cm soil profile nevertheless their assessment was conducted against np derived variables for the same profile depth thus maintaining fairness of comparisons 2 8 2 crop evapotranspiration etc a general soil water balance was used to compute etc as a residual from the closed equation 3 p i u r o n r o f f δ s w e t c d where p is rainfall mm i is irrigation water applied mm u is upward soil moisture capillary flux mm ron is surface runon within the field mm roff is surface runoff from the field mm δsw is the change in soil moisture storage in the soil profile mm and d is the deep percolation mm below the root zone the deep percolation was estimated by daily soil water balance approach using a computer program that was written in microsoft visual basic the calculation of d considers a root zone that is modeled between a minimum 10 cm and maximum value 120 cm as a function of minimum and maximum values of basal crop coefficient kcb derived from jensen and allen 2016 the inputs to the program were daily weather data including air temperature incoming shortwave irradiance relative humidity wind speed and rainfall irrigation dates and amounts initial water content in the soil profile at crop emergence and crop and site specific information such as planting date maturity date soil parameters maximum rooting depth etc payero et al 2009 bryant et al 1992 the computer program calculated daily etc and the water balance in the crop root zone using the two step approach etc kc eto where eto is grass reference evapotranspiration and kc stage based crop coefficients adopted from fao 56 methodology is the crop coefficient in the program eto is calculated using the weather data as input to the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 monteith and unsworth 2007 and kc is used to adjust the eto to that of the desired crops at different growth stages and growing environments the daily soil water balance equation for deep percolation is 4 d j m a x p j r j i j e t c j c d j 1 0 where dj is deep percolation on day j cdj 1 is root zone cumulative depletion depth at the end of day j 1 pj is precipitation rj is precipitation and or irrigation runoff from the soil surface on day j mm ij is irrigation depth on day j mm and etcj is crop evapotranspiration on day j mm estimated by the two step approach cdj 1 was calculated via two pathways depending on the data availability for days when total depletion is available from θvref or θv measurements they were used directly on the days when these were not measured it was estimated as previous day s depletion cdj 2 minus pj 1 ij 1 rj 1 etcj 1 dj 1 to initiate the calculations on the first day of soil water balance i e planting date for silt loam soil the cdj 1 was taken as initial depletion which is 0 to initiate the water balance the surface runoff from each field was estimated using the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs curve number method usda nrcs 1985 as outlined in usda nrcs 1985 hydrologic soil groups for each soil type were determined and curve numbers were determined for row crops and pasture surface covers under all antecedent moisture conditions to estimate daily rj the same procedure has been used to estimate field scale and plot scale surface runoff at the experimental site previously kukal and irmak 2020 irmak 2015a runon was ignored from the soil water balance as the experimental field was not adjacent to any other field from which runon could be possible precipitation in each field was measured on an hourly basis precipitation was sampled every 1 min and output as hourly totals using bowen ratio energy balance system brebs equipped with rain gauges in the field site which were part of the larger nebraska water energy flux measurement modeling and research network nebflux irmak 2010 with substantial research and experience with both the field sites in the past it was established that the upward capillary flux usually caused by a shallow water table which is not the case here and runon are negligible due to the soil textural and hydraulic properties at the sites and negligible slopes as well as no source of runon adjacent to the field sites respectively thus the soil water balance equation is reduced to the following form for calculating crop evapotranspiration etc 5 etc p i r d δsw 2 8 3 irrigation triggers it for the purpose of this research an irrigation trigger was defined as the situation in the soil moisture time series when the tsw was equal to or lower than readily available water raw raw was computed for each experimental site as a difference of soil water at field capacity and maximum allowable depletion mad for the purpose of it computation mad was taken as 35 for both the sites which is a typical mad value used with a safe buffer to avoid plant water stress this should not be confused with the mad that was used to actually irrigate the silt loam field 40 45 as mentioned in section 2 1 finally the number of times an it was observed in a soil moisture dataset sourced to each of the sensors were counted and compared to np derived it as 6 i t n t s w r a w where n indicates number of times the condition in the paranthesis is met all units are in mm the number of it accounts for whether the senosor was able to report the attainment of the irrigation threshold used for management when the reference np did so as mentioned earlier the methods used to calculate the end user targeted variables here are the standard best available and previously used methods irmak 2015a nevertheless weaknesses in methods even if any would not impact the assessments given that the stationarity of methods across sensors and reference np allows for only the θv signal to be propagated into the final magnitudes and negation of the any methodological impacts 2 9 performance assessment of sensor reported end user targeted variables the θv and θvref derived end user targeted variables from 2017 were used to assess the sensors for their performance each sensor under factory calibration f c was characterized for its performance to reflect true tsw etc and it using rmse additionally soil specific calibration functions to correct sensor reported θv using regression analyses among θv and θvref were developed using datasets from 2017 consequently these functions were applied to f c sensor reported 2018 θv datasets and the resulting improved θv information was used to predict tsw etc and it under site specific calibration s s c and assessed against np derived variables thus these calibration functions were implemented on the original raw independently collected moisture data from 2018 the original sensor tsw estimates and those after θv calibration were assessed against np measured tsw tswref in 2018 and the respective rmse s were calculated also a measure metric improvement in rmse post calibration irmse was computed to represent the percentage change in success improvement decline or no change in sensor perfornamce to estimate tsw after the calibrations were implemented relative to original rmse thus a positive irmse implies improvement fig 3 and a negative irmse implies no improvement or even worsening of the estimation 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensor performance in θv estimation the pairwise θv and θvref data from the 2017 growing season were used in an ordinary least squares ols regression analysis and calibration parameters i e slopes and intercepts of θv versus θvref regressions were determined these parameters were used as observations to conduct a 3 way anova test to statistically infer if sensor performance varied by soil types installation orientation and the choice of sensor it was observed that the slope and intercepts were statistically different among the two soil types at 99 and 90 confidence intervals the slopes were statistically different among sensors at 90 ci while the intercepts were not both the slopes and intercepts were not statistically different among the two orientations thus while the choice of sensor and soil type significantly affected sensor performance the installation orientation was not found to be a significant driver of sensor performance the differences seen in the θv among v and h orientations can be a consequence of the differences in spheres of influence when the sensors in question are installed horizontally or vertically for example the volume of influence for a sensor such as cs655 will be a cylindrical one with a major and minor axis the sensor will encounter more vertical volume in v orientation and more horizontal volume in h orientation the patterns of moisture dynamics can vary in these differently aligned volumes with v orientation subject to greater θv along the sensing components while np sampling volume is static which can cause differences in performance statistics based on the abovementioned findings the focus of this research inferences and discussion of sensor error propagation into end user targeted variables will only be limited to the h sensor orientation since orientation did not affect estimation of θv it follows as a corollary that it is also not a significant driver of end user targeted variables as well the h orientation was chosen due to the fact that the sensors sampling volumes major axes will be aligned in the horizontal soil cross section which encounters relatively lower spatial variability than its v orientation counterparts also by selecting h orientation it was ensured that research findings are consistent with the literature as most of the studies have evaluated sensors when installed in h orientation sensor installation orientation can be an important on farm water irrigation management decision to make from an operational standpoint although it did not affect sensor accuracy this issue is relevant only for probe based sensors as it alters the actual volume of soil sampled by the sensor installation orientation is a critical decision to make at the field level due to its role in conveying the geometry of sampled volume for soil water status and both orientations h and v can be of varying interest to the user depending on the intention and objectives while installation orientation is also a strong function of sensor type used a vast majority of soil moisture sensors are designed to be installed vertically there are also labor based differences resulting from specific orientations as the ease and avoidance of labor can be vastly different during both installation and removal for one orientation over the other the installation orientation remains an open question to the users as majority of commercial sensors are often recommended from manufacturer to be installed in either orientation without much or quantitative discussion of how these orientations will impact soil moisture reporting this question can be answered by the users by evaluating if their intended applications require horizontally or vertically aligned spatial averaging moreover it has to be evaluated by the users if the uncertainties involved with the use of a particular orientation are considerable enough when compared to their management resolution and if they will potentially affect their decisions 3 2 sensor error propagation in end user targeted metrics 3 2 1 sensor error propagation in tsw estimation a wide range of differences were observed when tsw was computed using soil moisture sensor derived θv with respect to that computed using np derived θvref these differences were found to be soil type specific for a given sensor to represent the errors resulting in tsw with the use of each sensor rmse of θv derived tsw values against θvref derived tsw was calculated table 2 in silt loam all the sensors resulted in fairly large rmse values for tsw estimation the most and least accurate sensors in silt loam were teros 21 mps 6 and cs616 rmse s of 111 mm and 551 mm respectively in loamy sand the most and least accurate sensors respectively were cs655 rmse of 25 mm and 10 hs rmse of 155 mm overall it was found that in general the use of sensors to represent soil water dynamics tsw is a more challenging task in silt loam soil than loamy sand it was found that post calibrated tsw estimation for all sensors was improved in silt loam soil and this improvement irmse ranged from 19 to 82 in loamy sand however not all sensors show improvement in tsw estimation cs616 10hs ec 5 5te and tdr 315 l show irmse that ranged from 4 to 79 on an average post calibration improvements were 45 and 42 in silt loam and loamy sand respectively fig 3 it is interesting to note that even after s s c the reduced rmse magnitudes in silt loam soils were three to five times the rmse in loamy sand soils however the inherent differences in the plant available water field capacity minus permananent wilting point among the two soil profiles have to be taken into account the plant available water is 201 mm and 171 mm in in silt loam soil and loamy sand soil respectively nevertheless the error encountered in tsw estimation was largely greater in loamy sand than silty loam soil even after s s c in both silt loam and loamy sand soils jd probe demonstrated the best performance to estimate tsw with or without s s c the observation of no improvement in some sensors in loamy sand soil may be primarily due to a already satisfactorily high performance under factory calibrations ii low systematic component of the sensor performance than that in silt loam soils and iii as a consequence application of calibration functions resulting in overfitting and hence no improvement in performance thus it might be more useful for these sensors to be used under factory calibrations in loamy sand which implies that using site specific calibrations does not always result in improved performance while estimating θv or tsw efficient and objective sensor selection entails that appropriate resources that take into account measured performance statistics be made available for possible conduitions of use by the clientele thus the performance statistics of all the investigated sensors were translated into simple relative rankings based on errors observed in their tsw estimation when compared to tswref under factory and site specific calibration table 3 across both f c and s s c as well as both soil types jd probe was ranked the best it is recommended that these ranks be considered as a criteria for sensor selection when accurate representation of end user targeted variables is desirable e g tsw which is a common target for researchers studying crop root zone water dynamics moreover table 2 should be consulted for any sensor that is selected for use so as to be aware of the errors they are subject to when under use in particular conditions and keep these uncertainties under consideration to decide reliability of the sensor for decision making and allowing a safe buffer for error 3 2 2 sensor error propagation into etc estimation in addition to tsw an important variable that is of interest to research community water resources planning and management agencies irrigators and other agricultural professionals as an indicator of etc to assess each sensor for their performance to reasonably estimate etc θv measured by each sensor in a soil water balance was used to compute etc as a residual from soil water balance identical soil water balance approach was implemented for each sensor and both soil types to ensure that the resulting differences in etc are not confounded by the methdology deployed in this research the components of the soil water balance differed across the two sites including precipitation irrigation due to different location and management runoff due to different values of constants inputs to nrcs curve number methodology and deep percolation due to different crop coefficients and soil inputs to the fao 56 deep percolation methodology however these components were constant for all sensors within each of the given sites soil type to ensure fair comparisons and evaluation the sensors were installed in the root zone profile of the row crops as well as grass and thus measured the representative soil water conditions available for each crop for transpiration and evaporation processes since the two vegetative surfaces were drastically different crop configuration crop physiology leaf area ground cover fraction root zone structure and volume it is not recommended to compare etc values across the two sites for various sensors as with tsw the resulting sensor estimated etc quantities were compared with true etc etcref estimated from θvref the percent deviation of sensor estimated etc from etcref can be compared among different sensors at a given site table 4 it should be noted that in silt loam soil etc represents maize water use in 2017 and soybean water use in 2018 while in loamy sand soil etc represents pasture grass water use in both 2017 and 2018 it was found in 2017 that all sensors underestimated etc in silt loam soil the deviation of sensor measured etc from true etc ranged from 14 to 31 negative sign signifies underestimation which implies that the choice of sensor under a given soil type impacts the quantification of consumptive use of the soil vegetation system being monitored based on their absolute deviation from np determined etc the sensors were ranked if they are used under f c table 3 in silt loam jd probe sm150 and cs655 ranked the best to estimate etc while in loamy sand sm150 tdr 315 l and cs615 ranked the best post s s c these rankings changed slightly table 3 which is a consequence of varying degrees of improvement achieved in different sensors using s s c affecting the performance ranks achieved while a sensor might rank among the best in a given soil it still might be subject to high errors that can be detrimental to crop water use assessments and decision making for example teros 21 when used under f c in silt loam soil is ranked the third best sensor while demonstrating a deviation of 17 from etcref which might be unacceptable for research assessments of crop water uptake due to these reasons the rankings have to be considered alongwith the statistics presented in table 4 unlike what was observed in silt loam soil sensors showed both overstimation and underestimation of etc in loamy sand soil the deviations of sensor estimated etc from etcref ranged from 14 to 61 in loamy sand interestingly the best ranked sensors sm150 and tdr 315 l performed almost perfectly 0 1 deviation to estimate etc within 1 mm of etcref the 2018 growing season was used to evaluate if s s c led to any improvement in estimating etc using sensors fig 3 shows the percent improvements resulting in etc estimation post calibration blue bars under each soil type on an average across all sensors that showed any improvement at all sensors in loamy sand showed an irmse of 86 while those in silt loam showed an irmse of 17 among all the sensors in loamy sand soil cs616 showed highest irmse of 100 among others in the range of 67 88 however these f c sensors did not have scope for improvement as their deviation was 10 for example cs616 improved from an underestimation of 0 9 under f c to 0 4 with s s c which translates into 100 improvement but physically does not amount to much in silt loam soil 10hs had the highest irmse at 21 improved from 29 underestimation to 23 underestimation closely followed by cs655 18 teros 21 16 and 5te 15 these observations suggest that almost all sensors can be used with s s c in lomay sand soils with high accuracy to estimate etc in silt loam soils it is possible to estimate etc with selected sensors jd probe sm150 combined with s s c with 10 rmse the statistics provided in table 4 act as empirical evidence based criteria to consider while selecting a sensor to accurately quantify etc using a soil water balance approach it is critical to understand that the uncertainties presented here are only attributable to the choice of soil moisture sensors and not arising from assumptions in other soil water balance components as mentioned earlier any other confounding variables methodologies that could influence the inter sensor comparisons were strictly held constant these uncertainty measures convey the impact of sensor selection process on reporting etc which is useful for visualizing impacts and superior to only considering impacts on θv these details help the user select the best performing sensor under a given soil type determine if s s c is beneficial and become aware of the error uncertainty associated with its use in hydrological research 3 2 3 sensor error propagation into determining irrigation triggers the discussion of the impacts of sensor estimated θv error propagation into derivation of tsw and etc was inclined primarily towards research use however the most sought after application of soil moisture sensors when employed for commercial production management by growers is to aid in irrigation scheduling thus an ideal sensor should be capable of accurately reporting the exact timing corresponding to when the soil water status is depleted down to mad so as to effectively implement irrigation management practices irrigation depth is usually a pre set amount usually anywhere between 25 4 mm 38 1 mm and is a function of well and irrigation system capacity thus the sensor is expected to accurately report the timing when the pre set amount needs to be applied to evaluate each sensor the number of times each sensor reported an irrigation trigger it in comparison to what was reported by np measurements itref was counted and presented these comparisons in table 5 it was observed that in loamy sand itref were higher than that found in silt loam 10 in silt loam vs 13 in loamy sand which is justified due to differences in a soil texture and b irrigated crop production atsilt loam site vs rainfed production in loamy sand site during 2017 in silt loam all the sensors with the exception of teros21 severely underestimated observed it to the extent that they did not report even a single it table 5 thus in silt loam soil the use of teros21 resulted in perfectly optimal decision making in loamy sand soil during 2017 all sensors underestimated it when compared to itref except jd probe which reported exact it events the deviation of it from itref varied from 15 in tdr 315 l to 100 i e 0 it reported in sm150 5te teros 21 similar results were found by fares and alva 2000 where they found promising results by using capacitance probes jd probe is a capacitance based probe for optimal irrigation in sandy soil tdr 315 l only missed 2 it and hence was the second best performing sensor in loamy sand soils table 5 it was observed throughout the research findings that performance indicators of tsw etc and it estimation were relatively worse in silt loam soil than loamy sand soil the primary reason for this behaviour is high clay contents in silt loam soil for which bound water water molecules bound to soil surfce by adhesive cohesive and osmotic forces effects can confound sensor performance as with free water molecules application of electrical field does not polarize bound water which results in low dielectric permittivity and misrepresentation of soil moisture hilhorst et al 2001 or and wraith 1999 sun and young 2001 higher the clay content higher the bound water effects and misrepresentation that is primarily seen in tdr sensors moreover montmorillonite a 2 1 clay mineral is the dominant clay mineral in hastings silt loam soil higher salinity in silt loam soil than loamy sand soil as measured by electrical conductivity 169 higher table 1 is another critcial factor that hinders accurate soil moisture measurement using both tdr and capacitance sensors 2 1 clays have large surface areas affecting bound water and bulk permittivity confounding soil moisture estimation interestingly s s c did not result in any improvement in estimating it in silt loam soils in fact using s s c with teros 21 resulted in inferior perforemance as there existed no scope for improvement given that it performed perfectly under f c in silt loam findings of this research suggest that for these two growing seasons none of the sensors could estimate it with robustness and in fact none of them reported even one it under both f c and s s c in loamy sand however s s c resulted in improvement in it estimation in five of the sensors the irmse averaged across all the sensors that showed improvement in loam sand soil was 80 three of these sensors cs655 cs616 and ec 5 showed a perfect estimation post calibration fig 3 jd probe maintained its perfect it estimation both prior to and post calibration table 3 can be consulted for the ranking of the sensors based on their it reporting performance under f c and s s c respectively in silt loam soils due to all sensors being equally inefficient at estimating it the they were limitedly ranked or no ranks under s s c the ranks were limited to 1st 3rd for loamy sand soil as well for the same reasons when the findigs are viewed at from a sensing principle standpoint rather than a sensor specific standpoint there was no consistent observation of superior performance of one technological principal over another when the performance criteria was averaged by sensor technological principals it was found that in loamy sand soil tdr sensors performed the best followed by capacitance based and electrial resistance based sensors and these trends were uniform across the three metrics however no clear trend was noticed in silt loam soils this could be due to different mechanisms by which each sensor technology can be affected due from certain medium characeristics in fact none of these sensor technologies is capable of holistically accounting for various medium aspects that can be exploited for moisture measurement susha lekshmi et al 2014 for example tdr sensors are based on topp s equation topp et al 1980 which is insensitive to porosity pore fluid properties saturation and mineral constituency bhat and singh 2007 susha lekshmi et al 2014 in fact soil specific parameters such as clay content ion concentration mineralogy salinity porosity ambient temperature presence of the organic matter matrix structure etc are not being accounted by any of the available techniques the mechanisms and magnitude of the intensity to which these factors affect the success of various sensing technologies are complex to decipher especially in two contrasting soils as studied here some of these contrasting characteristics are tilled annual cropped soils vs long term grass cover irrigated vs rainfed silt loam vs loamy sand texture soil structure affected as a result of grazing vs agricultural machinery and salinity arising from agricultural fertilizers vs no chemical inputs see properties listed in table 1 the findings from this research suggest that assessments of soil moisture sensors can differ when different target metrics are investigated a given sensor even if relatively successful in predicting tsw and or etc accurately might not be equally successful in estimating it for example in silt loam sm150 performed reasonably well rank 2 when predicting etc but was ranked 6th when predicting tsw and did not report it well either although all the end user targeted variables rely fundamentally on θv for their derivation the arithmetic nature of θv is what dictates them actually for example θv is used as an input to estimate etc but the absolute value of θv is not of much relevance in these calculations instead the incremental change in θv or tsw in the root zone is what drives the soil water balance and thus estimation of etc as explained in the methodology a period of roughly a week was considered for implementing the soil water budget the net change in θv or tsw dictates the change in soil moisture storage term δsw of the balance which consequently affects water available for transpiration or evaporation in the soil crop system if a sensor that performed poorly in reporting an accurate θv in the soil profile but reported the same δsw change over time that the profile underwent it would result in true representation of etc during that period this characteristic of soil moisture sensors is commonly utilized in irrigation management extension programs to use relative calibrations as opposed to absolute calibrations in order to use low cost sensors for efficient irrigation managemnent relative calibrations rely on recording change occuring in sensor output with visual response of wet and dry conditions and suffices proper sensor use because the sensor is just comapred to itself and not an independent standard it oriented performance considers whether a soil moisture sensor is capable of reporting an event when the sensor reported θv attains a preset threshold required for irrigation scheduling in this case the sensitivity of the sensor to respond to drying at a rate that matches the rate truly demonstrated by the soil as represented by true np measurements is more important that the absolute value of θv this concept has also been proposed in assessment of satelite soil moisture products in agricultural landscapes champagne et al 2016 they suggested that smos product was better at capturing the relative trends of soil moisture than aquarius product although it did not estimate absolute value to the same accuracy thus the real applications of soil moisture sensors expected by diverse audiences require relative change and rate based data information rather than absolute θv information in the same way as θv cannot be a governing single criterion for sensor selection for several end user applications similarly one end user application cannot alone act as a criterion to dictate sensor selection moreover irrespective of what the targeted metric is and what sensor is used any application of technology in agricultural water management has to be informed by the margin of uncertainty associated with the application and the resources presented here will be useful in this direction although we have ranked the sensors based on their accuracy statistics under each soil type we recommend that the accuracy levels be relied upon to quantitatively evaluate how the use of a certain type of technology can affect assessments of critical agrohydrological variables such as total soil water and evapotranspiration it also cautioned that the objective of the research was to translate θv based sensor assessments into commonly used agricultural water management terms and not to communicate any relative suitability unsuitability of commercial sensors it is also realized that greater statistical power could have been gained by increasing the number of replicates in these experiments as a consequence of limited dataset size and possibility of spatial heterogeneity which is universal in any research relying on spot measurements the findings may be subject to variability outside of sensor accuracy there exist other operational feasibility factors that can influence the desirability of one sensor over another kukal et al 2020 have discussed such factors including cost ease of use and telemetry options in addition to sensor performance accuracy to develop a holistic guide for sensor selection 4 conclusions this research evaluated nine soil moisture sensors for their suitability to estimate critical quantitative metrics that are expected by research users and growers the need for this analyses arises from the facts that 1 accurate estimation of absolute θv by a sensor cannot determine its suitability alone and that several relative aspects of sensor data can be practically useful even when absolute θv estimation is unacceptable and 2 it is preferable to assess errors associated with sensor use in practical metrics used in real applications in addition to θv than θv alone to address this it was proposed that each sensor be evaluated based on its success in accurately reporting three major end user targeted metrics a tsw b etc and c it while tsw and etc are of greater interest to researchers water planners and managers irrigation districts policy decision makers it is the primary intended use of the sensors when employed by growers and other commercial production personnel under two different soil types the sensor performance varied considerably across selected commercial sensors when evaluated for estimating tsw etc and it sensor installation orientation was also investigated as a driver but was found to be statistically insignificant and thus the research questions were limited to horizontally installed sensors commonly employed in research and production settings three major sets of findings of how different sensors perform under each soil type for tsw etc and it estimations were presented a suitability rank of each sensor b the errors associated with each sensor when estimating these quantities and c if s s c s improve the performance of these sensors when compared to f c these resources provide objective direction on which sensor to employ and the uncertainty of assessments relying on these estimations employing soil moisture sensors was shown to be subject to substantial errors in estimation of tsw etc and it as high as 684 mm rmse in tsw in 0 1 20 m soil profile cs616 in silt loam as high as 61 deviation in etc teros 21 in loamy sand and as high as 100 deviation in it no triggers reported at all at the same time certain sensors were able to estimate these quantities accurately under f c tsw was estimated to the accuracy of 18 mm rmse using jd probe in loamy sand etc was perfectly estimated 0 1 deviation using tdr 315 l and sm150 in loamy sand and it was estimated perfectly as well exact number of itref reported using teros 21 in silt loam and tdr 315 l and jd probe in loamy sand soil s s c resulted in improvement in performance with 45 and 17 improvement observed in tsw and etc in silt loam soil respectively and 42 80 and 86 improvement was observed in tsw it and etc in loamy sand soil respectively the only exception where s s c did not result in any improvement was it estimation in silt loam soil to the best of authors knowledge this research is the first to translate traditional θv accuracy assessments into practical and application oriented criteria and use them to evaluate sensors for these specific applications the findings of this research are fairly transferrable given that the experiments were conducted in actual field settings that represented major agricultural land use types row crops and pasture and major soil types silt loam and loamy sand in the region it is recommended that the resources presented herein can be used as effective and more intuitive assessment criteria along with more operationally relevant factors that can influence sensor suitability and desirability declaration of competing interest the authors declare no

10396,soil moisture sensors are subject to uncertainty inaccuracy in measuring soil water status that hinders various applications user groups researchers and growers advisers rely on these sensors for estimating critical agricultural water management decisions and information such as total soil water in the crop root zone tsw crop evapotranspiration etc and predicting irrigation triggers it i e when tsw is equal to or lower than readily available water there is a lack of translation of errors in sensor reported soil moisture θv into tsw etc and it which is critical to farm level decision making as well as research assessments nine soil moisture sensors based on principles of time domain reflectometry capacitance and electrical resistance were investigated in field conditions for silt loam and loamy sand soils under two installation orientations vertical and horizontal during two growing seasons 2017 and 2018 accurate representation of tsw etc and it was found to be a function of

of tsw etc and it were quantified under each condition of use and sensors were comparatively ranked for effective selection it was found that all sensors underestimated etc in silt loam soil the deviation of sensor measured etc from true etc ranged from 14 to 31 which implies that the choice of sensor under a given soil type impacts the quantification of consumptive use of the soil vegetation

45 and 17 improvement in tsw and etc in silt loam soil respectively and 42 80 and 86 improvement observed in tsw it and etc in loamy sand soil respectively the research findings showed that suitability of soil moisture sensors can differ when different target metrics are used as criteria these findings emphasize the need for evaluating soil moisture sensors based on practical and application oriented criteria in addition to reliance on θv accuracy to the best of authors knowledge this research is the first to translate traditional θv accuracy assessments into practical and application oriented criteria and use them to evaluate sensors for these specific applications sensor rankings and uncertainty associated with their use presented here will allow diverse users to effectively identify sensors for targeted applications in water management decision making and research keywords soil moisture sensors irrigation time domain reflectometry capacitance electrical resistance evapotranspiration 1 introduction numerous sensing methods exist for estimation of soil moisture and since they function based on diverse principles they are subject to errors and uncertainties these methods extend from manual gravimetric sampling to technology based tools including neutron scattering time domain reflectometry tdr capacitance based sensing and electric resistance based sensing er extensive research has been conducted to evaluate their accuracy across global conditions of use spanning dozens of commercial sensors and all soil textural classes evett et al 2002 leib et al 2003 baumhardt et al 2000 varble and chávez 2011 jabro et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 chow et al 2009 primarily the objectives of these research studies were to investigate the accuracy of sensor s to represent soil moisture expressed by volumetric water content or θv as well as develop appropriate correction strategies to improve θv estimation as a result useful mathematical empirical functions have been developed and proposed under various conditions of sensor use e g soil texture salinity structure etc to aid in accurate estimation of θv the research conducted in this direction evett and steiner 1995 irmak and haman 2001 heng et al 2002 quinones et al 2003 irmak and irmak 2005 jabro et al 2005 brocca et al 2007 irmak et al 2010 mittelbach et al 2012 su et al 2014 datta et al 2018 irmak 2019a zhu et al 2019 emphasizes the importance of accurate θv estimation to address the suitability of a sensor for a given application ideally a sensor is regarded acceptable if it produces accurate θv information either under factory calibration f c or a combination of the f c sensor output and a site specific calibration s s c it is crucial to reconsider and reevaluate this notion of using θv as the target metric when evaluating soil moisture sensing technology because of its limited direct use in farm level decision making or scientific research other metrics hold greater relevance for real world applications like commercial operations such as irrigation decisions and scientific research such as soil water storage and crop evapotranspiration for instance investment on a soil moisture sensor in a commercial operation non research settings is expected to add significant value to irrigation decisions rather than merely reporting an accurate θv similarly its use by a researcher in a multi plot experiment is expected to aid in acceptable estimation of total soil water tsw in the plant root zone profile and crop evapotranspiration etc so as to discern the impacts of any imposed treatments on soil water balance a sensor that does not report an accurate θv might still be valuable to make an effective irrigation decision or convey etc this is due to the fact that soil water balance calculations rely on change in the θv value or its trends rather than the absolute value itself thus it is practically logical that emphasis is laid on accurate representation of these decision making or end user targeted variables tsw etc and irrigation management in addition to θv therefore it would be ideal if the errors and uncertainties associated with these sensors are reported in terms of these variables rather than only θv so that sensor evaluation and selection can be based on metrics that will actually be used in real world applications for instance evett et al 2012 stated that errors of the magnitude 0 05 m3 m 3 in θv translated into errors of up to 50 mm day 1 in soil water flux change in soil water storage over time estimation making them unsuitable for use in water balance et and water use efficiency wue it is critical that the methodologies used to estimate these end user targeted variables are held constant so that the performance is a function of only θv obtained from the sensors investigated and not any differences in assumptions or methods adopted to the best of our knowledge extremely limited body of research has evaluated and compared several soil moisture sensors for success in representing some measure of these practical metrics to both commercial and research audiences mittelbach et al 2012 evaluated four soil moisture sensors in clay loam soil in switzerland using sensor estimated change in soil moisture storage in comparison with lysimeter measured etc walker et al 2004 used three soil moisture sensors in loam soil in australia to quantify change in soil moisture storage and compare it against a bucket water balance model paige and keefer 2008 compared three tdr and capacitance based sensors in a sandy gravelly loam site in arizona by assessing change in soil moisture storage against the same computed using a soil water balance model where etc was measured using a bowen ratio system and runoff was measured using an h flume by using different approaches these studies addressed the success or failure of soil moisture sensors to accurately represent the soil water balance in research oriented and commercial production oriented use soil moisture sensors are often expected to reflect seasonal dynamics of tsw and seasonal total etc and their ability to call irrigation triggers it irmak 2015a b djaman and irmak 2012 irmak et al 2014 kukal and irmak 2019 and any sensor technology has not been evaluated for these important applications this research aims to address these knowledge gaps in the literature by evaluating soil moisture sensors in silt loam and loamy sand soils for two complete growing seasons nine commercial sensors truetdr 315 l acclima inc meridian id cs616 and cs 655 campbell scientific inc logan ut 5 te 10hs ec 5 and mps 6 meter group pullman wa sm150 delta t devices ltd cambridge uk and john deere field connect john deere water san marcos cal were included in an investigation of how errors in θv sensing by using various sensor technologies can propagate into a assessments of tsw and etc by the scientific research community and b irrigation decision making in commercial agricultural operations producer oriented the specific objectives were to i evaluate performance of sensors to accurately determine tsw etc and it in row crop and pasture grass agricultural systems ii assess any improvement of tsw etc and it estimates when site specific calibrations s s c were used relative to factory calibrations f c and iv rank all the sensors for their success in estimating tsw etc and it for both the soil types so as to facilitate sensor selection aimed at these applications it is emphasized that in order to estimate tsw etc and it the process of conversion from θv was the same across sensors and thus the uncertainties observed in these variables are translated from uncertainties in θv only also the information presented in this manuscript should only be deemed true for silt loam and loamy sand soils as the experiments were limited to these soil textures only 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of soils vegetative characteristics and management at the experimental sites the field experiments were conducted during 2017 and 2018 growing seasons at two sites fig 1 which were selected so that the two ecosystems and agriculturally predominant soil types are represented in this research site 1 and site 2 are referred to as by their soil types i e silt loam and loamy sand respectively hereon the growing seasons for maize and soybean as well as the active photosynthetic period in the pasture grass was monitored as these periods coincide with the predominant conditions of use soil temperatures and wetting patterns primarily of soil moisture sensors the sensors were installed in 2017 growing season and remained in the soil until the end of experiment to minimize any effects arising from insufficient contact and disturbance due to repeated installation and removal silt loam site 1 the first experimental site site 1 was at the university of nebraska lincoln south central agricultural laboratory scal 40 43 n and 98 8 w at an elevation of 552 m above mean sea level near clay center nebraska the long term average annual precipitation in this area is 730 mm and the long term average growing season may 1st september 30th precipitation is 437 mm although both variables vary substantially and inter annually a wide range of soil temperatures measured with the cs655 sensor at 60 cm depth were encountered throughout 2017 and 2018 growing seasons 11 c to 26 c this site has well drained hastings silt loam soil crete fine smectitic mesic pachic argiustolls with field capacity and permanent wilting point of 0 34 m3 m 3 and 0 14 m3 m 3 respectively measured at site table 1 irrigated row crops were grown during the experimental period field maize zea mays l and soybean glycine max were grown in 2017 and 2018 respectively typical effective rooting depth of field maize and soybean at the experimental site is 1 50 m and 1 20 m respectively measured across 15 years of experiments at the site total available water holding capacity of the top 1 50 m soil profile is approximately 300 mm the experimental field 16 5 ha was irrigated using a four span hydraulic and continuous move center pivot irrigation system t l irrigation co hastings nebraska irrigation management was conducted to maintain crops at optimum growth conditions and maintain root zone 0 120 cm soil water near 40 45 of maximum allowable depletion irmak 2015a following this criterion of management total irrigation water depth of 159 mm in 2017 and 64 mm in 2018 were applied loamy sand site 2 the second experimental site site 2 was at central city 41 16 n 97 56 w at an elevation of 549 m above mean sea level approximately 10 km north of the platte river nebraska here the long term average annual and growing season precipitation is 732 mm and 464 mm respectively the soil temperature ranged from 14 c to 25 c this site has deep moderately drained and moderately permeable loamy sand ipage mixed mesic oxyaquic ustipsamments with a field capacity and permanent wilting point of 0 19 m3 m 3 and 0 05 m3 m 3 respectively measured at site table 1 this site was a rainfed native grassland approximately 70 ha in size and contains primarily buffalograss bouteloua dactyloides nutt 90 and tall fescue festuca arundinacea total available water holding capacity of the top 1 50 m soil profile is approximately 210 mm this grassland was established in 1980 and still maintains its natural establishment conditions due to rainfed conditions the vegetation experiences water stress especially during july and august it is grazed throughout most of the growing season and the grass height varies between approximately 5 and 13 cm throughout the season irmak 2010 the small area where this experiment was located within the pasture grass field was fenced and no cattle was allowed to keep the setup undisturbed uncompacted and maintain pristine infiltration characteristics that are inherent to a representative pasture grass vegetated loamy sand site nebraska has approximately 19 6 million ha of land that comprises approximately 12 million ha of grassland rangeland 1 9 million ha of irrigated maize and 0 8 million ha of irrigated soybean irmak 2010 thus the vegetative surfaces in these experiments are well representative of nebraska and other midwestern states and hence hold significance for the state and other states with similar soil texture and soil water holding characteristics and cropping systems table 1 presents some of the measured basic soil characteristics at both sites these data serve as metadata for the conditions in which this research was conducted with the intention of improving transferability of the findings and information gained from this research these data were measured using soil samples collected at the experimental sites and analyzed using standard physical and chemical properties laboratory techniques the inclusion of these two soil types in these experiments provides an opportunity to evaluate the sensors for use in conditions that are representative of a major proportion of the state s irrigated and rainfed agricultural production 2 2 soil moisture sensors investigated nine different commercial soil moisture sensors that fall into three main categories when classified by operational principles were investigated at each site two sets of each sensor were evaluated one of which was installed in horizontal parallel to the ground surface orientation and the other in vertical perpendicular to the ground surface orientation the only exceptions were jd probe which can only be installed vertically being a multi sensor probe and tdr315 l acclima which was only evaluated in horizontal orientation the lack of replication of different sensors at each site and orientation was due to 1 already extensive financial investment and 2 the need for careful consideration of minimizing the spatial moisture variability from soil crop and management factors and thus evaluating sensors in a confined small volume to further minimize probability of spatial heterogeneity moreover given a specific financial investment the goal was to include more type of commercial sensors to investigate as stakeholders have a wide range of sensor options and research should cater to that need by evaluating a wide panel of sensors in the same framework following are all the sensors included in this research under their corresponding principles of operation time domain reflectometry tdr based sensors o truetdr 315 l acclima acclima inc meridian id o cs616 campbell scientific inc logan ut o cs655 campbell scientific inc logan ut capacitance based sensors o 5te meter group pullman wa o 10hs meter group pullman wa o ec 5 meter group pullman wa o sm150 delta t devices cambridge u k o john deere jd field connect john deere water san marcos cal electrical resistance based sensor teros 21 mps 6 meter group pullman wa all the sensors are indirect methods of soil moisture determination i e they use an intermediate soil property to indirectly estimate volumetric water content θv for example truetdr 315 l uses apparent dielectric permittivity cs616 and cs655 use oscillation frequency and consequently apparent dielectric permittivity 5te 10hs ec 5 and sm150 use dielectric constant jd field connect uses a count proportional to the sensor resonant frequency and teros 21 uses soil matrix potential these intermediate variables are related to θv via previously developed relationships such as the topp s equation topp et al 1980 all the sensors report soil moisture status as volumetric water content θv except teros 21 mps 6 which reports soil matric potential ψm kpa all ψm measurement were converted to θv using a soil specific soil water characteristic curve developed by irmak 2019b it is useful to mention here that the accuracy assessments in this manuscript are based on the final sensor θv output and ψm in teros 21 and not the intermediate soil properties that the sensing components measure the final θv or ψm output from the sensor is a function of estimation characteristics of intermediate soil property as well as effectiveness of the conversion approach used e g topp s equation since all sensors use different intermediate soil properties as well as different conversion approaches it would be challenging to systematically compare accuracy individually at intermediate and final sensor output levels moreover the approach used in this research seems the most apt in the light of the fact that most of the practical applications also rely on the final sensor output and not intermediate variables 2 3 reference moisture measurement a new troxler model 4302 neutron probe np soil moisture gauge troxler electronic laboratories inc research triangle park n c represented reference θv θvref information in the research all other sensors investigated have been compared assessed and calibrated against np measurements in order to collect data for np calibration the np was used to estimate volumetric soil water content at the soil depths of 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 and 0 90 1 20 m to be able to capture a wide range of soil water content during the calibrations at both sites aluminum access tubes were installed in the center of each plot that were established specifically for calibration process gravimetric soil samples were taken in the same vertical distance as the soil layers in which np reading were taken such that soil core samples were taken from the entire 0 30 m soil layer increments 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 and 0 90 1 20 m in each site to be able to represent the same soil area in the vertical domain as the np s sphere of influence which is approximately 0 30 m in diameter additional undisturbed soil core samples were taken in each research site at each soil layer at approximately 1 m distance from the np access tubes to quantify the soil bulk density once the soil bulk density and gravimetric soil water content on a percent weight basis were determined the volumetric soil water content was determined by multiplying the soil bulk density values with the associated weight basis water content for each soil layer the neutron probe was calibrated by correlating probe readings with volumetric water content of soil core samples 100 cm3 taken at each depth during the soil sampling procedure for calibration and bulk density a minimum to negligible amount of organic matter e g plant root was observed and visible macropores or biopores vertical infiltration channels or cracks were not present this process collecting np and gravimetric samples was carried out continuously following one major rain event and took approximately two weeks to complete the soil moisture and bulk density measurements for calibration were conducted at different periods date thus starting from near field capacity foe silt loam soil or saturation for loamy sand after a heavy rain event different range of soil water content was measured as the soil moisture was depleted by plants and or decreased due to evaporation losses which resulted in covering almost the entire range from field capacity to near permanent wilting point for the silt loam soil i e 14 35 vol and from near saturation to permanent wilting point for the loamy sand soil 5 35 vol this process also ensured that the np was calibrated for different soil layers and accounted for potential spatial variability exists in vertical direction of each experimental site fig 2 a and b clearly show that the np had an excellent accuracy in measuring volumetric soil water content for both sites with minimum error and indicating its use as a reference method to compare all other soil moisture sensing technologies is justified irmak s unpublished research notes two np access tubes were installed at each site for reference soil moisture information these tubes were installed in close vicinity of the sampling area of the sensors evaluated for example in silt loam np access tubes were installed in the inter plant spacing in the same row as other sensors ensuring fair evaluation the access tubes were covered at all times except when measuring soil moisture to avoid any interaction with ambient moisture conditions due to rain and or irrigation site specific calibration equations were developed for the np irmak s unpublished research data for both sites by correlating the factory calibrated np measurements to the gravimetric sample determined θv it was hypothesized that these calibration functions when implemented on independent soil moisture data will result in some degree of improvement in end user targeted metric estimation as has been observed when estimating θv thus these calibration functions were implemented on the original raw independently collected moisture data from 2018 the original sensor estimated tsw etc and it and those estimated post calibration were assessed against np measured tswref etcref and itref in 2018 also a measure improvement in rmse post calibration irmse to represent the percentage change in success improvement decline or no change in sensor performance to estimate tsw etc and it was computed after the calibrations were implemented relative to original rmse thus a positive irmse implies improvement and a negative irmse implies no improvement or even worsening of the estimation 2 4 installation specifications all sensors that can be installed in varying orientations were investigated under two orientations vertical and horizontal although limited research zhu et al 2019 plauborg et al 2005 caldwell et al 2018 chen et al 2020 has been conducted on this topic it has been seen that sensor installation orientation might have an effect on sensor accuracy soil profiles pits were dug at both sites for horizontal sensor orientation so that the four boundary walls of the pits were perpendicular to the pit bottom plane the soil beyond the cuboidal pit was ensured to be undisturbed and soil structure was maintained in silt loam soil the pit was dug in the furrow whereas in loamy sand soil the pit was dug in a representative grassed area for horizontal orientation the sensors were installed parallel to the ground surface against one of the pit walls at 60 cm from soil surface such that the sensing components of the sensor prongs ceramic disks etc resided in undisturbed soil volume and sampled soil moisture in undisturbed soil this depth was selected to avoid spatial heterogeneous wetting patterns at shallower depths as well as due to its coincidence with effective root volume sensor outputs are highly sensitive to the effectiveness of sensor installation requiring that extreme caution is used in the installation procedure the volume of influence for em sensors is 500 cm3 evett 2008 chen et al 2020 and thus enough inter sensor distance was allowed with an additional buffer so that these volumes are independent for each sensor and there is no overlap to avoid signal interference post installation the pit was refilled with the same volume of soil compacted to original conditions as best as possible and the same soil layers were placed back in their original depths to enable the construction of the original soil layers it has to be noted that the soil was backfilled only over the non sensing part of the sensors and thus any changes in bulk density post backfill should not affect sensor measurements for vertical orientation the sensors were installed perpendicular to the ground surface such that the sensing components completely rest in undisturbed soil volume and are below the non sensing components the geometrical mid points of the vertically installed sensors sensing components align with each other lie on a common horizontal imaginary line this installation fashion ensured that most of the sensing volume manufacturer reported was comparable across all the sensors this is a commonly known issue in soil moisture sensor evaluation setups and exists because every sensor has a different geometry of sensing components and it will be impossible to make their sensing volumes totally coincide thus the best strategy is to match the maximum proportion of each sensor s sensing volume to that of np by aligning their midpoints and this strategy was used in this research for silt loam v the imaginary horizontal line was at 30 cm from the ground surface while for loamy sand v it was 50 cm from the ground surface installation was deeper due to higher infiltration rates than silt loam for silt loam site h the sensors were installed directly under the plant row within the root zone and for silt loam v they were installed in the inter plant spacing ensuring sampling of the root zone all sensors including np access tubes were installed between the healthy maize or soybean plants in an area with uniform emergence so that representative soil moisture measurements are made similarly in loamy sand side sensors were installed in an area with healthy grass cover with uniform grass cover the jd probe being a multi depth probe had different installation specifications than those discussed above jd probes can only be vertically installed perpendicular to the soil surface and hence we were not concerned with installation orientations in this case the probe was installed into a cylindrical hole made by a snugly fitting giddings probe such that there was not any undue opportunity for preferential flow around the probe nevertheless soil slurry prepared from the soil taken from the same depth at the site was used to ensure this the jd probes were compared to np soil moisture at five different depths where the capacitors are placed i e 10 20 30 50 and 100 cm it should be noted that these depths are alterable but manufacturer default depths were used in this research all sensors and the np access tubes remained in the soil throughout the two calendar years to maintain consistency and minimize soil disturbance 2 5 soil moisture data measurement and retrieval all the sensors investigated were equipped with various manufacturer recommended data loggers that read soil moisture status every minute and output hourly averages throughout the two growing seasons it was ensured that the sub hourly sensor readings were the same do not change in such short time frame and were accurately represented by the hourly average outputs and there was no sampling time mismatch between instantaneous np measurements and hourly average sensor measurements that were used for comparison the datasets were retrieved manually except for jd probe for which telemetry system was used for data retrieval the np measurements were conducted at both access tubes at the two sites roughly every week throughout the two growing seasons at each access tube eight neutron count measurements were conducted each week each corresponding to the depths where various sensors were installed i e 10 cm jd probe 20 cm jd probe 30 cm jd probe and all sensors under silt loam v 50 cm jd probe and all sensors under loamy sand v 60 cm for all sensors under silt loam h and loamy sand h and 100 cm jd probe measurement of weekly soil moisture resulted in a broad range of soil moisture conditions encountered to test the soil moisture sensors against at both sites although there were no sensors to be investigated at 90 cm and 120 cm depths θvref was measured at these depths as well to aid in a scaling procedure which is detailed in section 2 7 2 6 statistical analysis all sensors were evaluated for their performance in estimating θv tsw etc and it using root mean squared error rmse m3 m 3 computed as in eq 1 it was aimed to compare various target variables predicted by sensors in question with those measured using true np technique 1 r m s e i 1 n e i m i 2 n where mi is sensor estimated variable ei is corresponding np reported reference variable and n is number of observations rmse was used to denote the absolute value of the error that would be associated with these sensor estimated variables if the sensor in question is used to report soil moisture status as calculated from the experimental data additionally linear regression was used among pairwise data of sensor estimated variables on the ordinate and true variables on the abscissa to quantify the estimates of slope and intercept coefficient of determination r2 2 7 scaling of sensor performance to the root zone profile the experimental evaluation of the sensors was only accomplished at one depth however the objectives of this research entail that end user targeted metrics tsw etc and it be computed which require incremental θv and measurements throughout the root zone profile for example computing tsw and etc will require implementing a soil water balance model at the root zone scale as water extraction occurs from the entire root length similarly determining it or irrigation scheduling has to account for the water deficit in the entire root zone having not measured sensor performance at multiple depths a scaling approach was used to apply the performance models quantified at the experimental depths at incremental depths in the soil profile the incremental depths were 30 cm 60 cm 90 cm and 120 cm and thus the root zone considered was 0 120 cm the scaling approach assumes that the performance of the sensors with respect to the reference np measurements does not change with depth implying that the performance of sensors installed at 60 cm with respect to np measurements can be scaled up to other depths within the root zone as mentioned in section 2 5 θvref was measured at all four incremental depths using these data site specific linear functions were developed among θvref measured at various depths namely θvref at 60 cm vs θvref at 30 cm θvref at 60 cm vs θvref at 90 cm and θvref at 60 cm vs θvref at 120 cm these functions not presented here model the relative moisture availability in the soil profile at various depths although the sensors in question are subject to errors their inter depth relative behaviour is systematic and thus should mimic the inter depth patterns demonstrated by np derived θvref thus the inter depth θvref relationships were applied to all the sensors to estimate sensor specific θv at 30 cm 90 cm and 120 cm using θv at 60 cm as an independent variable these operations resulted in sensor specific θv datasets at 30 60 90 and 120 cm at each site which thereby were used for calculation of end user targeted variables it is critical to note that these estimated θv magnitudes at three additional depths were assumed to be subject to the same degree of inaccuracy that was measured at one depth 2 8 quantification of end user targeted variables sensor measured θv data as well as np measured θvref data were each used as input to compute sensor derived and np derived tsw etc and it respectively for both growing seasons using the methodologies outlined below for all the end user targeted variables the exact same computational procedures listed in 2 8 1 2 8 3 were adopted across all the sensors the computational procedures use other variables constants and assumptions in a certain manner to deduce the end user targeted variables for example the water balance used to determine etc uses several input and output flux terms that have their own methodologies in order to not confound the signal of θv in the end user targeted variables it is critical that the methodologies are held constant across all the sensors as well as the reference values of the same variables derived from np in doing that the possibility of errors and uncertainties associated with other components of the computational procedure e g the error associated with runoff or deep percolation estimation was removed which could have impact the inferences about propagation of θv errors into tsw etc and it metrics thus any differences in tsw etc and it deductions among various sensors would only be the function of θv as other assumptions constants and variables are held stationary among investigated sensors and np and thus the effect of methodology is negated or cancelled out 2 8 1 total soil water tsw the total soil water tsw in the complete monitored soil profile 0 120 cm reflects the integration of moisture detected at individual incremental depths throughout the profile at daily scale the depth of water present in each layer 0 30 30 60 60 90 90 120 cm was calculated by multiplying θv for each layer to the depth of layer i e 300 mm 2 tsw θ v l a y e r 1 θ v l a y e r 2 θ v l a y e r 3 θ v l a y e r 4 300 where tsw is total soil water in the soil profile mm θvlayerx is θv fraction m3 m 3 at xth layer x ranges from 1 to 4 layer 1 layer 2 layer 3 and layer 4 represent 0 30 30 60 60 90 and 90 120 cm depth of soil profile respectively and 300 represents the depth of each layer in mm tsw reprsents the water storage in the soil matrix and does not account for macropore storage the jd probes sensed θv at 10 20 30 50 and 100 cm and thus unlike other sensors represented 0 100 cm soil profile nevertheless their assessment was conducted against np derived variables for the same profile depth thus maintaining fairness of comparisons 2 8 2 crop evapotranspiration etc a general soil water balance was used to compute etc as a residual from the closed equation 3 p i u r o n r o f f δ s w e t c d where p is rainfall mm i is irrigation water applied mm u is upward soil moisture capillary flux mm ron is surface runon within the field mm roff is surface runoff from the field mm δsw is the change in soil moisture storage in the soil profile mm and d is the deep percolation mm below the root zone the deep percolation was estimated by daily soil water balance approach using a computer program that was written in microsoft visual basic the calculation of d considers a root zone that is modeled between a minimum 10 cm and maximum value 120 cm as a function of minimum and maximum values of basal crop coefficient kcb derived from jensen and allen 2016 the inputs to the program were daily weather data including air temperature incoming shortwave irradiance relative humidity wind speed and rainfall irrigation dates and amounts initial water content in the soil profile at crop emergence and crop and site specific information such as planting date maturity date soil parameters maximum rooting depth etc payero et al 2009 bryant et al 1992 the computer program calculated daily etc and the water balance in the crop root zone using the two step approach etc kc eto where eto is grass reference evapotranspiration and kc stage based crop coefficients adopted from fao 56 methodology is the crop coefficient in the program eto is calculated using the weather data as input to the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 monteith and unsworth 2007 and kc is used to adjust the eto to that of the desired crops at different growth stages and growing environments the daily soil water balance equation for deep percolation is 4 d j m a x p j r j i j e t c j c d j 1 0 where dj is deep percolation on day j cdj 1 is root zone cumulative depletion depth at the end of day j 1 pj is precipitation rj is precipitation and or irrigation runoff from the soil surface on day j mm ij is irrigation depth on day j mm and etcj is crop evapotranspiration on day j mm estimated by the two step approach cdj 1 was calculated via two pathways depending on the data availability for days when total depletion is available from θvref or θv measurements they were used directly on the days when these were not measured it was estimated as previous day s depletion cdj 2 minus pj 1 ij 1 rj 1 etcj 1 dj 1 to initiate the calculations on the first day of soil water balance i e planting date for silt loam soil the cdj 1 was taken as initial depletion which is 0 to initiate the water balance the surface runoff from each field was estimated using the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs curve number method usda nrcs 1985 as outlined in usda nrcs 1985 hydrologic soil groups for each soil type were determined and curve numbers were determined for row crops and pasture surface covers under all antecedent moisture conditions to estimate daily rj the same procedure has been used to estimate field scale and plot scale surface runoff at the experimental site previously kukal and irmak 2020 irmak 2015a runon was ignored from the soil water balance as the experimental field was not adjacent to any other field from which runon could be possible precipitation in each field was measured on an hourly basis precipitation was sampled every 1 min and output as hourly totals using bowen ratio energy balance system brebs equipped with rain gauges in the field site which were part of the larger nebraska water energy flux measurement modeling and research network nebflux irmak 2010 with substantial research and experience with both the field sites in the past it was established that the upward capillary flux usually caused by a shallow water table which is not the case here and runon are negligible due to the soil textural and hydraulic properties at the sites and negligible slopes as well as no source of runon adjacent to the field sites respectively thus the soil water balance equation is reduced to the following form for calculating crop evapotranspiration etc 5 etc p i r d δsw 2 8 3 irrigation triggers it for the purpose of this research an irrigation trigger was defined as the situation in the soil moisture time series when the tsw was equal to or lower than readily available water raw raw was computed for each experimental site as a difference of soil water at field capacity and maximum allowable depletion mad for the purpose of it computation mad was taken as 35 for both the sites which is a typical mad value used with a safe buffer to avoid plant water stress this should not be confused with the mad that was used to actually irrigate the silt loam field 40 45 as mentioned in section 2 1 finally the number of times an it was observed in a soil moisture dataset sourced to each of the sensors were counted and compared to np derived it as 6 i t n t s w r a w where n indicates number of times the condition in the paranthesis is met all units are in mm the number of it accounts for whether the senosor was able to report the attainment of the irrigation threshold used for management when the reference np did so as mentioned earlier the methods used to calculate the end user targeted variables here are the standard best available and previously used methods irmak 2015a nevertheless weaknesses in methods even if any would not impact the assessments given that the stationarity of methods across sensors and reference np allows for only the θv signal to be propagated into the final magnitudes and negation of the any methodological impacts 2 9 performance assessment of sensor reported end user targeted variables the θv and θvref derived end user targeted variables from 2017 were used to assess the sensors for their performance each sensor under factory calibration f c was characterized for its performance to reflect true tsw etc and it using rmse additionally soil specific calibration functions to correct sensor reported θv using regression analyses among θv and θvref were developed using datasets from 2017 consequently these functions were applied to f c sensor reported 2018 θv datasets and the resulting improved θv information was used to predict tsw etc and it under site specific calibration s s c and assessed against np derived variables thus these calibration functions were implemented on the original raw independently collected moisture data from 2018 the original sensor tsw estimates and those after θv calibration were assessed against np measured tsw tswref in 2018 and the respective rmse s were calculated also a measure metric improvement in rmse post calibration irmse was computed to represent the percentage change in success improvement decline or no change in sensor perfornamce to estimate tsw after the calibrations were implemented relative to original rmse thus a positive irmse implies improvement fig 3 and a negative irmse implies no improvement or even worsening of the estimation 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensor performance in θv estimation the pairwise θv and θvref data from the 2017 growing season were used in an ordinary least squares ols regression analysis and calibration parameters i e slopes and intercepts of θv versus θvref regressions were determined these parameters were used as observations to conduct a 3 way anova test to statistically infer if sensor performance varied by soil types installation orientation and the choice of sensor it was observed that the slope and intercepts were statistically different among the two soil types at 99 and 90 confidence intervals the slopes were statistically different among sensors at 90 ci while the intercepts were not both the slopes and intercepts were not statistically different among the two orientations thus while the choice of sensor and soil type significantly affected sensor performance the installation orientation was not found to be a significant driver of sensor performance the differences seen in the θv among v and h orientations can be a consequence of the differences in spheres of influence when the sensors in question are installed horizontally or vertically for example the volume of influence for a sensor such as cs655 will be a cylindrical one with a major and minor axis the sensor will encounter more vertical volume in v orientation and more horizontal volume in h orientation the patterns of moisture dynamics can vary in these differently aligned volumes with v orientation subject to greater θv along the sensing components while np sampling volume is static which can cause differences in performance statistics based on the abovementioned findings the focus of this research inferences and discussion of sensor error propagation into end user targeted variables will only be limited to the h sensor orientation since orientation did not affect estimation of θv it follows as a corollary that it is also not a significant driver of end user targeted variables as well the h orientation was chosen due to the fact that the sensors sampling volumes major axes will be aligned in the horizontal soil cross section which encounters relatively lower spatial variability than its v orientation counterparts also by selecting h orientation it was ensured that research findings are consistent with the literature as most of the studies have evaluated sensors when installed in h orientation sensor installation orientation can be an important on farm water irrigation management decision to make from an operational standpoint although it did not affect sensor accuracy this issue is relevant only for probe based sensors as it alters the actual volume of soil sampled by the sensor installation orientation is a critical decision to make at the field level due to its role in conveying the geometry of sampled volume for soil water status and both orientations h and v can be of varying interest to the user depending on the intention and objectives while installation orientation is also a strong function of sensor type used a vast majority of soil moisture sensors are designed to be installed vertically there are also labor based differences resulting from specific orientations as the ease and avoidance of labor can be vastly different during both installation and removal for one orientation over the other the installation orientation remains an open question to the users as majority of commercial sensors are often recommended from manufacturer to be installed in either orientation without much or quantitative discussion of how these orientations will impact soil moisture reporting this question can be answered by the users by evaluating if their intended applications require horizontally or vertically aligned spatial averaging moreover it has to be evaluated by the users if the uncertainties involved with the use of a particular orientation are considerable enough when compared to their management resolution and if they will potentially affect their decisions 3 2 sensor error propagation in end user targeted metrics 3 2 1 sensor error propagation in tsw estimation a wide range of differences were observed when tsw was computed using soil moisture sensor derived θv with respect to that computed using np derived θvref these differences were found to be soil type specific for a given sensor to represent the errors resulting in tsw with the use of each sensor rmse of θv derived tsw values against θvref derived tsw was calculated table 2 in silt loam all the sensors resulted in fairly large rmse values for tsw estimation the most and least accurate sensors in silt loam were teros 21 mps 6 and cs616 rmse s of 111 mm and 551 mm respectively in loamy sand the most and least accurate sensors respectively were cs655 rmse of 25 mm and 10 hs rmse of 155 mm overall it was found that in general the use of sensors to represent soil water dynamics tsw is a more challenging task in silt loam soil than loamy sand it was found that post calibrated tsw estimation for all sensors was improved in silt loam soil and this improvement irmse ranged from 19 to 82 in loamy sand however not all sensors show improvement in tsw estimation cs616 10hs ec 5 5te and tdr 315 l show irmse that ranged from 4 to 79 on an average post calibration improvements were 45 and 42 in silt loam and loamy sand respectively fig 3 it is interesting to note that even after s s c the reduced rmse magnitudes in silt loam soils were three to five times the rmse in loamy sand soils however the inherent differences in the plant available water field capacity minus permananent wilting point among the two soil profiles have to be taken into account the plant available water is 201 mm and 171 mm in in silt loam soil and loamy sand soil respectively nevertheless the error encountered in tsw estimation was largely greater in loamy sand than silty loam soil even after s s c in both silt loam and loamy sand soils jd probe demonstrated the best performance to estimate tsw with or without s s c the observation of no improvement in some sensors in loamy sand soil may be primarily due to a already satisfactorily high performance under factory calibrations ii low systematic component of the sensor performance than that in silt loam soils and iii as a consequence application of calibration functions resulting in overfitting and hence no improvement in performance thus it might be more useful for these sensors to be used under factory calibrations in loamy sand which implies that using site specific calibrations does not always result in improved performance while estimating θv or tsw efficient and objective sensor selection entails that appropriate resources that take into account measured performance statistics be made available for possible conduitions of use by the clientele thus the performance statistics of all the investigated sensors were translated into simple relative rankings based on errors observed in their tsw estimation when compared to tswref under factory and site specific calibration table 3 across both f c and s s c as well as both soil types jd probe was ranked the best it is recommended that these ranks be considered as a criteria for sensor selection when accurate representation of end user targeted variables is desirable e g tsw which is a common target for researchers studying crop root zone water dynamics moreover table 2 should be consulted for any sensor that is selected for use so as to be aware of the errors they are subject to when under use in particular conditions and keep these uncertainties under consideration to decide reliability of the sensor for decision making and allowing a safe buffer for error 3 2 2 sensor error propagation into etc estimation in addition to tsw an important variable that is of interest to research community water resources planning and management agencies irrigators and other agricultural professionals as an indicator of etc to assess each sensor for their performance to reasonably estimate etc θv measured by each sensor in a soil water balance was used to compute etc as a residual from soil water balance identical soil water balance approach was implemented for each sensor and both soil types to ensure that the resulting differences in etc are not confounded by the methdology deployed in this research the components of the soil water balance differed across the two sites including precipitation irrigation due to different location and management runoff due to different values of constants inputs to nrcs curve number methodology and deep percolation due to different crop coefficients and soil inputs to the fao 56 deep percolation methodology however these components were constant for all sensors within each of the given sites soil type to ensure fair comparisons and evaluation the sensors were installed in the root zone profile of the row crops as well as grass and thus measured the representative soil water conditions available for each crop for transpiration and evaporation processes since the two vegetative surfaces were drastically different crop configuration crop physiology leaf area ground cover fraction root zone structure and volume it is not recommended to compare etc values across the two sites for various sensors as with tsw the resulting sensor estimated etc quantities were compared with true etc etcref estimated from θvref the percent deviation of sensor estimated etc from etcref can be compared among different sensors at a given site table 4 it should be noted that in silt loam soil etc represents maize water use in 2017 and soybean water use in 2018 while in loamy sand soil etc represents pasture grass water use in both 2017 and 2018 it was found in 2017 that all sensors underestimated etc in silt loam soil the deviation of sensor measured etc from true etc ranged from 14 to 31 negative sign signifies underestimation which implies that the choice of sensor under a given soil type impacts the quantification of consumptive use of the soil vegetation system being monitored based on their absolute deviation from np determined etc the sensors were ranked if they are used under f c table 3 in silt loam jd probe sm150 and cs655 ranked the best to estimate etc while in loamy sand sm150 tdr 315 l and cs615 ranked the best post s s c these rankings changed slightly table 3 which is a consequence of varying degrees of improvement achieved in different sensors using s s c affecting the performance ranks achieved while a sensor might rank among the best in a given soil it still might be subject to high errors that can be detrimental to crop water use assessments and decision making for example teros 21 when used under f c in silt loam soil is ranked the third best sensor while demonstrating a deviation of 17 from etcref which might be unacceptable for research assessments of crop water uptake due to these reasons the rankings have to be considered alongwith the statistics presented in table 4 unlike what was observed in silt loam soil sensors showed both overstimation and underestimation of etc in loamy sand soil the deviations of sensor estimated etc from etcref ranged from 14 to 61 in loamy sand interestingly the best ranked sensors sm150 and tdr 315 l performed almost perfectly 0 1 deviation to estimate etc within 1 mm of etcref the 2018 growing season was used to evaluate if s s c led to any improvement in estimating etc using sensors fig 3 shows the percent improvements resulting in etc estimation post calibration blue bars under each soil type on an average across all sensors that showed any improvement at all sensors in loamy sand showed an irmse of 86 while those in silt loam showed an irmse of 17 among all the sensors in loamy sand soil cs616 showed highest irmse of 100 among others in the range of 67 88 however these f c sensors did not have scope for improvement as their deviation was 10 for example cs616 improved from an underestimation of 0 9 under f c to 0 4 with s s c which translates into 100 improvement but physically does not amount to much in silt loam soil 10hs had the highest irmse at 21 improved from 29 underestimation to 23 underestimation closely followed by cs655 18 teros 21 16 and 5te 15 these observations suggest that almost all sensors can be used with s s c in lomay sand soils with high accuracy to estimate etc in silt loam soils it is possible to estimate etc with selected sensors jd probe sm150 combined with s s c with 10 rmse the statistics provided in table 4 act as empirical evidence based criteria to consider while selecting a sensor to accurately quantify etc using a soil water balance approach it is critical to understand that the uncertainties presented here are only attributable to the choice of soil moisture sensors and not arising from assumptions in other soil water balance components as mentioned earlier any other confounding variables methodologies that could influence the inter sensor comparisons were strictly held constant these uncertainty measures convey the impact of sensor selection process on reporting etc which is useful for visualizing impacts and superior to only considering impacts on θv these details help the user select the best performing sensor under a given soil type determine if s s c is beneficial and become aware of the error uncertainty associated with its use in hydrological research 3 2 3 sensor error propagation into determining irrigation triggers the discussion of the impacts of sensor estimated θv error propagation into derivation of tsw and etc was inclined primarily towards research use however the most sought after application of soil moisture sensors when employed for commercial production management by growers is to aid in irrigation scheduling thus an ideal sensor should be capable of accurately reporting the exact timing corresponding to when the soil water status is depleted down to mad so as to effectively implement irrigation management practices irrigation depth is usually a pre set amount usually anywhere between 25 4 mm 38 1 mm and is a function of well and irrigation system capacity thus the sensor is expected to accurately report the timing when the pre set amount needs to be applied to evaluate each sensor the number of times each sensor reported an irrigation trigger it in comparison to what was reported by np measurements itref was counted and presented these comparisons in table 5 it was observed that in loamy sand itref were higher than that found in silt loam 10 in silt loam vs 13 in loamy sand which is justified due to differences in a soil texture and b irrigated crop production atsilt loam site vs rainfed production in loamy sand site during 2017 in silt loam all the sensors with the exception of teros21 severely underestimated observed it to the extent that they did not report even a single it table 5 thus in silt loam soil the use of teros21 resulted in perfectly optimal decision making in loamy sand soil during 2017 all sensors underestimated it when compared to itref except jd probe which reported exact it events the deviation of it from itref varied from 15 in tdr 315 l to 100 i e 0 it reported in sm150 5te teros 21 similar results were found by fares and alva 2000 where they found promising results by using capacitance probes jd probe is a capacitance based probe for optimal irrigation in sandy soil tdr 315 l only missed 2 it and hence was the second best performing sensor in loamy sand soils table 5 it was observed throughout the research findings that performance indicators of tsw etc and it estimation were relatively worse in silt loam soil than loamy sand soil the primary reason for this behaviour is high clay contents in silt loam soil for which bound water water molecules bound to soil surfce by adhesive cohesive and osmotic forces effects can confound sensor performance as with free water molecules application of electrical field does not polarize bound water which results in low dielectric permittivity and misrepresentation of soil moisture hilhorst et al 2001 or and wraith 1999 sun and young 2001 higher the clay content higher the bound water effects and misrepresentation that is primarily seen in tdr sensors moreover montmorillonite a 2 1 clay mineral is the dominant clay mineral in hastings silt loam soil higher salinity in silt loam soil than loamy sand soil as measured by electrical conductivity 169 higher table 1 is another critcial factor that hinders accurate soil moisture measurement using both tdr and capacitance sensors 2 1 clays have large surface areas affecting bound water and bulk permittivity confounding soil moisture estimation interestingly s s c did not result in any improvement in estimating it in silt loam soils in fact using s s c with teros 21 resulted in inferior perforemance as there existed no scope for improvement given that it performed perfectly under f c in silt loam findings of this research suggest that for these two growing seasons none of the sensors could estimate it with robustness and in fact none of them reported even one it under both f c and s s c in loamy sand however s s c resulted in improvement in it estimation in five of the sensors the irmse averaged across all the sensors that showed improvement in loam sand soil was 80 three of these sensors cs655 cs616 and ec 5 showed a perfect estimation post calibration fig 3 jd probe maintained its perfect it estimation both prior to and post calibration table 3 can be consulted for the ranking of the sensors based on their it reporting performance under f c and s s c respectively in silt loam soils due to all sensors being equally inefficient at estimating it the they were limitedly ranked or no ranks under s s c the ranks were limited to 1st 3rd for loamy sand soil as well for the same reasons when the findigs are viewed at from a sensing principle standpoint rather than a sensor specific standpoint there was no consistent observation of superior performance of one technological principal over another when the performance criteria was averaged by sensor technological principals it was found that in loamy sand soil tdr sensors performed the best followed by capacitance based and electrial resistance based sensors and these trends were uniform across the three metrics however no clear trend was noticed in silt loam soils this could be due to different mechanisms by which each sensor technology can be affected due from certain medium characeristics in fact none of these sensor technologies is capable of holistically accounting for various medium aspects that can be exploited for moisture measurement susha lekshmi et al 2014 for example tdr sensors are based on topp s equation topp et al 1980 which is insensitive to porosity pore fluid properties saturation and mineral constituency bhat and singh 2007 susha lekshmi et al 2014 in fact soil specific parameters such as clay content ion concentration mineralogy salinity porosity ambient temperature presence of the organic matter matrix structure etc are not being accounted by any of the available techniques the mechanisms and magnitude of the intensity to which these factors affect the success of various sensing technologies are complex to decipher especially in two contrasting soils as studied here some of these contrasting characteristics are tilled annual cropped soils vs long term grass cover irrigated vs rainfed silt loam vs loamy sand texture soil structure affected as a result of grazing vs agricultural machinery and salinity arising from agricultural fertilizers vs no chemical inputs see properties listed in table 1 the findings from this research suggest that assessments of soil moisture sensors can differ when different target metrics are investigated a given sensor even if relatively successful in predicting tsw and or etc accurately might not be equally successful in estimating it for example in silt loam sm150 performed reasonably well rank 2 when predicting etc but was ranked 6th when predicting tsw and did not report it well either although all the end user targeted variables rely fundamentally on θv for their derivation the arithmetic nature of θv is what dictates them actually for example θv is used as an input to estimate etc but the absolute value of θv is not of much relevance in these calculations instead the incremental change in θv or tsw in the root zone is what drives the soil water balance and thus estimation of etc as explained in the methodology a period of roughly a week was considered for implementing the soil water budget the net change in θv or tsw dictates the change in soil moisture storage term δsw of the balance which consequently affects water available for transpiration or evaporation in the soil crop system if a sensor that performed poorly in reporting an accurate θv in the soil profile but reported the same δsw change over time that the profile underwent it would result in true representation of etc during that period this characteristic of soil moisture sensors is commonly utilized in irrigation management extension programs to use relative calibrations as opposed to absolute calibrations in order to use low cost sensors for efficient irrigation managemnent relative calibrations rely on recording change occuring in sensor output with visual response of wet and dry conditions and suffices proper sensor use because the sensor is just comapred to itself and not an independent standard it oriented performance considers whether a soil moisture sensor is capable of reporting an event when the sensor reported θv attains a preset threshold required for irrigation scheduling in this case the sensitivity of the sensor to respond to drying at a rate that matches the rate truly demonstrated by the soil as represented by true np measurements is more important that the absolute value of θv this concept has also been proposed in assessment of satelite soil moisture products in agricultural landscapes champagne et al 2016 they suggested that smos product was better at capturing the relative trends of soil moisture than aquarius product although it did not estimate absolute value to the same accuracy thus the real applications of soil moisture sensors expected by diverse audiences require relative change and rate based data information rather than absolute θv information in the same way as θv cannot be a governing single criterion for sensor selection for several end user applications similarly one end user application cannot alone act as a criterion to dictate sensor selection moreover irrespective of what the targeted metric is and what sensor is used any application of technology in agricultural water management has to be informed by the margin of uncertainty associated with the application and the resources presented here will be useful in this direction although we have ranked the sensors based on their accuracy statistics under each soil type we recommend that the accuracy levels be relied upon to quantitatively evaluate how the use of a certain type of technology can affect assessments of critical agrohydrological variables such as total soil water and evapotranspiration it also cautioned that the objective of the research was to translate θv based sensor assessments into commonly used agricultural water management terms and not to communicate any relative suitability unsuitability of commercial sensors it is also realized that greater statistical power could have been gained by increasing the number of replicates in these experiments as a consequence of limited dataset size and possibility of spatial heterogeneity which is universal in any research relying on spot measurements the findings may be subject to variability outside of sensor accuracy there exist other operational feasibility factors that can influence the desirability of one sensor over another kukal et al 2020 have discussed such factors including cost ease of use and telemetry options in addition to sensor performance accuracy to develop a holistic guide for sensor selection 4 conclusions this research evaluated nine soil moisture sensors for their suitability to estimate critical quantitative metrics that are expected by research users and growers the need for this analyses arises from the facts that 1 accurate estimation of absolute θv by a sensor cannot determine its suitability alone and that several relative aspects of sensor data can be practically useful even when absolute θv estimation is unacceptable and 2 it is preferable to assess errors associated with sensor use in practical metrics used in real applications in addition to θv than θv alone to address this it was proposed that each sensor be evaluated based on its success in accurately reporting three major end user targeted metrics a tsw b etc and c it while tsw and etc are of greater interest to researchers water planners and managers irrigation districts policy decision makers it is the primary intended use of the sensors when employed by growers and other commercial production personnel under two different soil types the sensor performance varied considerably across selected commercial sensors when evaluated for estimating tsw etc and it sensor installation orientation was also investigated as a driver but was found to be statistically insignificant and thus the research questions were limited to horizontally installed sensors commonly employed in research and production settings three major sets of findings of how different sensors perform under each soil type for tsw etc and it estimations were presented a suitability rank of each sensor b the errors associated with each sensor when estimating these quantities and c if s s c s improve the performance of these sensors when compared to f c these resources provide objective direction on which sensor to employ and the uncertainty of assessments relying on these estimations employing soil moisture sensors was shown to be subject to substantial errors in estimation of tsw etc and it as high as 684 mm rmse in tsw in 0 1 20 m soil profile cs616 in silt loam as high as 61 deviation in etc teros 21 in loamy sand and as high as 100 deviation in it no triggers reported at all at the same time certain sensors were able to estimate these quantities accurately under f c tsw was estimated to the accuracy of 18 mm rmse using jd probe in loamy sand etc was perfectly estimated 0 1 deviation using tdr 315 l and sm150 in loamy sand and it was estimated perfectly as well exact number of itref reported using teros 21 in silt loam and tdr 315 l and jd probe in loamy sand soil s s c resulted in improvement in performance with 45 and 17 improvement observed in tsw and etc in silt loam soil respectively and 42 80 and 86 improvement was observed in tsw it and etc in loamy sand soil respectively the only exception where s s c did not result in any improvement was it estimation in silt loam soil to the best of authors knowledge this research is the first to translate traditional θv accuracy assessments into practical and application oriented criteria and use them to evaluate sensors for these specific applications the findings of this research are fairly transferrable given that the experiments were conducted in actual field settings that represented major agricultural land use types row crops and pasture and major soil types silt loam and loamy sand in the region it is recommended that the resources presented herein can be used as effective and more intuitive assessment criteria along with more operationally relevant factors that can influence sensor suitability and desirability declaration of competing interest the authors declare no

10397,impact sprinkler 20py2 is outlet is a single phase water flow and the aeration impact sprinkler 20py2 ais outlet is gas liquid two phase flow the jet dispersing principle of ais is somewhat different from conventional sprinklers and has advantages and the ability to working well at the low pressure condition the experimental study on the droplet size distribution of is and ais was carried out by the volume weighted method to analyze the mean diameter dv median diameter d50 water droplets frequency distribution and the cumulative frequency at different distances from sprinklers similarly the velocity of the drop was measured by laser precipitation monitor lpm and statically analyzed by using a number weighted method the results showed that both the drop diameters dv and d50 increased with the distance from the sprinkler nozzle but decreased with an increase in the working pressure similarly droplet frequency distribution at a diameter 3 5 mm of both sprinklers increased with the working pressure the quantity of larger droplets decreased with an increase in working pressure and this trend amplified with an increase in the distance from the sprinkler nozzle under low pressure 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa and the absence of wind conditions the droplet distribution of the ais was more uniform and constant than the is the droplet s frequency distribution of ais and is nozzles was conformed to a logarithmic normal distribution with the distance from the sprinkler increasing the slope of the droplet cumulative frequency curve decreased gradually under the same pressure and at similar distances from the nozzle the d50 of the 20py2is was less than the 20py2ais and the functional relationship between median diameter working pressure and distance from the sprinkler was established when the pressure was set at 0 15 mpa and 10 m away from the sprinkler the droplet s median diameter was 6 higher under ais than under is at the working pressure of 0 25 mpa the frequency distribution of water droplets under both nozzles was higher and water droplets are more frequent for a different distance from a sprinkler droplet velocity was improved with the decreasing droplet diameter but due to low pressure there was not significantly influenced in velocity the results may deliver a basis for additional efficient exploration of the ais keywords impact sprinkler aeration nozzle drop size distribution frequency distribution droplet velocity kinetic energy 1 introduction the sprinkler irrigation system is globally popular known as a high potential irrigation system with high irrigation efficiency darko et al 2017 schneider 2000 burt et al 1999 for the development of irrigation sprinklers lot of explanations have been applied by researchers for technology expansion to advance irrigation developments from the technical structural and financial point of view liu et al 2016 deboer darrell 2002 keller and bliesner 2000 king and kincaid d 1997 the design of the irrigation sprinklers system is mostly based on complementary hydraulic performance spraying water droplet diameter and flow landing speed they are important indices of spraying performance of the nozzle when the quality of a sprinkler irrigation system is evaluated therefore it is crucial to investigate the distribution law of droplets produced by the nozzle which is significant for soil conservation crop growth moreover the study of droplet velocity and droplet kinetic energy law plays an important role in the evaluation of a sprinkler irrigation system and the prediction of the spraying effect it is suggestively dependent on the velocity distributions and droplet size li and kawano 1996 playán et al 2010 li and kawano 1996 li et al 1994 dadiao and wallender w 1985 similarly the classification of droplets characterization is essential to assess the efficiency and quality of a sprinkler irrigation system sprinkler irrigation typically implies the determination of water droplets diameters when approaching to the soil surface concerning the sprinkler equipment it is mainly related to the type of sprinkler system a different nozzle size and working pressure however water droplets move through the air accompanied by the water loss which includes the evaporation loss and the wind drift loss water losses have normally been empirically connected with the wind due to the impact of the wind speed water loss produced by small droplets were larger than that of the large size droplets sadeghi et al 2015 playán et al 2005 deboer darrell 2002 tarjuelo et al 2000 trimmer w 1987 edling 1985 a modified droplet dynamic model has been used to examine the evaporation loss out of a sprinkler irrigation system yan et al 2010 and droplet classification has been used to investigate the significance of droplet kinetic energy on soil and crop deboer and monnens 2001 kincaid 1996 for many years various types of procedures were used to evaluate the droplet characteristics which is related to pellets created by precipitation such as stain method oil immersion method photographic or optical methods montero et al 2003 sudheer and panda 2000 solomon k et al 1985 kohl r and deboer d 1984 magarvey r 1957 for the approximation of droplets diameter velocity and angle the modern methods have been implemented directly to manipulate from single isolated sprinklers such as low speed photography high speed photography and optical particle tracking velocimetry optv in the absence of wind indoor conditions bautista capetillo et al 2014 bautista capetillo and prado hernández 2011 king and bjorneberg 2010 salvador et al 2009 optical methods count on the advantage of being fully automated in data collection thus permitting fast repeatable drop characterization burguete et al 2007 therefore the distribution of water droplets was studied the models of the water droplet diameter distribution in the whole spraying region including normal distribution logarithmic normal distribution and upper limit logarithmic normal distribution were used to map water droplets of all the sizes moreover these distribution models were associated with nozzle parameters and with the primary droplet size which is formed by the sprinkler these distribution models were required when numerical simulation sprinkler irrigation is performed burillo et al 2013 xu et al 2010 montero et al 2003 kincaid et al 1996 solomon k et al 1985 von bernuth and gilley 1984 since the ultimate effect of sprinkler irrigation was caused by a variety of factors on soil properties but the key parameter determined by the impact force of droplet on the soil that is transferred from the kinetic energy basahi et al 1998 bautista capetillo et al 2012 the kinetic energy carried by droplets may interfere with the infiltration and soil erosion kincaid 1996 the soil runoff rate bulk density of soil surface crust and sediment yield were generally directly proportional to droplet kinetic energy flux density values mohammed and a kohl 1987 thompson and james 1985 studies reported that suitable information on velocity and droplet diameter is mandatory to analyze the kinetic energy of a sprinkler irrigation system and to estimate the performance of irrigation systems under different working situations kincaid 1996 king et al 2010 yan et al 2011 the aeration impact sprinkler ais is an innovative kind of sprinkler with an arm spoon for a constant rotation of sprinkler the ais working condition is based on the two phase flow fluid air water instead of a commonly used single phase water only impact sprinkler the idea of designing ais comes from the structure of aerated liquid pressure atomizers studied in firefighting the existing research shows that a better atomization effect could be obtained even a small amount of gas is introduced in the water jet the rotating principle of the ais is stationary rotated step by step and reversed therefore it is different from other types of sprinklers and has different droplet characteristics the droplets diameter of ais was measured and compared with is by xiang et al 2016 the results revealed that the applied water depth is improved at the middle range of jet and the peak value is reduced at the end of the jet when the sprinkler was working under lower pressure the suction capability of ais was experimentally studied by xiang et al 2018 information on the droplet size and velocity distributions of the ais remains limited this study mainly focuses on the mean diameter dv median diameters d50 frequency distribution cumulative volume distribution and effect of drop size on velocity distribution characteristics and kinetic energy distribution law additionally this study proposed a droplet distribution model for the ais on the basis under different working pressures and different distances from the sprinkler head 2 methodology 2 1 principal structure and application of newly designed ais for the execution of the aeration function in jet flow different types of methods were applied the first method was the active gas supply form with the pushing pressures which is common in the aeration equipment the second method was the entraining air form of the coaxial jet mixing jet used in the cavitation jet liu and zhu 1993 furthermore the liquid phase was jetted into the second nozzle from the first nozzle and then the gas liquid two phase flow was produced and spray out from the second nozzle the form of negative suction based on the venturi principle was the third method this method was simple and the inspiration capacity was connected with the conversion degree of pressure energy to kinetic energy for the liquid phase in this paper an aeration suction pipe was added in the existing impact sprinkler as shown in fig 1 the tube of impact sprinkler was collapsible and the front end of the tube was provided with a nozzle to accelerate the water before spraying out the inserted gas suction pipe was coaxial with the tube and the outer end of the gas suction pipe was connected with the environmental atmosphere the air would be entrained into the nozzle and sprayed out due to the viscous effect of liquid when the water flow bypass the gas suction pipe the pressure in the inner end of the gas suction pipe would be less than atmospheric pressure and the airflow would be continuous due to the presence of pressure difference finally the gas water two phase flow would be sprayed out from the nozzle in this structural form the quantity of entrained air was determined by the insertion depth of the gas suction pipe the inner diameter of the pipe and the working pressure water droplet distribution of the newly designed ais and the original is were measured under the working pressures of 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa among which 0 25 mpa was the normal working pressure for 20py2 is whereas 0 2 mpa and 0 15 mpa were the irregular low pressure condition gb t2299 2008 2008 2 2 measurement principle of laser raindrop spectrometer adolf thies clima laser precipitation monitor atclpm manufactured by gmbh co kg gottingen is a new generation precision probe for measuring ground precipitation particles as shown in fig 2 the laser raindrop spectrometer is the source of laser which emits a set of parallel beams passing through the photoelectric node at the receiving end the tube measures the light intensity and converts into an electrical signal to measure the water droplet information the working principle of atclpm is described in detail by king and bjorneberg 2010 during the experiments continuous measurements were taken as the droplets emitted by the sprinkler fell through the laser beam bautista capetillo et al 2009 the controlled operation storage circuit was used to calculate the size and dropping rate of water droplets the laser raindrop spectrometer can also accumulate the measured droplet volume to calculate the droplet volume distribution and carry out the necessary analysis such as obtaining the water droplet spectrum map water droplet spectra could provide the water droplet size range droplet velocity range and the corresponding number of particles the measurement range for droplet size was from 0 125 mm 8 5 mm which was divided into 24 diameter classes and that for particle velocity was from 0 2 ms 1 20 0 ms 1 with a total of 21 velocity classes the minimum and maximum measuring limits of precipitation intensity were 0 005 mmh 1 and 250 00 mmh 1 respectively king et al 2009 atclpm has the advantage of convenient processing data real time monitoring and simultaneous measurement of water droplet velocity and diameter compared with the conventional color spot method and flour method for measuring water droplet diameter bai and yan 2011 li et al 2005 xu et al 2004 2 3 experimental procedure and data processing in this research a newly designed aeration impact sprinkler and existing impact sprinkler were used the experimental test was carried out in the wind free hall of the research center of fluid machinery and technology jiangsu university two sprinklers were fixed at the same elevation of 1 4 m above the ground level the nozzle for the is and ais were in round shape with a diameter of 7 mm and 8 3 mm respectively which made the two sprinklers have nearly the same flow rate under the same working pressure the flow rates measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter for both sprinklers at three pressures were 12 3 13 3 and 15 9 m3 h 1 respectively with an accuracy tolerance of 0 5 the time duration of each operation was set at 10 minutes the water droplet test had been carried out at a distance of 2 m 18 m from the nozzle with an interval of 2 m and the measurements were replicated four times per point under each pressure 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa at the range of 4 m to 6 m droplets emitted from the main jet and created by the movement of impact arm analyzed together at a distance of 8 m from the sprinkler both groups of drops arrived separately at the observation point and only drops emitted by the main jet were characterized at further distances only drops resulting from the main jet were characterized the nozzle pressure was measured by precision pressure gauges at an accuracy tolerance of 0 4 during the experiments a large amount of data was continually collected through lpm it is noted that the dimension errors caused by coincidence errors and edge effects could not be omitted edge effects were caused by the relationship between the diameter of the sprayed water droplets and the landing velocity of sprayed water droplets coincidence errors happened when two droplets instantaneously passed through the laser beam and project overlapping shadows on the photo detectors the number of particles corresponding to velocity values of each diameter level was eliminated if less than 15 drops otherwise the data were statistically tested for the random error of normal distribution by using the 3σ principal wang et al 2011 the volume weighting method was used to calculate the average diameter of water droplets at any measuring point as this method has been proved to be suitable for the actual situation by some studies 2 4 basic droplet statistics significance and distribution the liquid atomizer is the fundamental procedure to improve the bulk water into the groups of small droplets impact sprinkler was used as an atomizer handling the huge amount of datasets collected from lpm required a statistical approach for numerous parameters similarly the evaluation and comparison of the spray properties required qualitative and necessary information although it is suitable to classify the sets by reducing the number of parameters such as the droplet diameter d mm arithmetic mean diameter d mm drop volume mean diameter dv mm volume median diameter d50 mm drop standard deviation sdd mm and droplet coefficient of variation cvd were calculated based on the droplet size data to obtain the significance and scattering seginer 1963 the droplet diameter quantity is known as the ratio of water droplets comparative to the entire value of drops the droplet collective volume frequency is the ratio of diameter water droplets less than a specified size relative to the total volume of drops similarly d50 is described as the diameter that resembles 50 of the total collective volume frequency the parameters d eq 1 dv eq 2 as well as d50 and rv eq 3 were computed in this study where rv is the ratio between dv and d50 two other parameters were also determined the arithmetic means velocity v ms 1 by eq 4 and kinetic energy ekr j cm 2 min 1 by eq 5 1 d i 1 n n i ⅆ i i 1 n n i 2 d v i 1 24 n i ⅆ i 4 i 1 24 n i d i 3 3

droplet diameter distribution histograms are presented in figs 3 and 4 the volumetric mean diameter dv and median diameter d50 of water droplets generated by the ais and is sprinklers are plotted against the distance from the sprinkler at the working pressures of 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa under a fixed pressure as the distance from the nozzle increases dv and d50 increases gradually similarly at the same distance the diameter of the water droplet and the slope of the curve decreased gradually with the increase in pressure this indicates that the increasing trend of raindrop diameter decreases along the radial direction it can also be observed that this change is small up to of 6 m from the sprinkler but increases with the distance beyond the 6 m and at locations 8 m and 14 m from the sprinkler the droplet diameter from the ais is varied by 2 14 and 10 53 respectively compared that from the is at the pressure 0 25 mpa the volume means diameter and median diameter relationship between aeration and impact nozzle under different three pressures are illustrated in fig 5 the relative value rv is computed using eq 3 when the distance is farther from the nozzle the difference between d50 and dv can be reduced by increasing the working pressure as compared to ais is at a working pressure of 0 25 mpa results in a larger wetted radius and forms several additional coarse droplets at locations far from the sprinkler according to eq 3 the reduction in rv indicates that d50 approaches dv fig 5 clearly shows that the curve difference of rv value for ais under low pressure of 0 15 mpa is very low it explains that far from the nozzle ais sprinkler produces very low coarse droplets compared to is furthermore the reduction of rv to zero levels means that the difference between d50 and dv is very low to determine the distribution law of d50 and dv two simple regression models are identified to predict the statically fitting functions of d50 and dv for both nozzle types the distance from the nozzle and working pressure for ais and is the correlations are presented as eqs 8 9 8 d v 0 29 1 8 d 0 90 p 0 68 e 0 21 l r 2 89 55 9 d 50 0 251 0 91 d 1 72 p 0 83 e 0 21 l r 2 91 8 where d nozzle diameter mm p the working pressure mpa l distance from the sprinkler m 3 2 radial frequency distribution of water droplets under different pressures in this study the volume weighting method is used for the calculation of water droplet frequency the volumetric droplet frequency histograms of ais and is are presented in fig 6 a the spray droplet diameters in the irrigation area are ranged from 0 125 mm 8 5 mm under the three different pressures the frequency distribution of droplets with given diameter d is denoted as pd when the working pressure increased pd 3 5 mm it also increased at the same time the number of coarse droplets decreased for each sprinkler the value pd 3 5 mm at 0 25 mpa both ais and is were improved and more significant than other working pressures under the low pressure like 0 15 mpa and 0 2 mpa the is nozzle droplet frequencies decreased it can be illustrated from fig 6 a that the diameter distribution of water droplets is strongly related to the working pressure in ais the frequency for water droplets of diameter less than 3 mm increases significantly and that larger than 3 5 mm decreases significantly than is the increased frequency of smaller water droplets implies a better atomization effect also with the increase of pressure the difference of droplet diameter distribution decreases gradually and the difference of droplet diameter between the measuring points at pressure p 0 25 mpa is small when the pressure is 0 25 mpa the main range of droplet diameter at the distance of 1m 8 m from the nozzle is 0 25 mm 3 00 mm while water droplets larger than 3 mm in diameter are mainly distributed over the distance of 10 m 18 m from the spray as the distance from the nozzle increases the smaller droplet diameter frequency decreases and the frequency of large diameter water droplets increases gradually in is more than ais droplets with the largest diameter are found at the end of the water thrown pressure had a small effect on the water droplet diameter near the nozzle while pressure had a higher effect farther away from the nozzle when the pressure increases the difference between the water droplet diameter distributions at the distance of 3m 9 m from the nozzle becomes smaller it can also be observed from fig 6 a that the longer the distance from the sprinkler the larger the diameter of the peaks under the effect of inertial and gravitational forces over the same interval of time fine droplet particles endure greater braking than coarse particles when droplets are emitted by a nozzle fine drops always deposit closer to the sprinkler than coarse drops similarly it was consistent with the effect of working pressure on the distribution of water droplet diameter with the increase of nozzle pressure the frequency of smaller water droplets increases obviously the fine water droplets with small diameter ranged from 0 6 mm to 0 3 mm are easy to produce drift phenomenon and evaporation loss leading to higher and more serious the evaporation rate and lower the spraying efficiency bai and yan 2011 edling 1985 yan et al 2011 generally mean droplet sizes from both ais and is nozzles were related to each other at a given distance from the sprinkler but a large amount of finest drops created from the is which is smaller than the increase rate of the minimum droplet size diameter when the greater droplet diameter declined the droplet sizes of ais was more enhanced and larger than the cumulative rate of the smallest droplet size it is known that the larger the diameter of sprayed water droplets the higher the destructive impact on soil surface structure which is not favorable to soil and water conservation and crop growth wu et al 2012 it means that ais may be more useful to minimize evaporation and wind drift losses while preventing damage to the soil from fig 6 b it can be seen that the main diameter distribution ranges of water droplets for ais and is are 0 125 mm 6 5 mm and 0 125 mm 8 mm respectively in other words the water droplet distribution range of is is larger than that of ais from the fig 6 b at the starting measured position although the droplet frequency curve intertwined similarly when the droplet diameter is fixed at 2 mm and the working pressure increases from 0 15 mpa to 0 25 mpa the water droplets frequency for both sprinklers is successively increased when the drop diameter 3 5 mm at the pressure of 0 25 mpa the ais frequency curve consistently reduces whereas the is curve slope is intertwined the water droplet frequency of ais is generally smaller than that of is at 4 mm droplet diameter moreover the diameter distribution of different water droplets of ais is more uniform than that of is especially at 0 25 mpa ais has a greater amount of water droplets with a diameter of less than 3 mm with more significant inclination than is it is considered suitable for spraying water droplets with a diameter range of 1 mm 3 5 mm when the working pressures are 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa based on fig 6 b the frequency of the entire spraying area for ais recorded is at 1 mm as 34 4 35 6 and 40 2 for 2 mm as 66 3 71 2 and 75 7 and for 3 5 mm as 85 5 89 6 and 96 2 the corresponding value for is is at 1 mm as 35 8 36 3 and 40 5 for 2 mm as 60 4 66 36 and 69 2 and for 3 5 mm as 86 2 84 2 and 87 5 respectively additionally when the working pressure is kept at 0 25 mpa water droplets with diameter 1 mm 3 5 mm in the spraying area is more frequent for different distance from the sprinkler fig 7 shows a comparison chart of the two kinds of nozzles in terms of the frequency distribution of water droplets at different measuring points from 4 m 8 m 12 m 14 m and 18 m under 0 25 mpa the distance of 4 m from the nozzle covers the starting position distance from 8 m to 14 m covers the middle position of water throws and 18 m covers the end position from the sprinkler it is clear from fig 7 at near and middle distances from ais the relation between frequency distribution and drops diameter is slightly larger and better than that from is the frequency distribution laws of water droplet diameter for both nozzles are in good agreement with a logarithmic normal distribution the droplet frequency for different pressure values and different distances from the nozzle is fitted using matlab and the model parameters presented in table 1 and the formula of the logarithmic normal distribution function in eq 10 10 y y o a 2 π w x e ln x x c 2 2 w 2 where x is the water droplet diameter mm y is the water droplet distribution function yo is the minimum frequency value xc is the water droplet diameter corresponding to the cumulative frequency maximum mm w and a are the fitting coefficients 3 3 cumulative frequency distribution of water droplet under different distance and pressures the cumulative frequency of water droplets at different distances and pressures from the nozzle is presented in fig 8 a the curve slope of the nearest distance from ais is more significant than that from is and the slope of the curve decreases gradually with the increase of distance from the nozzle at the same pressure which is similar to previous results kincaid et al 1996 king and bjorneberg 2010 zhu et al 2015 the increase in pressure at the same distance causes the slope of the curve to increase slowly furthermore graphical representation also indicates that the closer the distance from the nozzle the more significant the volume fraction of the small diameter droplet the results also suggest that along the radial direction the quantity of large diameter water droplets increases gradually with the increase of the distance from the nozzle with the increase in pressure the cumulative frequency curve slope of water droplets at different distances from the nozzle gradually decreases this indicates that the number of water droplets with a smaller diameter increases with the increasing pressure another trend is that the water droplet diameter increases along the radial direction and decreases with increasing pressure pressure on the cumulative frequency distribution of droplet diameter of is is significant with the increase of pressure the difference between the curve slope at each measuring point decreases and the slope of the cumulative frequency curve of water droplets at the same distance from the nozzle increases for the is when the pressure is higher than the 0 15 mpa at the end of the wetted radius the change of curve for the cumulative frequency of water droplets rises slowly furthermore under the same pressure the cumulative frequency of water droplets from ais changes more evenly with the increase of pressure and distance relative to is as can be seen in fig 8 b ais exhibits better results than is at pressures 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa the water droplets diameter along the radial distribution is more uniform in ais the average droplet diameters ranged from 0 mm to 3 5 mm for ais and 0 mm to 4 5 mm for is are recorded at a level of 90 cumulative frequency the cumulative frequency distribution of recorded for ais is under 1 mm as 39 58 and 76 under 2 mm 65 75 and 90 under 3 5 mm 83 90 and 92 the corresponding value for is is under 1 mm 34 39 and 48 under 2 mm 60 68 and 73 under 3 5 mm 77 86 and 88 at pressure 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa 0 25 mpa respectively the comparison of droplet size distributions shows that ais generates fine drop while is creates bigger drops with diameter ranged about 5 5 mm at the middle position these output consequences are similar to those achieved by previous scholars who used different kinds of sprinklers al araki 2002 dadiao andwallender w 1985 issaka et al 2018 at the most distances from the sprinkler the number of droplets with a smaller diameter is greater compared to that with a larger diameter this is supportive of the hypothesis that droplet formation is a constant procedure on the jet track liu et al 2016 lu and cheng 2018 zhu et al 2018 the exponential distribution function is used to describe and compare the cumulative frequency distribution of water droplets in conventional sprinklers moreover a method is provided to estimate the parameters for a given sprinkler type nozzle size and pressure head solomon k et al 1985 von bernuth and gilley 1984 similarly for both is and ais sprinklers the exponential distribution function is used as eq 11 in equation 11 l is the length value which corresponds to the water droplet diameter corresponding to the cumulative frequency of water droplets that is always replaced by d50 in eq 9 the boltzmann distribution model is also applied to fit the droplet cumulative frequency distribution of is and ais through eq 12 11 f x 1 e a x l n 12 f x q 1 q 2 1 e d x c d x q 2 where a and n are dimensionless exponents and α 0 n 0 q1 is the starting point line value q2 is the finish line value xc is the center point of the diameter values dx is the droplet diameter constant the fitted results of both sprinklers at different distances from the sprinkler are calculated by using simple matlab and graphically presented by microsoft excel software at pressure 0 25 mpa as can be seen from table 2 single phase spraying nozzle and the gas liquid two phase nozzle have the diameter distribution of water droplets which is better fitted with an exponential function at a given distance far from the nozzle ais has a higher fitting coefficient than is however at distances of 4 and 8 m from the nozzle the fitting functions and r2 values of ais are 0 6 and 0 7 and 8 and 12 higher than is far from the nozzle at a distance of 14 m to 18 m on the contrary the fitting functions and correlation coefficient value of is are 1 and 1 05 and r2 values 1 and 2 better than that of ais the results show that when the distance from the nozzle is closer the exponential distribution function of ais has a higher fitting and water droplet diameter than is table 3 shows the percentage of droplets with a cumulative mean diameter for ais and is at different working pressures diameters d10 d25 d50 d75 and d90 represent the diameters corresponding to 10 25 50 75 and 90 respectively it can be observed that for both the nozzle sizes the droplet sizes increase with an increasing percentage of droplet diameters in the research almost 20 of drops are identical at every distance from ais than is 4 distribution law of water droplet velocity under different pressure spray water droplet velocity is an important parameter to determine water droplet kinetic energy the test measured the different velocity at different points through a laser precipitation monitor in a previous study relationship between velocity and distance from the nozzle at different pressure was analyzed zhu et al 2015 the authors reported that the velocity of three sprinklers at different pressures at a velocity range from 0 ms 1 6 3 ms 1 for distances exceeding 10 m with the mean drop diameter ranges from 0 mm to 4 mm respectively furthermore bautista capetillo et al 2014 have adopted a nonlinear equation for the statistical analysis of the droplet velocities and significant differences among different measurements 13 v a b ln d where v is the droplet velocity ms 1 a and b are regression coefficients eq 13 provides an excellent overall fit to droplet diameter and velocities measured by photographically bautista capetillo et al 2014 salvador et al 2009 the sum of the squares reduction test sas 2007 was used for the nonlinear regression and significance of coefficient a and b fig 9 shows that the velocity of the droplets is more variable than droplets diameter at each considering distance with pressure 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa especially in single phase liquid impact sprinkler the mean measured velocities in ais and is increase with the droplet diameter the results display that in ais and is water droplet velocity increases by different distances of the nozzle under working pressures of 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa there is an excellent logarithmic relationship between the velocity of water droplets and the diameter of water droplets therefore the logarithmic function model can better describe the water droplet velocity and water droplet diameter the velocity of water droplets less than 3 5 mm in diameter is more affected by the pressure from fig 9 at low pressure the differences for fine droplets 3 5 mm are reduced than those for coarse droplets 3 5 mm hence the working pressure does not influence the velocity of fine droplets so the phenomenon happens because fine droplets are entered around the path of coarse droplets and carried further and their velocity closely related to the jet velocities moreover the relationship between small droplet diameter and velocity is consistent with the logarithmic function model however the correlation coefficient values for ais and is recorded are 95 and 85 respectively similarly from fig 10 the relationship between both sprinklers at pressure 0 25 mpa shows a better velocity fitting curve concerning drop diameter 1 mm with a logarithmic function model and the correlation regression values of 97 and 94 are recorded drop diameter and aerodynamic drag are the main cause of the reduction of velocity slop fine and minimum size drops were found everywhere at any point but a large number of fine drops are deposited near the sprinkler nozzle smaller droplets can be observed in the final vertical trajectory while coarse droplets are usually detected at distal points the trajectory path continues a considerable parallel component throughout irrigation fragmentation of coarse droplets from the main area of spraying plum in flight trajectory slightly more than the sprinkler king and bjorneberg 2010 furthermore due to the increase of pressure velocity consequence on the diameter of water droplets increased at a distance of 6 m to 10 m from the sprinkler from fig 10 it can be observed that water droplet velocity gradually increases reaching the maximum value at the maximum droplet diameter far from the sprinkler the results indicate that the water droplet diameter is an essential factor for determining the velocity of water droplets therefore the logarithmic relation between the velocity and distance from a sprinkler can be obtained by the following relationship 14 v 0 392 2 79 ln d 1 103 r 2 0 97 to study the overall effect of working pressure on the water droplet velocity of both nozzles the velocity of water droplets under each working pressure is at a significant level of 5 the variance analysis is carried out and the calculated value of p is 0 507 which indicates that the effect of working pressure on the velocity of water droplets is small most of the small droplets formed in ais is related to the innovative structure of ais consequently working pressure has little effect on droplet velocity from fig 11 the mean droplet velocities for ais range from 0 ms 1 to 6 8 ms 1 as a consequence droplets under 1 ms 1 has a frequency of 25 24 and 21 under 4 ms 1 of 4 5 and 7 under 6 ms 1 of 3 2 and 4 for pressures of 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa respectively in comparison the mean droplet velocities for is ranged from 0ms 1 to 6 8 ms 1droplets under 1 ms 1 recorded has a frequency percentage of 23 17 and 17 under 4 ms 1 of 4 8 and 8 and under 6 ms 1of 1 2 and 4 for pressures of 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa respectively the relationship between velocity and frequency of water droplets in fig 11 shows that the maximum frequency is obtained at a velocity of 1 ms 1 at both combinations the frequency distribution curve slop is continually reduced in ais while in is it is slightly increased at the velocity of drops 3ms 1 statistical parameters for droplet diameter and velocity obtained for different working pressures are presented in table 4 the parameters include the arithmetic mean standard deviation coefficient of variation the volumetric mean diameter median diameter droplets velocity standard velocity deviation and velocity coefficient of variation for both kinds of nozzles there is an overall reduction in mean droplet diameter with an increase in working pressure for ais the standard deviation of droplet diameter ranges from 1 05 mm to 0 94 mm with a mean value of 0 99 mm and the coefficient in diameter variation ranges from 119 to 132 with a mean value of 126 6 for is the standard deviation in droplet diameters ranges from 0 92 mm to 0 77 mm with a mean value of 0 77 mm while the coefficients in diameter variation range from 118 to 115 with a mean value of 105 33 similarly the velocity of ais under high droplet frequency is lower than is under each working pressure the standard velocity deviation parameter of ais ranges from 1 42 ms 1 to 1 41 ms 1 with the mean value of 1 36 ms 1 while that of is ranges from 1 35 ms 1 to 2 2 ms 1 with the mean value of 1 62 ms 1 4 1 radial distribution of water droplet kinetic energy under different pressures radial distribution of the kinetic energy denoted by ek for both nozzles along the radial surface under the working pressures of 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa is plotted in fig 12 generally atclpm provides a lower estimate of droplet kinetic energy and could measure the more substantial proportion of smaller droplets as the distance from the nozzle increases due to the increase of water droplet diameter and water droplet velocity the kinetic energy of droplet increases gradually until reaching a maximum at level 80 of the wetting radius sprinkler impact arm is the leading cause of breaking water jet in the shape of droplets from the surface of the jet into the air it also happened because flying water lumps as surrounded by the inertial force viscous force gravity action and surface tension under the joint action of continuous aeration split a large number of droplets the diameter and velocity of water droplets produced a higher frequency in the central area of the jet hence the frequency of small droplet diameter decreases gradually with the increase of droplet diameter from the distance of the nozzle therefore the farther away from the nozzle the larger the diameter of water droplets with the higher kinetic energy of the water droplets to further study the observed relationship between the kinetic energy of water droplets and the distance from the nozzle the regression analysis of the test data can be obtained by eq 15 15 e k e k o k e x p α x where x is the distance from the nozzle m k α ek0 is the fitting coefficient the values of correlation coefficients under different pressures are shown in table 5 the drop in kinetic energy does not differ too much at the three working pressures 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa the results show that the correlation coefficient of water droplet kinetic energy using the exponential function model is better than that of the radial distribution model the correlation coefficient is above 80 85 and the kinetic energy of water droplet decreases gradually with the increase of pressure the influence of pressure on the kinetic energy near the water droplet increases with the increase of the distance from the nozzle as the pressure increases the kinetic energy decreases gradually and the pressure exerts less effect on the kinetic energy of the adjacent droplets similarly the influence of pressure on the kinetic energy of water droplets increases gradually with the distance from the nozzle when the sprinkler works at a low pressure of 0 15 mpa the kinetic energy slop at a distance of 10 m from is increases 17 more than that from ais furthermore under the pressure of 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa the curve difference in ais recorded is much lower than that in is therefore the appropriate reduction of the working pressure of ais can effectively reduce the anti kinetic energy of spraying water droplets and hence reduces the soil erosion and damage to soil structure to maintain soil and water 5 conclusion the ais that contains two phase fluid inlets air water has different performance features from those of conventional one phase water sprinklers the droplet characteristics droplet diameter velocity and kinetic energy were measured using an atclpm the following conclusions can be obtained from the analysis 1 the diameter of the water droplets is distributed exponentially along the radial direction the effect of working pressure on dv and d50 increases with the cumulative distance from the nozzle as indicated by the mean droplet diameter model and the medium droplet diameter model these model correlation coefficients can reach a higher level of 0 9 under low pressure the water droplet distribution range of is is a bit wider than of ais under different pressures 2 the logarithmic normal distribution model is developed to illustrate the frequency distribution laws for the two kinds of sprinklers ais has a higher frequency distribution than is i e 96 vs 87 at a working pressure of 0 25 mpa for both sprinklers the droplet distribution in logarithmic normal distribution increases by an average value of 7 compared to the exponential distribution function the water droplet distribution of ais is more continuous and uniform than that of is under different pressures 3 the relationship between small droplet diameter and velocity is consistent with the logarithmic function model and the distribution accuracy calculated for both sprinklers is 95 and 85 respectively the working pressure has a small effect on the relationship between the diameter and the velocity of water droplets 4 the exponential function model better fits the radial distribution of the kinetic energy of water droplets the kinetic energy of the water droplets increases with the drop diameter and the distance from the nozzle ais produces a 17 lower kinetic energy slop than is under low pressure of 0 15 mpa declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgment this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant

10397,impact sprinkler 20py2 is outlet is a single phase water flow and the aeration impact sprinkler 20py2 ais outlet is gas liquid two phase flow the jet dispersing principle of ais is somewhat different from conventional sprinklers and has advantages and the ability to working well at the low pressure condition the experimental study on the droplet size distribution of is and ais was carried out by the volume weighted method to analyze the mean diameter dv median diameter d50 water droplets frequency distribution and the cumulative frequency at different distances from sprinklers similarly the velocity of the drop was measured by laser precipitation monitor lpm and statically analyzed by using a number weighted method the results showed that both the drop diameters dv and d50 increased with the distance from the sprinkler nozzle but decreased with an increase in the working pressure similarly droplet frequency distribution at a diameter 3 5 mm of both sprinklers increased with the working pressure the quantity of larger droplets decreased with an increase in working pressure and this trend amplified with an increase in the distance from the sprinkler nozzle under low pressure 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa and the absence of wind conditions the droplet distribution of the ais was more uniform and constant than the is the droplet s frequency distribution of ais and is nozzles was conformed to a logarithmic normal distribution with the distance from the sprinkler increasing the slope of the droplet cumulative frequency curve decreased gradually under the same pressure and at similar distances from the nozzle the d50 of the 20py2is was less than the 20py2ais and the functional relationship between median diameter working pressure and distance from the sprinkler was established when the pressure was set at 0 15 mpa and 10 m away from the sprinkler the droplet s median diameter was 6 higher under ais than under is at the working pressure of 0 25 mpa the frequency distribution of water droplets under both nozzles was higher and water droplets are more frequent for a different distance from a sprinkler droplet velocity was improved with the decreasing droplet diameter but due to low pressure there was not significantly influenced in velocity the results may deliver a basis for additional efficient exploration of the ais keywords impact

technology expansion to advance irrigation developments from the technical structural and financial point of view liu et al 2016 deboer darrell 2002 keller and bliesner 2000 king and kincaid d 1997 the design of the irrigation sprinklers system is mostly based on complementary hydraulic performance spraying water droplet diameter and flow landing speed they are important indices of spraying performance of the nozzle when the quality of a sprinkler irrigation system is evaluated therefore it is crucial to investigate the distribution law of droplets produced by the nozzle which is significant for soil conservation crop growth moreover the study of droplet velocity and droplet kinetic energy law plays an important role in the evaluation of a sprinkler irrigation system and the prediction of the spraying effect it is suggestively dependent on the velocity distributions and droplet size li and kawano 1996 playán et al 2010 li and kawano 1996 li et al 1994 dadiao and wallender w 1985 similarly the classification of droplets characterization is essential to assess the efficiency and quality of a sprinkler irrigation system sprinkler irrigation typically implies the determination of water droplets diameters when approaching to the soil surface concerning the sprinkler equipment it is mainly related to the type of sprinkler system a different nozzle size and working pressure however water droplets move through the air accompanied by the water loss which includes the evaporation loss and the wind drift loss water losses have normally been empirically connected with the wind due to the impact of the wind speed water loss produced by small droplets were larger than that of the large size droplets sadeghi et al 2015 playán et al 2005 deboer darrell 2002 tarjuelo et al 2000 trimmer w 1987 edling 1985 a modified droplet dynamic model has been used to examine the evaporation loss out of a sprinkler irrigation system yan et al 2010 and droplet classification has been used to investigate the significance of droplet kinetic energy on soil and crop deboer and monnens 2001 kincaid 1996 for many years various types of procedures were used to evaluate the droplet characteristics which is related to pellets created by precipitation such as stain method oil immersion method photographic or optical methods montero et al 2003 sudheer and panda 2000 solomon k et al 1985 kohl r and deboer d 1984 magarvey r 1957 for the approximation of droplets diameter velocity and angle the modern methods have been implemented directly to manipulate from single isolated sprinklers such as low speed photography high speed photography and optical particle tracking velocimetry optv in the absence of wind indoor conditions bautista capetillo et al 2014 bautista capetillo and prado hernández 2011 king and bjorneberg 2010 salvador et al 2009 optical methods count on the advantage of being fully automated in data collection thus permitting fast repeatable drop characterization burguete et al 2007 therefore the distribution of water droplets was studied the models of the water droplet diameter distribution in the whole spraying region including normal distribution logarithmic normal distribution and upper limit logarithmic normal distribution were used to map water droplets of all the sizes moreover these distribution models were associated with nozzle parameters and with the primary droplet size which is formed by the sprinkler these distribution models were required when numerical simulation sprinkler irrigation is performed burillo et al 2013 xu et al 2010 montero et al 2003 kincaid et al 1996 solomon k et al 1985 von bernuth and gilley 1984 since the ultimate effect of sprinkler irrigation was caused by a variety of factors on soil properties but the key parameter determined by the impact force of droplet on the soil that is transferred from the kinetic energy basahi et al 1998 bautista capetillo et al 2012 the kinetic energy carried by droplets may interfere with the infiltration and soil erosion kincaid 1996 the soil runoff rate bulk density of soil surface crust and sediment yield were generally directly proportional to droplet kinetic energy flux density values mohammed and a kohl 1987 thompson and james 1985 studies reported that suitable information on velocity and droplet diameter is mandatory to analyze the kinetic energy of a sprinkler irrigation system and to estimate the performance of irrigation systems under different working situations kincaid 1996 king et al 2010 yan et al 2011 the aeration impact sprinkler ais is an innovative kind of sprinkler with an arm spoon for a constant rotation of sprinkler the ais working condition is based on the two phase flow fluid air water instead of a commonly used single phase water only impact sprinkler the idea of designing ais comes from the structure of aerated liquid pressure atomizers studied in firefighting the existing research shows that a better atomization effect could be obtained even a small amount of gas is introduced in the water jet the rotating principle of the ais is stationary rotated step by step and reversed therefore it is different from other types of sprinklers and has different droplet characteristics the droplets diameter of ais was measured and compared with is by xiang et al 2016 the results revealed that the applied water depth is improved at the middle range of jet and the peak value is reduced at the end of the jet when the sprinkler was working under lower pressure the suction capability of ais was experimentally studied by xiang et al 2018 information on the droplet size and velocity distributions of the ais remains limited this study mainly focuses on the mean diameter dv median diameters d50 frequency distribution cumulative volume distribution and effect of drop size on velocity distribution characteristics and kinetic energy distribution law additionally this study proposed a droplet distribution model for the ais on the basis under different working pressures and different distances from the sprinkler head 2 methodology 2 1 principal structure and application of newly designed ais for the execution of the aeration function in jet flow different types of methods were applied the first method was the active gas supply form with the pushing pressures which is common in the aeration equipment the second method was the entraining air form of the coaxial jet mixing jet used in the cavitation jet liu and zhu 1993 furthermore the liquid phase was jetted into the second nozzle from the first nozzle and then the gas liquid two phase flow was produced and spray out from the second nozzle the form of negative suction based on the venturi principle was the third method this method was simple and the inspiration capacity was connected with the conversion degree of pressure energy to kinetic energy for the liquid phase in this paper an aeration suction pipe was added in the existing impact sprinkler as shown in fig 1 the tube of impact sprinkler was collapsible and the front end of the tube was provided with a nozzle to accelerate the water before spraying out the inserted gas suction pipe was coaxial with the tube and the outer end of the gas suction pipe was connected with the environmental atmosphere the air would be entrained into the nozzle and sprayed out due to the viscous effect of liquid when the water flow bypass the gas suction pipe the pressure in the inner end of the gas suction pipe would be less than atmospheric pressure and the airflow would be continuous due to the presence of pressure difference finally the gas water two phase flow would be sprayed out from the nozzle in this structural form the quantity of entrained air was determined by the insertion depth of the gas suction pipe the inner diameter of the pipe and the working pressure water droplet distribution of the newly designed ais and the original is were measured under the working pressures of 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa among which 0 25 mpa was the normal working pressure for 20py2 is whereas 0 2 mpa and 0 15 mpa were the irregular low pressure condition gb t2299 2008 2008 2 2 measurement principle of laser raindrop spectrometer adolf thies clima laser precipitation monitor atclpm manufactured by gmbh co kg gottingen is a new generation precision probe for measuring ground precipitation particles as shown in fig 2 the laser raindrop spectrometer is the source of laser which emits a set of parallel beams passing through the photoelectric node at the receiving end the tube measures the light intensity and converts into an electrical signal to measure the water droplet information the working principle of atclpm is described in detail by king and bjorneberg 2010 during the experiments continuous measurements were taken as the droplets emitted by the sprinkler fell through the laser beam bautista capetillo et al 2009 the controlled operation storage circuit was used to calculate the size and dropping rate of water droplets the laser raindrop spectrometer can also accumulate the measured droplet volume to calculate the droplet volume distribution and carry out the necessary analysis such as obtaining the water droplet spectrum map water droplet spectra could provide the water droplet size range droplet velocity range and the corresponding number of particles the measurement range for droplet size was from 0 125 mm 8 5 mm which was divided into 24 diameter classes and that for particle velocity was from 0 2 ms 1 20 0 ms 1 with a total of 21 velocity classes the minimum and maximum measuring limits of precipitation intensity were 0 005 mmh 1 and 250 00 mmh 1 respectively king et al 2009 atclpm has the advantage of convenient processing data real time monitoring and simultaneous measurement of water droplet velocity and diameter compared with the conventional color spot method and flour method for measuring water droplet diameter bai and yan 2011 li et al 2005 xu et al 2004 2 3 experimental procedure and data processing in this research a newly designed aeration impact sprinkler and existing impact sprinkler were used the experimental test was carried out in the wind free hall of the research center of fluid machinery and technology jiangsu university two sprinklers were fixed at the same elevation of 1 4 m above the ground level the nozzle for the is and ais were in round shape with a diameter of 7 mm and 8 3 mm respectively which made the two sprinklers have nearly the same flow rate under the same working pressure the flow rates measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter for both sprinklers at three pressures were 12 3 13 3 and 15 9 m3 h 1 respectively with an accuracy tolerance of 0 5 the time duration of each operation was set at 10 minutes the water droplet test had been carried out at a distance of 2 m 18 m from the nozzle with an interval of 2 m and the measurements were replicated four times per point under each pressure 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa at the range of 4 m to 6 m droplets emitted from the main jet and created by the movement of impact arm analyzed together at a distance of 8 m from the sprinkler both groups of drops arrived separately at the observation point and only drops emitted by the main jet were characterized at further distances only drops resulting from the main jet were characterized the nozzle pressure was measured by precision pressure gauges at an accuracy tolerance of 0 4 during the experiments a large amount of data was continually collected through lpm it is noted that the dimension errors caused by coincidence errors and edge effects could not be omitted edge effects were caused by the relationship between the diameter of the sprayed water droplets and the landing velocity of sprayed water droplets coincidence errors happened when two droplets instantaneously passed through the laser beam and project overlapping shadows on the photo detectors the number of particles corresponding to velocity values of each diameter level was eliminated if less than 15 drops otherwise the data were statistically tested for the random error of normal distribution by using the 3σ principal wang et al 2011 the volume weighting method was used to calculate the average diameter of water droplets at any measuring point as this method has been proved to be suitable for the actual situation by some studies 2 4 basic droplet statistics significance and distribution the liquid atomizer is the fundamental procedure to improve the bulk water into the groups of small droplets impact sprinkler was used as an atomizer handling the huge amount of datasets collected from lpm required a statistical approach for numerous parameters similarly the evaluation and comparison of the spray properties required qualitative and necessary information although it is suitable to classify the sets by reducing the number of parameters such as the droplet diameter d mm arithmetic mean diameter d mm drop volume mean diameter dv mm volume median diameter d50 mm drop standard deviation sdd mm and droplet coefficient of variation cvd were calculated based on the droplet size data to obtain the significance and scattering seginer 1963 the droplet diameter quantity is known as the ratio of water droplets comparative to the entire value of drops the droplet collective volume frequency is the ratio of diameter water droplets less than a specified size relative to the total volume of drops similarly d50 is described as the diameter that resembles 50 of the total collective volume frequency the parameters d eq 1 dv eq 2 as well as d50 and rv eq 3 were computed in this study where rv is the ratio between dv and d50 two other parameters were also determined the arithmetic means velocity v ms 1 by eq 4 and kinetic energy ekr j cm 2 min 1 by eq 5 1 d i 1 n n i ⅆ i i 1 n n i 2 d v i 1 24 n i ⅆ i 4 i 1 24 n i d i 3 3

droplet diameter distribution histograms are presented in figs 3 and 4 the volumetric mean diameter dv and median diameter d50 of water droplets generated by the ais and is sprinklers are plotted against the distance from the sprinkler at the working pressures of 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa under a fixed pressure as the distance from the nozzle increases dv and d50 increases gradually similarly at the same distance the diameter of the water droplet and the slope of the curve decreased gradually with the increase in pressure this indicates that the increasing trend of raindrop diameter decreases along the radial direction it can also be observed that this change is small up to of 6 m from the sprinkler but increases with the distance beyond the 6 m and at locations 8 m and 14 m from the sprinkler the droplet diameter from the ais is varied by 2 14 and 10 53 respectively compared that from the is at the pressure 0 25 mpa the volume means diameter and median diameter relationship between aeration and impact nozzle under different three pressures are illustrated in fig 5 the relative value rv is computed using eq 3 when the distance is farther from the nozzle the difference between d50 and dv can be reduced by increasing the working pressure as compared to ais is at a working pressure of 0 25 mpa results in a larger wetted radius and forms several additional coarse droplets at locations far from the sprinkler according to eq 3 the reduction in rv indicates that d50 approaches dv fig 5 clearly shows that the curve difference of rv value for ais under low pressure of 0 15 mpa is very low it explains that far from the nozzle ais sprinkler produces very low coarse droplets compared to is furthermore the reduction of rv to zero levels means that the difference between d50 and dv is very low to determine the distribution law of d50 and dv two simple regression models are identified to predict the statically fitting functions of d50 and dv for both nozzle types the distance from the nozzle and working pressure for ais and is the correlations are presented as eqs 8 9 8 d v 0 29 1 8 d 0 90 p 0 68 e 0 21 l r 2 89 55 9 d 50 0 251 0 91 d 1 72 p 0 83 e 0 21 l r 2 91 8 where d nozzle diameter mm p the working pressure mpa l distance from the sprinkler m 3 2 radial frequency distribution of water droplets under different pressures in this study the volume weighting method is used for the calculation of water droplet frequency the volumetric droplet frequency histograms of ais and is are presented in fig 6 a the spray droplet diameters in the irrigation area are ranged from 0 125 mm 8 5 mm under the three different pressures the frequency distribution of droplets with given diameter d is denoted as pd when the working pressure increased pd 3 5 mm it also increased at the same time the number of coarse droplets decreased for each sprinkler the value pd 3 5 mm at 0 25 mpa both ais and is were improved and more significant than other working pressures under the low pressure like 0 15 mpa and 0 2 mpa the is nozzle droplet frequencies decreased it can be illustrated from fig 6 a that the diameter distribution of water droplets is strongly related to the working pressure in ais the frequency for water droplets of diameter less than 3 mm increases significantly and that larger than 3 5 mm decreases significantly than is the increased frequency of smaller water droplets implies a better atomization effect also with the increase of pressure the difference of droplet diameter distribution decreases gradually and the difference of droplet diameter between the measuring points at pressure p 0 25 mpa is small when the pressure is 0 25 mpa the main range of droplet diameter at the distance of 1m 8 m from the nozzle is 0 25 mm 3 00 mm while water droplets larger than 3 mm in diameter are mainly distributed over the distance of 10 m 18 m from the spray as the distance from the nozzle increases the smaller droplet diameter frequency decreases and the frequency of large diameter water droplets increases gradually in is more than ais droplets with the largest diameter are found at the end of the water thrown pressure had a small effect on the water droplet diameter near the nozzle while pressure had a higher effect farther away from the nozzle when the pressure increases the difference between the water droplet diameter distributions at the distance of 3m 9 m from the nozzle becomes smaller it can also be observed from fig 6 a that the longer the distance from the sprinkler the larger the diameter of the peaks under the effect of inertial and gravitational forces over the same interval of time fine droplet particles endure greater braking than coarse particles when droplets are emitted by a nozzle fine drops always deposit closer to the sprinkler than coarse drops similarly it was consistent with the effect of working pressure on the distribution of water droplet diameter with the increase of nozzle pressure the frequency of smaller water droplets increases obviously the fine water droplets with small diameter ranged from 0 6 mm to 0 3 mm are easy to produce drift phenomenon and evaporation loss leading to higher and more serious the evaporation rate and lower the spraying efficiency bai and yan 2011 edling 1985 yan et al 2011 generally mean droplet sizes from both ais and is nozzles were related to each other at a given distance from the sprinkler but a large amount of finest drops created from the is which is smaller than the increase rate of the minimum droplet size diameter when the greater droplet diameter declined the droplet sizes of ais was more enhanced and larger than the cumulative rate of the smallest droplet size it is known that the larger the diameter of sprayed water droplets the higher the destructive impact on soil surface structure which is not favorable to soil and water conservation and crop growth wu et al 2012 it means that ais may be more useful to minimize evaporation and wind drift losses while preventing damage to the soil from fig 6 b it can be seen that the main diameter distribution ranges of water droplets for ais and is are 0 125 mm 6 5 mm and 0 125 mm 8 mm respectively in other words the water droplet distribution range of is is larger than that of ais from the fig 6 b at the starting measured position although the droplet frequency curve intertwined similarly when the droplet diameter is fixed at 2 mm and the working pressure increases from 0 15 mpa to 0 25 mpa the water droplets frequency for both sprinklers is successively increased when the drop diameter 3 5 mm at the pressure of 0 25 mpa the ais frequency curve consistently reduces whereas the is curve slope is intertwined the water droplet frequency of ais is generally smaller than that of is at 4 mm droplet diameter moreover the diameter distribution of different water droplets of ais is more uniform than that of is especially at 0 25 mpa ais has a greater amount of water droplets with a diameter of less than 3 mm with more significant inclination than is it is considered suitable for spraying water droplets with a diameter range of 1 mm 3 5 mm when the working pressures are 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa based on fig 6 b the frequency of the entire spraying area for ais recorded is at 1 mm as 34 4 35 6 and 40 2 for 2 mm as 66 3 71 2 and 75 7 and for 3 5 mm as 85 5 89 6 and 96 2 the corresponding value for is is at 1 mm as 35 8 36 3 and 40 5 for 2 mm as 60 4 66 36 and 69 2 and for 3 5 mm as 86 2 84 2 and 87 5 respectively additionally when the working pressure is kept at 0 25 mpa water droplets with diameter 1 mm 3 5 mm in the spraying area is more frequent for different distance from the sprinkler fig 7 shows a comparison chart of the two kinds of nozzles in terms of the frequency distribution of water droplets at different measuring points from 4 m 8 m 12 m 14 m and 18 m under 0 25 mpa the distance of 4 m from the nozzle covers the starting position distance from 8 m to 14 m covers the middle position of water throws and 18 m covers the end position from the sprinkler it is clear from fig 7 at near and middle distances from ais the relation between frequency distribution and drops diameter is slightly larger and better than that from is the frequency distribution laws of water droplet diameter for both nozzles are in good agreement with a logarithmic normal distribution the droplet frequency for different pressure values and different distances from the nozzle is fitted using matlab and the model parameters presented in table 1 and the formula of the logarithmic normal distribution function in eq 10 10 y y o a 2 π w x e ln x x c 2 2 w 2 where x is the water droplet diameter mm y is the water droplet distribution function yo is the minimum frequency value xc is the water droplet diameter corresponding to the cumulative frequency maximum mm w and a are the fitting coefficients 3 3 cumulative frequency distribution of water droplet under different distance and pressures the cumulative frequency of water droplets at different distances and pressures from the nozzle is presented in fig 8 a the curve slope of the nearest distance from ais is more significant than that from is and the slope of the curve decreases gradually with the increase of distance from the nozzle at the same pressure which is similar to previous results kincaid et al 1996 king and bjorneberg 2010 zhu et al 2015 the increase in pressure at the same distance causes the slope of the curve to increase slowly furthermore graphical representation also indicates that the closer the distance from the nozzle the more significant the volume fraction of the small diameter droplet the results also suggest that along the radial direction the quantity of large diameter water droplets increases gradually with the increase of the distance from the nozzle with the increase in pressure the cumulative frequency curve slope of water droplets at different distances from the nozzle gradually decreases this indicates that the number of water droplets with a smaller diameter increases with the increasing pressure another trend is that the water droplet diameter increases along the radial direction and decreases with increasing pressure pressure on the cumulative frequency distribution of droplet diameter of is is significant with the increase of pressure the difference between the curve slope at each measuring point decreases and the slope of the cumulative frequency curve of water droplets at the same distance from the nozzle increases for the is when the pressure is higher than the 0 15 mpa at the end of the wetted radius the change of curve for the cumulative frequency of water droplets rises slowly furthermore under the same pressure the cumulative frequency of water droplets from ais changes more evenly with the increase of pressure and distance relative to is as can be seen in fig 8 b ais exhibits better results than is at pressures 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa the water droplets diameter along the radial distribution is more uniform in ais the average droplet diameters ranged from 0 mm to 3 5 mm for ais and 0 mm to 4 5 mm for is are recorded at a level of 90 cumulative frequency the cumulative frequency distribution of recorded for ais is under 1 mm as 39 58 and 76 under 2 mm 65 75 and 90 under 3 5 mm 83 90 and 92 the corresponding value for is is under 1 mm 34 39 and 48 under 2 mm 60 68 and 73 under 3 5 mm 77 86 and 88 at pressure 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa 0 25 mpa respectively the comparison of droplet size distributions shows that ais generates fine drop while is creates bigger drops with diameter ranged about 5 5 mm at the middle position these output consequences are similar to those achieved by previous scholars who used different kinds of sprinklers al araki 2002 dadiao andwallender w 1985 issaka et al 2018 at the most distances from the sprinkler the number of droplets with a smaller diameter is greater compared to that with a larger diameter this is supportive of the hypothesis that droplet formation is a constant procedure on the jet track liu et al 2016 lu and cheng 2018 zhu et al 2018 the exponential distribution function is used to describe and compare the cumulative frequency distribution of water droplets in conventional sprinklers moreover a method is provided to estimate the parameters for a given sprinkler type nozzle size and pressure head solomon k et al 1985 von bernuth and gilley 1984 similarly for both is and ais sprinklers the exponential distribution function is used as eq 11 in equation 11 l is the length value which corresponds to the water droplet diameter corresponding to the cumulative frequency of water droplets that is always replaced by d50 in eq 9 the boltzmann distribution model is also applied to fit the droplet cumulative frequency distribution of is and ais through eq 12 11 f x 1 e a x l n 12 f x q 1 q 2 1 e d x c d x q 2 where a and n are dimensionless exponents and α 0 n 0 q1 is the starting point line value q2 is the finish line value xc is the center point of the diameter values dx is the droplet diameter constant the fitted results of both sprinklers at different distances from the sprinkler are calculated by using simple matlab and graphically presented by microsoft excel software at pressure 0 25 mpa as can be seen from table 2 single phase spraying nozzle and the gas liquid two phase nozzle have the diameter distribution of water droplets which is better fitted with an exponential function at a given distance far from the nozzle ais has a higher fitting coefficient than is however at distances of 4 and 8 m from the nozzle the fitting functions and r2 values of ais are 0 6 and 0 7 and 8 and 12 higher than is far from the nozzle at a distance of 14 m to 18 m on the contrary the fitting functions and correlation coefficient value of is are 1 and 1 05 and r2 values 1 and 2 better than that of ais the results show that when the distance from the nozzle is closer the exponential distribution function of ais has a higher fitting and water droplet diameter than is table 3 shows the percentage of droplets with a cumulative mean diameter for ais and is at different working pressures diameters d10 d25 d50 d75 and d90 represent the diameters corresponding to 10 25 50 75 and 90 respectively it can be observed that for both the nozzle sizes the droplet sizes increase with an increasing percentage of droplet diameters in the research almost 20 of drops are identical at every distance from ais than is 4 distribution law of water droplet velocity under different pressure spray water droplet velocity is an important parameter to determine water droplet kinetic energy the test measured the different velocity at different points through a laser precipitation monitor in a previous study relationship between velocity and distance from the nozzle at different pressure was analyzed zhu et al 2015 the authors reported that the velocity of three sprinklers at different pressures at a velocity range from 0 ms 1 6 3 ms 1 for distances exceeding 10 m with the mean drop diameter ranges from 0 mm to 4 mm respectively furthermore bautista capetillo et al 2014 have adopted a nonlinear equation for the statistical analysis of the droplet velocities and significant differences among different measurements 13 v a b ln d where v is the droplet velocity ms 1 a and b are regression coefficients eq 13 provides an excellent overall fit to droplet diameter and velocities measured by photographically bautista capetillo et al 2014 salvador et al 2009 the sum of the squares reduction test sas 2007 was used for the nonlinear regression and significance of coefficient a and b fig 9 shows that the velocity of the droplets is more variable than droplets diameter at each considering distance with pressure 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa especially in single phase liquid impact sprinkler the mean measured velocities in ais and is increase with the droplet diameter the results display that in ais and is water droplet velocity increases by different distances of the nozzle under working pressures of 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa there is an excellent logarithmic relationship between the velocity of water droplets and the diameter of water droplets therefore the logarithmic function model can better describe the water droplet velocity and water droplet diameter the velocity of water droplets less than 3 5 mm in diameter is more affected by the pressure from fig 9 at low pressure the differences for fine droplets 3 5 mm are reduced than those for coarse droplets 3 5 mm hence the working pressure does not influence the velocity of fine droplets so the phenomenon happens because fine droplets are entered around the path of coarse droplets and carried further and their velocity closely related to the jet velocities moreover the relationship between small droplet diameter and velocity is consistent with the logarithmic function model however the correlation coefficient values for ais and is recorded are 95 and 85 respectively similarly from fig 10 the relationship between both sprinklers at pressure 0 25 mpa shows a better velocity fitting curve concerning drop diameter 1 mm with a logarithmic function model and the correlation regression values of 97 and 94 are recorded drop diameter and aerodynamic drag are the main cause of the reduction of velocity slop fine and minimum size drops were found everywhere at any point but a large number of fine drops are deposited near the sprinkler nozzle smaller droplets can be observed in the final vertical trajectory while coarse droplets are usually detected at distal points the trajectory path continues a considerable parallel component throughout irrigation fragmentation of coarse droplets from the main area of spraying plum in flight trajectory slightly more than the sprinkler king and bjorneberg 2010 furthermore due to the increase of pressure velocity consequence on the diameter of water droplets increased at a distance of 6 m to 10 m from the sprinkler from fig 10 it can be observed that water droplet velocity gradually increases reaching the maximum value at the maximum droplet diameter far from the sprinkler the results indicate that the water droplet diameter is an essential factor for determining the velocity of water droplets therefore the logarithmic relation between the velocity and distance from a sprinkler can be obtained by the following relationship 14 v 0 392 2 79 ln d 1 103 r 2 0 97 to study the overall effect of working pressure on the water droplet velocity of both nozzles the velocity of water droplets under each working pressure is at a significant level of 5 the variance analysis is carried out and the calculated value of p is 0 507 which indicates that the effect of working pressure on the velocity of water droplets is small most of the small droplets formed in ais is related to the innovative structure of ais consequently working pressure has little effect on droplet velocity from fig 11 the mean droplet velocities for ais range from 0 ms 1 to 6 8 ms 1 as a consequence droplets under 1 ms 1 has a frequency of 25 24 and 21 under 4 ms 1 of 4 5 and 7 under 6 ms 1 of 3 2 and 4 for pressures of 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa respectively in comparison the mean droplet velocities for is ranged from 0ms 1 to 6 8 ms 1droplets under 1 ms 1 recorded has a frequency percentage of 23 17 and 17 under 4 ms 1 of 4 8 and 8 and under 6 ms 1of 1 2 and 4 for pressures of 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa respectively the relationship between velocity and frequency of water droplets in fig 11 shows that the maximum frequency is obtained at a velocity of 1 ms 1 at both combinations the frequency distribution curve slop is continually reduced in ais while in is it is slightly increased at the velocity of drops 3ms 1 statistical parameters for droplet diameter and velocity obtained for different working pressures are presented in table 4 the parameters include the arithmetic mean standard deviation coefficient of variation the volumetric mean diameter median diameter droplets velocity standard velocity deviation and velocity coefficient of variation for both kinds of nozzles there is an overall reduction in mean droplet diameter with an increase in working pressure for ais the standard deviation of droplet diameter ranges from 1 05 mm to 0 94 mm with a mean value of 0 99 mm and the coefficient in diameter variation ranges from 119 to 132 with a mean value of 126 6 for is the standard deviation in droplet diameters ranges from 0 92 mm to 0 77 mm with a mean value of 0 77 mm while the coefficients in diameter variation range from 118 to 115 with a mean value of 105 33 similarly the velocity of ais under high droplet frequency is lower than is under each working pressure the standard velocity deviation parameter of ais ranges from 1 42 ms 1 to 1 41 ms 1 with the mean value of 1 36 ms 1 while that of is ranges from 1 35 ms 1 to 2 2 ms 1 with the mean value of 1 62 ms 1 4 1

pressures of 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa is plotted in fig 12 generally atclpm provides a lower estimate of droplet kinetic energy and could measure the more substantial proportion of smaller droplets as the distance from the nozzle increases due to the increase of water droplet diameter and water droplet velocity the kinetic energy of droplet increases gradually until reaching a maximum at level 80 of the wetting radius sprinkler impact arm is the leading cause of breaking water jet in the shape of droplets from the surface of the jet into the air it also happened because flying water lumps as surrounded by the inertial force viscous force gravity action and surface tension under the joint action of continuous aeration split a large number of droplets the diameter and velocity of water droplets produced a higher frequency in the central area of the jet hence the frequency of small droplet diameter decreases gradually with the increase of droplet diameter from the distance of the nozzle therefore the farther away from the nozzle the larger the diameter of water droplets with the higher kinetic energy of the water droplets to further study the observed relationship between the kinetic energy of water droplets and the distance from the nozzle the regression analysis of the test data can be obtained by eq 15 15 e k e k o k e x p α x where x is the distance from the nozzle m k α ek0 is the fitting coefficient the values of correlation coefficients under different pressures are shown in table 5 the drop in kinetic energy does not differ too much at the three working pressures 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa the results show that the correlation coefficient of water droplet kinetic energy using the exponential function model is better than that of the radial distribution model the correlation coefficient is above 80 85 and the kinetic energy of water droplet decreases gradually with the increase of pressure the influence of pressure on the kinetic energy near the water droplet increases with the increase of the distance from the nozzle as the pressure increases the kinetic energy decreases gradually and the pressure exerts less effect on the kinetic energy of the adjacent droplets similarly the influence of pressure on the kinetic energy of water droplets increases gradually with the distance from the nozzle when the sprinkler works at a low pressure of 0 15 mpa the kinetic energy slop at a distance of 10 m from is increases 17 more than that from ais furthermore under the pressure of 0 2 mpa and 0 25 mpa the curve difference in ais recorded is much lower than that in is therefore the appropriate reduction of the working pressure of ais can effectively reduce the anti kinetic energy of spraying water droplets and hence reduces the soil erosion and damage to soil structure to maintain soil and water 5 conclusion the ais that contains two phase fluid inlets air water has different performance features from those of conventional one phase water sprinklers the droplet characteristics droplet diameter velocity and kinetic energy were measured using an atclpm the following conclusions can be obtained from the analysis 1 the diameter of the water droplets is distributed exponentially along the radial direction the effect of working pressure on dv and d50 increases with the cumulative distance from the nozzle as indicated by the mean droplet diameter model and the medium droplet diameter model these model correlation coefficients can reach a higher level of 0 9 under low pressure the water droplet distribution range of is is a bit wider than of ais under different pressures 2 the logarithmic normal distribution model is developed to illustrate the frequency distribution laws for the two kinds of sprinklers ais has a higher frequency distribution than is i e 96 vs 87 at a working pressure of 0 25 mpa for both sprinklers the droplet distribution in logarithmic normal distribution increases by an average value of 7 compared to the exponential distribution function the water droplet distribution of ais is more continuous and uniform than that of is under different pressures 3 the relationship between small droplet diameter and velocity is consistent with the logarithmic function model and the distribution accuracy calculated for both sprinklers is 95 and 85 respectively the working pressure has a small effect on the relationship between the diameter and the velocity of water droplets 4 the exponential function model better fits the radial distribution of the kinetic energy of water droplets the kinetic energy of the water droplets increases with the drop diameter and the distance from the nozzle ais produces a 17 lower kinetic energy slop than is under low pressure of 0 15 mpa declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgment this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant

10398,studying the physiological responses of winter wheat to drought is conducive to learning to utilize biological water saving technologies such as regulating deficit irrigation and obtaining higher water use efficiency wue however the close relationship between the trend of responses of physiological functions in wheat and changes in soil moisture merits further study in this study a two season pot experiment with three levels of water deficit 45 75 fc field capacity was established at three growth stages based on the theory that the drought resistant physiological functions of winter wheat could respond to regulated deficit irrigation the goal was to explore the effects of short term drought re watering on yield and wue and the sensitivity of wheat leaf physiological indicators to reflect changes in soil moisture the results showed that the short term drought in different periods after the jointing period reduced the yield of winter wheat by 2 03 64 39 compared with the treatment of an adequate supply of water 75 85 fc priority should be placed on ensuring irrigation during the jointing and filling periods treatments that experienced drought during the heading period 55 75 fc and then recovered to 75 85 fc after flowering can improve the wue by 5 22 the physiological function of drought resistance in winter wheat leaves responds noticeably to drought and the re watering process in the range of 45 85 fc the maximum values of the activities of superoxide dismutase sod and peroxidase and the contents of malondialdehyde and proline pro during drought increased by 51 9 15 1 40 4 and 157 2 respectively compared with those of the control group the activity of catalase primarily increased after rehydration and the maximum value was 1 5 fold that of the control group after 14 days of rehydration the physiological index values of multiple treatments can be restored to the level of control which proves that the physiological response within the range of 45 85 fc water change is reversible based on the experimental data of the two seasons the changes in activity of sod and content of pro more effectively reflect the changes in soil moisture than the other indicators roc analysis auc 0 720 0 978 and have a significant correlation with yield p 0 05 therefore they can be considered as physiological reference tools to monitor the effect of irrigation and adjust its strategy keywords winter wheat short term drought physiological response soil water status 1 introduction during the green revolution of the 1960s scientists achieved a rapid increase in the yields of major staple grain crops wheat corn and rice through the selection of elite varieties development of hybrid varieties and application of fertilizers pingali 2012 during the post green revolution the primary need is to adapt to the reduction of crop yields caused by environmental changes therefore it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that plants use to respond to variable environments bailey serres et al 2019 since drought is one of the main factors that affects food security the water strategy to ensure food security includes saving water improving crop water use efficiency and modernizing irrigation infrastructure hanjra and qureshi 2010 regulated deficit irrigation rdi is an effective irrigation management technology in this context its core involves the adjustment of irrigation water based on the phenological period and crop growth status to improve the water use efficiency wue of crops kang et al 2000 the key of rdi is to determine the optimal water level in each growth period so that the negative impact of water shortage is reduced while reducing the amount of irrigation this management technique has been proven to be effective for a variety of crops intrigliolo et al 2016 permanhani et al 2016 sánchez virosta et al 2020 zhang et al 2012 the degree of stress duration and timepoint of stress and the response of the crop after stress relief are three key factors that affect the growth of crops under drought conditions farooq et al 2009 zlatev and lidon 2012 the stress resistance of winter wheat results in stronger resistance to drought some effects of drought on crops are irreversible such as the morphology of leaves reduction in the number of leaves and increase in the ratio of roots to shoots shao et al 2008 thapa et al 2018 some effects have strain reversibility with changes in soil moisture such as photosynthesis active oxygen scavenging and osmotic adjustments the plants respond to stress and these functions can still be restored after release from moderate stress bala 2000 nezhadahmadi et al 2013 zlatev and lidon 2012 winter wheat is highly resistant to mild and moderate abiotic stress before jointing and many negative effects can be eliminated after rehydration abid et al 2018 winter wheat begins to grow rapidly during the jointing stage and it then switches to reproductive growth at the later stages it is important to understand the responses of the physiological mechanism of stress resistance of winter wheat to soil moisture during these periods liang et al 2018 reactive oxygen species ros produced by drought stress cause oxidative stress as a secondary stress leading to problems such as cell membrane lipid peroxidation osakabe et al 2014 superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and peroxidase pod are important components of the antioxidant protective enzyme system which can reduce the toxic effect of ros on cells therefore they are often used as physiological indicators of crop stress resistance arbona et al 2013 gill and tuteja 2010 studies have shown that these three enzymes have demonstrable responses to changes in soil moisture and are closely related to the photosynthesis of crops hao et al 2019 malondialdehyde mda is commonly used as a product of cell membrane lipid peroxidation to reflect the damage of crop cells under adverse conditions iqbal et al 2018 rashid et al 2019 osmoprotection is when plants respond to stress by accumulating osmolytes in the cytoplasm and chloroplast and then degrade them after the stress has been relieved the accumulation of proline pro as a common osmoprotectant helps to stimulate the activity of antioxidant protective enzymes and can also be used as an organic nitrogen reserve after the stress has been relieved filippou et al 2014 sairam and tyagi 2004 all of these indicators are likely to reflect the responses of the physiological mechanisms of wheat to changes in soil moisture since wheat is widely grown in arid and semiarid regions irrigation is an essential management measure therefore it is necessary to study the physiological processes of the resistance of wheat to drought and its subsequent mechanisms of recovery in the past there have been a number of studies on the response of crops to drought stress but they have been primarily used to compare irrigation effects at a single point in the growth period and select varieties at the seedling stage few studies have focused on the response of physiological mechanism of winter wheat to drought and re watering after the jointing stage and the relationship between this response and changes in soil moisture based on the close relationship between physiological response and soil moisture it should be possible to simultaneously determine the physiological state of crops and soil moisture using indictors of leaf functions however there has been little discussion on the sensitivity of the ability of different indicators of leaf function to reflect changes in soil moisture therefore this study focused on determining the response of antioxidant protection system and osmotic protection function of winter wheat under short term drought re watering conditions after the jointing period we examined the following factors a the effects of levels of water stress on the yield and wue of winter wheat b whether the response of common physiological indices to water change after jointing has a positive response and results in strain reversibility and c the sensitivity of these physiological indicators to the change in soil water status 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and cultural practice descriptions the experiment was conducted in the research greenhouse of northwest a f university in yangling shaanxi province china from november 2016 to may 2017 and october 2017 to april 2018 the test area is in a semi humid and drought prone area and the climate in this region is semiarid with an average of 2 164 h of sunshine and 210 days free of frost the soil that was tilled was the 0 20 cm layer and the soil parameters are shown in table 1 the experiment used the winter wheat cultivar xiaoyan 22 the nursery was accomplished in a plant growth chamber and the wheat seedlings were transplanted into a barrel after vernalization the barrels were 27 27 30 cm3 and there were five holes on the bottom gauze and gravel were laid under the soil to ensure the permeability of air fifteen kilograms of dried soil was added to each barrel after passage through a 5 mm sieve the base fertilizer compound fertilizer n p k 19 19 19 total nutrients 57 was thoroughly mixed in the soil and no top dressing was added a total of 1 cm of perlite was laid on the soil surface to reduce the evaporation between the plants the arrangement of the experiment is shown as fig 1 2 2 experimental design the control group of the experiment was the ck with sufficient water supply 75 85 fc during the whole growth period in addition the water deficit of w1 65 75 fc w2 55 65 fc and w3 45 55 fc was established during the three growth stages meng et al 2016 among them fc is the field capacity mass water content the three periods include s1 jointing booting stage s2 heading flowering stage and s3 filling maturing stage ten treatments with five replicates were utilized in this experiment table 2 the weighing method was used to control the water conditions irrigation water went to the upper limit when the water conditions were below the lower limit the duration of water treatment during each period in the two quarters was 7 days 2016 2017 and 9 days 2017 2018 respectively 2 3 data collection the sampling timepoints were selected during the two treatment phases of drought and re watering the sampling sites selected for the first season 2016 2017 were the third and seventh day after drought and the first and second week after rehydration an analysis of the data indicated that most of the inter group differences disappeared at 2 weeks after rehydration therefore to better explore the rule of changes in the physiological responses denser sampling points were determined samples were analyzed at the third sixth and ninth day during drought and re watering during the second quarter 2017 2018 on the sampling day we chose all green functional leaves with the exception of the top three leaves that were used as samples because this could reflect the function of wheat leaves without affecting photosynthesis samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at 80 c we used the nitroblue tetrazolium nbt method to assay sod while cat was assayed at 240 nm pod was assayed using the guaiacol chromogenic method malondialdehyde and pro were determined using the thiobarbituric acid tba and sulfosalicylic acid dihydrate methods respectively the ears of the plants in each pot were collected separately after they had turned completely yellow and weighed as yield g pot after threshing the difference value between two irrigation intervals was monitored by weighing and the cumulative total was the water consumption kg pot of the wheat wue g kg was the ratio of yield to water consumption 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical analytical methods used in this study included analyses of variance correlation and receiver operating characteristics roc analysis which were completed using spss 23 ibm inc armonk ny usa an analysis of variance anova was performed between four water levels at the same period a correlation analysis combined all the data to analyze the influence of variables on physiological indices a roc analysis was used to determine whether physiological indices can identify that a plant is or has been subjected to a certain amount of water the roc curve was plotted using a negative category rate 1 specificity as the abscissa and the sensitivity as the ordinate it automatically showed the accuracy of the diagnostic test the larger the area under the curve auc is the higher the diagnostic accuracy is fawcett 2006 to select an appropriate threshold the selected feature quantity was evaluated using youden s index yi as shown below 1 y i m a x i m u m s e n s i t i v i t y s p e c i f i c i t y 1 the value corresponding to the largest youden index was the best threshold bt 3 results 3 1 effects of water deficit period and stress level on winter wheat the results of the comprehensive variance analysis shown in table 3 revealed that yield and wue were also significantly affected by the growth period g soil moisture s and their interaction g s in addition s had the most significant effect on sod cat pod and pro p 0 01 the interaction g s between g and s had no significant effect on these physiological indicators however under the experimental conditions of this study the content of mda in the leaves was not significantly affected by the three variable sources 3 1 1 yield and wue all of the water deficit treatments reduced production during both quarters under deficit irrigation conditions resulting in values that were 2 03 45 31 and 18 33 64 39 lower than those of the control treatment respectively table 4 yields were lower during the second period because the drought in the second season was longer than that in the first the yield and wue of the two seasons were consistent the treatment that had the lowest reduction in yield was s2w2 and the wues of s2w1 and s2w2 were higher than that of the control group table 5 the lowest yield and wue both appeared during the jointing stage s1 of the w3 treatment 45 55 fc there was no significant difference between yield and wue at the w1 and w2 levels in s1 and s2 and the negative effect of the w3 level was more noticeable there was no significant difference between the three water treatments in s3 the negative effects of the water treatment in s2 were smaller than those of the other two periods when the average of each growth period was compared and the partial treatment also improved the wue with less reduction in yield 3 1 2 superoxide dismutase sod the activity of the sod of winter wheat leaves responded significantly to the drought rehydration treatment 45 75 fc during the three periods fig 2 the activity of sod increased significantly during drought and was as high as 1 87 fold that of the level of ck the activity of sod during the drought stage of s1 changed relatively predictably with time demonstrating w3 w2 w1 ck it decreased briefly within 3 days and then increased again the responses during drought during the s2 and s3 periods were similar the sod activity of the three treatment groups continued to increase to d6 and then decreased and the trend was stable after rehydration at r9 there was no significant difference in the activity of sod among w1 w2 and the ck the activity of sod at the w3 level 45 55 fc was always higher than that of the ck during the drought and rehydration stages before r14 there was no significant difference in the activity of sod in all the treatments after two weeks of rehydration 3 1 3 catalase cat the activity of cat increased significantly after re watering when winter wheat responded to a short term drought fig 3 the activity of cat during the s1 period always demonstrated w3 w2 w1 ck the trends of change of the activities of cat during the s2 and s3 period were similar but the range of change in s3 was smaller than s2 the activity of cat during the drought stage began to rise at d3 from the level below ck and gradually exceeded that of the ck during these two periods most treatments had a peak of cat activity at r6 during the rehydration stage of the three periods the maximum peak occurred at r6 during the s2 period and the activities of cat during w1 w2 and w3 were 1 87 2 18 and 1 81 fold that of the ck treatment respectively there was no significant difference among all the treatments in s2 and s3 and s1w1 and the ck at r14 3 1 4 peroxidase pod the activity of pod in the three water treatment groups differed significantly from that in the ck during short term drought and it increased with the extension of time during the drought stage fig 4 the activity of pod during the three treatment groups was higher than that of the ck during drought in the s1 period and the maximum value appeared at d9 however the activities of pod after rehydration in w1 and w2 were not significantly different and were closer to that of the ck than w3 the activity of pod changed consistently during the drought stage of s2 and s3 these values were significantly higher than that of the ck at d6 and were maintained through d9 the activity of the pod of s2w3 during the rehydration stage exceeded those of the other three treatments during the same period and there was no significant difference between the activities of w1 and w2 there was no significant difference between the three water treatment groups during the rehydration stage of s3 the pod activity of most treatments could return to the ck level at r14 3 1 5 malondialdehyde mda the drought treatment had the most significant effect on the content of mda during the s1 treatment this could be because the jointing stage was the rapid growth period of wheat fig 5 the content of mda in s1 increased significantly after d3 and the contents of mda in the w1 w2 and w3 treatments at d9 were 1 66 1 69 and 2 09 fold that of the ck respectively rehydration significantly reduced the content of mda in the three water treatments during the s1 period and only s1w3 was still significantly higher than that of the ck at r14 the peak of mda content during the drought stage of s2 and s3 both appeared at d6 and was smaller than the peak of s1 there was no significant difference in the content of mda among the three treatments and the ck in s2 after two weeks of rehydration the mda contents of w1 w2 and w3 still increased after rehydration during s3 and it was 1 27 1 38 and 1 37 fold that of the ck at d9 however there was no significant difference in the level of mda among all the treatments at r14 3 1 6 proline pro the proline in leaves responded noticeably to the change of water fig 6 and these responses appeared during all three periods the content of pro at the three levels of treatment was significantly higher than that of the ck during the drought of three periods and increased with the extension of drought which could continue to d9 the content of pro under the w3 treatment was always significantly higher than those of the other treatments during the drought stage and it could increase to 2 75 fold that of the ck the content of pro did not rapidly decrease to the level of ck after rehydration but it gradually dropped from r3 and returned to the level of ck at r14 the content of pro in each period basically remained w3 w2 w1 ck based on the observation of the drought process this lack of change indicates that the lower the soil moisture content within the range of 45 75 fc the higher the content of pro during the drought stage 3 1 7 combined analysis the data of the two quarters were classified based on the same period and water level and the mean values of each treatment were calculated during the drought stage d and rehydration stage r for the anova respectively fig 7 the differences between dsod and rsod in each period were basically the same the maximum value usually appeared at the level of w3 45 55 fc the value of rcat was higher than that of dcat there was no significant difference between the dcat values in s2 and s3 but the rcat values differed the dpod in ck 75 85 fc level was significantly lower than those of the other treatments but rehydration reduced the rpod at the w1 and w2 levels and reduced the difference compared with the ck there was generally no significant difference between the content of mda in the groups with the exception of dmda in s1 and the rmda in s3 there was no significant difference between dpro and rpro under the same treatment in s1 but there was a significant difference between dpro and rpro under the w2 and w3 45 65 fc levels in s2 and s3 a roc diagnosis was used to analyze whether the index value during drought and after rehydration could be used to identify the drought level that the wheat was experiencing or had been subjected to respectively and the results were expressed by the area under the curve auc of the roc curve table 6 the results showed that dsod rsod dpro and rpro were significantly reliable auc 0 720 0 956 in determining whether the wheat was subjected to drought rehydration treatment at levels lower than 55 65 and 75 fc among them the result with soil moisture sm 75 fc was the most accurate auc 0 85 rcat and rpod could indicate when the wheat had been subjected to drought treatment 45 75 fc but the ability of dcat and dpod to determine this was limited dcat could determine that the sm at this time was lower than 65 fc and 55 fc but dpod could not determine sm 55 mda was not effective at diagnosing water changes in the range of 45 75 fc this is related to the fact that cat pod and mda sometimes lack significant inter group differences during the drought rehydration process within this soil moisture range since a roc analysis showed that sod and pro were the most sensitive to water changes the correlation among activity of sod content of pro yield and wue was analyzed in more detail fig 8 the yield and wue were highly significantly positively correlated p 0 01 and both rsod and rpro were significantly negatively correlated with yield p 0 05 moreover there was a significant negative correlation between rpro and wue it was apparent that the physiological changes after rehydration were more closely related to the yield the higher activity of sod and content of pro after rehydration indicated that the release of winter wheat from water stress was slow or incomplete which resulted in a negative impact on the final yield higher rpro not only represents a positive response to osmotic regulation but may also mean more water consumption thereby further reducing the wue dsod and dpro were highly significantly positively correlated p 0 01 and rsod and rpro were significantly positively correlated p 0 05 indicating that these two indicators had a relatively consistent trend of response in response to drought 4 discussion 4 0 1 effects of drought and re watering on the yield of winter wheat and wue the drought tolerance of wheat during its reproductive development is important for improving the yield potential and stability under conditions of climate change senapati et al 2019 the yield of the short term drought treatment in this study was reduced compared with the treatment with sufficient water supply and the severe drought 45 55 fc treatment reduced the yield most significantly singh and malik 1983 also obtained similar results in long term drought conditions during different growth periods water stress at the jointing stage will eliminate the potential production of wheat eck 1988 therefore under conditions of limited irrigation guaranteeing irrigation during the jointing and flowering stages of winter wheat is the optimal plan to conserve water and preserve the production of crop followed by the provision of irrigation during the filling stage mustafa et al 2017 xue et al 2006 this study also proved this finding the results of this experiment show that the yield under 45 55 fc level at the jointing stage was significantly lower than that of the other levels which may be owing to the significant reduction in the thousand grain weight at this level which ultimately led to a reduction in production abid et al 2018 the reduction in yield under 65 75 fc during the jointing and filling stage is lower which may be owing to the fact that this irrigation treatment aids in the regulation of protein content of grain meng et al 2016 torrion and stougaard 2017 short term drought of 55 75 fc at the heading stage effectively improved the wue although the drought at the heading stage reduced the photosynthetic rate pn it helped to increase the pn after re watering at the flowering stage sun et al 2014 found that the pn at the heading stage of wheat has no significant relationship to the increase of yield but the pn after flowering is significantly related to the increase in yield this tenet is not affected by the variety 4 0 2 response of antioxidant protection and osmotic regulation to changes in soil moisture the reaction of the plant antioxidant protective enzyme system to ros depends on its chemical characteristics signal strength and the plant development stage of reactive oxygen species abid et al 2018 found that the activities of enzymes that protect against oxidation and the contents of mda and proline content of wheat increased with time during 10 days of drought at the tillering and elongation stages and the indicators of moderate drought group 55 60 fc could recover to the level of control within 3 days after rehydration but that of the severe drought group 35 40 fc was still higher than that of the control these findings are generally consistent with the experimental results from the s2 period of this study in this study enzyme activity also did not increase decrease with time at the same level of drought or rehydration the reason may be that although excessive ros may damage crops it is also a signaling substance therefore the plant must maintain a certain balance of ros through regulation of the antioxidant protective enzyme system gechev et al 2006 sun et al 2015 also found similar results the contents of pro and mda in strawberry leaves continued to increase with time over the course of a 10 day short term drought treatment while the activities of sod cat and pod began to decrease after a 6 day increase and the activity sod remained relatively higher the reason why cat pod and mda have limited response to soil moisture status is that their tendency to change is not as stable as those of sod and pro the activity of cat did not increase significantly during drought in s2 and s3 under the conditions of this experiment one reason for this could be because cat has a low affinity for h2o2 and it only becomes active at a high concentration of h2o2 kavas et al 2013 tan et al 2008 found that the regularity of the response of pod to water differed among varieties in addition nikolaeva et al 2010 found that the content of mda in leaves of three wheat species was affected by the synergistic effect of antioxidant protective enzymes in most studies these physiological indicators respond to changes in soil moisture and can be reversed during stress in general the trend is as follows a the content of pro generally increases in parallel with the time of drought b the activities of antioxidant protective enzymes and the content of mda differ during the process of drought owing to the test plan and variety but the responses of sod and pro are relatively stable the roc analysis in this study also verified these results this may be owing to the fact that pro is one of the main substances directly involved in the osmotic regulation of wheat and sod is the first defense of antioxidant protective enzyme system when the soil moisture changes 4 0 3 physiological parameters as a reference in optimized irrigation management the five leaf functional indicators used in this study are often used to evaluate the drought resistance of crops not only are samples easy to obtain but the methods of measurement are relatively well established and simple more importantly they are closely related to the photosynthesis and yield of wheat in a study on tomatoes hao et al 2019 found that the net photosynthetic rate during the whole period of growth highly significantly correlated with stomatal conductance and it also highly significantly correlated with the activities of sod cat and pod during the process of drought rehydration in each growth period the higher activities of sod and pod under drought stress are conducive to the development of pollen and male sterility so that winter wheat can maintain its grain number under drought stress to reduce the loss of yield dong et al 2017 the osmotic adjustment oa of wheat has a positive effect on maintaining the stability of yield under water deficit the correlation between oa and grain yield under greenhouse conditions increases with the severity of water deficit and a significant positive correlation also exists between the two under field conditions p 0 05 blum et al 1999 grichar et al 2004 moinuddin et al 2005 based on the results of the two season experiment this study used a roc analysis to quantify the sensitivity of physiological indicators to soil moisture changes and selected sod and pro auc 0 720 0 978 as the most significant of the indicators studied currently some physiological indicators with the same characteristics such as the net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance have been used to clarify the water demand of crops at different stages roche 2015 costa et al 2019 abid et al 2016 examining these physiological parameters during irrigation management or prediction models can simultaneously reflect the status of various drought resistant physiological mechanisms of crops and the corresponding status of soil moisture 4 0 4 conclusions when discussing the effects of rdi on winter wheat yield and wue this study showed that short term drought 45 75 fc within 9 days of a single growth period after jointing did not benefit the yield however mild and moderate 55 75 fc drought re watering treatments at the heading stage improved the wue subsequent studies should consider extending the duration of stress at this level 55 75 fc or enrich the irrigation scheme settings to find the threshold of drought compensation effect and the highest wue several aspects of this experiment demonstrate the feasibility of using leaf physiological indicators for drought resistance to reflect the status of soil moisture first the responses of sod cat pod mda and pro to the irrigation process were stress reversible and differences between treatments caused by drought can be detected during the stress period and 14 days after re watering this reflects the premise that leaf physiological function indicators can be used to reflect changes in soil moisture a quantitative analysis of roc shows that sod and pro were two of the five indicators that most effectively reflected the soil moisture status with the highest auc value of 0 978 moreover their rehydrated value and yield were significantly negatively correlated p 0 05 therefore based on the ease of acquisition of leaf samples and index determination they can be considered as a physiological reference tool that reflects both soil moisture status and crop physiological status providing a reference for monitoring soil moisture adjusting irrigation decisions and predicting yield by models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

10398,studying the physiological responses of winter wheat to drought is conducive to learning to utilize biological water saving technologies such as regulating deficit irrigation and obtaining higher water use efficiency wue however the close relationship between the trend of responses of physiological functions in wheat and changes in soil moisture merits further study in this study a two season pot experiment with three levels of water deficit 45 75 fc field capacity was established at three growth stages based on the theory that the drought resistant physiological functions of winter wheat could respond to regulated deficit irrigation the goal was to explore the effects of short term drought re watering on yield and wue and the sensitivity of wheat leaf physiological indicators to reflect changes in soil moisture the results showed that the short term drought in different periods after the jointing period reduced the yield of winter wheat by 2 03 64 39 compared with the treatment of an adequate supply of water 75 85 fc priority should be placed on ensuring irrigation during the jointing and filling periods treatments that experienced drought during the heading period 55 75 fc and then recovered to 75 85 fc after flowering can improve the wue by 5 22 the physiological function of drought resistance in winter wheat leaves responds noticeably to drought and the re watering process in the range of 45 85 fc the maximum values of the activities of superoxide dismutase sod and peroxidase and the contents of malondialdehyde and proline pro during drought increased by 51 9 15 1 40 4 and 157 2 respectively compared with those of the control group the activity of catalase primarily increased after rehydration and the maximum value was 1 5 fold that of the control group after 14 days of rehydration the physiological index values of multiple treatments can be restored to the level of control which proves that the physiological response within the range of 45 85 fc water change is reversible based on the experimental data of the two seasons the changes in activity of sod and content of pro more effectively reflect the changes in soil moisture than the other indicators roc analysis auc 0 720 0 978 and have a significant correlation with yield p 0 05 therefore they can be considered as physiological reference tools to monitor the effect of irrigation and adjust its strategy keywords winter wheat short term drought physiological response soil water status 1 introduction during the green revolution of the 1960s scientists achieved a rapid increase in the yields of major staple grain crops wheat corn and rice through the selection of elite varieties development of hybrid varieties and application of fertilizers pingali 2012 during the post green revolution the primary need is to adapt to the reduction of crop yields caused by environmental changes therefore it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that plants use to respond to variable environments bailey serres et al 2019 since drought is one of the main factors that affects food security the water strategy to ensure food security includes saving water improving crop water use efficiency and modernizing irrigation infrastructure hanjra and qureshi 2010 regulated deficit irrigation rdi is an effective irrigation management technology in this context its core involves the adjustment of irrigation water based on the phenological period and crop growth status to improve the water use efficiency wue of crops kang et al 2000 the key of rdi is to determine the optimal water level in each growth period so that the negative impact of water shortage is reduced while reducing the amount of irrigation this management technique has been proven to be effective for a variety of crops intrigliolo et al 2016 permanhani et al 2016 sánchez virosta et al 2020 zhang et al 2012 the degree of stress duration and timepoint of stress and the response of the crop after stress relief are three key factors that affect the growth of crops under drought conditions farooq et al 2009 zlatev and lidon 2012 the stress resistance of winter wheat results in stronger resistance to drought some effects of drought on crops are irreversible such as the morphology of leaves reduction in the number of leaves and increase in the ratio of roots to shoots shao et al 2008 thapa et al 2018 some effects have strain reversibility with changes in soil moisture such as photosynthesis active oxygen scavenging and osmotic adjustments the plants respond to stress and these functions can still be restored after release from moderate stress bala 2000 nezhadahmadi et al 2013 zlatev and lidon 2012 winter wheat is highly resistant to mild and moderate abiotic stress before jointing and many negative effects can be eliminated after rehydration abid et al 2018 winter wheat begins to grow rapidly during the jointing stage and it then switches to reproductive growth at the later stages it is important to understand the responses of the physiological mechanism of stress resistance of winter wheat to soil moisture during these periods liang et al 2018 reactive oxygen species ros produced by drought stress cause oxidative stress as a secondary stress leading to problems such as cell membrane lipid peroxidation osakabe et al 2014 superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and peroxidase pod are important components of the antioxidant protective enzyme system which can reduce the toxic effect of ros on cells therefore they are often used as physiological indicators of crop stress resistance arbona et al 2013 gill and tuteja 2010 studies have shown that these three enzymes have demonstrable responses to changes in soil moisture and are closely related to the photosynthesis of crops hao et al 2019 malondialdehyde mda is commonly used as a product of cell membrane lipid peroxidation to reflect the damage of crop cells under adverse conditions iqbal et al 2018 rashid et al 2019 osmoprotection is when plants respond to stress by accumulating osmolytes in the cytoplasm and chloroplast and then degrade them after the stress has been relieved the accumulation of proline pro as a common osmoprotectant helps to stimulate the activity of antioxidant protective enzymes and can also be used as an organic nitrogen reserve after the stress has been relieved filippou et al 2014 sairam and tyagi 2004 all of these indicators are likely to reflect the responses of the physiological mechanisms of wheat to changes in soil moisture since wheat is widely grown in arid and semiarid regions irrigation is an essential management measure therefore it is necessary to study the physiological processes of the resistance of wheat to drought and its subsequent mechanisms of recovery in the past there have been a number of studies on the response of crops to drought stress but they have been primarily used to compare irrigation effects at a single point in the growth period and select varieties at the seedling stage few studies have focused on the response of physiological mechanism of winter wheat to drought and re watering after the jointing stage and the relationship between this response and changes in soil moisture based on the close relationship between physiological response and soil moisture it should be possible to simultaneously determine the physiological state of crops and soil moisture using indictors of leaf functions however there has been little discussion on the sensitivity of the ability of different indicators of leaf function to reflect changes in soil moisture therefore this study focused on determining the response of antioxidant protection system and osmotic protection function of winter wheat under short term drought re watering conditions after the jointing period we examined the following factors a the effects of levels of water stress on the yield and wue of winter wheat b whether the response of common physiological indices to water change after jointing has a positive response and results in strain reversibility and c the sensitivity of these physiological indicators to the change in soil water status 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and cultural practice descriptions the experiment was conducted in the research greenhouse of northwest a f university in yangling shaanxi province china from november 2016 to may 2017 and october 2017 to april 2018 the test area is in a semi humid and drought prone area and the climate in this region is semiarid with an average of 2 164 h of sunshine and 210 days free of frost the soil that was tilled was the 0 20 cm layer and the soil parameters are shown in table 1 the experiment used the winter wheat cultivar xiaoyan 22 the nursery was accomplished in a plant growth chamber and the wheat seedlings were transplanted into a barrel after vernalization the barrels were 27 27 30 cm3 and there were five holes on the bottom gauze and gravel were laid under the soil to ensure the permeability of air fifteen kilograms of dried soil was added to each barrel after passage through a 5 mm sieve the base fertilizer compound fertilizer n p k 19 19 19 total nutrients 57 was thoroughly mixed in the soil and no top dressing was added a total of 1 cm of perlite was laid on the soil surface to reduce the evaporation between the plants the arrangement of the experiment is shown as fig 1 2 2 experimental design the control group of the experiment was the ck with sufficient water supply 75 85 fc during the whole growth period in addition the water deficit of w1 65 75 fc w2 55 65 fc and w3 45 55 fc was established during the three growth stages meng et al 2016 among them fc is the field capacity mass water content the three periods include s1 jointing booting stage s2 heading flowering stage and s3 filling maturing stage ten treatments with five replicates were utilized in this experiment table 2 the weighing method was used to control the water conditions irrigation water went to the upper limit when the water conditions were below the lower limit the duration of water treatment during each period in the two quarters was 7 days 2016 2017 and 9 days 2017 2018 respectively 2 3 data collection the sampling timepoints were selected during the two treatment phases of drought and re watering the sampling sites selected for the first season 2016 2017 were the third and seventh day after drought and the first and second week after rehydration an analysis of the data indicated that most of the inter group differences disappeared at 2 weeks after rehydration therefore to better explore the rule of changes in the physiological responses denser sampling points were determined samples were analyzed at the third sixth and ninth day during drought and re watering during the second quarter 2017 2018 on the sampling day we chose all green functional leaves with the exception of the top three leaves that were used as samples because this could reflect the function of wheat leaves without affecting photosynthesis samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at 80 c we used the nitroblue tetrazolium nbt method to assay sod while cat was assayed at 240 nm pod was assayed using the guaiacol chromogenic method malondialdehyde and pro were determined using the thiobarbituric acid tba and sulfosalicylic acid dihydrate methods respectively the ears of the plants in each pot were collected separately after they had turned completely yellow and weighed as yield g pot after threshing the difference value between two irrigation intervals was monitored by weighing and the cumulative total was the water consumption kg pot of the wheat wue g kg was the ratio of yield to water consumption 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical analytical methods used in this study included analyses of variance correlation and receiver operating characteristics roc analysis which were completed using spss 23 ibm inc armonk ny usa an analysis of variance anova was performed between four water levels at the same period a correlation analysis combined all the data to analyze the influence of variables on physiological indices a roc analysis was used to determine whether physiological indices can identify that a plant is or has been subjected to a certain amount of water the roc curve was plotted using a negative category rate 1 specificity as the abscissa and the sensitivity as the ordinate it automatically showed the accuracy of the diagnostic test the larger the area under the curve auc is the higher the diagnostic accuracy is fawcett 2006 to select an appropriate threshold the selected feature quantity was evaluated using youden s index yi as shown below 1 y i m a x i m u m s e n s i t i v i t y s p e c i f i c i t y 1 the value corresponding to the largest youden index was the best threshold bt 3 results 3 1 effects of water deficit period and stress level on winter wheat the results of the comprehensive variance analysis shown in table 3 revealed that yield and wue were also significantly affected by the growth period g soil moisture s and their interaction g s in addition s had the most significant effect on sod cat pod and pro p 0 01 the interaction g s between g and s had no significant effect on these physiological indicators however under the experimental conditions of this study the content of mda in the leaves was not significantly affected by the three variable sources 3 1 1 yield and wue all of the water deficit treatments reduced production during both quarters under deficit irrigation conditions resulting in values that were 2 03 45 31 and 18 33 64 39 lower than those of the control treatment respectively table 4 yields were lower during the second period because the drought in the second season was longer than that in the first the yield and wue of the two seasons were consistent the treatment that had the lowest reduction in yield was s2w2 and the wues of s2w1 and s2w2 were higher than that of the control group table 5 the lowest yield and wue both appeared during the jointing stage s1 of the w3 treatment 45 55 fc there was no significant difference between yield and wue at the w1 and w2 levels in s1 and s2 and the negative effect of the w3 level was more noticeable there was no significant difference between the three water treatments in s3 the negative effects of the water treatment in s2 were smaller than those of the other two periods when the average of each growth period was compared and the partial treatment also improved the wue with less reduction in yield 3 1 2 superoxide dismutase sod the activity of the sod of winter wheat leaves responded significantly to the drought rehydration treatment 45 75 fc during the three periods fig 2 the activity of sod increased significantly during drought and was as high as 1 87 fold that of the level of ck the activity of sod during the drought stage of s1 changed relatively predictably with time demonstrating w3 w2 w1 ck it decreased briefly within 3 days and then increased again the responses during drought during the s2 and s3 periods were similar the sod activity of the three treatment groups continued to increase to d6 and then decreased and the trend was stable after rehydration at r9 there was no significant difference in the activity of sod among w1 w2 and the ck the activity of sod at the w3 level 45 55 fc was always higher than that of the ck during the drought and rehydration stages before r14 there was no significant difference in the activity of sod in all the treatments after two weeks of rehydration 3 1 3 catalase cat the activity of cat increased significantly after re watering when winter wheat responded to a short term drought fig 3 the activity of cat during the s1 period always demonstrated w3 w2 w1 ck the trends of change of the activities of cat during the s2 and s3 period were similar but the range of change in s3 was smaller than s2 the activity of cat during the drought stage began to rise at d3 from the level below ck and gradually exceeded that of the ck during these two periods most treatments had a peak of cat activity at r6 during the rehydration stage of the three periods the maximum peak occurred at r6 during the s2 period and the activities of cat during w1 w2 and w3 were 1 87 2 18 and 1 81 fold that of the ck treatment respectively there was no significant difference among all the treatments in s2 and s3 and s1w1 and the ck at r14 3 1 4 peroxidase pod the activity of pod in the three water treatment groups differed significantly from that in the ck during short term drought and it increased with the extension of time during the drought stage fig 4 the activity of pod during the three treatment groups was higher than that of the ck during drought in the s1 period and the maximum value appeared at d9 however the activities of pod after rehydration in w1 and w2 were not significantly different and were closer to that of the ck than w3 the activity of pod changed consistently during the drought stage of s2 and s3 these values were significantly higher than that of the ck at d6 and were maintained through d9 the activity of the pod of s2w3 during the rehydration stage exceeded those of the other three treatments during the same period and there was no significant difference between the activities of w1 and w2 there was no significant difference between the three water treatment groups during the rehydration stage of s3 the pod activity of most treatments could return to the ck level at r14 3 1 5 malondialdehyde mda the drought treatment had the most significant effect on the content of mda during the s1 treatment this could be because the jointing stage was the rapid growth period of wheat fig 5 the content of mda in s1 increased significantly after d3 and the contents of mda in the w1 w2 and w3 treatments at d9 were 1 66 1 69 and 2 09 fold that of the ck respectively rehydration significantly reduced the content of mda in the three water treatments during the s1 period and only s1w3 was still significantly higher than that of the ck at r14 the peak of mda content during the drought stage of s2 and s3 both appeared at d6 and was smaller than the peak of s1 there was no significant difference in the content of mda among the three treatments and the ck in s2 after two weeks of rehydration the mda contents of w1 w2 and w3 still increased after rehydration during s3 and it was 1 27 1 38 and 1 37 fold that of the ck at d9 however there was no significant difference in the level of mda among all the treatments at r14 3 1 6 proline pro the proline in leaves responded noticeably to the change of water fig 6 and these responses appeared during all three periods the content of pro at the three levels of treatment was significantly higher than that of the ck during the drought of three periods and increased with the extension of drought which could continue to d9 the content of pro under the w3 treatment was always significantly higher than those of the other treatments during the drought stage and it could increase to 2 75 fold that of the ck the content of pro did not rapidly decrease to the level of ck after rehydration but it gradually dropped from r3 and returned to the level of ck at r14 the content of pro in each period basically remained w3 w2 w1 ck based on the observation of the drought process this lack of change indicates that the lower the soil moisture content within the range of 45 75 fc the higher the content of pro during the drought stage 3 1 7 combined analysis the data of the two quarters were classified based on the same period and water level and the mean values of each treatment were calculated during the drought stage d and rehydration stage r for the anova respectively fig 7 the differences between dsod and rsod in each period were basically the same the maximum value usually appeared at the level of w3 45 55 fc the value of rcat was higher than that of dcat there was no significant difference between the dcat values in s2 and s3 but the rcat values differed the dpod in ck 75 85 fc level was significantly lower than those of the other treatments but rehydration reduced the rpod at the w1 and w2 levels and reduced the difference compared with the ck there was generally no significant difference between the content of mda in the groups with the exception of dmda in s1 and the rmda in s3 there was no significant difference between dpro and rpro under the same treatment in s1 but there was a significant difference between dpro and rpro under the w2 and w3 45 65 fc levels in s2 and s3 a roc diagnosis was used to analyze whether the index value during drought and after rehydration could be used to identify the drought level that the wheat was experiencing or had been subjected to respectively and the results were expressed by the area under the curve auc of the roc curve table 6 the results showed that dsod rsod dpro and rpro were significantly reliable auc 0 720 0 956 in determining whether the wheat was subjected to drought rehydration treatment at levels lower than 55 65 and 75 fc among them the result with soil moisture sm 75 fc was the most accurate auc 0 85 rcat and rpod could indicate when the wheat had been subjected to drought treatment 45 75 fc but the ability of dcat and dpod to determine this was limited dcat could determine that the sm at this time was lower than 65 fc and 55 fc but dpod could not determine sm 55 mda was not effective at diagnosing water changes in the range of 45 75 fc this is related to the fact that cat pod and mda sometimes lack significant inter group differences during the drought rehydration process within this soil moisture range since a roc analysis showed that sod and pro were the most sensitive to water changes the correlation among activity of sod content of pro yield and wue was analyzed in more detail fig 8 the yield and wue were highly significantly positively correlated p 0 01 and both rsod and rpro were significantly negatively correlated with yield p 0 05 moreover there was a significant negative correlation between rpro and wue it was apparent that the physiological changes after rehydration were more closely related to the yield the higher activity of sod and content of pro after rehydration indicated that the release of winter wheat from water stress was slow or incomplete which resulted in a negative impact on the final yield higher rpro not only represents a positive response to osmotic regulation but may also mean more water consumption thereby further reducing the wue dsod and dpro were highly significantly positively correlated p 0 01 and rsod and rpro were significantly positively correlated p 0 05 indicating that these two indicators had a relatively consistent trend of response in response to drought 4 discussion 4 0 1 effects of drought and re watering on the yield of winter wheat and wue the drought tolerance of wheat during its reproductive development is important for improving the yield potential and stability under conditions of climate change senapati et al 2019 the yield of the short term drought treatment in this study was reduced compared with the treatment with sufficient water supply and the severe drought 45 55 fc treatment reduced the yield most significantly singh and malik 1983 also obtained similar results in long term drought conditions during different growth periods water stress at the jointing stage will eliminate the potential production of wheat eck 1988 therefore under conditions of limited irrigation guaranteeing irrigation during the jointing and flowering stages of winter wheat is the optimal plan to conserve water and preserve the production of crop followed by the provision of irrigation during the filling stage mustafa et al 2017 xue et al 2006 this study also proved this finding the results of this experiment show that the yield under 45 55 fc level at the jointing stage was significantly lower than that of the other levels which may be owing to the significant reduction in the thousand grain weight at this level which ultimately led to a reduction in production abid et al 2018 the reduction in yield under 65 75 fc during the jointing and filling stage is lower which may be owing to the fact that this irrigation treatment aids in the regulation of protein content of grain meng et al 2016 torrion and stougaard 2017 short term drought of 55 75 fc at the heading stage effectively improved the wue although the drought at the heading stage reduced the photosynthetic rate pn it helped to increase the pn after re watering at the flowering stage sun et al 2014 found that the pn at the heading stage of wheat has no significant relationship to the increase of yield but the pn after flowering is significantly related to the increase in yield this tenet is not affected by the variety 4 0 2 response of antioxidant protection and osmotic regulation to changes in soil moisture the reaction of the plant antioxidant protective enzyme system to ros depends on its chemical characteristics signal strength and the plant development stage of reactive oxygen species abid et al 2018 found that the activities of enzymes that protect against oxidation and the contents of mda and proline content of wheat increased with time during 10 days of drought at the tillering and elongation stages and the indicators of moderate drought group 55 60 fc could recover to the level of control within 3 days after rehydration but that of the severe drought group 35 40 fc was still higher than that of the control these findings are generally consistent with the experimental results from the s2 period of this study in this study enzyme activity also did not increase decrease with time at the same level of drought or rehydration the reason may be that although excessive ros may damage crops it is also a signaling substance therefore the plant must maintain a certain balance of ros through regulation of the antioxidant protective enzyme system gechev et al 2006 sun et al 2015 also found similar results the contents of pro and mda in strawberry leaves continued to increase with time over the course of a 10 day short term drought treatment while the activities of sod cat and pod began to decrease after a 6 day increase and the activity sod remained relatively higher the reason why cat pod and mda have limited response to soil moisture status is that their tendency to change is not as stable as those of sod and pro the activity of cat did not increase significantly during drought in s2 and s3 under the conditions of this experiment one reason for this could be because cat has a low affinity for h2o2 and it only becomes active at a high concentration of h2o2 kavas et al 2013 tan et al 2008 found that the regularity of the response of pod to water differed among varieties in addition nikolaeva et al 2010 found that the content of mda in leaves of three wheat species was affected by the synergistic effect of antioxidant protective enzymes in most studies these physiological indicators respond to changes in soil moisture and can be reversed during stress in general the trend is as follows a the content of pro generally increases in parallel with the time of drought b the activities of antioxidant protective enzymes and the content of mda differ during the process of drought owing to the test plan and variety but the responses of sod and pro are relatively stable the roc analysis in this study also verified these results this may be owing to the fact that pro is one of the main substances directly involved in the osmotic regulation of wheat and sod is the first defense of antioxidant protective enzyme system when the soil moisture changes 4 0 3 physiological parameters as a reference in optimized irrigation management the five leaf functional indicators used in this study are often used to evaluate the drought resistance of crops not only are samples easy to obtain but the methods of measurement are relatively well established and simple more importantly they are closely related to the photosynthesis and yield of wheat in a study on tomatoes hao et al 2019 found that the net photosynthetic rate during the whole period of growth highly significantly correlated with stomatal conductance and it also highly significantly correlated with the activities of sod cat and pod during the process of drought rehydration in each growth period the higher activities of sod and pod under drought stress are conducive to the development of pollen and male sterility so that winter wheat can maintain its grain number under drought stress to reduce the loss of yield dong et al 2017 the osmotic adjustment oa of wheat has a positive effect on maintaining the stability of yield under water deficit the correlation between oa and grain yield under greenhouse conditions increases with the severity of water deficit and a significant positive correlation also exists between the two under field conditions p 0 05 blum et al 1999 grichar et al 2004 moinuddin et al 2005 based on the results of the two season experiment this study used a roc analysis to quantify the sensitivity of physiological indicators to soil moisture changes and selected sod and pro auc 0 720 0 978 as the most significant of the indicators studied currently some physiological indicators with the same characteristics such as the net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance have been used to clarify the water demand of crops at different stages roche 2015 costa et al 2019 abid et al 2016 examining these physiological parameters during irrigation management or prediction models can simultaneously reflect the status of various drought resistant physiological mechanisms of crops and the corresponding status of soil moisture 4 0 4 conclusions when discussing the effects of rdi on winter wheat yield and wue this study showed that short term drought 45 75 fc within 9 days of a single growth period after jointing did not benefit the yield however mild and moderate 55 75 fc drought re watering treatments at the heading stage improved the wue subsequent studies should consider extending the duration of stress at this level 55 75 fc or enrich the irrigation scheme settings to find the threshold of drought compensation effect and the highest wue several aspects of this experiment demonstrate the feasibility of using leaf physiological indicators for drought resistance to reflect the status of soil moisture first the responses of sod cat pod mda and pro to the irrigation process were stress reversible and differences between treatments caused by drought can be detected during the stress period and 14 days after re watering this reflects the premise that leaf physiological function indicators can be used to reflect changes in soil moisture a quantitative analysis of roc shows that sod and pro were two of the five indicators that most effectively reflected the soil moisture status with the highest auc value of 0 978 moreover their rehydrated value and yield were significantly negatively correlated p 0 05 therefore based on the ease of acquisition of leaf samples and index determination they can be considered as a physiological reference tool that reflects both soil moisture status and crop physiological status providing a reference for monitoring soil moisture adjusting irrigation decisions and predicting yield by models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

10399,water productivity wp expressed as the yield produced per unit volume of water is an important indicator of water use in arid and semi arid areas due to complex plant cover and hydrological processes the quantification and assessment of wp are usually difficult to determine especially at the regional scale in this study an arid irrigated agro ecosystem in the upper yellow river basin was selected as a case study area based on field observation and model simulation results the wp of irrigation water wpi water applied wp i p and evapotranspiration wpet were calculated equivalent water productivity ewp of irrigation water ewpi water applied ewp i p and evapotranspiration ewpet were proposed and calculated to unify the disparate wp for various crops and natural vegetation results showed wpi and wp i p decreased with the increase of water application for all plants except watermelon indicating supplemental irrigation to watermelon is urgent to improve its production and wp i p the spatially averaged wpet kg m 3 was 2 47 for maize 0 80 for sunflower 12 3 for watermelon 1 39 for wheat and 0 65 for natural vegetation wpet for natural vegetation was usually lower in this salt stressed area compared with other water stressed areas the ewp revealed the rank order of wp for different crops and natural vegetation watermelon wheat maize sunflower for ewpi natural vegetation wheat watermelon maize sunflower for ewp i p and wheat sunflower watermelon maize natural vegetation for ewpet the relationship between ewp i p and ewpet was scale dependent due to the water reuse phenomena among different land cover types and the canals through the shallow groundwater system ignoring natural vegetation will result in considerable bias in the estimation of the regional scale water productivity 16 in this study wp improvement strategies such as transferring irrigation water from less productive sunflower areas to productive vegetable and natural vegetation areas reducing bare soil evaporation and constructing a timely and accurate irrigation drainage system were provided keywords equivalent water productivity water reuse model simulation field scale regional scale 1 introduction about 40 of the land and 35 of the world s population is under arid and semi arid climatic conditions el beltagy and madkour 2012 where water scarcity threatens food security environmental health and economic development in these areas water productivity wp expressed as the yield or benefit derived from the use of water has gained prominence molden and sakthivadivel 1999 hamdy et al 2003 playán and mateos 2006 pereira et al 2012 kang et al 2017 improving water productivity in arid irrigated agro ecosystems is considered as the key point for saving water and sustaining agricultural production and ecosystems due to land cover fragmentation and the spatial heterogeneity of land quality such as soil conditions and irrigation accessibility various kinds of crops usually exist in an irrigation system ren et al 2019b the yields of different crops are often not comparable e g the yield of vegetables can reach about 80 tons per hectare while oil crops are only several tons ren et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the market prices of different crops especially vegetables and fruits vary greatly during years in addition natural vegetation patches around croplands are often viewed inherently indispensable as viable land resources for producing forage or biofuel mclaughlin 2011 feng et al 2015 draining excess water and salt ren et al 2017 reducing runoff and pollutants liu et al 2017b and providing biodiversity refuges and habitat corridors tscharntke et al 2002 thus it is not easy to compare the water productivity of different crops and natural vegetation and to quantify the productivity of a whole agro ecosystem because of the aforementioned difficulties traditional water productivity assessment for an agro ecosystem is usually concentrated on the comparison of wp of the same crop singh et al 2006 jiang et al 2015 sun et al 2017 for the whole system previous studies typically used a simple accumulation of the yields of different crops for calculating regional scale water productivity ren et al 2019a huang and li 2010 cao et al 2012 however these methods have limitations in showing real spatial trends of field wp giving reasonable quantification of the regional wp and comparing wp between regions in arid irrigated agro ecosystems not only is crop growth highly reliant on irrigation water but also the prosperity of natural vegetation is directly or indirectly dependent on it e g the reuse of field percolation and canal seepage through capillary rise and the shallow groundwater system ayars et al 2006 ren et al 2018b due to the intense hydrological connectivity between the cropland and the natural land water productivity assessment for an agro ecosystem should consider not only the crops but also the natural vegetation however in traditional water productivity assessment natural vegetation in irrigation districts is usually ignored singh et al 2006 jiang et al 2015 xue et al 2018 above all a reasonable criterion to unify the wps of different crops and natural vegetation and integrate them for a whole region is necessary for water resource management quantifying and improving water productivity should be based on a clear understanding of the hydrological processes molden et al 2007 and the cause effect relationships between hydrological variables e g evaporation transpiration percolation and capillary rise and biophysical variables e g dry matter and grain yields singh et al 2006 in addition water productivity gains can only be accomplished by optimizing it both at the field scale and the regional scale bouman 2007 in irrigated agro ecosystems with shallow groundwater table depth the hydrological processes are very complex with frequent lateral groundwater exchange among different crop fields canals and drainage ditches ren et al 2016 2019b konukcu et al 2006 the shallow groundwater system plays an important role in the redistribution and reuse of the percolation or seepage water ren et al 2018b thus the quantification of the required hydrological variables is difficult the spatial distribution of crop yields is also difficult to obtain field experiments and regional observations are fundamental methods to quantify water productivity however they are usually time consuming and costly various kinds of simulation models have been developed and they are cost effective to quantify hydrological processes with appropriate field observations therefore the use of simulation models from field to regional scales should be an attractive approach to overcome the aforementioned difficulties for water productivity assessment droogers and kite 1999 singh et al 2006 xu et al 2019 for these reasons an arid irrigated agro ecosystem located in the upper yellow river basin was taken as a case study area to explore an appropriate approach for water productivity assessment the objectives of this study were to 1 propose a reasonable criterion to unify the water productivity of different crops and natural vegetation and 2 present a comprehensive analysis of water productivity in irrigated agroecosystems from the field scale to the regional scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description data collection and previous simulation the jiyuan irrigation system jiyuan 40 45 40 52 n 106 59 107 07 e ren et al 2019b located in the western region of hetao irrigaton district fig 1 in northern china was selected as a case study area it is a typical arid irrigated region covering an area of 8490 ha in which 60 7 is cropland 30 3 is natural vegetation land and the remaining surface is covered by residential land sand dunes and water bodies the climate topography hydrogeology irrigation and drainage systems have been described in ren et al 2018b 2019b a typical feature of the study area is the highly heterogeneous land use and land cover types fig 1 caused by the mosaic pattern of small mixed crop fields and natural vegetation patches individual crop fields range from 0 01 to 1 ha and natural patches range from 0 01 200 ha crop production within the cropland includes sunflower maize wheat and some vegetables e g watermelon pepper and tomato the natural lands are mainly sparse grassland with scattered shrubs with salt tolerant vegetation such as tamarix chinensis lour phragmites australis cav trin ex steud elymus dahuricus turcz and suaeda salsa l pall field observations were conducted in jiyuan during the growing season in 2012 and 2013 the data including soil physical properties soil water and salt dynamics irrigation groundwater crop growth and yield were obtained from more than 26 representative fields distributed in jiyuan ren et al 2019b daily meteorological data were collected from the nearby linhe weather station the year 2012 was a wet year while 2013 was a dry year according to the hydrological frequency analysis respectively with total precipitation 202 mm and 88 mm during the growing season crop and land use pattern maps were generated by large scale field survey as well as manual visual interpretation of high resolution google earth images about 0 5 m resolution to accurately identify the small mixed crop fields a total of five land cover types maize sunflower wheat vegetables and natural vegetation were classified for model simulation fig 1 because the vegetables watermelon tomato and pepper had similar crop calendars and irrigation scheduling watermelon was selected as a representative crop in this study jiyuan usually has 4 6 water diversions during the growing season from early may to late september for cropland irrigation the total water diversion during the growing season was 24 and 29 million m3 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the spatial distribution of field irrigation depth was obtained based on field observations and former studies ren et al 2019b generally the upstream areas have larger irrigation depths as they have more access to the water fig 2 crop fields were irrigated 1 4 times while natural patches were almost never irrigated eventually the total water irrigated to the crop field was respectively about 17 and 20 million m3 in 2012 and 2013 the canal conveyance efficiency the ratio of water volume delivered to the fields to the water diverted into the canals of the irrigation system was respectively 0 71 and 0 70 during the growing season in 2012 and 2013 based on the water balance calculation in ren et al 2018b for all the water diverted to jiyuan during the growing season about 83 was depleted through evapotranspiration et of crops and natural vegetation 13 was drained out of jiyuan and the rest 4 was for domestic use livestock and a few fishponds as the last part of water is small and its productivity is difficult to quantify it was deducted directly from the total water budget correspondingly the areas of residential land water body and sand dunes were also not considered in this study distributed hydrus dualkc modeling has been successfully conducted with the assistance of gis remote sensing data and a field observation network in the study area by ren et al 2019b the hydrus dualkc model ren et al 2016 2017 is a 1 d mechanistic model resulting from coupling the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2009 and the fao 56 dual crop coefficient dualkc approach allen et al 1998 the distributed simulation was implemented by independent runs of hydrus dualkc model in all the homogenous simulation units which were obtained by overlaying thematic map layers of vegetation irrigation soil and groundwater depth model simulations provided a detailed description of the spatial variation of water budgets in different fields including evaporation transpiration bottom upward and downward fluxes as well as the lateral groundwater and salt exchange between different simulation units ren et al 2019b the actual evapotranspiration et a was highly heterogeneous among fields ranging between 162 and 567 mm fig 3 spatially averaged et a for maize and sunflower were larger than that for wheat vegetables and natural vegetation in the two years table 1 the net bottom water flux of sunflower field was negative indicating excessive water was applied precipitation and irrigation and groundwater was recharged during the growing season vegetables wheat and natural vegetation had net upward water flux indicating significant groundwater depletion the upward flux of natural vegetation reached 230 mm and 278 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively because the natural land was never irrigated and vegetation was highly dependent on the shallow groundwater for the whole region the et a of the wet year 2012 512 mm was higher than the dry year 2013 484 mm table 2 in addition cropland et a was higher than that for the natural land thus higher than the et a of the total area i e the spatial average of the cropland et a and the natural land et a net groundwater outflow from the cropland was respectively 3 99 106 m3 73 mm and 7 66 106 m3 149 mm in 2012 and 2013 while groundwater inflow to the natural land was respectively 3 94 106 m3 175 mm and 7 74 106 m3 301 mm table 2 2 2 yield calculation in this study the yield of each crop was calculated based on the previous simulation results using the crop yield response to water relationship adopted from doorenbos and kassam 1979 1 y a y m 1 k y 1 t a t m where ym and ya are the maximum and actual crop yields kg ha 1 ky is the yield response factor i e effect of water or salt stress on yield for a given crop tm and ta are the maximum and actual cumulative transpirations mm season 1 the yields of maize sunflower and wheat refer to air dried grain yields while the yield of watermelon refers to fresh fruits with commercial value for natural vegetation patches the implementation of their value or function in an agro ecosystem is highly dependent on the primary productivity therefore eq 1 was also used to calculate the production of natural land where ym and ya are the maximum and actual aboveground dry matter kg ha 1 respectively ym for the considered crops were obtained from local surveys the ym of natural vegetation was specified based on field observation and former studies ge et al 2010 liu et al 2011 values of ky for crops were first obtained from fao irrigation and drainage paper no 33 and then adjusted during model calibration given that the amount of dry matter produced by any plant and the water it transpires are proportional arkley 1963 a ky 1 was assigned to natural vegetation tm was determined through the product of the reference crop evapotranspiration eto times the basal crop coefficient kcb under standard conditions allen et al 1998 ta was the output of the hydrus dualkc model field observation yields of the different crops and natural vegetation in 2012 and 2013 were used to calibrate and validate the model a total of 26 yield observation points 6 maize points 10 sunflower points 2 watermelon points 4 wheat points and 4 natural vegetation points in 2012 and 33 yield observation points 13 maize points 11 sunflower points 3 watermelon points 2 wheat points and 4 natural vegetation points in 2013 were used for model calibration and validation the root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 were used as indicators to evaluate model performance xu et al 2013 2 3 water productivity calculation water productivity wp is defined as the ratio of the net benefits from crop forestry fishery livestock and mixed agricultural systems to the amount of water used to produce those benefits molden et al 2010 various expressions of wp have been proposed with different purposes in the past decades with the numerator being grain yield liu et al 2007 biomass steduto et al 2007 or monetary value molden and sakthivadivel 1999 and the denominator being transpiration viets 1962 evapotranspiration zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 irrigation bastiaanssen et al 2003 water applied playán and mateos 2006 water costs rodrigues and pereira 2009 or other parameters combined pereira et al 2012 due to the coexistence of cropland and natural land in the study area the wp in this study is expressed as crop yield and aboveground dry matter produced per unit volume of water kg m 3 in crop production systems and the natural land respectively the following definitions were selected 2 w p i y a i 3 w p i p y a i p 4 w p i p y a i p where ya is actual crop yield kg ha 1 i is irrigation amount at the field scale or water diversion at the regional scale m3 ha 1 p is precipitation m3 ha 1 eta is actual evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 wpi wp i p and wpet are respectively the water productivity of irrigation i water applied i p and actual evapotranspiration eta kg m 3 the spatial domain boundary for the field scale is the field of a certain crop or natural vegetation patch from canopy surface to the 300 cm depth of soil profile for the regional scale the boundary is the whole jiyuan area without residential land water body and sand dune from surface to the first impermeable layer irrigation canals and drainage ditches were included in the study domain the temporal domain is the growing season from may 1 to september 30 each year to compare with previous studies the wpet of natural vegetation was further converted to water use efficiency wue g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 i e the ratio of ecosystem gross carbon assimilation to et hu et al 2008 which was widely used in grassland ecosystem studies the following equation was used for the conversion 5 w u e w p e t γ e t γ c γ b where γet is the ratio of the growing season et i e the et used to calculate wpet to the yearly et γc is the carbon concentration of dry biomass γb is the ratio of aboveground dry biomass to total biomass γet 0 74 was used in this study based on the previous studies ren et al 2018b 2019b the values of γc and γb were derived from zheng et al 2007 and wang et al 2010 of 0 45 and 0 56 respectively in order to compare the wp at the regional scale the yield of a certain crop or the aboveground dry matter of natural vegetation ya was further converted to equivalent yield of a reference crop using the following equation 6 y e y m r y m y a where ye is the equivalent yield and ym r is the maximum yield of the reference crop in this study spring maize was selected as reference crop and all other crop yields or dry matter of vegetation were further converted to the yield of maize for wp calculation and comparison the converted wp was defined as equivalent water productivity ewp and marked as ewpi ewp i p and ewpet corresponding to the definitions of eq s 2 3 and 4 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 yield of crops and natural vegetation results showed the simulated yields of maize sunflower wheat and natural vegetation fit well with field observations fig 4 watermelon yields in the two years were also estimated well with relative errors within 7 calibrated parameters ym and ky and simulated yield variation of different crops at jiyuan in 2012 wet year and 2013 dry year are shown in table 3 the calibrated ym 16 0 t ha 1 for maize was larger than the maximum yield reported by li et al 2020 15 5 t ha 1 while lower than that reported by liu et al 2017 17 8 t ha 1 who obtained the values through drip irrigation experiments in the same region the calibrated ky 1 25 for maize was a little larger than the results derived from liu et al 2017 ky 1 1 for sunflower the calibrated ym 4 5 t ha 1 was slightly lower than the maximum yield obtained by li et al 2015 4 8 t ha 1 through drip irrigation experiment in hetao while the calibrated ky 0 95 was higher than that obtained by erdem and delibas 2003 ky 0 85 under tekirdag conditions the calibrated ym 75 t ha 1 and ky 1 10 for watermelon were both within the ranges of previous studies ym 50 86 t ha 1 ky 1 0 1 3 lei et al 2003 şimşek et al 2004 abdelkhalik et al 2019 for spring wheat the ym 7 5 t ha 1 and ky 1 15 obtained in this study agreed with those reported by dong et al 2011 and haghverdi et al 2014 of 7 4 t ha 1 and 1 12 respectively for the sparse natural vegetation the ym 9 0 t ha 1 and ky 1 0 also worked well and similar to previous studies akhter et al 2003 ge et al 2010 liu et al 2011 the good model performance and reasonable parameters indicated that the simulated yield could be used for evaluating water productivity the simulated yield of maize in 2012 ranged from 9 6 14 7 t ha 1 and spatially averaged 13 5 t ha 1 about 14 higher than that in 2013 11 8 t ha 1 watermelon showed a significantly higher yield 45 higher in 2012 67 6 t ha 1 when compared with that of 2013 46 5 t ha 1 with similar eto during the growing season in 2012 753 mm and 2013 762 mm crop water requirements during the two years were almost the same the higher yield in the wet year 2012 indicated that these two crops especially watermelon were more reliant on precipitation due to insufficient irrigation for water supplement or salt leaching the yields of sunflower 4 3 4 4 t ha 1 and wheat 6 8 6 9 t ha 1 were almost the same between the two years indicating sufficient irrigation to the two crops the simulated dry biomass of natural vegetation was only about 30 of its maximum value it was because the natural land was almost never irrigated and vegetation was under poor conditions with very low canopy coverage ren et al 2019b in addition the dry biomass of natural vegetation had greater spatial variation than that of the crops with coefficients of variation cv reaching 0 34 and 0 37 in 2012 and 2013 respectively table 3 the reason may be that the conditions e g groundwater soil and vegetation species of natural patches were highly different in the region with less human intervention yield of different crops including natural vegetation from each field in the study area was converted to maize equivalent yield ye using eq 6 ye is a reflection of the growth conditions of different plants with higher value representing a better condition results showed ye varied greatly from 2 0 15 9 t ha 1 with that in 2012 usually higher than 2013 fig 5 the ye of sunflower and wheat was usually the highest reaching about 15 t ha 1 maize and watermelon also had relatively higher ye of about 12 t ha 1 the ye of natural vegetation was the lowest only about 5 t ha 1 for the whole region ye showed a fragmented distribution with no obvious spatial trend corresponding to land cover types fig 6 therefore the current growth conditions of sunflower and wheat were superior to that of the other crops especially the natural vegetation 3 2 field scale water productivity the water productivity of different crops and the natural vegetation was first calculated using the simulated actual yield y a and water balance components as wpi wp i p and wpet table 4 the wpi of maize sunflower watermelon and wheat decreased with the increase of irrigation amount fig 7 the wp i p was smaller than wpi for the different crops for natural vegetation the wp i p in 2012 was 50 smaller than that in 2013 it was because the water applied irrigation in 2012 was far more than that in 2013 while vegetation growth was not improved much for natural vegetation and all the crops except watermelon wp i p decreased with the increase of water applied fig 7 it indicated that the marginal benefit of increasing water application to these plants was decreasing however for watermelon the wp i p increased with increasing of water application comparing year 2013 with 2012 this suggested that a supplemental irrigation to watermelon during the growth period is needed to improve its production and wp i p wpet was usually smaller than wp i p for the different crops and natural vegetation table 4 this implies that the water applied was insufficient for evapotranspiration thus soil water or groundwater were depleted to make up the deficit during the growing season the absolute values of regression coefficients and r2 between wpet and eta were usually smaller than those between wpi and irrigation i and between wp i p and water applied i p for different plants thus the correlations between wpet and eta were relatively weak with the increase of eta wpet slightly increased for maize while decreased for all the other crops and natural vegetation fig 7 the wpet of a certain crop for the two years was very similar with average values kg m 3 of 2 47 for maize 0 80 for sunflower 12 3 for vegetables 1 39 for wheat and 0 65 for natural vegetation the wpet for maize in this study was smaller than that reported by liu et al 2017a which obtained wpet from a drip irrigation experiment in hetao with values ranging between 3 1 and 5 3 kg m 3 however it was close to the result from a lysimetric experiment of about 2 3 kg m 3 in the region gao et al 2017 due to the similar basin irrigation applied the wpet for sunflower was slightly higher than that from a saline water irrigation study wpet 0 47 0 76 kg m 3 he et al 2016 while lower than that from a drip irrigation study in hetao wpet 1 22 1 78 kg m 3 li et al 2015 for spring wheat the wpet in this study was comparable with the previous study in this region which reported values ranging from 1 1 to 1 9 kg m 3 dong et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 xu et al 2013 the wpet of watermelon was significantly lower than that reported by lei et al 2003 wpet 14 3 39 2 kg m 3 it was mainly because the water balance period in this study was about 2 months longer than the actual watermelon growth period and the study mentioned above was conducted with drip irrigation the natural vegetation wpet was converted to wue using eq 5 resulting in a value of 0 39 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 it was equal to the average annual grassland wue of china as reported by liu et al 2015 however it was obviously lower than the global grassland or shrubland wue 0 67 0 81 g c kg 1 h2o ito and inatomi 2012 and the mean annual grassland wue of southern united states 0 54 g c kg 1 h2o tian et al 2010 in addition previous studies conducted in other arid or semi arid grasslands in china also showed a wue 0 63 0 80 g c kg 1 h2o higher than that in this study hu et al 2008 tang et al 2017 the relatively low wue wpet for natural land in this study was mainly caused by the serious soil salinity problems due to the high salt content vegetation in natural patches was mainly halophytic and the canopy coverage was very low in addition the soil water content was usually high due to the shallow groundwater depth thus soil evaporation was high and it caused a relatively high et a of natural land with lower canopy coverage biomass and higher et a the wpet was usually lower in such salt stressed areas compared with the areas only with water stress the equivalent water productivity i e ewpi ewp i p and ewpet of different crops and natural vegetation was calculated as the ratio of their maize equivalent yield ye to the corresponding water balance components i e i i p and eta fig 8 results showed that the average ewpi in the two years for irrigated crops followed this rank order watermelon 6 85 kg m 3 wheat 6 02 kg m 3 maize 4 33 kg m 3 sunflower 3 92 kg m 3 table 4 it indicated the water irrigated on vegetable fields was most efficiently used while that applied to the sunflower field was least efficiently used the average ewp i p was lower than ewpi with an order of natural vegetation 4 06 kg m 3 wheat 3 92 kg m 3 watermelon 3 75 kg m 3 maize 2 90 kg m 3 sunflower 2 82 kg m 3 the natural land had the highest ewp i p as only precipitation was applied to it for the crops the order of ewp i p was similar to that of ewpi overall the equivalent water productivity of irrigation water i or water applied i p was higher in natural land vegetable and wheat fields while lower in maize and sunflower fields however the average ewpet showed an order of wheat 2 97 kg m 3 sunflower 2 83 kg m 3 watermelon 2 62 kg m 3 maize 2 47 kg m 3 natural vegetation 1 16 kg m 3 thus compared with watermelon maize and natural vegetation wheat and sunflower had a higher use efficiency of the evapotranspirated water the ewpet was obviously lower than ewp i p for all the crops and natural vegetation except for sunflower which had an ewpet slightly higher than ewp i p this indicated again that water applied i p for most crops and natural vegetation was not enough for their evapotranspiration and the soil water or groundwater may be depleted to supply the deficit during the growing season the spatial distribution of field scale ewp i p and ewpet is shown in fig 9 the ewp i p for cropland showed an increasing trend from south to north while that for the natural land showed a decreasing trend the spatial pattern of ewp i p for cropland was caused by the increasing trend of ye fig 6 and the decreasing trend of water applied fig 2 from south to north the spatial distribution of ewp i p for natural land was mainly dominated by the distribution of canopy coverage f c with higher f c south resulting in a larger ewp i p on the whole ewp i p was larger in the dry year 2013 ewpet did not display specific spatial trends except it was usually higher in the croplands along the two branch canals fig 9 it might be caused by the higher surface elevation and deeper groundwater depth along the major canals and thus bare soil evaporation was low ren et al 2018a in addition these areas also had more access to canal water for timely irrigation 3 3 regional scale water productivity for cropland spatially averaged ye was respectively 14 6 and 14 2 t ha 1 in 2012 and 2013 the ewp i p values in the two years were almost the same at about 2 45 kg m 3 ewpet was also very similar with values of 2 70 and 2 75 kg m 3 in 2012 and 2013 table 5 ewpi in 2012 3 7 kg m 3 was larger than that in 2013 2 87 kg m 3 due to less water diversion and higher yield in the wet year 2012 for the whole region if the production of natural vegetation was ignored as in traditional water productivity assessment the ewpi ewp i p and ewpet were respectively 3 40 2 04 and 2 02 kg m 3 in 2012 and 2 87 2 26 and 1 95 kg m 3 in 2013 however when natural vegetation production was considered the values of these water productivities can be increased by about 16 in this study table 5 it indicated that ignoring the natural vegetation will result in considerable bias in the estimation of the regional scale water productivity for cropland ewp i p was smaller than ewpet at the regional scale it indicated the water applied water diversion and precipitation to the cropland exceeded the crop et this was in contrast with aforementioned field scale results where water applied was less than et it was because the amount of water directly irrigated to crop fields was only about 70 of that diverted to the cropland due to low canal conveyance efficiency most of the water loss recharged to the shallow groundwater systems through canal seepage and can be reused by crops through capillary rise thus for cropland the water applied at the field scale was insufficient while that at the regional scale was enough the excess water at the regional scale was temporarily stored in the shallow groundwater system ren et al 2018b however for the total area natural land included ewp i p was larger than ewpet table 5 indicating the water applied water diversion and precipitation to the whole region was less than the total et again therefore when natural land was considered besides the depletion of the above temporarily stored groundwater water original soil water or groundwater storage was also consumed by et during the growing season in order to maintain the balance of the soil water and groundwater between years and to leach salt an irrigation called autumn irrigation was applied after harvest in early october because the land was fallow from october to next april in the study area this time period as well as the autumn irrigation is beyond the discussion of this study 3 4 water productivity improvement water productivity should be improved with limited water diversion to confront water scarcity while with relatively higher yield to defend farmers interests for the whole agro ecosystem all water applied precipitation and irrigation was consumed except some abandoned and drainage water with relatively high tds total dissolved solids g l 1 which flows out of the region to improve water productivity of the whole agro ecosystem the values of ewpi ewp i p and ewpet should be considered synergistically as they can provide multiple perspectives to improve ewpi irrigation water should be used more efficiently to produce more with the current or less amount of water measures such as reducing abandoned water during irrigation and improving salt drainage efficiency drain more salt with less water can be adopted to reserve more irrigation water for crops and natural vegetation water irrigated to crops with lower ewpi e g sunflower and maize can be reduced while that to the crops with higher ewpi e g vegetable and wheat can be increased reserving a certain amount of water for the natural vegetation will largely improve total water productivity ewp i p of the whole region field irrigation should be more timely and efficient to coordinate with precipitation thus attaining higher production the ewpet of the whole region regional scale was low about 2 3 kg m 3 compared with that of crop fields 2 35 3 15 kg m 3 field scale to increase ewpet yield should be increased while evapotranspiration should be decreased as much as possible the actual yield of natural vegetation maize and watermelon had a relatively large gap with their potential values table 3 salt stress had been proved to be the main reason causing the yield gaps ren et al 2016 in addition the non beneficial bare soil evaporation of natural vegetation vegetable and sunflower during the growing season was relatively high compared with that of other similar places around the world kool et al 2014 ren et al 2019b which contributed to the high et therefore the productive water flows e g transpiration should be increased to enhance yield and the unproductive water flows e g evaporation should be reduced to limit et prochnow et al 2012 previous study showed that proper water and salt management such as additional irrigation for natural land and vegetables and groundwater depth optimization can increase yield production and decrease bare soil evaporation significantly ren et al 2018a with the advantage of accurately supplying water to plant roots drip irrigation also showed a higher wpet compared with basin irrigation as discussed in 3 1 liu et al 2017a li et al 2015 lei et al 2003 thus these measures can be adopted to increase water productivity in this region to realize the above management strategies a more efficient water conveyance irrigation and drainage system is needed it should include well lined canals or tubes modern irrigation technologies e g drip irrigation and powerful groundwater control systems e g pipe drainage system an efficient system can ensure field irrigation and drainage are more timely and accurate thus water requirements of crops during some critical periods can be directly met without through the shallow groundwater system i e water temporarily stored by the groundwater reservoir due to percolation or canal seepage and reused later irrigation water is better used directly rather than through reuse especially in areas with salinity problems direct water use through field irrigation would enhance salt leaching while water reuse through capillary rise usually aggravates salt accumulation and reduces ewpet therefore improving the traditional irrigation to accurately apply irrigation through efficient water management systems will improve water productivity 4 conclusions water productivity wp in various forms was calculated from field to regional scales based on field observation and model simulation results in an arid irrigated agro ecosystem in hetao irrigation district of the upper yellow river basin the wp of different crops natural vegetation cropland and the whole region was analyzed and compared results showed wpi and wp i p decreased with the increase of water applied for all plants except watermelon a supplemental irrigation to watermelon is urgent to improve its production and wp i p the spatially averaged wpet kg m 3 was 2 47 for maize 0 80 for sunflower 12 3 for vegetables 1 39 for wheat and 0 65 for natural vegetation the wpet values of the different crops were lower than those of previous drip irrigation studies further they were not affected by the amount of water application during the two years in this salt stressed area wpet for natural vegetation was usually lower compared with that in water deficit areas equivalent water productivity ewp proved to be useful for comparison of different crops and showing the spatial distribution of wp for the cropland ewp i p was higher than ewpet at the field scale while ewp i p was lower than ewpet at the regional scale for the whole region natural land considered ewp i p was again higher than ewpet the disparate characteristics of wp for different crops and natural vegetation were mainly caused by the complex hydrological processes and crop pattern especially the significant water reuse phenomena among different land cover types and the canals through shallow groundwater systems for a region ignoring natural vegetation will result in considerable bias in the estimation of the regional scale water productivity 16 in this study the various forms of wp provided different perspectives on wp improvement irrigation water can be transferred from less productive sunflower areas to productive vegetable and natural vegetation areas based on the rank order of ewpi and ewp i p to improve wp ewpet indicated the importance of reducing bare soil evaporation in wp improvement through the comparison of ewp i p and ewpet at different scales it was found that timely and accurate irrigation guaranteed by an efficient water management system was better than water

phenomena among different land cover types and the canals through the shallow groundwater system ignoring natural vegetation will result in considerable bias in the estimation of the regional scale

liu et al 2017b and providing biodiversity refuges and habitat corridors tscharntke et al 2002 thus it is not easy to compare the water productivity of different crops and natural vegetation and to quantify the productivity of a whole agro ecosystem because of the aforementioned difficulties traditional water productivity assessment for an agro ecosystem is usually concentrated on the comparison of wp of the same crop singh et al 2006 jiang et al 2015 sun et al 2017 for the whole system previous studies typically used a simple accumulation of the yields of different crops for calculating regional scale water productivity ren et al 2019a huang and li 2010 cao et al 2012 however these methods have limitations in showing real spatial trends of field wp giving reasonable quantification of the regional wp and comparing wp between regions in arid irrigated agro ecosystems not only is crop growth highly reliant on irrigation water but also the prosperity of natural vegetation is directly or indirectly dependent on it e g the reuse of field percolation and canal seepage through capillary rise and the shallow groundwater system ayars et al 2006 ren et al 2018b due to the intense hydrological connectivity between the cropland and the natural land water productivity assessment for an agro ecosystem should consider not only the crops but also the natural vegetation however in traditional water productivity assessment natural vegetation in irrigation districts is usually ignored singh et al 2006 jiang et al 2015 xue et al 2018 above all a reasonable criterion to unify the wps of different crops and natural vegetation and integrate them for a whole region is necessary for water resource management quantifying and improving water productivity should be based on a clear understanding of the hydrological processes molden et al 2007 and the cause effect relationships between hydrological variables e g evaporation transpiration percolation and capillary rise and biophysical variables e g dry matter and grain yields singh et al 2006 in addition water productivity gains can only be accomplished by optimizing it both at the field scale and the regional scale bouman 2007 in irrigated agro ecosystems with shallow groundwater table depth the hydrological processes are very complex with frequent lateral groundwater exchange among different crop fields canals and drainage ditches ren et al 2016 2019b konukcu et al 2006 the shallow groundwater system plays an important role in the redistribution and reuse of the percolation or seepage water ren et al 2018b thus the quantification of the required hydrological variables is difficult the spatial distribution of crop yields is also difficult to obtain field experiments and regional observations are fundamental methods to quantify water productivity however they are usually time consuming and costly various kinds of simulation models have been developed and they are cost effective to quantify hydrological processes with appropriate field observations therefore the use of simulation models from field to regional scales should be an attractive approach to overcome the aforementioned difficulties for water productivity assessment droogers and kite 1999 singh et al 2006 xu et al 2019 for these reasons an arid irrigated agro ecosystem located in the upper yellow river basin was taken as a case study area to explore an appropriate approach for water productivity assessment the objectives of this study were to 1 propose a reasonable criterion to unify the water productivity of different crops and natural vegetation and 2 present a comprehensive analysis of water productivity in irrigated agroecosystems from the field scale to the regional scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description data collection and previous simulation the jiyuan irrigation system jiyuan 40 45 40 52 n 106 59 107 07 e ren et al 2019b located in the western region of hetao irrigaton district fig 1 in northern china was selected as a case study area it is a typical arid irrigated region covering an area of 8490 ha in which 60 7 is cropland 30 3 is natural vegetation land and the remaining surface is covered by residential land sand dunes and water bodies the climate topography hydrogeology irrigation and drainage systems have been described in ren et al 2018b 2019b a typical feature of the study area is the highly heterogeneous land use and land cover types fig 1 caused by the mosaic pattern of small mixed crop fields and natural vegetation patches individual crop fields range from 0 01 to 1 ha and natural patches range from 0 01 200 ha crop production within the cropland includes sunflower maize wheat and some vegetables e g watermelon pepper and tomato the natural lands are mainly sparse grassland with scattered shrubs with salt tolerant vegetation such as tamarix chinensis lour phragmites australis cav trin ex steud elymus dahuricus turcz and suaeda salsa l pall field observations were conducted in jiyuan during the growing season in 2012 and 2013 the data including soil physical properties soil water and salt dynamics irrigation groundwater crop growth and yield were obtained from more than 26 representative fields distributed in jiyuan ren et al 2019b daily meteorological data were collected from the nearby linhe weather station the year 2012 was a wet year while 2013 was a dry year according to the hydrological frequency analysis respectively with total precipitation 202 mm and 88 mm during the growing season crop and land use pattern maps were generated by large scale field survey as well as manual visual interpretation of high resolution google earth images about 0 5 m resolution to accurately identify the small mixed crop fields a total of five land cover types maize sunflower wheat vegetables and natural vegetation were classified for model simulation fig 1 because the vegetables watermelon tomato and pepper had similar crop calendars and irrigation scheduling watermelon was selected as a representative crop in this study jiyuan usually has 4 6 water diversions during the growing season from early may to late september for cropland irrigation the total water diversion during the growing season was 24 and 29 million m3 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the spatial distribution of field irrigation depth was obtained based on field observations and former studies ren et al 2019b generally the upstream areas have larger irrigation depths as they have more access to the water fig 2 crop fields were irrigated 1 4 times while natural patches were almost never irrigated eventually the total water irrigated to the crop field was respectively about 17 and 20 million m3 in 2012 and 2013 the canal conveyance efficiency the ratio of water volume delivered to the fields to the water diverted into the canals of the irrigation system was respectively 0 71 and 0 70 during the growing season in 2012 and 2013 based on the water balance calculation in ren et al 2018b for all the water diverted to jiyuan during the growing season about 83 was depleted through evapotranspiration et of crops and natural vegetation 13 was drained out of jiyuan and the rest 4 was for domestic use livestock and a few fishponds as the last part of water is small and its productivity is difficult to quantify it was deducted directly from the total water budget correspondingly the areas of residential land water body and sand dunes were also not considered in this study distributed hydrus dualkc modeling has been successfully conducted with the assistance of gis remote sensing data and a field observation network in the study area by ren et al 2019b the hydrus dualkc model ren et al 2016 2017 is a 1 d mechanistic model resulting from coupling the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2009 and the fao 56 dual crop coefficient dualkc approach allen et al 1998 the distributed simulation was implemented by independent runs of hydrus dualkc model in all the homogenous simulation units which were obtained by overlaying thematic map layers of vegetation irrigation soil and groundwater depth model simulations provided a detailed description of the spatial variation of water budgets in different fields including evaporation transpiration bottom upward and downward fluxes as well as the lateral groundwater and salt exchange between different simulation units ren et al 2019b the actual evapotranspiration et a was highly heterogeneous among fields ranging between 162 and 567 mm fig 3 spatially averaged et a for maize and sunflower were larger than that for wheat vegetables and natural vegetation in the two years table 1 the net bottom water flux of sunflower field was negative indicating excessive water was applied precipitation and irrigation and groundwater was recharged during the growing season vegetables wheat and natural vegetation had net upward water flux indicating significant groundwater depletion the upward flux of natural vegetation reached 230 mm and 278 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively because the natural land was never irrigated and vegetation was highly dependent on the shallow groundwater for the whole region the et a of the wet year 2012 512 mm was higher than the dry year 2013 484 mm table 2 in addition cropland et a was higher than that for the natural land thus higher than the et a of the total area i e the spatial average of the cropland et a and the natural land et a net groundwater outflow from the cropland was respectively 3 99 106 m3 73 mm and 7 66 106 m3 149 mm in 2012 and 2013 while groundwater inflow to the natural land was respectively 3 94 106 m3 175 mm and 7 74 106 m3 301 mm table 2 2 2 yield calculation in this study the yield of each crop was calculated based on the previous simulation results using the crop yield response to water relationship adopted from doorenbos and kassam 1979 1 y a y m 1 k y 1 t a t m where ym and ya are the maximum and actual crop yields kg ha 1 ky is the yield response factor i e effect of water or salt stress on yield for a given crop tm and ta are the maximum and actual cumulative transpirations mm season 1 the yields of maize sunflower and wheat refer to air dried grain yields while the yield of watermelon refers to fresh fruits with commercial value for natural vegetation patches the implementation of their value or function in an agro ecosystem is highly dependent on the primary productivity therefore eq 1 was also used to calculate the production of natural land where ym and ya are the maximum and actual aboveground dry matter kg ha 1 respectively ym for the considered crops were obtained from local surveys the ym of natural vegetation was specified based on field observation and former studies ge et al 2010 liu et al 2011 values of ky for crops were first obtained from fao irrigation and drainage paper no 33 and then adjusted during model calibration given that the amount of dry matter produced by any plant and the water it transpires are proportional arkley 1963 a ky 1 was assigned to natural vegetation tm was determined through the product of the reference crop evapotranspiration eto times the basal crop coefficient kcb under standard conditions allen et al 1998 ta was the output of the hydrus dualkc model field observation yields of the different crops and natural vegetation in 2012 and 2013 were used to calibrate and validate the model a total of 26 yield observation points 6 maize points 10 sunflower points 2 watermelon points 4 wheat points and 4 natural vegetation points in 2012 and 33 yield observation points 13 maize points 11 sunflower points 3 watermelon points 2 wheat points and 4 natural vegetation points in 2013 were used for model calibration and validation the root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 were used as indicators to evaluate model performance xu et al 2013 2 3 water productivity calculation water productivity wp is defined as the ratio of the net benefits from crop forestry fishery livestock and mixed agricultural systems to the amount of water used to produce those benefits molden et al 2010 various expressions of wp have been proposed with different purposes in the past decades with the numerator being grain yield liu et al 2007 biomass steduto et al 2007 or monetary value molden and sakthivadivel 1999 and the denominator being transpiration viets 1962 evapotranspiration zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 irrigation bastiaanssen et al 2003 water applied playán and mateos 2006 water costs rodrigues and pereira 2009 or other parameters combined pereira et al 2012 due to the coexistence of cropland and natural land in the study area the wp in this study is expressed as crop yield and aboveground dry matter produced per unit volume of water kg m 3 in crop production systems and the natural land respectively the following definitions were selected 2 w p i y a i 3 w p i p y a i p 4 w p i p y a i p where ya is actual crop yield kg ha 1 i is irrigation amount at the field scale or water diversion at the regional scale m3 ha 1 p is precipitation m3 ha 1 eta is actual evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 wpi wp i p and wpet are respectively the water productivity of irrigation i water applied i p and actual evapotranspiration eta kg m 3 the spatial domain boundary for the field scale is the field of a certain crop or natural vegetation patch from canopy surface to the 300 cm depth of soil profile for the regional scale the boundary is the whole jiyuan area without residential land water body and sand dune from surface to the first impermeable layer irrigation canals and drainage ditches were included in the study domain the temporal domain is the growing season from may 1 to september 30 each year to compare with previous studies the wpet of natural vegetation was further converted to water use efficiency wue g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 i e the ratio of ecosystem gross carbon assimilation to et hu et al 2008 which was widely used in grassland ecosystem studies the following equation was used for the conversion 5 w u e w p e t γ e t γ c γ b where γet is the ratio of the growing season et i e the et used to calculate wpet to the yearly et γc is the carbon concentration of dry biomass γb is the ratio of aboveground dry biomass to total biomass γet 0 74 was used in this study based on the previous studies ren et al 2018b 2019b the values of γc and γb were derived from zheng et al 2007 and wang et al 2010 of 0 45 and 0 56 respectively in order to compare the wp at the regional scale the yield of a certain crop or the aboveground dry matter of natural vegetation ya was further converted to equivalent yield of a reference crop using the following equation 6 y e y m r y m y a where ye is the equivalent yield and ym r is the maximum yield of the reference crop in this study spring maize was selected as reference crop and all other crop yields or dry matter of vegetation were further converted to the yield of maize for wp calculation and comparison the converted wp was defined as equivalent water productivity ewp and marked as ewpi ewp i p and ewpet corresponding to the definitions of eq s 2 3 and 4 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 yield of crops and natural vegetation results showed the simulated yields of maize sunflower wheat and natural vegetation fit well with field observations fig 4 watermelon yields in the two years were also estimated well with relative errors within 7 calibrated parameters ym and ky and simulated yield variation of different crops at jiyuan in 2012 wet year and 2013 dry year are shown in table 3 the calibrated ym 16 0 t ha 1 for maize was larger than the maximum yield reported by li et al 2020 15 5 t ha 1 while lower than that reported by liu et al 2017 17 8 t ha 1 who obtained the values through drip irrigation experiments in the same region the calibrated ky 1 25 for maize was a little larger than the results derived from liu et al 2017 ky 1 1 for sunflower the calibrated ym 4 5 t ha 1 was slightly lower than the maximum yield obtained by li et al 2015 4 8 t ha 1 through drip irrigation experiment in hetao while the calibrated ky 0 95 was higher than that obtained by erdem and delibas 2003 ky 0 85 under tekirdag conditions the calibrated ym 75 t ha 1 and ky 1 10 for watermelon were both within the ranges of previous studies ym 50 86 t ha 1 ky 1 0 1 3 lei et al 2003 şimşek et al 2004 abdelkhalik et al 2019 for spring wheat the ym 7 5 t ha 1 and ky 1 15 obtained in this study agreed with those reported by dong et al 2011 and haghverdi et al 2014 of 7 4 t ha 1 and 1 12 respectively for the sparse natural vegetation the ym 9 0 t ha 1 and ky 1 0 also worked well and similar to previous studies akhter et al 2003 ge et al 2010 liu et al 2011 the good model performance and reasonable parameters indicated that the simulated yield could be used for evaluating water productivity the simulated yield of maize in 2012 ranged from 9 6 14 7 t ha 1 and spatially averaged 13 5 t ha 1 about 14 higher than that in 2013 11 8 t ha 1 watermelon showed a significantly higher yield 45 higher in 2012 67 6 t ha 1 when compared with that of 2013 46 5 t ha 1 with similar eto during the growing season in 2012 753 mm and 2013 762 mm crop water requirements during the two years were almost the same the higher yield in the wet year 2012 indicated that these two crops especially watermelon were more reliant on precipitation due to insufficient irrigation for water supplement or salt leaching the yields of sunflower 4 3 4 4 t ha 1 and wheat 6 8 6 9 t ha 1 were almost the same between the two years indicating sufficient irrigation to the two crops the simulated dry biomass of natural vegetation was only about 30 of its maximum value it was because the natural land was almost never irrigated and vegetation was under poor conditions with very low canopy coverage ren et al 2019b in addition the dry biomass of natural vegetation had greater spatial variation than that of the crops with coefficients of variation cv reaching 0 34 and 0 37 in 2012 and 2013 respectively table 3 the reason may be that the conditions e g groundwater soil and vegetation species of natural patches were highly different in the region with less human intervention yield of different crops including natural vegetation from each field in the study area was converted to maize equivalent yield ye using eq 6 ye is a reflection of the growth conditions of different plants with higher value representing a better condition results showed ye varied greatly from 2 0 15 9 t ha 1 with that in 2012 usually higher than 2013 fig 5 the ye of sunflower and wheat was usually the highest reaching about 15 t ha 1 maize and watermelon also had relatively higher ye of about 12 t ha 1 the ye of natural vegetation was the lowest only about 5 t ha 1 for the whole region ye showed a fragmented distribution with no obvious spatial trend corresponding to land cover types fig 6 therefore the current growth conditions of sunflower and wheat were superior to that of the other crops especially the natural vegetation 3 2 field scale water productivity the water productivity of different crops and the natural vegetation was first calculated using the simulated actual yield y a and water balance components as wpi wp i p and wpet table 4 the wpi of maize sunflower watermelon and wheat decreased with the increase of irrigation amount fig 7 the wp i p was smaller than wpi for the different crops for natural vegetation the wp i p in 2012 was 50 smaller than that in 2013 it was because the water applied irrigation in 2012 was far more than that in 2013 while vegetation growth was not improved much for natural vegetation and all the crops except watermelon wp i p decreased with the increase of water applied fig 7 it indicated that the marginal benefit of increasing water application to these plants was decreasing however for watermelon the wp i p increased with increasing of water application comparing year 2013 with 2012 this suggested that a supplemental irrigation to watermelon during the growth period is needed to improve its production and wp i p wpet was usually smaller than wp i p for the different crops and natural vegetation table 4 this implies that the water applied was insufficient for evapotranspiration thus soil water or groundwater were depleted to make up the deficit during the growing season the absolute values of regression coefficients and r2 between wpet and eta were usually smaller than those between wpi and irrigation i and between wp i p and water applied i p for different plants thus the correlations between wpet and eta were relatively weak with the increase of eta wpet slightly increased for maize while decreased for all the other crops and natural vegetation fig 7 the wpet of a certain crop for the two years was very similar with average values kg m 3 of 2 47 for maize 0 80 for sunflower 12 3 for vegetables 1 39 for wheat and 0 65 for natural vegetation the wpet for maize in this study was smaller than that reported by liu et al 2017a which obtained wpet from a drip irrigation experiment in hetao with values ranging between 3 1 and 5 3 kg m 3 however it was close to the result from a lysimetric experiment of about 2 3 kg m 3 in the region gao et al 2017 due to the similar basin irrigation applied the wpet for sunflower was slightly higher than that from a saline water irrigation study wpet 0 47 0 76 kg m 3 he et al 2016 while lower than that from a drip irrigation study in hetao wpet 1 22 1 78 kg m 3 li et al 2015 for spring wheat the wpet in this study was comparable with the previous study in this region which reported values ranging from 1 1 to 1 9 kg m 3 dong et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 xu et al 2013 the wpet of watermelon was significantly lower than that reported by lei et al 2003 wpet 14 3 39 2 kg m 3 it was mainly because the water balance period in this study was about 2 months longer than the actual watermelon growth period and the study mentioned above was conducted with drip irrigation the natural vegetation wpet was converted to wue using eq 5 resulting in a value of 0 39 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 it was equal to the average annual grassland wue of china as reported by liu et al 2015 however it was obviously lower than the global grassland or shrubland wue 0 67 0 81 g c kg 1 h2o ito and inatomi 2012 and the mean annual grassland wue of southern united states 0 54 g c kg 1 h2o tian et al 2010 in addition previous studies conducted in other arid or semi arid grasslands in china also showed a wue 0 63 0 80 g c kg 1 h2o higher than that in this study hu et al 2008 tang et al 2017 the relatively low wue wpet for natural land in this study was mainly caused by the serious soil salinity problems due to the high salt content vegetation in natural patches was mainly halophytic and the canopy coverage was very low in addition the soil water content was usually high due to the shallow groundwater depth thus soil evaporation was high and it caused a relatively high et a of natural land with lower canopy coverage biomass and higher et a the wpet was usually lower in such salt stressed areas compared with the areas only with water stress the equivalent water productivity i e ewpi ewp i p and ewpet of different crops and natural vegetation was calculated as the ratio of their maize equivalent yield ye to the corresponding water balance components i e i i p and eta fig 8 results showed that the average ewpi in the two years for irrigated crops followed this rank order watermelon 6 85 kg m 3 wheat 6 02 kg m 3 maize 4 33 kg m 3 sunflower 3 92 kg m 3 table 4 it indicated the water irrigated on vegetable fields was most efficiently used while that applied to the sunflower field was least efficiently used the average ewp i p was lower than ewpi with an order of natural vegetation 4 06 kg m 3 wheat 3 92 kg m 3 watermelon 3 75 kg m 3 maize 2 90 kg m 3 sunflower 2 82 kg m 3 the natural land had the highest ewp i p as only precipitation was applied to it for the crops the order of ewp i p was similar to that of ewpi overall the equivalent water productivity of irrigation water i or water applied i p was higher in natural land vegetable and wheat fields while lower in maize and sunflower fields however the average ewpet showed an order of wheat 2 97 kg m 3 sunflower 2 83 kg m 3 watermelon 2 62 kg m 3 maize 2 47 kg m 3 natural vegetation 1 16 kg m 3 thus compared with watermelon maize and natural vegetation wheat and sunflower had a higher use efficiency of the evapotranspirated water the ewpet was obviously lower than ewp i p for all the crops and natural vegetation except for sunflower which had an ewpet slightly higher than ewp i p this indicated again that water applied i p for most crops and natural vegetation was not enough for their evapotranspiration and the soil water or groundwater may be depleted to supply the deficit during the growing season the spatial distribution of field scale ewp i p and ewpet is shown in fig 9 the ewp i p for cropland showed an increasing trend from south to north while that for the natural land showed a decreasing trend the spatial pattern of ewp i p for cropland was caused by the increasing trend of ye fig 6 and the decreasing trend of water applied fig 2 from south to north the spatial distribution of ewp i p for natural land was mainly dominated by the distribution of canopy coverage f c with higher f c south resulting in a larger ewp i p on the whole ewp i p was larger in the dry year 2013 ewpet did not display specific spatial trends except it was usually higher in the croplands along the two branch canals fig 9 it might be caused by the higher surface elevation and deeper groundwater depth along the major canals and thus bare soil evaporation was low ren et al 2018a in addition these areas also had more access to canal water for timely irrigation 3 3 regional scale water productivity for cropland spatially averaged ye was respectively 14 6 and 14 2 t ha 1 in 2012 and 2013 the ewp i p values in the two years were almost the same at about 2 45 kg m 3 ewpet was also very similar with values of 2 70 and 2 75 kg m 3 in 2012 and 2013 table 5 ewpi in 2012 3 7 kg m 3 was larger than that in 2013 2 87 kg m 3 due to less water diversion and higher yield in the wet year 2012 for the whole region if the production of natural vegetation was ignored as in traditional water productivity assessment the ewpi ewp i p and ewpet were respectively 3 40 2 04 and 2 02 kg m 3 in 2012 and 2 87 2 26 and 1 95 kg m 3 in 2013 however when natural vegetation production was considered the values of these water productivities can be increased by about 16 in this study table 5 it indicated that ignoring the natural vegetation will result in considerable bias in the estimation of the regional scale water productivity for cropland ewp i p was smaller than ewpet at the regional scale it indicated the water applied water diversion and precipitation to the cropland exceeded the crop et this was in contrast with aforementioned field scale results where water applied was less than et it was because the amount of water directly irrigated to crop fields was only about 70 of that diverted to the cropland due to low canal conveyance efficiency most of the water loss recharged to the shallow groundwater systems through canal seepage and can be reused by crops through capillary rise thus for cropland the water applied at the field scale was insufficient while that at the regional scale was enough the excess water at the regional scale was temporarily stored in the shallow groundwater system ren et al 2018b however for the total area natural land included ewp i p was larger than ewpet table 5 indicating the water applied water diversion and precipitation to the whole region was less than the total et again therefore when natural land was considered besides the depletion of the above temporarily stored groundwater water original soil water or groundwater storage was also consumed by et during the growing season in order to maintain the balance of the soil water and groundwater between years and to leach salt an irrigation called autumn irrigation was applied after harvest in early october because the land was fallow from october to next april in the study area this time period as well as the autumn irrigation is beyond the discussion of this study 3 4 water productivity improvement water productivity should be improved with limited water diversion to confront water scarcity while with relatively higher yield to defend farmers interests for the whole agro ecosystem all water applied precipitation and irrigation was consumed except some abandoned and drainage water with relatively high tds total dissolved solids g l 1 which flows out of the region to improve water productivity of the whole agro ecosystem the values of ewpi ewp i p and ewpet should be considered synergistically as they can provide multiple perspectives to improve ewpi irrigation water should be used more efficiently to produce more with the current or less amount of water measures such as reducing abandoned water during irrigation and improving salt drainage efficiency drain more salt with less water can be adopted to reserve more irrigation water for crops and natural vegetation water irrigated to crops with lower ewpi e g sunflower and maize can be reduced while that to the crops with higher ewpi e g vegetable and wheat can be increased reserving a certain amount of water for the natural vegetation will largely improve total water productivity ewp i p of the whole region field irrigation should be more timely and efficient to coordinate with precipitation thus attaining higher production the ewpet of the whole region regional scale was low about 2 3 kg m 3 compared with that of crop fields 2 35 3 15 kg m 3 field scale to increase ewpet yield should be increased while evapotranspiration should be decreased as much as possible the actual yield of natural vegetation maize and watermelon had a relatively large gap with their potential values table 3 salt stress had been proved to be the main reason causing the yield gaps ren et al 2016 in addition the non beneficial bare soil evaporation of natural vegetation vegetable and sunflower during the growing season was relatively high compared with that of other similar places around the world kool et al 2014 ren et al 2019b which contributed to the high et therefore the productive water flows e g transpiration should be increased to enhance yield and the unproductive water flows e g evaporation should be reduced to limit et prochnow et al 2012 previous study showed that proper water and salt management such as additional irrigation for natural land and vegetables and groundwater depth optimization can increase yield production and decrease bare soil evaporation significantly ren et al 2018a with the advantage of accurately supplying water to plant roots drip irrigation also showed a higher wpet compared with basin irrigation as discussed in 3 1 liu et al 2017a li et al 2015 lei et al 2003 thus these measures can be adopted to increase water productivity in this region to realize the above management strategies a more efficient water conveyance irrigation and drainage system is needed it should include well lined canals or tubes modern irrigation technologies e g drip irrigation and powerful groundwater control systems e g pipe drainage system an efficient system can ensure field irrigation and drainage are more timely and accurate thus water requirements of crops during some critical periods can be directly met without through the shallow groundwater system i e water temporarily stored by the groundwater reservoir due to percolation or canal seepage and reused later irrigation water is better used directly rather than through reuse especially in areas with salinity problems direct water use through field irrigation would enhance salt leaching while water reuse through capillary rise usually aggravates salt accumulation and reduces ewpet therefore improving the traditional irrigation to accurately apply irrigation through efficient water management systems will improve water productivity 4 conclusions water productivity wp in various forms was calculated from field to regional scales based on field observation and model simulation results in an arid irrigated agro ecosystem in hetao irrigation district of the upper yellow river basin the wp of different crops natural vegetation cropland and the whole region was analyzed and compared results showed wpi and wp i p decreased with the increase of water applied for all plants except watermelon a supplemental irrigation to watermelon is urgent to improve its production and wp i p the spatially averaged wpet kg m 3 was 2 47 for maize 0 80 for sunflower 12 3 for vegetables 1 39 for wheat and 0 65 for natural vegetation the wpet values of the different crops were lower than those of previous drip irrigation studies further they were not affected by the amount of water application during the two years in this salt stressed area wpet for natural vegetation was usually lower compared with that in water deficit areas equivalent water productivity ewp proved to be useful for comparison of different crops and showing the spatial distribution of wp for the cropland ewp i p was higher than ewpet at the field scale while ewp i p was lower than ewpet at the regional scale for the whole region natural land considered ewp i p was again higher than ewpet the disparate characteristics of wp for different crops and natural vegetation were mainly caused by the complex hydrological processes and crop pattern especially the significant water reuse phenomena among different land cover types and the canals through shallow groundwater systems for a region ignoring natural vegetation will result in considerable bias in the estimation of the regional scale water productivity 16 in this study the various forms of wp provided different perspectives on wp improvement irrigation water can be transferred from less productive sunflower areas to productive vegetable and natural vegetation areas based on the rank order of ewpi and ewp i p to improve wp ewpet indicated the importance of reducing bare soil evaporation in wp improvement through the comparison of ewp i p and ewpet at different scales it was found that timely and accurate irrigation guaranteed by an efficient water management system was better than water
