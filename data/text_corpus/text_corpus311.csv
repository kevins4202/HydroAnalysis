1555,groundwater contamination is a worldwide concern and the development of new materials for groundwater remediation has been of great interest this study investigated removal kinetics and mechanisms of nitrate copper ion and hexavalent chromium 20 50 mg l 1 by particles of al fe alloy consisting of 20 fe in batch reactors from a single kno3 cuso4 cu no3 2 k2cr2o7 and their mixed solutions the effects of contaminant interactions and initial ph of the solution were examined and the alloy particles before and after reaction were characterized by x ray diffraction spectrometer scanning electron microscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy the removal mechanisms were attributed to chemical reduction cu ii to cu no3 to nh3 and cr vi to cr iii and co precipitation of cr iii al iii fe iii hydroxides oxyhydroxides cu ii enhanced the rates of no3 and cr vi reduction and cr vi was an inhibitor for cu ii and no3 reduction this study demonstrates that al fe alloy is of potential for groundwater remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords groundwater remediation heavy metals nitrate aluminum iron alloy particles 1 introduction zero valent iron zvi has been extensively investigated for groundwater remediation primarily due to its low cost and effectiveness for a wide variety of contaminants including chlorinated organic compounds nitroaromatic compounds arsenic heavy metals nitrate dyes and phenol fu et al 2014 scherer et al 2000 sun et al 2016 groundwater contamination is often seen to be mixed pollutants lina et al 2015 singh et al 2013 for instance the concentration of nitrate hexavalent chromium cr vi and other heavy metals in groundwater in rupnagar district of india was greater than their respective limits regulated by world health organization who by 134 630 singh et al 2013 zvi was investigated for simultaneous removal of cu ii and no3 hao et al 2005 khalil et al 2016 cu ii and cr vi han et al 2016 hou et al 2008 and no3 and cr vi vilardi et al 2017 wei et al 2016 from water removal of cu ii no3 and cr vi from water by zvi was primarily through a chemical reduction mechanism to cu0 nh3 and cr iii respectively followed by precipitation and or adsorption alowitz and scherer 2002 fu et al 2014 han et al 2016 hou et al 2008 khalil et al 2016 suzuki et al 2012 vilardi et al 2017 wei et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 cu ii facilitated the reduction rates of no3 and cr vi hao et al 2005 hou et al 2008 khalil et al 2016 while no3 did not affect cr vi reduction zhu et al 2017 removal of total cr cr vi cr iii by zvi was accomplished by reduction of cr vi to cr iii and co precipitation of cr iii fe iii hydroxides oxyhydroxides alowitz and scherer 2002 fu et al 2014 hu et al 2010 lo et al 2006 mitra et al 2011 vilardi et al 2017 wei et al 2016 in general the reduction potential of zvi decreases significantly from acidic ph to alkaline ph while zvi oxidation by water inevitably increases ph of the solution it was reported that the rates of no3 and cr vi reduction by zvi were decreased by several orders of magnitude at near neutral ph as compared to acidic ph gheju and iovi 2006 huang and zhang 2004 zvi s rapid passivation at neutral ph and above is the major limitation of zvi alowitz and scherer 2002 chen et al 2017 guan et al 2015 one of the effective strategies to overcome this problem is to deposit a second zero valent metal e g cu ni pd ag etc on the surface of zvi particles fu et al 2014 hu et al 2010 khalil et al 2016 lugo lugo et al 2010 yang et al 2014 indeed these bimetal materials are highly effective due to the effect of numerous micro galvanic cells nevertheless such bimetals increase the risks of secondary contamination and the cost of the materials alternatively fe al bimetals prepared by depositing zvi on the surface of zero valent aluminum zval particles via the reaction of fe2 or fe3 with zval in aqueous solutions were investigated for removal of heavy metals and carbon tetrachloride from water fu et al 2015a fu et al 2015b nidheesh et al 2018 the performance of fe al bimetal was significantly improved for removal of hexavalent chromium cr vi trivalent arsenic cadmium nickel copper zinc or carbon tetrachloride from water as compared to zvi and zval alone under comparable conditions cheng et al 2016 fu et al 2015a fu et al 2015b nidheesh et al 2018 for instance a complete removal of 20 mg l 1 cr vi was achieved by 6 g l 1 fe al bimetal particles at ph 3 9 in 60 min and a relatively high removal rate of 93 was achieved at ph 11 fu et al 2015a however it is difficult to uniformly deposit zvi on the surface of zval particles fu et al 2015a while deposited zvi is prone to fall off zval surface during the course of treatment leading to deteriorated performance fu et al 2015a yang et al 2014 in terms of the homogeneity and stability al fe alloys are superior to fe al bimetals bao et al 2017 hou et al 2015 xu et al 2017 xu et al 2018 previously we found that al fe alloys presented relatively constant reactivity for no3 reduction over a wide range of ph 2 12 xu et al 2017 and that cu ii significantly enhanced no3 reduction by al fe alloys bao et al 2017 hou et al 2015 the objective of this study was to investigate simultaneous removal kinetics and mechanism of no3 cu ii cr vi and cr iii from water to explore al fe alloy as a new material for groundwater remediation over multiple contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals were of analytical grade potassium nitrate kno3 copper nitrate cu no3 2

consisting of 20 fe labeled as al fe20 was used and the alloy particle size ranged between 100 and 120 meshes no pretreatment was carried out on the alloy prior to removal experiments in this study all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18 mω millipore usa 2 2 batch experiments a solution of 200 ml a single kno3 cuso4 k2cr2o7 cu no3 2 or their mixed solutions was placed in a 250 ml glass bottle the solution was purged with argon for at least 5 min to expel dissolved oxygen 2 mg l 1 and then 3 g of al fe20 alloy particles 100 120 meshes were loaded the solution was stirred with a magnetic bar at 200 rpm at a temperature of 25 2 c a sample solution of 1 2 ml was withdrawn at a given time interval for analysis the initial concentration of nitrate copper and hexavalent chromium was 50 25 20 mg l 1 respectively unless otherwise specified the initial ph of the solution was adjusted as required by diluted koh h2so4 or hcl solutions most of the experiments were carried out in duplicates or triplicates and the relative errors were generally 10 2 3 analytical methods and characterization sample solutions were filtered with 0 22 μm syringe filters and appropriate dilutions were made prior to analysis the concentrations of cr vi was measured by ion chromatography dionex ics 3000 equipped with the ionpac as7 4 250 mm analytical column and ionpac ng1 2 50 mm guard column apha 2005 samples were adjusted to ph 9 0 9 5 prior to analysis and an aliquot of 0 5 ml sample was injected and eluted by 250 mm nh4 2so4 and 100 mm nh4oh at a rate of 1 5 ml min 1 the post column reagent was 2 mm diphenylcarbohydrazide 10 v v ch3oh and 1 m h2so4 and the measurement was made at 530 nm the concentrations of no3 were analyzed by ion chromatography dionex ics 900

solutions removal kinetics of no3 cu ii and cr vi by al fe20 alloy were investigated in a single and mixed solutions of kno3 cuso4 cu no3 2 and k2cr2o7 fig 1 for a single solution of kno3 50 mg l 1 no3 cuso4 25 mg l 1 cu and k2cr2o7 20 mg l 1 cr fig 1a cu ii was rapidly removed 99 in 1 h while the removals of cr vi and no3 were slow 55 and 68 respectively in 24 h nitrate removal experienced a lag period of 5 h at the beginning and then proceeded in a pseudo zero order reaction kobs 1 806 mg l h 1 r2 0 9783 by contrast no lag period was observed for cr vi and cu ii this phenomenon could be likely that the passivation layer of metal oxides on the surface of the alloy was instantly destroyed in the case of cuso4 and k2cr2o7 and there was a competition between activation by water and passivation by nitrate soaking al fe alloys in deionized water at 45 c was able to remove the passivation film on the surface thus activating the materials for no3 reduction bao et al 2017 xu et al 2017 while surface passivation of al metal by nitric acid has been documented pyun and moon 1999 two stages were observed for cr vi its removal rate was rapid in the first stage 0 1 h 19 removed kobs 0 213 h 1 r2 0 8251 and then became much slower 1 24 h 36 removed kobs 0 025 h 1 r2 0 9957 cr vi removal by zvi and zval involved cr vi reduction to cr iii and its adsorption by fe oh 3 or al oh 3 li et al 2008 rivero huguet and marshall 2009 while the formation of crxfe1 x oh 3 co precipitates decreased the surface reactivity of fe al bimetal particles fu et al 2015a indeed surface passivation was observed on zvi and zval particles in the presence of cr vi fu et al 2015a han et al 2016 hu et al 2010 li et al 2008 rivero huguet and marshall 2009 investigated mixed metallic particles pd zn ag fe ni fe zn fe pd cu and cu fe to remove cr vi and also observed two stages of removal rate the rate constant of cr vi removal in the initial stage of the reaction 0 2 5 h was several orders of magnitude higher than that in the later stage they proposed that the decreased removal rate was mainly caused by the formation of oxy hydroxide passivation layer in the later stage therefore it was likely that cr vi removal by al fe alloy could involve the reduction crvi to criii and subsequent adsorption by al iii cr iii cr iii fe iii or cr iii al iii fe iii hydroxides and oxyhydroxides indeed al iii fe iii hydroxides co precipitated even under relatively acidic ph 4 5 conditions sánchez españa et al 2016 in the case of cu no3 2 fig 1b no3 removal rate was significantly enhanced 100 removal at 4 91 mg l 1 h 1 in cu no3 2 versus 68 removal at kobs of 1 81 mg l 1 h 1 in kno3 on the contrary the removal rate of cu ii was significantly suppressed in cu no3 2 solution cu ii was removed by 96 in 0 5 h in cuso4 solution fig 1a whereas cu ii removal was 16 only in the same period in cu no3 2 solution fig 1b enhanced removal rate of no3 by zvi in the presence of cu ii has also been previously observed fu et al 2014 hao et al 2005 khalil et al 2016 khalil et al 2016 proposed that depositing zero valent cu on the surface of zvi particles created numerous fe cu galvanic cells which catalytically enhanced the generation of surface active h h ads and thus facilitated electron transfer for no3 reduction as for the mechanism behind the suppression of cu ii removal by no3 it was probably related to the passivation effect of nitrate on metal surfaces pyun and moon 1999 indeed suppression of cu ii removal by no3 was also observed on kaolin fe ni nanoparticles because the no3 occupied the active sites of fe cai et al 2014 for a mixed solution of kno3 and k2cr2o7 fig 1c no3 reduction was completely inhibited while cr vi reduction was not significantly affected as compared to k2cr2o7 solution this indicates that no3 does not affect cr vi removal while cr vi is an inhibitor for no3 removal by al fe alloy zhu et al 2017 found that no3 did not influence the reduction of cr vi by nzvi ni for a mixed solution of cuso4 and k2cr2o7 fig 1d the removal rate of cu ii was slightly suppressed and cr vi removal rate in the first stage of 0 1 h was much faster 43 removal kobs 0 565 h 1 than that in the case of k2cr2o7 solution 19 removal kobs 0 213 h 1 see fig 1a this indicates that cu ii significantly promotes removal rate of cr vi for a mixed solution of cu no3 2 and k2cr2o7 fig 1e the rates of cu ii and no3 removal became much slower than the case of cu no3 2 as shown in fig 1b contrast to the two stage kinetics observed in the solutions of k2cr2o7 kno3 k2cr2o7 and cuso4 k2cr2o7 fig 1a c d cr vi removal was in a single stage of the first order reaction kobs 0 249 h 1 r2 0 9945 during the whole period of 24 h reaction in cu no3 2 k2cr2o7 fig 1e from which the highest rate of cr vi removal was observed inspecting fig 1d and e indicates that relatively high concentrations of cu ii remained during the 24 h reaction cu ii concentration rapidly decreased from 25 mg l 1 to 0 13 mg l 1 in the first 2 h where cr vi concentration declined from 20 mg l 1 to 13 mg l 1 and then decreased slowly during the remaining period of 22 h in cuso4 k2cr2o7 fig 1d by contrast cu ii concentration decreased much slower from 25 mg l 1 to 1 mg l 1 during the whole period of the 24 h reaction in cu no3 2 k2cr2o7 fig 1e the above results demonstrate that cr vi is an inhibitor for no3 removal cu ii is a promoter for cr vi and no3 removal and no3 is an inhibitor for cu ii removal by al fe alloy particles 1 cu 2 fe cu fe 2 2 cr 2 o 7 2 6fe 2 14 h 2cr 3 6fe 3 7h 2 o it should be noted that the removal trends of total cr vi iii and cr vi were almost identical in the above experiments chemical reduction is the major mechanism for removal of no3 cu ii and cr vi by zvi from aqueous solutions fu et al 2014 hou et al 2008 hu et al 2010 li et al 2019 lo et al 2006 while cr t removal by zvi from aqueous solutions involves reduction of cr vi to cr iii and co precipitation of cr iii fe iii hydroxides oxyhydroxides hou et al 2008 hu et al 2010 lo et al 2006 cu ii enhanced cr vi reduction by zvi via the following mechanism hou et al 2008 in the present al fe alloy system al is the major electron donor and al oh 3 is produced bao et al 2017 xu et al 2017 xu et al 2018 al oh 3 is a traditional adsorbent for water treatment and may contribute to adsorption removal of heavy metals and no3 from water therefore the mechanism of no3 cu ii and cr vi removal from water by al fe alloy particles may involve reduction adsorption and hydroxides co precipitation and will be discussed later in this study 3 2 effect of cuso4 and cucl2 on removal of cr vi and no3 fig 2 shows the effect of initial cu concentrations 10 100 mg l 1 on the removal of cu ii cr vi and no3 from mixed solutions cuso4 kno3 k2cr2o7 and cucl2 kno3 k2cr2o7 clearly the rate of cu ii removal decreased with increasing initial concentrations of cuso4 from 10 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 fig 2a for initial cu ii concentrations of 10 25 mg l 1 greater than 100 of cu ii were removed in 2 h where cu ii concentration was decreased to 0 01 mg l 1 it is interesting that this trend was out of order in the case of cucl2 fig 2b the rate of 50 mg l 1 cu ii removal was the lowest among 10 25 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 while removal rates of 75 and 100 mg l 1 cu ii were accelerated due to a significant decrease of the concentrations of no3 and cr vi see fig 2b by contrast the rate of cr vi removal increased with increasing initial concentrations of cuso4 and cucl2 fig 2c and d cr vi removal was rapid within initial period of 2 h and then became much slower in both cases of cuso4 and cucl2 with higher initial cu concentrations 50 100 mg l 1 cr vi removal was much faster in the case of cucl2 than that of cuso4 cr vi concentration decreased from 20 mg l 1 to 7 6 7 9 mg l 1 in 2 h in the case of initial concentrations of 50 100 mg cu l 1 cuso4 in comparison cr vi concentration declined to 0 05 3 mg l 1 in the case of cucl2 by the end of 24 h experiments cr vi concentration was below 1 mg l 1 in the case of 75 100 mg l 1 cuso4 while it was below 0 4 mg l 1 in the case of cucl2 nitrate removal in the mixed solutions of cuso4 kno3 k2cr2o7 was completely inhibited for all cases of initial cu concentrations fig 2e in contrast 90 of no3 were removed in the mixed solutions of cucl2 kno3 k2cr2o7 when initial concentrations of cu were 75 and 100 mg l 1 see fig 2f the prevention of nitrate removal in cuso4 kno3 k2cr2o7 fig 2e was due to relatively high cr vi concentrations 16 5 0 6 mg l 1 between 2 and 24 h see fig 2c nitrate removal in the case of 75 and 100 mg l 1 cucl2 fig 2f was clearly related to relatively low cr vi concentrations 0 4 mg l 1 between 2 and 24 h see fig 2d the above results further demonstrate that cr vi and no3 inhibit each other s removal rate and cu ii is a promoter for cr vi and no3 removal by al fe alloy from aqueous solutions the ph of cuso4 kno3 k2cr2o7 and cucl2 kno3 k2cr2o7 solutions was measured during the course of reaction fig 2g and h the ph of cuso4 kno3 k2cr2o7 solution increased rapidly with time during the initial period 0 2 h at initial cu ii concentrations of 10 25 mg l 1 but this trend did not appear at higher cu ii concentrations of 50 100 mg l 1 fig 2g overall the higher cu concentrations the lower solution ph was the final ph of the cuso4 kno3 k2cr2o7 solution was 8 95 8 30 7 63 7 15 and 6 60 for initial cu concentrations of 10 25 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 respectively a similar trend was observed in cucl2 kno3 k2cr2o7 solution at initial cu ii concentrations of 10 25 mg l 1 however the ph in the case of 50 mg l 1 cucl2 was increased higher than that for 25 mg l 1 cucl2 and even slightly higher than that of 10 mg l 1 cucl2 clearly this phenomenon was related to the lowest rate of cu removal for the case of 50 mg l 1 cucl2 khalil et al 2016 reported that the freshly produced zero valent cu particles from cu ii reduction were re oxidized by water molecules to cu oxides thus releasing protons h eqs 3 5 this probably explains the trend of solution ph for higher initial concentrations of cu ii 3 cu 2 2e cu 4 2cu h 2 o cu 2 o 2h 5 cu 2 o h 2 o 2cuo 2h 3 3 effect of initial ph value the ph value of the solution is an important parameter for removal of no3 and cr vi by zvi particles alowitz and scherer 2002 wu et al 2015 in general reduction potential of zvi decreases with increase of solution ph the rate of no3 reduction by zvi decreased with increasing ph huang and zhang 2004 and ceased at ph 9 luk and au yeung 2002 here we investigated the effect of initial ph 2 6 on simultaneous removal of cu ii cr vi and no3 from a mixed solution of cucl2 cu no3 2 and k2cr2o7 cu 75 mg l 1 cr vi 20 mg l 1 no3 50 mg l 1 fig 3 overall cu ii removal rate decreased with increasing initial ph between 2 and 5 while it was the fastest at initial ph 6 fig 3a this was because the reduction potential of al fe alloys including zvi and zval decreased with increase of ph of the solution the rapid removal at initial ph 6 was likely a combination of cu ii reduction and precipitation of cu oh 2 ksp 1 10 19 33 and cucro4 ksp 3 63 10 6 sun et al 2003 cr vi was rapidly removed at initial ph of 2 6 and the removal rate of total cr cr t was almost identical to that of cr vi with an exception of initial ph 2 at which the removal rate of cr t was around 50 see the inserted graph in fig 3b the final ph of the solutions at initial ph 3 6 increased to 5 7 8 2 at which the co precipitation of cr oh 3 al oh 3 al iii cr iii and or al iii cr iii fe iii hydroxide oxyhydroxides was likely to occur resulting in identical removal rates of cr t and cr vi the final ph of the solution in the case of initial ph 2 was at 4 3 0 1 at which part of cr iii were likely in the dissolved state barreradíaz et al 2012 as a result the removal of cr t in the case of initial ph 2 was different to that in the cases of initial ph 3 6 as for no3 the removal rate decreased with increase of initial ph fig 3c similar trends have been observed for zvi alowitz and scherer 2002 khalil et al 2016 but the removal rate of no3 in the presence of cr vi observed in this study was generally lower than that in previous studies xu et al 2017 3 4 removal mechanism zvi has been extensively investigated for removal of no3 cu ii and cr vi from water and the removal mechanism involved reduction precipitation and adsorption alowitz and scherer 2002 fu et al 2014 han et al 2016 hou et al 2008 khalil et al 2016 suzuki et al 2012 vilardi et al 2017 wei et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the reduction of contaminants included direct and indirect electron transfer the contaminants were instantaneously adsorbed to the surface and then reduced either by direct transfer of electron from zvi indirect transfer from hads or both fu et al 2014 suzuki et al 2012 removal of no3 by zvi was primarily by reduction to nh3 fu et al 2014 hao et al 2005 khalil et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 proposed that fe2 and no2 intermediates were generated prior to the formation of fe3 oxyhydroxide and nh4 eqs 6 7 6 fe no 3 2h fe 2 no 2 2h 2 o 7 3fe no 2 8h 3fe 2 nh 4 2h 2 o removal of cu ii by zvi involved reduction adsorption and precipitation where the reduction of cu ii to metallic cu was the major mechanism han et al 2016 hao et al 2005 the mechanism of total cr cr vi cr iii removal by zvi was considered that cr vi was reduced to cr iii by zvi and then cr iii was immediately removed from the solution as co precipitates of cr iii fe iii hydroxides oxyhydroxides see eq 8 alowitz and scherer 2002 fu et al 2014 hu et al 2010 lo et al 2006 mitra et al 2011 vilardi et al 2017 wei et al 2016 8 x cr 3 1 x fe 3 3h 2 o cr x fe 1 x oh 3 s 3h this mechanism for total cr removal also applied to removal of cr vi by fe al bimetals fu et al 2015a and the rate of cr vi reduction was promoted by cu ii as discussed previously see eq 1 and 2 hou et al 2008 al fe alloy particles before reaction and after reaction with deionized water blank control experiment a mixed solution of cu no3 2 and k2cr2o7 and a mixed solution of cucl2 cu no3 2 and k2cr2o7 were characterized by xrd and sem fig 4 al fe20 alloy consists of al fe and intermetallic compounds al2fe and al13fe4 fig 4a and the surface of al fe20 alloy particles was non porous fig 4b in contrast after reaction with deionized water a large amount of al oh 3 fig 4c and porous surface fig 4d were observed after the alloy s reaction with a mixed solution of cu no3 2 and k2cr2o7 no al oh 3 was produced fig 4e but larger size crystals were observed fig 4f the surface composition was similar when the alloy particles reacted with a mixed solution of cucl2 cu no3 2 and k2cr2o7 see fig 4g but the surface became porous fig 4h when the alloy particles reacted with deionized water fe was protected and al was oxidized by water leading to the formation of al oh 3 on the surface it was likely that fe was also oxidized along with al oxidation in the presence of contaminants and that a composite of cr iii al iii fe iii hydroxides oxyhydroxides was generated on the surface eq 9 9 1 x y cr 3 x fe 3 y al 3 3h 2 o cr 1 x y fe x al y oh 3 s 3h the adsorption of cr2o7 2 cu oh 2 and cu 0 onto this composite material was likely to take place indeed the xps analysis of the alloy s particle surface after reaction showed that cr iii al iii fe iii cr vi cu ii and cu 0 were present see fig 5 the peak positions of cr iii and fe iii observed here were consistent with those identified in cr vi removal by zvi and fe al bimetal hu et al 2010 jiang et al 2015 li et al 2008 xiao et al 2015 it should be noted that the peaks of cu and cr phases were not observed in the xrd this was likely because the concentrations of cu and cr were too low to be detected by xrd relative to al and fe and their intermetallic phases in the alloy in summary the removal of cr vi by al fe alloy was in principle through its reduction to cr iii which then precipitated in cr oh 3 and or a composite of cr iii al iii fe iii hydroxides oxyhydroxides nitrate was removed by reduction to ammonia and cu ii was reduced to cu 0 4 conclusions removal rate of 20 50 mg l 1 no3 cu ii and cr vi from water by 15 g l 1 al fe alloy 20 fe was in an order of cu ii no3 cr vi for mixtures of these contaminants no3 cu ii and cr vi were primarily removed by chemical reduction to nh3 cu 0 and cr iii respectively and cr iii co precipitated in a composite of cr iii al iii fe iii hydroxides oxyhydroxides cu ii enhanced reduction rates of cr vi and no3 by 2 7 times while cr vi and no3 inhibited each other s removal rate cr vi suppressed the rate of cu ii removal by 84 and inhibited no3 reduction completely when cr vi concentration was higher than 1 mg l 1 acknowledgements this work was supported by fundamental research funds for the central universities jd1814 
1555,groundwater contamination is a worldwide concern and the development of new materials for groundwater remediation has been of great interest this study investigated removal kinetics and mechanisms of nitrate copper ion and hexavalent chromium 20 50 mg l 1 by particles of al fe alloy consisting of 20 fe in batch reactors from a single kno3 cuso4 cu no3 2 k2cr2o7 and their mixed solutions the effects of contaminant interactions and initial ph of the solution were examined and the alloy particles before and after reaction were characterized by x ray diffraction spectrometer scanning electron microscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy the removal mechanisms were attributed to chemical reduction cu ii to cu no3 to nh3 and cr vi to cr iii and co precipitation of cr iii

vilardi et al 2017 wei et al 2016 in general the reduction potential of zvi decreases significantly from acidic ph to alkaline ph while zvi oxidation by water inevitably increases ph of the solution it was reported that the rates of no3 and cr vi reduction by zvi were decreased by several orders of magnitude at near neutral ph as compared to acidic ph gheju and iovi 2006 huang and zhang 2004 zvi s rapid passivation at neutral ph and above is the major limitation of zvi alowitz and scherer 2002 chen et al 2017 guan et al 2015 one of the effective strategies to overcome this problem is to deposit a second zero valent metal e g cu ni pd ag etc on the surface of zvi particles fu et al 2014 hu et al 2010 khalil et al 2016 lugo lugo et al 2010 yang et al 2014 indeed these bimetal materials are highly effective due to the effect of numerous micro galvanic cells nevertheless such bimetals increase the risks of secondary contamination and the cost of the materials alternatively fe al bimetals prepared by depositing zvi on the surface of zero valent aluminum zval particles via the reaction of fe2 or fe3 with zval in aqueous solutions were investigated for removal of heavy metals and carbon tetrachloride from water fu et al 2015a fu et al 2015b nidheesh et al 2018 the performance of fe al bimetal was significantly improved for removal of hexavalent chromium cr vi trivalent arsenic cadmium nickel copper zinc or carbon tetrachloride from water as compared to zvi and zval alone under comparable conditions cheng et al 2016 fu et al 2015a fu et al 2015b nidheesh et al 2018 for instance a complete removal of 20 mg l 1 cr vi was achieved by 6 g l 1 fe al bimetal particles at ph 3 9 in 60 min and a relatively high removal rate of 93 was achieved at ph 11 fu et al 2015a however it is difficult to uniformly deposit zvi on the surface of zval particles fu et al 2015a while deposited zvi is prone to fall off zval surface during the course of treatment leading to deteriorated performance fu et al 2015a yang et al 2014 in terms of the homogeneity and stability al fe alloys are superior to fe al bimetals bao et al 2017 hou et al 2015 xu et al 2017 xu et al 2018 previously we found that al fe alloys presented relatively constant reactivity for no3 reduction over a wide range of ph 2 12 xu et al 2017 and that cu ii significantly enhanced no3 reduction by al fe alloys bao et al 2017 hou et al 2015 the objective of this study was to investigate simultaneous removal kinetics and mechanism of no3 cu ii cr vi and cr iii from water to explore al fe alloy as a new

consisting of 20 fe labeled as al fe20 was used and the alloy particle size ranged between 100 and 120 meshes no pretreatment was carried out on the alloy prior to removal experiments in this study all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18 mω millipore usa 2 2 batch experiments a solution of 200 ml a single kno3 cuso4 k2cr2o7 cu no3 2 or their mixed solutions was placed in a 250 ml glass bottle the solution was purged with argon for at least 5 min to expel dissolved oxygen 2 mg l 1 and then 3 g of al fe20 alloy particles 100 120 meshes were loaded the solution was stirred with a magnetic bar at 200 rpm at a temperature of 25 2 c a sample solution of 1 2 ml was withdrawn at a given time interval for analysis the initial concentration of nitrate copper and hexavalent chromium was 50 25 20 mg l 1 respectively unless otherwise specified the initial ph of the solution was adjusted as required by diluted koh h2so4 or hcl solutions most of the experiments were carried out in duplicates or triplicates and the relative errors were generally 10 2 3 analytical methods and characterization sample solutions were filtered with 0 22 μm syringe filters and appropriate dilutions were made prior to analysis the concentrations of cr vi was measured by ion chromatography dionex ics 3000 equipped with the ionpac as7 4 250 mm analytical column and ionpac ng1 2 50 mm guard column apha 2005 samples were adjusted to ph 9 0 9 5 prior to analysis and an aliquot of 0 5 ml sample was injected and eluted by 250 mm nh4 2so4 and 100 mm nh4oh at a rate of 1 5 ml min

solutions removal kinetics of no3 cu ii and cr vi by al fe20 alloy were investigated in a single and mixed solutions of kno3 cuso4 cu no3 2 and k2cr2o7 fig 1 for a single solution of kno3 50 mg l 1 no3 cuso4 25 mg l 1 cu and k2cr2o7 20 mg l 1 cr fig 1a cu ii was rapidly removed 99 in 1 h while the removals of cr vi and no3 were slow 55 and 68 respectively in 24 h nitrate removal experienced a lag period of 5 h at the beginning and then proceeded in a pseudo zero order reaction kobs 1 806 mg l h 1 r2 0 9783 by contrast no lag period was observed for cr vi and cu ii this phenomenon could be likely that the passivation layer of metal oxides on the surface of the alloy was instantly destroyed in the case of cuso4 and k2cr2o7 and there was a competition between activation by water and passivation by nitrate soaking al fe alloys in deionized water at 45 c was able to remove the passivation film on the surface thus activating the materials for no3 reduction bao et al 2017 xu et al 2017 while surface passivation of al metal by nitric acid has been documented pyun and moon 1999 two stages were observed for cr vi its removal rate was rapid in the first stage 0 1 h 19 removed kobs 0 213 h 1 r2 0 8251 and then became much slower 1 24 h 36 removed kobs 0 025 h 1 r2 0 9957 cr vi removal by zvi and zval involved cr vi reduction to cr iii and its adsorption by fe oh 3 or al oh 3 li et al 2008 rivero huguet and marshall 2009 while the formation of crxfe1 x oh 3 co precipitates decreased the surface reactivity of fe al bimetal particles fu et al 2015a indeed surface passivation was observed on zvi and zval particles in the presence of cr vi fu et al 2015a han et al 2016 hu et al 2010 li et al 2008 rivero huguet and marshall 2009 investigated mixed metallic particles pd zn ag fe ni fe zn fe pd cu and cu fe to remove cr vi and also observed two stages of removal rate the rate constant of cr vi removal in the initial stage of the reaction 0 2 5 h was several orders of magnitude higher than that in the later stage they proposed that the decreased removal rate was mainly caused by the formation of oxy hydroxide passivation layer in the later stage therefore it was likely that cr vi removal by al fe alloy could involve the reduction crvi to criii and subsequent adsorption by al iii cr iii cr iii fe iii or cr iii al iii fe iii hydroxides and oxyhydroxides indeed al iii fe iii hydroxides co precipitated even under relatively acidic ph 4 5 conditions sánchez españa et al 2016 in the case of cu no3 2 fig 1b no3 removal rate was significantly enhanced 100 removal at 4 91 mg l 1 h 1 in cu no3 2 versus 68 removal at kobs of 1 81 mg l 1 h 1 in kno3 on the contrary the removal rate of cu ii was significantly suppressed in cu no3 2 solution cu ii was removed by 96 in 0 5 h in cuso4 solution fig 1a whereas cu ii removal was 16 only in the same period in cu no3 2 solution fig 1b enhanced removal rate of no3 by zvi in the presence of cu ii has also been previously observed fu et al 2014 hao et al 2005 khalil et al 2016 khalil et al 2016 proposed that depositing zero valent cu on the surface of zvi particles created numerous fe cu galvanic cells which catalytically enhanced the generation of surface active h h ads and thus facilitated electron transfer for no3 reduction as for the mechanism behind the suppression of cu ii removal by no3 it was probably related to the passivation effect of nitrate on metal surfaces pyun and moon 1999 indeed suppression of cu ii removal by no3 was also observed on kaolin fe ni nanoparticles because the no3 occupied the active sites of fe cai et al 2014 for a mixed solution of kno3 and k2cr2o7 fig 1c no3 reduction was completely inhibited while cr vi reduction was not significantly affected as compared to k2cr2o7 solution this indicates that no3 does not affect cr vi removal while cr vi is an inhibitor for no3 removal by al fe alloy zhu et al 2017 found that no3 did not influence the reduction of cr vi by nzvi ni for a mixed solution of cuso4 and k2cr2o7 fig 1d the removal rate of cu ii was slightly suppressed and cr vi removal rate in the first stage of 0 1 h was much faster 43 removal kobs 0 565 h 1 than that in the case of k2cr2o7 solution 19 removal kobs 0 213 h 1 see fig 1a this indicates that cu ii significantly promotes removal rate of cr vi for a mixed solution of cu no3 2 and k2cr2o7 fig 1e the rates of cu ii and no3 removal became much slower than the case of cu no3 2 as shown in fig 1b contrast to the two stage kinetics observed in the solutions of k2cr2o7 kno3 k2cr2o7 and cuso4 k2cr2o7 fig 1a c d cr vi removal was in a single stage of the first order reaction kobs 0 249 h 1 r2 0 9945 during the whole period of 24 h reaction in cu no3 2 k2cr2o7 fig 1e from which the highest rate of cr vi removal was observed inspecting fig 1d and e indicates that relatively high concentrations of cu ii remained during the 24 h reaction cu ii concentration rapidly decreased from 25 mg l 1 to 0 13 mg l 1 in the first 2 h where cr vi concentration declined from 20 mg l 1 to 13 mg l 1 and then decreased slowly during the remaining period of 22 h in cuso4 k2cr2o7 fig 1d by contrast cu ii concentration decreased much slower from 25 mg l 1 to 1 mg l 1 during the whole period of the 24 h reaction in cu no3 2 k2cr2o7 fig 1e the above results demonstrate that cr vi is an inhibitor for no3 removal cu ii is a promoter for cr vi and no3 removal and no3 is an inhibitor for cu ii removal by al fe alloy particles 1 cu 2 fe cu fe 2 2 cr 2 o 7 2 6fe 2 14 h 2cr 3 6fe 3 7h 2 o it should be noted that the removal trends of total cr vi iii and cr vi were almost identical in the above experiments chemical reduction is the major mechanism for removal of no3 cu ii and cr vi by zvi from aqueous solutions fu et al 2014 hou et al 2008 hu et al 2010 li et al 2019 lo et al 2006 while cr t removal by zvi from aqueous solutions involves reduction of cr vi to cr iii and co precipitation of cr iii fe iii hydroxides oxyhydroxides hou et al 2008 hu et al 2010 lo et al 2006 cu ii enhanced cr vi reduction by zvi via the following mechanism hou et al 2008 in the present al fe alloy system al is the major electron donor and al oh 3 is produced bao et al 2017 xu et al 2017 xu et al 2018 al oh 3 is a traditional adsorbent for water treatment and may contribute to adsorption removal of heavy metals and no3 from water therefore the mechanism of no3 cu ii and cr vi removal from water by al fe alloy particles may involve reduction adsorption and hydroxides co precipitation and will be discussed later in this study 3 2 effect of cuso4 and cucl2 on removal of cr vi and no3 fig 2 shows the effect of initial cu concentrations 10 100 mg l 1 on the removal of cu ii cr vi and no3 from mixed solutions cuso4 kno3 k2cr2o7 and cucl2 kno3 k2cr2o7 clearly the rate of cu ii removal decreased with increasing initial concentrations of cuso4 from 10 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 fig 2a for initial cu ii concentrations of 10 25 mg l 1 greater than 100 of cu ii were removed in 2 h where cu ii concentration was decreased to 0 01 mg l 1 it is interesting that this trend was out of order in the case of cucl2 fig 2b the rate of 50 mg l 1 cu ii removal was the lowest among 10 25 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 while removal rates of 75 and 100 mg l 1 cu ii were accelerated due to a significant decrease of the concentrations of no3 and cr vi see fig 2b by contrast the rate of cr vi removal increased with increasing initial concentrations of cuso4 and cucl2 fig 2c and d cr vi removal was rapid within initial period of 2 h and then became much slower in both cases of cuso4 and cucl2 with higher initial cu concentrations 50 100 mg l 1 cr vi removal was much faster in the case of cucl2 than that of cuso4 cr vi concentration decreased from 20 mg l 1 to 7 6 7 9 mg l 1 in 2 h in the case of initial concentrations of 50 100 mg cu l 1 cuso4 in comparison cr vi concentration declined to 0 05 3 mg l 1 in the case of cucl2 by the end of 24 h experiments cr vi concentration was below 1 mg l 1 in the case of 75 100 mg l 1 cuso4 while it was below 0 4 mg l 1 in the case of cucl2 nitrate removal in the mixed solutions of cuso4 kno3 k2cr2o7 was completely inhibited for all cases of initial cu concentrations fig 2e in contrast 90 of no3 were removed in the mixed solutions of cucl2 kno3 k2cr2o7 when initial concentrations of cu were 75 and 100 mg l 1 see fig 2f the prevention of nitrate removal in cuso4 kno3 k2cr2o7 fig 2e was due to relatively high cr vi concentrations 16 5 0 6 mg l 1 between 2 and 24 h see fig 2c nitrate removal in the case of 75 and 100 mg l 1 cucl2 fig 2f was clearly related to relatively low cr vi concentrations 0 4 mg l 1 between 2 and 24 h see fig 2d the above results further demonstrate that cr vi and no3 inhibit each other s removal rate and cu ii is a promoter for cr vi and no3 removal by al fe alloy from aqueous solutions the ph of cuso4 kno3 k2cr2o7 and cucl2 kno3 k2cr2o7 solutions was measured during the course of reaction fig 2g and h the ph of cuso4 kno3 k2cr2o7 solution increased rapidly with time during the initial period 0 2 h at initial cu ii concentrations of 10 25 mg l 1 but this trend did not appear at higher cu ii concentrations of 50 100 mg l 1 fig 2g overall the higher cu concentrations the lower solution ph was the final ph of the cuso4 kno3 k2cr2o7 solution was 8 95 8 30 7 63 7 15 and 6 60 for initial cu concentrations of 10 25 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 respectively a similar trend was observed in cucl2 kno3 k2cr2o7 solution at initial cu ii concentrations of 10 25 mg l 1 however the ph in the case of 50 mg l 1 cucl2 was increased higher than that for 25 mg l 1 cucl2 and even slightly higher than that of 10 mg l 1 cucl2 clearly this phenomenon was related to the lowest rate of cu removal for the case of 50 mg l 1 cucl2 khalil et al 2016 reported that the freshly produced zero valent cu particles from cu ii reduction were re oxidized by water molecules to cu oxides thus releasing protons h eqs 3 5 this probably explains the trend of solution ph for higher initial concentrations of cu ii 3 cu 2 2e cu 4 2cu h 2 o cu 2 o 2h 5 cu 2 o h 2 o 2cuo 2h 3 3 effect of initial ph value the ph value of the solution is an important parameter for removal of no3 and cr vi by zvi particles alowitz and scherer 2002 wu et al 2015 in general reduction potential of zvi decreases with increase of solution ph the rate of no3 reduction by zvi decreased with increasing ph huang and zhang 2004 and ceased at ph 9 luk and au yeung 2002 here we investigated the effect of initial ph 2 6 on simultaneous removal of cu ii cr vi and no3 from a mixed solution of cucl2 cu no3 2 and k2cr2o7 cu 75 mg l 1 cr vi 20 mg l 1 no3 50 mg l 1 fig 3 overall cu ii removal rate decreased with increasing initial ph between 2 and 5 while it was the fastest at initial ph 6 fig 3a this was because the reduction potential of al fe alloys including zvi and zval decreased with increase of ph of the solution the rapid removal at initial ph 6 was likely a combination of cu ii reduction and precipitation of cu oh 2 ksp 1 10 19 33 and cucro4 ksp 3 63 10 6 sun et al 2003 cr vi was rapidly removed at initial ph of 2 6 and the removal rate of total cr cr t was almost identical to that of cr vi with an exception of initial ph 2 at which the removal rate of cr t was around 50 see the inserted graph in fig 3b the final ph of the solutions at initial ph 3 6 increased to 5 7 8 2 at which the co precipitation of cr oh 3 al oh 3 al iii cr iii and or al iii cr iii fe iii hydroxide oxyhydroxides was likely to occur resulting in identical removal rates of cr t and cr vi the final ph of the solution in the case of initial ph 2 was at 4 3 0 1 at which part of cr iii were likely in the dissolved state barreradíaz et al 2012 as a result the removal of cr t in the case of initial ph 2 was different to that in the cases of initial ph 3 6 as for no3 the removal rate decreased with increase of initial ph fig 3c similar trends have been observed for zvi alowitz and scherer 2002 khalil et al 2016 but the removal rate of no3 in the presence of cr vi observed in this study was generally lower than that in previous studies xu et al 2017 3 4 removal mechanism zvi has been extensively investigated for removal of no3 cu ii and cr vi from water and the removal mechanism involved reduction precipitation and adsorption alowitz and scherer 2002 fu et al 2014 han et al 2016 hou et al 2008 khalil et al 2016 suzuki et al 2012 vilardi et al 2017 wei et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the reduction of contaminants included direct and indirect electron transfer the contaminants were instantaneously adsorbed to the surface and then reduced either by direct transfer of electron from zvi indirect transfer from hads or both fu et al 2014 suzuki et al 2012 removal of no3 by zvi was primarily by reduction to nh3 fu et al 2014 hao et al 2005 khalil et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 proposed that fe2 and no2 intermediates were generated prior to the formation of fe3 oxyhydroxide and nh4 eqs 6 7 6 fe no 3 2h fe 2 no 2 2h 2 o 7 3fe no 2 8h 3fe 2 nh 4 2h 2 o removal of cu ii by zvi involved reduction adsorption and precipitation where the reduction of cu ii to metallic cu was the major mechanism han et al 2016 hao et al 2005 the mechanism of total cr cr vi cr iii removal by zvi was considered that cr vi was reduced to cr iii by zvi and then cr iii was immediately removed from the solution as co precipitates of cr iii fe iii hydroxides oxyhydroxides see eq 8 alowitz and scherer 2002 fu et al 2014 hu et al 2010 lo et al 2006 mitra et al 2011 vilardi et al 2017 wei et al 2016 8 x cr 3 1 x fe 3 3h 2 o cr x fe 1 x oh 3 s 3h this mechanism for total cr removal also applied to removal of cr vi by fe al bimetals fu et al 2015a and the rate of cr vi reduction was promoted by cu ii as discussed previously see eq 1 and 2 hou et al 2008 al fe alloy particles before reaction and after reaction with deionized water blank control experiment a mixed solution of cu no3 2 and k2cr2o7 and a mixed solution of cucl2 cu no3 2 and k2cr2o7 were characterized by xrd and sem fig 4 al fe20 alloy consists of al fe and intermetallic compounds al2fe and al13fe4 fig 4a and the surface of al fe20 alloy particles was non porous fig 4b in contrast after reaction with deionized water a large amount of al oh 3 fig 4c and porous surface fig 4d were observed after the alloy s reaction with a mixed solution of cu no3 2 and k2cr2o7 no al oh 3 was produced fig 4e but larger size crystals were observed fig 4f the surface composition was similar when the alloy particles reacted with a mixed solution of cucl2 cu no3 2 and k2cr2o7 see fig 4g but the surface became porous fig 4h when the alloy particles reacted with deionized water fe was protected and al was oxidized by water leading to the formation of al oh 3 on the surface it was likely that fe was also oxidized along with al oxidation in the presence of contaminants and that a composite of cr iii al iii fe iii hydroxides oxyhydroxides was generated on the surface eq 9 9 1 x y cr 3 x fe 3 y al 3 3h 2 o cr 1 x y fe x al y oh 3 s 3h the adsorption of cr2o7 2 cu oh 2 and cu 0 onto this composite material was likely to take place indeed the xps analysis of the alloy s particle surface after reaction showed that cr iii al iii fe iii cr vi cu ii and cu 0 were present see fig 5 the peak positions of cr iii and fe iii observed here were consistent with those identified in cr vi removal by zvi and fe al bimetal hu et al 2010 jiang et al 2015 li et al 2008 xiao et al 2015 it should be noted that the peaks of cu and cr phases were not observed in the xrd this was likely because the concentrations of cu and cr were too low to be detected by xrd relative to al and fe and their intermetallic phases in the alloy in summary the removal of cr vi by al fe alloy was in principle through its reduction to cr iii which then precipitated in cr oh 3 and or a composite of cr iii al iii fe iii hydroxides oxyhydroxides nitrate was removed by reduction to ammonia and cu ii was reduced to cu 0 4 conclusions removal rate of 20 50 mg l 1 no3 cu ii and cr vi from water by 15 g l 1 al fe alloy 20 fe was in an order of cu ii no3 cr vi for mixtures of these contaminants no3 cu ii and cr vi were primarily removed by chemical reduction to nh3 cu 0 and cr iii respectively and cr iii co precipitated in a composite of cr iii al iii fe iii hydroxides oxyhydroxides cu ii enhanced reduction rates of cr vi and no3 by 2 7 times while cr vi and no3 inhibited each other s removal rate cr vi suppressed the rate of cu ii removal by 84 and inhibited no3 reduction completely when cr vi

1556,fractured porous media receive less attention than classic porous media in terms of remediation processes and sui techniques that can be applied efficiently an etched glass micromodel was built in order to simulate a fractured bedrock the purpose of this paper was to evaluate the feasibility of surfactant alcohol injection to recover napl with this fractured glass micromodel the influence of several parameters influencing napl recovery via surfactant injection were tested in the micromodel the ratio of alcohol to surfactant the total concentration of active matter alcohol surfactant the number of pore volume injected the direction of the injection and the continuous or pulsed injection mode these tests made it possible to identify the key parameters for a better recovery of napl in a fractured environment which are continuous upward injection six pore volume of surfactant solution and a n amoh n buoh ratio of 2 5 micromodel experiments were compared to previous reported experiments using the same surfactant solutions injected in classical porous media the lower capillary number being required for napl recovery in porous media is probably related to the better sweep and the increase in surface area available for napl dissolution napl recovery may be improved by increasing the capillary number by increasing the injected surfactant solution viscosity with polymer or by injecting foam keywords lnapl recovery surfactant fractured and porous media capillary number 1 introduction in situ surfactant flushing appears as one of the most innovative technologies to remove organic compounds present at residual saturation in saturated porous media contamination from napl spillages remains challenging since it is tributary to the hydrophobic nature and low solubility of these compounds conventional techniques such as pump and treat remains inefficient highly expensive due to the long timeframe required to remove significant amount of contaminant haley et al 1991 mackay and cherry 1989 also pump and treat brings the soil to residual napl saturation which is inappropriate to meet standard quality concentration of water which requires further treatment surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear have been developed to accelerate contaminant mass removal for such systems wu et al 2018 surfactant allows to i modify interfacial tension between organic compound and water and promote the immiscible displacement or mobilization of the organic phase and ii increase solubilization by the formation of micelles above the critical micellar concentration cmc schramm 2000 despite the fact that numerous studies have been conducted in column with porous media martel and gelinas 1996 bernardez et al 2009 jácome and van geel 2015 jousse et al 2017 guan et al 2018 in 2d cheng et al 2016 zhong et al 2016 wu et al 2018 or at a pilot scale rao et al 1997 jawitz et al 1998 lee et al 2005 atteia et al 2017 fractured porous media receive less attention in general it is the lack of established methods for the investigation of napl contamination in fractured systems mercer and cohen 1990 pankow and cherry 1996 that leads to little research in literature describing benefits of various remedial strategies or specific methods for dealing with napl remediation in fractured systems hardisty et al 2004 to our knowledge sear has not yet been rigorously tested in fractured environments etched glass micromodels have shown insight into contaminant recovery and displacing processes involving immiscible fluids zhong et al 2001 detwiler et al 2001 thereby a glass micromodel two dimensional was created by etching a pattern onto two glass plates which were fused together representative physical properties of fractured bedrocks were used to design the micromodel the purpose of this study was to identify the key parameters for an efficient recovery of napl using surfactant solutions 2 material and methods 2 1 fluids 2 1 1 surfactant the surfactant solution used in this study is a combination of two alcohols n amyl alcohol n amoh and n butanol n buoh and one surfactant hostapur sas 60 sas this solution was already proved to be efficient to recover diesel from aquifers martel and gelinas 1996 the mass fraction ratio of the n amyl alcohol and n butanol 2 5 1 1 5 1 0 1 or 1 0 were tested in this study a constant mass ratio of 1 1 between alcohols and sas were selected for all experiments 2 2 experimental set up 2 2 1 micromodel description the micromodel was built at the university of calgary according to mckellar and wardlaw 1982 techniques the micromodels consist of two glass plates each sizing 14 cm 14 cm 0 6 cm the central area of each plate 10 cm 10 cm is etched with a mirror image fracture network fig 1 entry and exit moats are located at the proximal and distal ends of the micromodel the moats span the lengths of the etched fracture system and have a width and depth of 0 50 cm and 150 μm respectively the bottom plate also has an additional etched moat which underlies entry moat and has a width of 0 2 cm and a depth of 300 μm this was added to ensure that the injected fluid entirely fills the entry moat upon injection and then penetrates the fracture system from a uniform starting point an entry port was drilled in the center of both moats through the top plates to control the fluid flow into and out of the model when assembled a spacing less or equal to 5 μm in height exists between the two plates from a volumetric point of view this spacing is moderate however it allows continuity of the wetting phase throughout the model in which it can bypass the non wetting phase in the etched fracture system by travelling in the pillar space between the plates due to limitations in glass etching techniques a minimum micromodel fracture aperture and depth of 100 μm can be achieved five fracture apertures were selected 180 255 330 455 and 580 μm as an equivalent range of fracture aperture four model fracture lengths were chosen 2 4 6 and 8 cm no fracture spans the entire length of the micromodel in order to avoid preferential flow paths from proximal to distal end twenty six fractures begin at each sides of the micromodel ensuring that each of those fractures crosses together to maintain hydraulic connectivity between both ends also an arbitrary orientation was chosen to observe the behaviour of fluids at fracture intersections and to obtain a maximum variability interconnecting small to large large to large and small to small apertures in addition dead end fractures were added to the micromodel to observe various trapping mechanisms these fractures lengths range from 2 to 4 cm and were interspaced at arbitrary orientations within the model fracture system tables 1 and 2 2 2 2 micromodel properties given the fracture apertures the depth of each fracture connected to the proximal end and the cross section of the pillar space the cross sectional area a v is equal to 2 25 mm2 the permeability of the micromodel was determined in a single phase water flood experiment with a fixed flow rate using the darcy law the permeability of the micromodel is equal to 534 darcy the fracture system pore volume was calculated three times using the digitalization software deskscan v 1 0 when digitalizing a fracture the end coordinates x y of the fracture are placed in an output file along with an identification number corresponding in ascending order 1 through 5 to the aperture classes and their corresponding depths a quickbasic program converts the fracture end coordinates

pillar space pore volume v pi equal to 45 mm3 the total pore volume v p v f v pi of the micromodel is calculated and equals to 240 mm3 the porosity for the etched part of the plate was calculated as follows θ v f v pi v t where v t is the total volume of the fracture system considering the total volume of the fracture system v t 193 5 mm3 the porosity of the etched part is 12 4 2 2 3 set up a mechanical syringe pump harvard apparatus 22 with a 25 0 ml gas tight syringe and teflon tubings are used to inject fluids into the fracture system a camera nikon was used to collect images for digitalization during the running experiments 2 3 experimental procedure once the micromodel is assembled complete water saturation was reached using methylene blue dyed deaerated water 0 5 g l then diesel dyed with redoil 1 g l flooded the water saturated model from the proximal to the distal end corresponding to a 0 80 0 05 ml 3 3 pv injection the injection rate was low enough 0 38 ml min to prevent diesel from entering the pillar space between the plates rather than flowing through the fractures the diesel advanced through the water saturated model until residual water saturation s wi was obtained then a water flood was performed 12 5 pv at the same rate until residual diesel oil saturation s or was obtained once s or was reached a second water flood combined with surfactant was made the purpose of the second water flood was to flush away any trapped diesel to reach a second oil saturation s ors experiments were done at 25 c 3 c during the experiments images were collected during each of the floods and at their endpoints which correspond to s wi s or and s ors the collected images provide the basis for quantitative analyses of the fluids displacements surfactant solutions efficiencies and diesel recoveries active matter concentration pore volume of surfactant solution injected flow rate and the orientations horizontal or vertical of the micromodel were varied 2 4 quantitative analyses collected images were digitalized to account for diesel in the fractures in order to obtain the total volume of diesel v ot during oil and water saturations for the diesel saturated fracture intersections the computer program subtracted the area of the smaller fractures to prevent duplication of the computed surfaces this method was used to calculate the surface area of both fluids by transforming the image into a binary file the surface area of the diesel blobs in the entry moat were also calculated and then multiplied by their depths to obtain their volume v om volume of diesel in the entry moat must be considered in the mass balance of the system since it can be displaced by the injected surfactant solutions diesel recovery was calculated as follows diesel recovery v ot sor v ot sors v ot sor 100 where vot sor is the total volume of diesel at sor vot sors is the total volume of diesel at sors the surfactant solution efficiency has been defined as the ratio between the mass of displaced diesel and the mass of active matter needed to do so the mass of displaced diesel is defined as follows displ diesel g v ot sor v ot sors ρ diesel table 3 shows the physical properties of the surfactant solutions cannon fenske viscometer picnometer for density injected into the micromodel the surfactant solutions are lighter but close to the density of water 0 9940 g cm3 and denser than the one for diesel 0 8316 g cm3 the solutions injected are more viscous than water but less than diesel high viscosity solutions promote high viscous forces responsible for a better diesel mobilization it also helps to maintain a more stable front via a favorable mobility ratio surfactant solutions with a density close to water minimises overriding or underriding of the solutions in the micromodel those parameters are used to calculate the capillary number n ca that is used to define the ability to displace immiscible fluids in porous media lake 1989 and calculated as follow n ca viscous forces capillary forces q μ σ cos θ where q is the displacing fluid velocity m s 1 μ is the viscosity of the displacing fluid pa s σ is the interfacial tension between diesel and water or the displacing fluid n m 1 θ is the contact angle between diesel and water 3 results 3 1 n amoh n buoh ratio the n amoh n buoh was tested to define its influence on diesel recovery both recoveries from fractures and moats were calculated fig 2 all the experiments were done using a constant 10 a m concentration and 6 pv of solution into the system globally the diesel recovery ranged from 55 5 to 68 3 for the fracture system and 52 7 to 95 9 for the moat the best ratio for the fractured system is 2 5 1 with a diesel recovery that range from 64 1 to 68 3 and corresponding to the more viscous solution 3 2 active matter concentration effect a series of experiments by varying active matter concentrations from 2 5 to 12 5 using a surfactant solution of n amoh n buoh 2 5 1 and sas were conducted in order to define their effects on diesel recovery for all experiments 6 pv of surfactant solution were injected fig 3 emphasizes on the impact of the a m concentration on diesel recovery which reaches a maximum of 81 2 diesel recovery for a 12 5 a m concentration it also shows that the recovery is linearly correlated to the a m concentration of the washing solution as stated by martel et al 1993 12 5 a m concentration constitute an upper limit for this particular solution that becomes cloudy unstable at higher concentrations fig 4 shows the different efficiencies of surfactant solutions with various a m concentrations and their ability to displace diesel constant mass ratio corresponds to the ratio of the mass of active matter in the solution injected to the displaced mass of diesel two straight lines are shown one with a ratio of 2 5 and another with a ratio of 5 a ratio of 5 means that two times more surfactant is needed per mass of diesel displaced than for a ratio of 2 5 the more the concentration of a m increases the more the ratio decreases starting from 2 5 for lower a m concentrations 2 5 5 and ending towards 5 for higher a m concentrations 10 12 5 it can be observed that as the mass of active matter increases the mass of displaced diesel decrease both figures show that despite the fact that the solution efficiency decreases with increasing a m concentration elevated a m concentrations are required to maximize the diesel recovery and achieve remedial goals 3 3 injected pore volume effect a series of experiments varying the injected pore volume 2 3 4 6 and 12 pv using a surfactant solution of n amoh n buoh 2 5 1 and sas with 10 a m concentration were conducted in order to define the effect of injected pore volume on the recovery of diesel fig 5 shows that the recovery increases with increasing injected pore volume until 6 pv additional pore volume contributes moderately to the diesel recovery and mass ratio between injected a m concentration and displaced diesel decreases as the injected pore volume increases fig 6 as the washing solution progresses the area of diesel in contact with surfactant solution decreases and therefore the amount of diesel recovered still increase but with less diesel becoming available 3 4 continuous vs pulsed injection to evaluate which injection strategy provides the better contact between surfactant solution and diesel two types of injections were evaluated first pulsed injection was considered and consisted of injecting a 2 pv slug of surfactant solution followed by an injection of 8 pv of water and repeating twice for a total 6 pv of surfactant solution injected secondly continuous injection was considered and consisted of a continuous injection of 6 pv of surfactant solution both injection strategies were repeated several times 4 times for the pulsed injection and 5 times for the continuous injection and the results were compared in terms of diesel recovery for both injection types the surfactant solution containing a ratio of n amoh n buoh of 2 5 1 and an a m concentration of 10 was used fig 7 demonstrates the diesel recovery for both injections with an average range of 57 1 to 64 1 for the final 6 vp injection these experiments seem to indicate that there is no advantage to use the pulsed injection mode the efficiency of both types mass ratio of injections lies between 20 and 30 and the variance of both injections overlap one another fig 8 a continuous injection would be preferred since the volume of wastewater produced and treated is higher for a pulsed injection 3 5 selecting the best injection conditions to increase diesel recovery from observation made in sections 3 2 3 3 and 3 4 it was decided to compare different masses of injected active matter to find the optimized combination between the number of pore volume injected and the concentration of active matter for an equivalent mass of active matter it is preferable to inject a surfactant solution with a higher a m concentration with a low number of pore volume than the contrary since the resulting diesel recovery is higher this was shown on fig 9 with the point couple a a and b b same active matter injected into the micromodel both a and b formulations have higher a m concentrations lower volumes injected and higher diesel recovery even if the injection of a 12 5 a m solution for 12 pv was not done for this study theoretically it would be the optimal solution to use 3 6 impact of injection strategy experiments were also done by placing the micromodel in a vertical position to determine the effect of the additional buoyancy force on diesel recovery experiments were done using a surfactant solution of n amoh n buoh 2 5 1 and sas with 10 a m concentration with upwards downwards and sideways fluid injection the velocity was kept constant for all the micromodel orientations no large difference between horizontal and upwards injections were observed table 4 the slight difference is probably due to the extra gravitational force displacing the diesel out of the micromodel fracture system however the diesel recovery greatly decreases in the downwards injections case as expected since in this case the buoyancy force acts in the opposite direction to the flow since the micromodel is not symmetrical around its center the fracture configuration system is not the same for both injection sideways thus yielding slightly different results sideways injections of surfactant solution have a lower diesel recovery since the mobilized diesel tends to displace itself upwards in the fractured system instead of out of the micromodel 3 7 capillary number capillary numbers were calculated for experiments using n amoh n buoh 2 5 1 and 1 5 1 and sas solutions and plotted against schematic capillary desaturation curves from guo et al 2017 fig 10 as defined by the n ca equation residual saturation decreases as a function of the viscosity of the injected solution and the reduction the interfacial tension this decrease is observed only above a critical capillary number n ca corresponding to the point where viscous forces overcome capillary forces and non wetting phase desaturation is initiated also comparing our data to schematic curves defined for porous media without fracture the desaturation of diesel in the fractured media appears to follow a path similar to classical porous media when n ca is increasing the shift along n ca axis between all capillary desaturation curves might be attributed to wettability permeability and porous media configuration guo et al 2017 no attempt to fit was conducted because of the lack of data for n ca up to 10 2 corresponding to the region were the residual saturation decrease moderately and lower than 10 5 corresponding to the normal range water floods micromodel results were compared to the n ca calculated from martel and gelinas 1996 in columns containing ottawa sand martel and gelinas 1996 compared diesel recovery using the same surfactant alcohol mixture results from these experiments were plotted on fig 9 both set of results show approximately the same trend of diesel desaturation curve for porous media it can be observed that desaturation of diesel occurs at lower n ca lower than 10 6 than for fractured media lower than 10 4 this gap between both desaturation curves might be attributed to diesel wettability over the sand and the micromodel glass higher surface area of contact between surfactant solution and diesel in the porous media which leads to a better solubilization of the diesel this mechanism was not observed in the micromodel fracture heterogeneity in the micromodel which leads to a lower sweep efficiency of the surfactant solution 4 summary and implications for aquifer remediation the purpose of this work was to systematically evaluate the impact of various physicochemical factors such as alcohol ratio surfactant concentration and injection strategy on capillary napl desaturation in a fractured porous media an increase in diesel desaturation was observed with increasing active matter content in the solutions however this study shows that diesel displacement is more dependent on capillary number than on surfactant concentration alone the only way to recover diesel from fractured and porous media is to drastically increase the capillary number this can be achieved either by increasing viscous forces from the injected solution or by decreasing ift between diesel and water to achieve ift reductions increasing the surfactant concentration may lead to an uncontrolled solubilization of diesel in water rosen and kunjappu 2012 and add additional difficulties during effluent treatment ift might also be decreased by the increase of the water salinity which is not conventional for aquifer remediation unlike the enhanced oil recovery industry increasing viscous force is achievable through varying the injection strategy for example by increasing injection flow rates up to a realistic value or by adding polymer martel et al 2004 zhong et al 2008 which tend to increase the viscosity of the injected fluid another way to increase the viscous forces acting to dislodge trapped diesel is to inject foam which exhibits the advantages of low surfactant consumption maire and fatin rouge 2017

might be applicable to fractured porous media yan et al 2006 a suitable capillary number of the flooding solution should be determined prior to a field application and may require an exhaustive characterization of the fractured system connectivity and heterogeneity acknowledgement the authors wish to thank the detalc program of environment canada for funding the project the project was also

1556,fractured porous media receive less attention than classic porous media in terms of remediation processes and sui techniques that can be applied efficiently an etched glass micromodel was built in order to simulate a fractured bedrock the purpose of this paper was to evaluate the feasibility of surfactant alcohol injection to recover napl with this fractured glass micromodel the influence of several parameters influencing napl recovery via surfactant injection were tested in the micromodel the ratio of alcohol to surfactant the total concentration of active matter alcohol surfactant the number of pore volume injected the direction of the injection and the continuous or pulsed injection mode these tests made it possible to identify the key parameters for a better recovery of napl in a fractured environment which are continuous upward injection six pore volume of surfactant solution and a n amoh n buoh ratio of 2 5 micromodel experiments were compared to previous reported experiments using the same surfactant solutions injected in classical porous media the lower capillary number being required for napl recovery in porous media is probably related to the better sweep and the increase in surface area available for napl dissolution napl recovery may be improved by increasing the capillary number by increasing the injected surfactant solution viscosity with polymer or by injecting foam keywords lnapl recovery surfactant fractured and porous media capillary number 1 introduction in situ surfactant flushing appears as one of the most innovative technologies to remove organic compounds present at residual saturation in saturated porous media contamination from napl spillages remains challenging since it is tributary to the hydrophobic nature and low solubility of these compounds conventional techniques such as pump and treat remains inefficient highly expensive due to the long timeframe required to remove significant amount of contaminant haley et al 1991 mackay and cherry 1989 also pump and treat brings the soil to residual napl saturation which is inappropriate to meet standard quality concentration of water which requires further treatment surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear have been developed to accelerate contaminant mass removal for such systems wu et al 2018 surfactant allows to i modify interfacial tension between organic compound and water and promote the immiscible displacement or mobilization of the organic phase and ii increase solubilization by the formation of micelles above the critical micellar

attention in general it is the lack of established methods for the investigation of napl contamination in fractured systems mercer and cohen 1990 pankow and cherry 1996 that leads to little research in literature describing benefits of various remedial strategies or specific methods for dealing with napl remediation in fractured systems hardisty et al 2004 to our knowledge sear has not yet been rigorously tested in fractured environments etched glass micromodels have shown insight into contaminant recovery and displacing processes involving immiscible fluids zhong et al 2001 detwiler et al 2001 thereby a glass micromodel two dimensional was created by etching a pattern onto two glass plates which were fused together representative physical properties of fractured bedrocks were used to design the micromodel the purpose of this study was to identify the key parameters for an efficient recovery of napl using surfactant solutions 2 material and methods 2 1 fluids 2 1 1 surfactant the surfactant solution used in this study is a combination of two alcohols n amyl alcohol n amoh and n butanol n buoh and one surfactant hostapur sas 60 sas this solution was already proved to be

1 1 between alcohols and sas were selected for all experiments 2 2 experimental set up 2 2 1 micromodel description the micromodel was built at the university of calgary according to mckellar and wardlaw 1982 techniques the micromodels consist of two glass plates each sizing 14 cm 14 cm 0 6 cm the central area of each plate 10 cm 10 cm is etched with a mirror image fracture network fig 1 entry and exit moats are located at the proximal and distal ends of the micromodel the moats span the lengths of the etched fracture system and have a width and depth of 0 50 cm and 150 μm respectively the bottom plate also has an additional etched moat which underlies entry moat and has a width of 0 2 cm and a depth of 300 μm this was added to ensure that the injected fluid entirely fills the entry moat upon injection and then penetrates the fracture system from a uniform starting point an entry port was drilled in the center of both moats through the top plates to control the fluid flow into and out of the model when assembled a spacing less or equal to 5 μm in height exists between the two plates from a volumetric point of view this spacing is moderate however it allows continuity of the wetting phase throughout the model in which it can bypass the non wetting phase in the etched fracture system by travelling in the pillar space between the plates due to limitations in glass etching techniques a minimum micromodel fracture aperture and depth of 100 μm can be achieved five fracture apertures were selected 180 255 330 455 and 580 μm as an equivalent range of fracture aperture four model fracture lengths were chosen 2 4 6 and 8 cm no fracture spans the entire length of the micromodel in order to avoid preferential flow paths from proximal to distal end twenty six fractures begin at each sides of the micromodel ensuring that each of those fractures crosses together to maintain hydraulic connectivity between both ends also an arbitrary orientation was chosen to observe the behaviour of fluids at fracture intersections and to obtain a maximum variability interconnecting small to large large to large and small to small apertures in addition dead end fractures were added to the micromodel to observe various trapping mechanisms these fractures lengths range from 2 to 4 cm and were interspaced at arbitrary orientations within the model fracture system tables 1 and 2 2 2

recoveries from fractures and moats were calculated fig 2 all the experiments were done using a constant 10 a m concentration and 6 pv of solution into the system globally the diesel recovery ranged from 55 5 to 68 3 for the fracture system and 52 7 to 95 9 for the moat the best ratio for the fractured system is 2 5 1 with a diesel recovery that range from 64 1 to 68 3 and corresponding to the more viscous solution 3 2 active matter concentration effect a series of experiments by varying active matter concentrations from 2 5 to 12 5 using a surfactant solution of n amoh n buoh 2 5 1 and sas

decreases in the downwards injections case as expected since in this case the buoyancy force acts in the opposite direction to the flow since the micromodel is not symmetrical around its center the fracture configuration system is not the same for both injection sideways thus yielding slightly different results sideways injections of surfactant solution have a lower diesel recovery since the mobilized diesel tends to displace itself upwards in the fractured system instead of out of the micromodel 3 7 capillary number capillary numbers were calculated for experiments using n amoh n buoh 2

resolution of approximately 30 μm and the rock samples are on the cm scale a computational grid for the intergranular space is generated and a micro dfn discrete fracture network model governs the grid properties a particle tracking method time domain random walk is used for transport simulations the basic concept of the model can now be formulated as follows when a particle is close to a reactive mineral surface it has a certain probability to get sorbed during a certain time span once sorbed it will remain so a certain time the model requires a number of input parameters that represent the sorption properties of the reactive minerals attempts are made to relate the parameters to traditional distribution parameters the model is evaluated by comparisons with recent laboratory experimental data these experiments consider two rock types veined gneiss and pegmatitic granite and two radionuclides cesium and barium it is concluded that the new reactive transport model can simulate the experimental data in a consistent and realistic way 1 introduction reactive processes in porous media take place at the interfaces between fluid and solid phases molins 2015 when considering diffusive transport of radionuclides in a crystalline rock we need to consider processes on the micrometer μm scale typically the mineral grains are larger but the aperture of micro fractures and the distances between grains are on the μm scale voutilainen et al 2019a recently x ray micro computed tomography x μct and related analysis methods have been developed to resolve three dimensional grain distributions ketcham and carlson 2001 fusseis et al 2014 these grain maps have a resolution of about 10 μm and hence describe the grains well but the sample size is presently limited to a few cm each grain can be connected to a mineral type and the abundances of the main minerals can be calculated it has been demonstrated trinchero et al 2016 iraola et al 2017 voutilainen et al 2017 tachi et al 2018 that the heterogeneity of a rock matrix affects the diffusion process as for example manifested in a breakthrough curve btc specific sorption on surfaces of different minerals and heterogeneities in pore and mineral structures have been suggested as an explanation to this departure from models assuming a homogeneous matrix this study along the studies mentioned above is motivated by the performance assessment and safety analysis of underground repositories for spent nuclear waste in the swedish and finnish programs a crystalline rock e g gneiss granite and metamorphic rock has been chosen as the host medium and we are hence focused on migration in this type of bedrocks in this study a numerical model of reactive transport will be presented and evaluated the starting point is the three dimensional mineral map provided by x μct from such maps computational grids that cover the intergranular space are generated and grid properties are specified the model is based on a particle tracking routine and particles will hence diffuse in the 3d intergranular grid in this type of simulations a particle means a fraction of mass and sometimes the term tracer particle is used if a particle is close to a reactive mineral surface it may get sorbed and stay sorbed for a certain time it is realized that the model will entail a large number of parameters that cannot be firmly established for this reason we present the model more as an approach with some novel features that are still open for improvements the reactive particle tracking method is implemented in the hydrogeological code darcytools svensson and ferry 2014 darcytools is a finite volume code that embodies a wide range of techniques and methods needed in the hydrogeological evaluation of deep repositories in fact darcytools was developed with this type of applications in mind and can hence be described as the tailor made repository code the construction of the computational grid is based on work performed by voutilainen et al 2012 2019a using c 14 pmma autoradiography and x μct the recent ideas by iraola et al 2017 and svensson et al 2018 2019 for constructing 3d intergranular grids have been applied and further developed time domain random walk tdrw has been used in the transport modelling where ideas presented by dentz et al 2012 iraola et al 2017 and voutilainen et al 2017 have been adapted for simulating the reactive transport of the tracer particles recently russian et al 2016 and kuva et al 2019 have improved the tdrw method so that effect of advection can be taken into account the model will be evaluated in various ways the main part is a comparison with some recent laboratory experiments considering diffusion and sorption of cesium and barium muuri et al 2017 2018a 2018b both veined gneiss and pegmatitic granite were used in the experiments and various distribution coefficients were evaluated the rock samples used in the experiments were not scanned by x μct so other samples from the site were used in the numerical experiments the samples used are however from the same borehole the model is also evaluated by relating the model parameters to the distribution coefficients kd and ka to be defined in section 2 3 that are typically determined experimentally to represent the magnitude of chemical sorption a comparison is also performed with a simple through diffusion case for which an analytical solution is available the main objective of the study is to present and evaluate a reactive particle tracking method that is based on x μct 2 materials and methods 2 1 the rock samples in the framework of the large experimental rock matrix retention properties repro project carried out at the onkalo test site in finland different laboratory characterization studies have been conducted two types of crystalline rock samples from the experimental site of the repro project are studied in this work the selected veined gneiss vgn and pegmatitic granite pgr samples represent the typical rock types of olkiluoto and their porosity mineralogy and transport properties have been widely studied previously kärki and paulamäki 2006 smellie et al 2014 ikonen et al 2014 kuva et al 2015 sammaljärvi et al 2017 muuri et al 2018b voutilainen et al 2018 aromaa et al 2019 the samples represent the same rock types and have been collected from the same drill cores pgr samples from onk pp318 and vgn samples from onk pp323 onk pp324 and onk pp327 as the samples for the laboratory experiments see section 2 2 in previous studies porosities ranging from 0 3 to 0 75 and from 0 3 to 1 3 have been measured for pgr and vgn respectively samples from the repro site using water gravimetry ar gas pycnometry and c 14 pmma autoradiography ikonen et al 2014 kuva et al 2015 furthermore effective diffusion coefficients of 5 7 0 7 10 13 m2 s and 1 7 0 2 10 13 m2 s were measured for pgr and vgn respectively samples using through diffusion experiments of hto voutilainen et al 2018 voutilainen et al 2019b have estimated that in in situ conditions the porosities and effective diffusion coefficients are about 20 and 32 respectively smaller than in the laboratory experiments indicate previously voutilainen et al 2019a have resolved the 3d mineral structure of the repro samples with x ray tomography and determined the porosity distribution with c 14 pmma autoradiography furthermore they have constructed 3d grain distributions of the samples by first segmenting different main mineral phases from each other by their x ray attenuation coefficient and then grains from mineral phases by performing a watershed segmentation on 3d mineral phase images the main minerals of the samples are quartz plagioclase k feldspar and mica unfortunately the x ray attenuation of quartz and plagioclase overlap and thus they cannot be segmented from each other directly however the grains belonging to the mineral phase that included quartz and plagioclase were randomly divided according to their known abundances sammaljärvi et al 2017 the constructed 3d grain distributions see fig 1 form the base of this work and are being further processed in order to create more realistic grain scale models the 3d grain distributions were 8 bit gray scale images the gray scale values of each grain were artificially selected so that different minerals had their own gray scale range and no grain has the same gray scale value as any of its neighboring grains see table 1 furthermore the voxel size of the original 3d grain distributions was reduced to 27 16 μm 2 2 the laboratory experiments the laboratory diffusion experiments used for the evaluation of the model are described in detail by muuri et al 2017 2018a 2018b two diffusion experiments with different set ups were carried out see fig 2 in the first type of experiment muuri et al 2017 2018a a cube approximately 1 1 1 cm3 was placed at the bottom of a vessel and five faces of the cube were exposed to the tracer solution volume of 15 ml results for cesium were reported in muuri et al 2017 and results for barium in muuri et al 2018a in the second type of experiment muuri et al 2018b diffusion of barium was studied using a larger sample 4 5 3 1 cm3 fig 2 only one side was exposed to the solution volume of 20 ml in order to allow one dimensional models in the analysis in practice this is equivalent with case where solution is transported in water conducting fracture and the tracer molecules may diffuse to surrounding rock matrix the phenomena is the main retention process for the transport of radionuclides in bedrock posiva 2013 for both experiments two rock types were tested vgn and pgr while in the second experiment the surface was polished after sawing in the first experiment it was not muuri et al 2018b performed the polishing to determine accurately the penetration curves after the diffusion experiment and it can be assumed that the polishing does not affect the decrease of the tracer concentration the decrease of the tracer concentration in the solution c t was measured during the experiment in the analysis c t is scaled using the initial concentration of the tracer in the surrounding solution c 0 in order to compare different measurements in the first experiment c t was measured for four months and in the second experiment c t was measured for about three months the numerical model is set up to simulate the experimental data and conditions as closely as possible another useful result from the experiments was the k d values obtained from crushed minerals and rocks our model is built on the concept that each tracer sorbs on one or several specific minerals from the experiments mineral specific k d values were measured it is expected that these are correlated to the adsorption time t d which is an important model parameter the correlation will be evaluated 2 3 transport model a conceptual view of the situation considered is given in fig 3 initially all particles are in solution and we denote this concentration c 0 it is then expected that particles will sorb on mineral surfaces that are directly exposed to the solution this is a comparatively fast process as the molecular diffusion of the solution controls the time scale particles may also diffuse into the rock through intergranular micro fractures and sorb on internal surfaces hence an in diffusion process which is slower as the effective intergranular diffusion coefficient is lower than the molecular diffusion coefficient for the solution a global parameter of interest is the decreasing concentration c t in the solution normalized with the initial concentration i e c t c 0 the basic concept of the numerical model presented here is that different radionuclides react differently with different mineral surfaces as an input the model requires a three dimensional mineral map and information how a certain radionuclide reacts with different minerals note that this is not information that is provided by the traditional distribution coefficients k d and k a the basic parameters of the model can now be introduced when a particle is close to a reactive mineral surface it has a certain probability p s to get sorbed within a certain time interval t s if sorbed it will stay sorbed for a time t d before desorption an immediate question is what close means we are developing a numerical method and it will be assumed that a particle may get sorbed when in a computational cell that has one or more cell faces in contact with a reactive grain the cell size δ is hence a model parameter if we consider that the events of being sorbed are distributed according to an exponential density function with parameter k 1 then 1 f x exp k 1 x if x 0 f x 0 if x 0 where x is a continuous random variable then the probability ps that the particle gets sorbed before ts is given by 2 p s p x t s 1 exp k 1 t s which gives 3 k 1 log 1 p s t s now consider that the desorption events are distributed according to an exponential density function assuming that the time between events is a poisson point process with parameter k 2 the mean time before release is then given by 4 t d e x 1 k 2 where 5 k 2 1 t d k 1 and k 2 are the numerical input parameters of the model when setting the numerical values for the four parameters p s t s t d and δ one should note that they are related see appendixes a and b the cell size is considered as fixed and t d will be a calibration parameter and we hence need to set values for p s and t s p s if one out of six cell walls is in contact with a sorbing mineral the probability to get sorbed is 1 6 however more cell walls can be in contact and we chose to put p s 0 2 t s the time to leave a cell by molecular diffusion is specified for t s δ 2 2 d mol where d mol is the molecular diffusion coefficient it should be emphasized that the exact values chosen for p s and t s will influence t d see discussion section one may also note that p s and t s are both part of 3 strictly only three parameters are needed however we keep both p s and t s for easier physical interpretation the particle tracking method is time domain random walk tdrw russian et al 2016 the method is implemented for both advection and diffusion in the code used darcytools svensson and ferry 2014 but here only diffusive transport is considered darcytools is a finite volume code for simulation of flow and transport in porous and or fractured media it is a general code for this class of problems but the analysis of a repository for nuclear waste is the main intended application two features of the code are specifically significant in the present context an unstructured cartesian grid with the possibility to remove refine cells locally and grid properties that are generated from a micro dfn 2 4 grids and micro dfn the construction of the computational grid and the intergranular fracture network micro dfn are presented and discussed in detail by svensson et al 2019 and only described here briefly the basic idea of the construction is outlined in fig 4 a grid that covers the 3d domain is first generated the cells inside grains are removed and a grid with typically two cells covering the intergranular space is obtained a micro dfn with fracture centres inside the grid is generated and the fracture properties govern the cell properties the cells that are not in contact with the fractures are removed as a final step in the micro dfn model fracture orientation follows a fisher distribution here a random orientation is used and spatial centres are statistically independent and follow a poisson process the number of fractures in the length interval l to l dl is simulated using the following power law equation 6 n i l a l dl l ref a l l ref a where n is the number of fractures per unit volume i m 3 is the intensity a is the power law exponent and lref m is the reference length which is here set to 1 m the micro dfn is tuned by a simulation of a steady state through diffusion case with fixed upstream and downstream boundary conditions the flux through the sample then gives the effective diffusion coefficient d e and the summed up intergranular porosity gives the global porosity ε tables 2 and 3 give the outcome of this exercise the tuning of the micro dfn is discussed in svensson et al 2018 here we follow the same procedure and use the diffusivity and aperture as calibration parameters it is useful to note that the apertures will control the global porosity while the product of the diffusivity and aperture controls the effective diffusivity as can be seen the calibrated d e and ε are in agreement with experimental data after this calibration the properties of the samples i e d e and ε will not be changed computational grids for the two experimental set ups are shown in figs 5 to 7 inside and close to the samples the grid has a constant cell size of 27 16 μm outside this volume the grid size is expanded in order to reduce the total number of cells still the number of cells ranges from 15 to 42 million cells in figs 5 and 6 the porosity distribution is illustrated one may note that the pgr sample has higher intergranular porosities which is due to the larger aperture specified for pgr see table 3 the above descriptions of data concepts and methods are summarized by the following computational steps 1 the 3d mineral maps are the starting point a 3d grid that covers the rock sample is generated and all cells get a gray scale value 2 cells inside grains are removed based on a test of gray scale values if all neighboring cells have the same value the cell can be removed 3 the resulting grid has holes representing grains and typically two cells will cover the intergranular space see fig 4 4 next a micro dfn is generated with fracture centres inside the grid the fracture network is based on eq 6 and the parameters in table 3 5 a new grid is generated inside the rock samples all cells not in contact with the micro dfn are removed note that the mineral maps are not used at this stage the resulting grid will have holes representing grains as before but a grain will no longer have a cell layer completely embedding the grain i e the grid is less connected we also note see fig 4 that fractures may intersect grains and a certain intragranular space is generated 6 cells will get properties diffusion coefficients and porosities from the micro dfn 7 the grid is then marked with the 3d mineral map which means that all cells get a gray scale value cells that belong to a reactive mineral phase are given a certain t d value other cells will get t d 0 it is the rates k 1 and k 2 eqs 3 and 5 that are specified for each cell 8 the initial particle distribution is generated by a random process giving a more or less depending on the number of particles uniform distribution in the solution 9 the tdrw can be started 3 results the simulations were set up following the outlines given in fig 2 however some differences should be mentioned in the studies by muuri et al 2017 2018a experiments with three different samples were performed the samples had slightly different dimensions the weight was from 4 9 to 5 5 g which however is not expected to influence the results in the present simulations an average size was used in the study by muuri et al 2018b the sample was larger than the grain map available the sample in the simulations had for this reason an area of 17 17 mm facing the solution the volume of the solution was adjusted correspondingly the model has one calibration parameter t d for each case a range of values for t d was tested and the best fit was selected this was done subjectively without any objective criterion in fig 8 the results for cesium are shown for vgn and pgr it will be assumed that cesium sorbs only on mica for vgn for pgr the mica content is only 2 table 1 and it will be assumed that plagioclase and k feldspar provide the sorbtion sites for most cases both the data and the simulations show a rapid drop of concentration in the beginning followed by a slower decrease of the concentration the first is caused by sorption on surfaces that are in contact with the tracer solution while the slower process is due to in diffusion see fig 3 further the large initial drop for vgn is related to the high mica content of this sample the corresponding results for barium are shown in fig 9 for the first type of experiment and in fig 10 for the second type of experiment for barium the same assumption as for cesium will apply i e sorbtion on mica for vgn and sorption on k feldspar and plagioclase for pgr both the data and the simulation show similar concentration changes as for cesium the agreement between simulations and data is considered to be acceptable for barium in vgn fig 9 a less good fit is found it should however be noted that the measured concentrations increase after 1800 h this can not be captured by the model for the second type of experiment an illustration of the penetration of barium into the sample is given by fig 11 and a comparison with measured data is found in fig 12 we find that after 1700 h the penetration depth is about 1 mm for vgn and 2 3 mm for pgr note that in fig 11 almost all particles are sorbed in the matrix the time fraction the particles are mobile is hence short compared to the time the particles are sorbed it has been argued that the fast initial drop of the solute concentration is due to surface sorption in figs 13 and 14 the simulated particle distribution on the sample surface is shown for vgn and pgr revealing surface sorption as expected indicating that the particles are concentrated on the mineral surfaces that have been specified as reactive the final case concerns a sensitivity study shown in fig 15 results are sensitive to small changes in both the effective diffusion coefficient and the desorption time experimentally determined effective diffusion coefficients may vary significantly the variation shown may thus be interpreted as the effect of using a range of samples similar to what was done in the experiments the desorption time can be related to k d and one may note that k d values determined in experiments have rather high uncertainties the calibrated t d values are summarized in table 4 and will be discussed below a nice feature of the experiments is that several samples were used for the same rock and the same tracer the samples are from the same borehole and the spread in the results thus indicates that variations from one sample to another may still be significant the spread also gives an uncertainty range when it comes to comparisons with the simulated profiles with this as a background we may conclude that the simulations are in fair agreement with the experimental data 4 discussion in typical applications k d is used as the parameter that describes the retention caused by reversible chemical sorption for this reason we will in this section discuss the relation between k d and the parameters of the present model the kd value is a direct measure of the partitioning of a tracer between the solid and liquid phases values are obtained from laboratory experiments where crushed material is placed in a liquid solution at equilibrium the amount of the tracer sorbed on the mineral and the amount still in the solution is measured let us see how this works out for a particle tracking approach if we denote the mass of the crushed material by m and the volume of the solute by v kd is obtained as 7 k d n sorb n free v m m 3 kg where n sorb and n free are the number of sorbed and free particles respectively in appendix a a relation between kd and the parameters of the present model is derived 8 k d 6 p s l 2 t d ρ dt s where ρ is the density of the grain particles d the diameter of a sphere the sorbing surface is assumed to be due to spherical grains and l 2 is the distance from the mineral surface to where a particle has a probability to get sorbed as explained earlier the distance l 2 is set to the cell size δ in a numerical simulation if we use the same values for p s t s and δ as in the application to the laboratory experiments we arrive at a relation between kd and td and d this relation is shown in fig 16 a numerical simulation was also performed by simulating the sorption on a cube 5 5 5 mm3 placed in a box 10 10 10 mm3 at steady state equilibrium n sorb and n free were noted and kd was calculated from eq 7 this confirmed the relations shown in fig 16 these relations are useful when considering the connection to experimentally determined so called batch kd values it should however be remembered that surface sorption at equilibrium is assumed next we consider sorption on inner surfaces in appendix b it is shown how t d can be related to kd for a so called through diffusion case btc s for a vgn sample are generated and compared to an analytical solution the outcome is k d 2 6 10 6 t d it is clear that much smaller kd values result from this relation as compared to the batch experiment values shown in fig 16 this is expected as the internal mineral surfaces are less accessible for the particles the laboratory experiments by muuri et al 2017 2018a 2018b are probably best described as having both surface and internal sorption as important components the c t c 0 curves have a characteristic shape where the first fast drop is due to surface sorption and the smaller drop later on indicates that penetration takes place in muuri et al 2017 mineral specific kd values are given in our model we need mineral specific td s for the radionuclide simulated the relation between these two parameters is clearly of interest the relation for cesium is shown in fig 17 based on the data given in table 4 as a final comment it is noted that the kd method has several shortcomings 1 kd values need to be evaluated for each new rock type as the mineral abundances are not explicitly accounted for 2 kd values may have two contributions surface sorption and sorption on internal surfaces 3 kd values are determined for the crushed material crushing creates additional fresh mineral surfaces that may be more reactive than aged surfaces previously it has been shown that the crushing increases the kd values by about factor of 10 andré et al 2009 muuri et al 2018b puukko et al 2018 voutilainen et al 2019b furthermore kd values dependent on the size distribution of the crushed material lehto et al 2019 the suggested method may eliminate some of these shortcomings but requires t d values for each mineral type for each radionuclide considered the laboratory data are available for limited number of radionuclides other possibility to resolve the shortcomings could be using a model for handling uptake kinetics barrow 1978 this kind of models would be particularly advantageous when speciation of the elements is of interest we present the model as an approach to sorption in a rock matrix it is then in place to discuss assumptions and limitations one of the key limitations is that we are only considering the intergranular space for an in diffusion problem fractures and grain boundaries may dominate the process the intragranular domain does however contribute to the total porosity and may also provide sorption sites in svensson et al 2018 alternative ways of generating the intergranular and intragranular domain are illustrated it is expected that the future development of the model will focus on the inclusion of the intragranular domain 5 conclusions we have presented a particle based numerical reactive transport model that represents reactive grain surfaces explicitly a three dimensional mineral map given by x μct is the starting point from this a computational grid for the intergranular space is generated and grid properties are generated from a micro dfn the transport model is based on the concept when a particle is close to a reactive mineral surface it has a probability ps to get sorbed within a time span ts once sorbed it will remain so a certain time td before desorbed ps and ts are given fixed values while td is considered as a calibration parameter the model is evaluated by applications to some recent laboratory experiments by muuri et al 2017 2018a 2018b these experiments include two rock types veined gneiss and pegmatitic granite and two radionuclides cesium and barium it is concluded that the model can be tuned to these experimental results using td as the single calibration parameter finally the model parameters are related to the traditional distribution parameters kd and ka acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge financial support

is a9 k d 6 k a ρd where ρ is the particle density this gives a10 k d 6 p s l 2 t d ρ dt s which is the sought relation appendix b the t d k d relation based on a transient through diffusion analysis the case considered is shown in fig b 1 it is a through diffusion set up with constant concentration in the upstream reservoir the time integrated flux at the downstream boundary i e the breakthrough curve btc is the main output of interest the initial and boundary conditions for the case are as follows c x 0 0 x 0 c 0 t c 0 t 0 c x t 0 x d where c 0 is the concentration in the reservoir in accordance with the chosen boundary conditions the analytical solution of fick s 2nd law for the contaminant mass m that has diffused through the rock slab per unit area is given by crank 1975 b1 m c

sample 10 10 10 mm3 and sorption on mica we first simulate btc s for a range of t d s and then fit the analytical solution to these btc s by adjusting the apparent diffusion coefficient d a it is then straight forward to find the corresponding k d by the relation d a d e ε ρk d before the t d k d relation is discussed we need to consider the conservative t d k d 0 case as the porosity ε and the effective diffusion coefficient d e will be treated as known from a steady state diffusion simulation using the vgn sample it was found that d e 1 7 10 13 m2 s and ε 0 61 hence it is only ρk d that are not known in the analytical solution ρ was set to 2700 kg m3 for the sorbing cases two more aspects need to be considered firstly we do not want the results to be dominated by surface sorption on the upstream face of the sample for this reason the first 50 10 6 m of the sample was specified as non sorbing for all cases secondly the concentration in the upstream reservoir should be constant for strongly sorbing cases and hence long integration times it was required to continuously add particles to the reservoir by doing so an approximately constant concentration could be preserved a range of t d values 0 10 100 and 1000 were then specified and the corresponding btc s were generated the case t d 0 can be regarded as a limiting case for small sorption rates from the analytical solution the k d values that fitted the numerical solution were found the comparison is shown in fig b 2 the k d values were found to be linearly related to t d b2 k d 2 6 10 6 t d the simple relation found is encouraging but it should be recalled that this k d is relevant for the sample considered in our basic model it is a k d relevant for a specific nuclide on a specific mineral surface that is of more interest fig b 1 outline of the case considered the domain has a length of d and the upstream reservoir has a constant concentration c0 the dotted line indicates a distance of 50 μm where sorption is suppressed fig b 1 fig b 2 integrated mass flux versus time solid lines give the analytical solution and dots the numerical solution the td values specified from left to right are 0 10 100 and 1000

1557,a numerical reactive transport model for crystalline rocks is developed and evaluated the model is based on mineral maps generated by x ray micro computed tomography x μct the maps used have a resolution of approximately 30 μm and the rock samples are on the cm scale a computational grid for the intergranular space is generated and a micro dfn discrete fracture network model governs the grid properties a particle tracking method time domain random walk is used for transport simulations the basic concept of the model can now be formulated as follows when a particle is close to a reactive mineral surface it has a certain probability to get sorbed during a certain time span once sorbed it will remain so a certain time the model requires a number of input parameters that represent the sorption properties of the reactive minerals attempts are made to relate the parameters to traditional distribution parameters the model is evaluated by comparisons with recent laboratory experimental data these experiments consider two rock types veined gneiss and pegmatitic granite and two radionuclides cesium and barium it is concluded that the new reactive transport model can simulate the experimental data in a consistent and realistic way 1 introduction reactive processes in porous media take place at the interfaces between fluid and solid phases molins 2015 when considering diffusive transport of radionuclides in a crystalline rock we need to consider processes on the micrometer μm scale typically the mineral grains are larger but the aperture of micro fractures and the distances between grains are on the μm scale voutilainen et al 2019a recently x ray micro computed tomography x μct and related analysis methods have been developed to resolve three dimensional grain distributions ketcham and carlson 2001 fusseis et al 2014 these grain maps have a resolution of about 10 μm and hence describe the grains well but the sample size is presently limited to a few cm each grain can be connected to a mineral type and the abundances of the main minerals can be calculated it has been demonstrated trinchero et al 2016 iraola et al 2017 voutilainen et al 2017 tachi et al 2018 that the heterogeneity of a rock matrix affects the diffusion process as for example manifested in a breakthrough curve btc specific sorption on surfaces of different minerals and heterogeneities in pore and mineral structures have been suggested as an explanation to this departure from models assuming a homogeneous matrix this study along the studies mentioned above is motivated by the performance assessment and safety analysis of underground repositories for spent nuclear waste in the swedish and finnish programs a crystalline rock e g gneiss granite and metamorphic rock has been chosen as the host medium and we are hence focused on migration in this type of bedrocks in this study a numerical model of reactive transport will be presented and evaluated the starting point is the three dimensional mineral map provided by x μct from such maps computational grids that cover the intergranular space are generated and grid properties are specified the model is based on a particle tracking routine and particles will hence diffuse in the 3d intergranular grid in this type of simulations a particle means a fraction of mass and sometimes the term tracer particle is used if a particle is close to a reactive mineral surface it may get sorbed and stay sorbed for a certain time it is realized that the model will entail a large number of parameters that cannot be firmly established for this reason we present the model more as an approach with some novel features that are still open for improvements the reactive particle tracking method is implemented in the hydrogeological code darcytools svensson and ferry 2014 darcytools is a finite volume code that embodies a wide range of techniques and methods needed in the hydrogeological evaluation of deep repositories in fact darcytools was developed with this type of applications in mind and can hence be described as the tailor made repository code the construction of the computational grid is based on work performed by voutilainen et al 2012 2019a using c 14 pmma autoradiography and x μct the recent ideas by iraola et al 2017 and svensson et al 2018 2019 for constructing 3d intergranular grids have been applied and further developed time domain random walk tdrw has been used in the transport modelling where ideas presented by dentz et al 2012 iraola et al 2017 and voutilainen et al 2017 have been adapted for simulating the reactive transport of the tracer particles recently russian et al 2016 and kuva et al 2019 have improved the tdrw method so that effect of advection can be taken into account the model will be evaluated in various ways the main part is a comparison with some recent laboratory experiments considering diffusion and sorption of cesium and barium muuri et al 2017 2018a 2018b both veined gneiss and pegmatitic granite were used in the experiments and various distribution coefficients were evaluated the rock samples used in the experiments were not scanned by x μct so other samples from the site were used in the numerical experiments the samples used are however from the same borehole the model is also evaluated by relating the model parameters to the distribution coefficients kd and ka to be defined in section 2 3 that are typically determined experimentally to represent the magnitude of chemical sorption a comparison is also performed with a simple through diffusion case for which an analytical solution is available the main objective of the study is to present and evaluate a reactive particle tracking method that is based on x μct 2 materials and methods 2 1 the rock samples in the framework of the large experimental rock matrix retention properties repro project carried out at the onkalo test site in finland different laboratory characterization studies have been conducted two types of crystalline rock samples from the experimental site of the repro project are studied in this work the selected veined gneiss vgn and pegmatitic granite pgr samples represent the typical rock types of olkiluoto and their porosity mineralogy and transport properties have been widely studied previously kärki and paulamäki 2006 smellie et al 2014 ikonen et al 2014 kuva et al 2015 sammaljärvi et al 2017 muuri et al 2018b voutilainen et al 2018 aromaa et al 2019 the samples represent the same rock types and have been collected from the same drill cores pgr samples from onk pp318 and vgn samples from onk pp323 onk pp324 and onk pp327 as the samples for the laboratory experiments see section 2 2 in previous studies porosities ranging from 0 3 to 0 75 and from 0 3 to 1 3 have been measured for pgr and vgn respectively samples from the repro site using water gravimetry ar gas pycnometry and c 14 pmma autoradiography ikonen et al 2014 kuva et al 2015 furthermore effective diffusion coefficients of 5 7 0 7 10 13 m2 s and 1 7 0 2 10 13 m2 s were measured for pgr and vgn respectively samples using through diffusion experiments of hto voutilainen et al 2018 voutilainen et al 2019b have estimated that in in situ conditions the porosities and effective diffusion coefficients are about 20 and 32 respectively smaller than in the laboratory experiments indicate previously voutilainen et al 2019a have resolved the 3d mineral structure of the repro samples with x ray tomography and determined the porosity distribution with c 14 pmma autoradiography furthermore they have constructed 3d grain distributions of the samples by first segmenting different main mineral phases from each other by their x ray attenuation coefficient and then grains from mineral phases by performing a watershed segmentation on 3d mineral phase images the main minerals of the samples are quartz plagioclase k feldspar and mica unfortunately the x ray attenuation of quartz and plagioclase overlap and thus they cannot be segmented from each other directly however the grains belonging to the mineral phase that included quartz and plagioclase were randomly divided according to their known abundances sammaljärvi et al 2017 the constructed 3d grain distributions see fig 1 form the base of this work and are being further processed in order to create more realistic grain scale models the 3d grain distributions were 8 bit gray scale images the gray scale values of each grain were artificially selected so that different minerals had their own gray scale range and no grain has the same gray scale value as any of its neighboring grains see table 1 furthermore the voxel size of the original 3d grain distributions was reduced to 27 16 μm 2 2 the laboratory experiments the laboratory diffusion experiments used for the evaluation of the model are described in detail by muuri et al 2017 2018a 2018b two diffusion experiments with different set ups were carried out see fig 2 in the first type of experiment muuri et al 2017 2018a a cube approximately 1 1 1 cm3 was placed at the bottom of a vessel and five faces of the cube were exposed to the tracer solution volume of 15 ml results for cesium were reported in muuri et al 2017 and results for barium in muuri et al 2018a in the second type of experiment muuri et al 2018b diffusion of barium was studied using a larger sample 4 5 3 1 cm3 fig 2 only one side was exposed to the solution volume of 20 ml in order to allow one dimensional models in the analysis in practice this is equivalent with case where solution is transported in water conducting fracture and the tracer molecules may diffuse to surrounding rock matrix the phenomena is the main retention process for the transport of radionuclides in bedrock posiva 2013 for both experiments two rock types were tested vgn and pgr while in the second experiment the surface was polished after sawing in the first experiment it was not muuri et al 2018b performed the polishing to determine accurately the penetration curves after the diffusion experiment and it can be assumed that the polishing does not affect the decrease of the tracer concentration the decrease of the tracer concentration in the solution c t was measured during the experiment in the analysis c t is scaled using the initial concentration of the tracer in the surrounding solution c 0 in order to compare different measurements in the first experiment c t was measured for four months and in the second experiment c t was measured for about three months the numerical model is set up to simulate the experimental data and conditions as closely as possible another useful result from the experiments was the k d values obtained from crushed minerals and rocks our model is built on the concept that each tracer sorbs on one or several specific minerals from the experiments mineral specific k d values were measured it is expected that these are correlated to the adsorption time t d which is an important model parameter the correlation will be evaluated 2 3 transport model a conceptual view of the situation considered is given in fig 3 initially all particles are in solution and we denote this concentration c 0 it is then expected that particles will sorb on mineral surfaces that are directly exposed to the solution this is a comparatively fast process as the molecular diffusion of the solution controls the time scale particles may also diffuse into the rock through intergranular micro fractures and sorb on internal surfaces hence an in diffusion process which is slower as the effective intergranular diffusion coefficient is lower than the molecular diffusion coefficient for the solution a global parameter of interest is the decreasing concentration c t in the solution normalized with the initial concentration i e c t c 0 the basic concept of the numerical model presented here is that different radionuclides react differently with different mineral surfaces as an input the model requires a three dimensional mineral map and information how a certain radionuclide reacts with different minerals note that this is not information that is provided by the traditional distribution coefficients k d and k a the basic parameters of the model can now be introduced when a particle is close to a reactive mineral surface it has a certain probability p s to get sorbed within a certain time interval t s if sorbed it will stay sorbed for a time t d before desorption an immediate question is what close means we are developing a numerical method and it will be assumed that a particle may get sorbed when in a computational cell that has one or more cell faces in contact with a reactive grain the cell size δ is hence a model parameter if we consider that the events of being sorbed are distributed according to an exponential density function with parameter k 1 then 1 f x exp k 1 x if x 0 f x 0 if x 0 where x is a continuous random variable then the probability ps that the particle gets sorbed before ts is given by 2 p s p x t s 1 exp k 1 t s which gives 3 k 1 log 1 p s t s now consider that the desorption events are distributed according to an exponential density function assuming that the time between events is a poisson point process with parameter k 2 the mean time before release is then given by 4 t d e x 1 k 2 where 5 k 2 1 t d k 1 and k 2 are the numerical input parameters of the model when setting the numerical values for the four parameters p s t s t d and δ one should note that they are related see appendixes a and b the cell size is considered as fixed and t d will be a calibration parameter and we hence need to set values for p s and t s p s if one out of six cell walls is in contact with a sorbing mineral the probability to get sorbed is 1 6 however more cell walls can be in contact and we chose to put p s 0 2 t s the time to leave a cell by molecular diffusion is specified for t s δ 2 2 d mol where d mol is the molecular diffusion coefficient it should be emphasized that the exact values chosen for p s and t s will influence t d see discussion section one may also note that p s and t s are both part of 3 strictly only three parameters are needed however we keep both p s and t s for easier physical interpretation the particle tracking method is time domain random walk tdrw russian et al 2016 the method is implemented for both advection and diffusion in the code used darcytools svensson and ferry 2014 but here only diffusive transport is considered darcytools is a finite volume code for simulation of flow and transport in porous and or fractured media it is a general code for this class of problems but the analysis of a repository for nuclear waste is the main intended application two features of the code are specifically significant in the present context an unstructured cartesian grid with the possibility to remove refine cells locally and grid properties that are generated from a micro dfn 2 4 grids and micro dfn the construction of the computational grid and the intergranular fracture network micro dfn are presented and discussed in detail by svensson et al 2019 and only described here briefly the basic idea of the construction is outlined in fig 4 a grid that covers the 3d domain is first generated the cells inside grains are removed and a grid with typically two cells covering the intergranular space is obtained a micro dfn with fracture centres inside the grid is generated and the fracture properties govern the cell properties the cells that are not in contact with the fractures are removed as a final step in the micro dfn model fracture orientation follows a fisher distribution here a random orientation is used and spatial centres are statistically independent and follow a poisson process the number of fractures in the length interval l to l dl is simulated using the following power law equation 6 n i l a l dl l ref a l l ref a where n is the number of fractures per unit volume i m 3 is the intensity a is the power law exponent and lref m is the reference length which is here set to 1 m the micro dfn is tuned by a simulation of a steady state through diffusion case with fixed upstream and downstream boundary conditions the flux through the sample then gives the effective diffusion coefficient d e and the summed up intergranular porosity gives the global porosity ε tables 2 and 3 give the outcome of this exercise the tuning of the micro dfn is discussed in svensson et al 2018 here we follow the same procedure and use the diffusivity and aperture as calibration parameters it is useful to note that the apertures will control the global porosity while the product of the diffusivity and aperture controls the effective diffusivity as can be seen the calibrated d e and ε are in agreement with experimental data after this calibration the properties of the samples i e d e and ε will not be changed computational grids for the two experimental set ups are shown in figs 5 to 7 inside and close to the samples the grid has a constant cell size of 27 16 μm outside this volume the grid size is expanded in order to reduce the total number of cells still the number of cells ranges from 15 to 42 million cells in figs 5 and 6 the porosity distribution is illustrated one may note that the pgr sample has higher intergranular porosities which is due to the larger aperture specified for pgr see table 3 the above descriptions of data concepts and methods are summarized by the following computational steps 1 the 3d mineral maps are the starting point a 3d grid that covers the rock sample is generated and all cells get a gray scale value 2 cells inside grains are removed based on a test of gray scale values if all neighboring cells have the same value the cell can be removed 3 the resulting grid has holes representing grains and typically two cells will cover the intergranular space see fig 4 4 next a micro dfn is generated with fracture centres inside the grid the fracture network is based on eq 6 and the parameters in table 3 5 a new grid is generated inside the rock samples all cells not in contact with the micro dfn are removed note that the mineral maps are not used at this stage the resulting grid will have holes representing grains as before but a grain will no longer have a cell layer completely embedding the grain i e the grid is less connected we also note see fig 4 that fractures may intersect grains and a certain intragranular space is generated 6 cells will get properties diffusion coefficients and porosities from the micro dfn 7 the grid is then marked with the 3d mineral map which means that all cells get a gray scale value cells that belong to a reactive mineral phase are given a certain t d value other cells will get t d 0 it is the rates k 1 and k 2 eqs 3 and 5 that are specified for each cell 8 the initial particle distribution is generated by a random process giving a more or less depending on the number of particles uniform distribution in the solution 9 the tdrw can be started 3 results the simulations were set up following the outlines given in fig 2 however some differences should be mentioned in the studies by muuri et al 2017 2018a experiments with three different samples were performed the samples had slightly different dimensions the weight was from 4 9 to 5 5 g which however is not expected to influence the results in the present simulations an average size was used in the study by muuri et al 2018b the sample was larger than the grain map available the sample in the simulations had for this reason an area of 17 17 mm facing the solution the volume of the solution was adjusted correspondingly the model has one calibration parameter t d for each case a range of values for t d was tested and the best fit was selected this was done subjectively without any objective criterion in fig 8 the results for cesium are shown for vgn and pgr it will be assumed that cesium sorbs only on mica for vgn for pgr the mica content is only 2 table 1 and it will be assumed that plagioclase and k feldspar provide the sorbtion sites for most cases both the data and the simulations show a rapid drop of concentration in the beginning followed by a slower decrease of the concentration the first is caused by sorption on surfaces that are in contact with the tracer solution while the slower process is due to in diffusion see fig 3 further the large initial drop for vgn is related to the high mica content of this sample the corresponding results for barium are shown in fig 9 for the first type of experiment and in fig 10 for the second type of experiment for barium the same assumption as for cesium will apply i e sorbtion on mica for vgn and sorption on k feldspar and plagioclase for pgr both the data and the simulation show similar concentration changes as for cesium the agreement between simulations and data is considered to be acceptable for barium in vgn fig 9 a less good fit is found it should however be noted that the measured concentrations increase after 1800 h this can not be captured by the model for the second type of experiment an illustration of the penetration of barium into the sample is given by fig 11 and a comparison with measured data is found in fig 12 we find that after 1700 h the penetration depth is about 1 mm for vgn and 2 3 mm for pgr note that in fig 11 almost all particles are sorbed in the matrix the time fraction the particles are mobile is hence short compared to the time the particles are sorbed it has been argued that the fast initial drop of the solute concentration is due to surface sorption in figs 13 and 14 the simulated particle distribution on the sample surface is shown for vgn and pgr revealing surface sorption as expected indicating that the particles are concentrated on the mineral surfaces that have been specified as reactive the final case concerns a sensitivity study shown in fig 15 results are sensitive to small changes in both the effective diffusion coefficient and the desorption time experimentally determined effective diffusion coefficients may vary significantly the variation shown may thus be interpreted as the effect of using a range of samples similar to what was done in the experiments the desorption time can be related to k d and one may note that k d values determined in experiments have rather high uncertainties the calibrated t d values are summarized in table 4 and will be discussed below a nice feature of the experiments is that several samples were used for the same rock and the same tracer the samples are from the same borehole and the spread in the results thus indicates that variations from one sample to another may still be significant the spread also gives an uncertainty range when it comes to comparisons with the simulated profiles with this as a background we may conclude that the simulations are in fair agreement with the experimental data 4 discussion in typical applications k d is used as the parameter that describes the retention caused by reversible chemical sorption for this reason we will in this section discuss the relation between k d and the parameters of the present model the kd value is a direct measure of the partitioning of a tracer between the solid and liquid phases values are obtained from laboratory experiments where crushed material is placed in a liquid solution at equilibrium the amount of the tracer sorbed on the mineral and the amount still in the solution is measured let us see how this works out for a particle tracking approach if we denote the mass of the crushed material by m and the volume of the solute by v kd is obtained as 7 k d n sorb n free v m m 3 kg where n sorb and n free are the number of sorbed and free particles respectively in appendix a a relation between kd and the parameters of the present model is derived 8 k d 6 p s l 2 t d ρ dt s where ρ is the density of the grain particles d the diameter of a sphere the sorbing surface is assumed to be due to spherical grains and l 2 is the distance from the mineral surface to where a particle has a probability to get sorbed as explained earlier the distance l 2 is set to the cell size δ in a numerical simulation if we use the same values for p s t s and δ as in the application to the laboratory experiments we arrive at a relation between kd and td and d this relation is shown in fig 16 a numerical simulation was also performed by simulating the sorption on a cube 5 5 5 mm3 placed in a box 10 10 10 mm3 at steady state equilibrium n sorb and n free were noted and kd was calculated from eq 7 this confirmed the relations shown in fig 16 these relations are useful when considering the connection to experimentally determined so called batch kd values it should however be remembered that surface sorption at equilibrium is assumed next we consider sorption on inner surfaces in appendix b it is shown how t d can be related to kd for a so called through diffusion case btc s for a vgn sample are generated and compared to an analytical solution the outcome is k d 2 6 10 6 t d it is clear that much smaller kd values result from this relation as compared to the batch experiment values shown in fig 16 this is expected as the internal mineral surfaces are less accessible for the particles the laboratory experiments by muuri et al 2017 2018a 2018b are probably best described as having both surface and internal sorption as important components the c t c 0 curves have a characteristic shape where the first fast drop is due to surface sorption and the smaller drop later on indicates that penetration takes place in muuri et al 2017 mineral specific kd values are given in our model we need mineral specific td s for the radionuclide simulated the relation between these two parameters is clearly of interest the relation for cesium is shown in fig 17 based on the data given in table 4 as a final comment it is noted that the kd method has several shortcomings 1 kd values need to be evaluated for each new rock type as the mineral abundances are not explicitly accounted for 2 kd values may have two contributions surface sorption and sorption on internal surfaces 3 kd values are determined for the crushed material crushing creates additional fresh mineral surfaces that may be more reactive than aged surfaces previously it has been shown that the crushing increases the kd values by about factor of 10 andré et al 2009 muuri et al 2018b puukko et al 2018 voutilainen et al 2019b furthermore kd values dependent on the size distribution of the crushed material lehto et al 2019 the suggested method may eliminate some of these shortcomings but requires t d values for each mineral type for each radionuclide considered the laboratory data are available for limited number of radionuclides other possibility to resolve the shortcomings could be using a model for handling uptake kinetics barrow 1978 this kind of models would be particularly advantageous when speciation of the elements is of interest we present the model as an approach to sorption in a rock matrix it is then in place to discuss assumptions and limitations one of the key limitations is that we are only considering the intergranular space for an in diffusion problem fractures and grain boundaries may dominate the process the intragranular domain does however contribute to the total porosity and may also provide sorption sites in svensson et al 2018 alternative ways of generating the intergranular and intragranular domain are illustrated it is expected that the future development of the model will focus on the inclusion of the intragranular domain 5 conclusions we have presented a particle based numerical reactive transport model that represents reactive grain surfaces explicitly a three dimensional mineral map given by x μct is the starting point from this a computational grid for the intergranular space is generated and grid properties are generated from a micro dfn the transport model is based on the concept when a particle is close to a reactive mineral surface it has a probability ps to get sorbed within a time span ts once sorbed it will remain so a certain time td before desorbed ps and ts are given fixed values while td is considered as a calibration parameter the model is evaluated by applications to some recent laboratory experiments by muuri et al 2017 2018a 2018b these experiments include two rock types veined gneiss and pegmatitic granite and two radionuclides cesium and barium it is concluded that the model can be tuned to these experimental results using td as the single calibration parameter finally the model parameters are related to the traditional distribution parameters kd and ka acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge financial support

2 t d t s which is the sought relation if we assume that the sorbing surface is due to the surface of a particle it is possible to relate k a to k d for spherical particles of diameter d the relation is a9 k d 6 k a ρd where ρ is the particle density this gives a10 k d 6 p s l 2 t d ρ dt s which is the sought relation appendix b the t d k d relation based on a transient through diffusion analysis the case considered is shown in fig b 1 it is a through diffusion set up with constant concentration in the upstream reservoir the time integrated flux at the downstream boundary i e the breakthrough curve btc is the main output of interest the initial and boundary conditions for the case are as follows c x 0 0 x 0 c 0 t c 0 t 0 c x t 0 x d where c 0 is the concentration in the reservoir in accordance with the chosen boundary conditions the analytical solution of fick s 2nd law for the contaminant mass m that has diffused through the rock slab per unit area is given by crank 1975 b1 m c

sample 10 10 10 mm3 and sorption on mica we first simulate btc s for a range of t d s and then fit the analytical solution to these btc s by adjusting the apparent diffusion coefficient d a it is then straight forward to find the corresponding k d by the relation d a d e ε ρk d before the t d k d relation is discussed we need to consider the conservative t d k d 0 case as the porosity ε and the effective diffusion coefficient d e will be treated as known from a steady state diffusion simulation using the vgn sample it was found that d e 1 7 10 13 m2 s and ε 0 61 hence it is only ρk d that are not known in the analytical solution ρ was set to 2700 kg m3 for the sorbing cases two more aspects need to be considered firstly we do not want the results to be dominated by surface sorption on the upstream face of the sample for this reason the first 50 10 6 m of the sample was specified as non sorbing for all cases secondly the concentration in the upstream reservoir should be constant for strongly sorbing cases and hence long integration times it was required to continuously add particles to the reservoir by doing so an approximately constant concentration could be preserved a range of t d values 0 10 100 and 1000 were then specified and the corresponding btc s were generated the case t d 0 can be regarded as a limiting case for small sorption rates from the analytical solution the k d values that fitted the numerical solution were found the comparison is shown in fig b 2 the k d values were found to be linearly related to t d b2 k d 2 6 10 6 t d the simple relation found is encouraging but it should be recalled that this k d is relevant for the sample considered in our basic model it is a k d relevant for a specific nuclide on a specific mineral surface that is of more interest fig b 1 outline of the case considered the domain has a length of d and the upstream reservoir has a constant concentration c0 the dotted line indicates a distance of 50 μm where sorption is suppressed fig b 1 fig b 2 integrated mass flux versus time solid lines give the analytical solution and dots the numerical solution the td values specified from left to right are 0 10 100 and 1000

1558,the subsurface remediation of nonaqueous liquid napl has proven to be challenging even when implementing more aggressive enhanced flushing techniques the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a combination of alkaline and surfactant based enhanced flushing for the removal of crude oil medium fraction from saturated porous media synchrotron x ray microtomography sxm was used to perform pore scale examination of napl fragmentation and changes in blob morphology and recovery using three different advective flushing methods surface active agent surfactant flushing alkaline flushing and sequential alkaline surfactant flushing this set of experiments was conducted to understand effects on such processes fragmentation and recovery as a function of media composition geochemical mineralogical and ph alterations due to calcium carbonate fraction results showed that the sequential flushing technique alkaline surfactant yielded the highest recovery 32 after 5 pore volumes pv of flushing the crude oil napl distribution varied due to differences in porous medium mixture composition and type of fluid i e surfactant vs alkaline used for flushing the results of this study can be used to aid in the understanding of physical and chemical parameters properties that control mobilization of crude oil in saturated porous media this can help reduce time and cost during remediation of contaminated sites that contain crude oil or less dense napl derivatives consistent with fuel type petroleum hydrocarbons keywords alkaline flushing crude oil napl pore scale remediation surfactant flushing 1 introduction hydrocarbons and fuel derivatives are common contaminants present at hazardous waste and superfund sites across the u s usepa 2000 2003 2007 nonaqueous phase liquids napl are generally classified by their fluid densities relative to that of water whereby light napl lnapl is less dense than water and dense napl dnapl is denser than water most fuel derivatives and petroleum hydrocarbons exist as lnapl and solvents and solvent stabilizers predominantly exist as dnapl oil spills and or unintentional releases i e leakage from underground storage tanks either small or large scale can migrate downward through soil reaching groundwater whereby pure phase napl oil can be retained in pore spaces of consolidated or unconsolidated rocks aquifers and act as a long term source of groundwater contamination connor 1988 pennell et al 1994 1996 it has been well documented that the presence of napl in the subsurface is generally considered to be the primary factor limiting remediation of sites contaminated by organic compounds nrc 1994 1997 1999 2005 although significant progress has been made for the removal or remediation of napl i e solvents crude oils diesels etc from the subsurface over the past few decades significant challenges and limitations still remain for complete source removal ghosh and tick 2013 mateas et al 2017 akyol and turkkan 2018 akyol 2018 in fact it has been shown that significant limitations with currently available remedial technologies persist making it unlikely to reach cleanup goals for complex contaminated groundwater sites in a time period of 50 100 years nrc 2013 typical pump and treat technologies have been used for the remediation of groundwater although they are generally not effective for the removal of napl sources to reach maximum contaminant levels in groundwater mccray et al 2011 akyol and turkkan 2018 a significant percentage of residual napl may remain in groundwater after a conventional pump and treat technique and significant mass can still remain in the subsurface even after more aggressive source zone removal methods have been implemented the residual napl may be trapped in smaller capillaries or adsorbed to the grains of the surrounding rocks or soil enhanced flushing techniques i e surfactant flushing etc can aid in the removal of residual napl source zones mulligan et al 2001 ghosh and tick 2013 akyol et al 2013 akyol 2018 booth 2018 ghosh et al 2019 previous studies have shown that a combination of alkaline and surfactant flushing used by the petroleum industry enhanced oil recovery eor can be a viable method for more efficient oil extraction al rossies et al 2010 du et al 2013 mulligan et al 2001 zhao et al 2013 an understanding of how these enhanced flushing techniques can change the napl distribution and blob morphology along with particular relevant chemical reactions that may occur in the subsurface with various physical heterogeneity or with the napl itself can help when designing and implementing removal strategies for residual napl or oil trapped in groundwater systems over the last decade several novel pore scale imaging techniques have been used to characterize multiphase fluid distribution within porous media in order to gain an improved understanding of pore trapping and pore mobilization processes specifically computer assisted x ray tomography cat and synchrotron x ray microtomography sxm have been used to characterize 3 d core pore network fluid distribution pore connectivity porosity and specific surface

phases in situ at the pore scale under high resolution 10 μm some details on advantages and limitations of such sxm techniques can be found in a number of studies that have been published over the last decade al raoush et al 2003 2005 wildenschild et al 2005 costanza robinson et al 2008 werth et al 2010 costanza robinson et al 2011 blunt et al 2013 several well documented studies using sxm have been conducted for similar porous media column systems over a wide range of conditions whereby replication consistency was validated for this technique costanza robinson et al 2008 narter and brusseau 2010 werth et al 2010 costanza robinson et al 2011 narter 2012 ghosh and tick 2013 ghosh et al 2019 some preliminary replication tests were conducted and confirmed that the results were consistent between experiments and sxm imaging technique although not feasible for every experiment due to time constraints associated with imaging these preliminary tests indicated that this technique provided reproducible results validating that the experimental technique used in this study was robust the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a combination of alkaline and surfactant based enhanced flushing techniques for the removal of hydrocarbon napl crude oil from groundwater this research aims to improve our understanding of the pore scale processes that influence napl crude oil during enhanced flushing conditions using a novel synchrotron x ray microtomography sxm imaging technique specifically the objectives include 1 assessing the impact of crude oil napl mobilization by quantifying the changes in oil distribution and morphology during independent surfactant and alkaline flushing and combination sequential alkaline surfactant flushing 2 quantifying oil recovery as a function of changes in oil blob distribution and morphology for various enhanced flushing scenarios and 3 determining the impact of different porous media mixtures on recovery of crude oil during surfactant flushing conditions overall this study aims to compare and contrast removal of napl via two enhanced flushing techniques surfactant agent vs alkaline agent and evaluate a new sequential combination flushing scenario of the two agents i e alkaline surfactant 2 materials and methods a lighter than water lnapl crude oil was chosen as the model non aqueous phase liquid napl and is characterized as a medium gravity 29 6 api oil also known as poseidon crude bp houston tx the density of medium fraction crude oil was 0 87 g cm3 the dynamic viscosity of medium fraction crude oil was 0 0084 dyn s cm2 according to usgs standard conventional crude oil which has api gravity of 22 or more and a viscosity 100 cp cp is considered as light crude oil ghosh 2011 previous experiments showed that oil phase doping with iodobenzene ib showed slight changes in interfacial tension ghosh 2011 these dopants showed the least partitioning to the non target fluids schnaar and brusseau 2006b doping with ib which has a density 1 82 g cm3 higher than water has a slight effect on api gravity of crude oil after recalculation the crude oil samples were characterized as light 23 4 api usgs standard however the viscosity and density change due to this doping effect were not measured two different flushing solutions were used to enhance the mobilization of the oil phase including 1 a sodium hydroxide naoh alkaline solution acs grade bdh chemicals diluted in nanopure water 18 mω cm and adjusted to a ph of 12 and 2 a 0 1 vol anionic surfactant branched alcohol propoxy sulfate solution commercially known as petrostep s 1 stepan chemical company northfield il the naoh alkaline solution was primarily chosen for its ability to reduce interfacial tension between the oil and aqueous phases and the fact that it has been widely used by the petroleum industry for tertiary crude oil recovery schramm 2000 another benefit of alkaline flushing is the ability to change the wettability of the porous medium oil system from oil wet to water wet thereby reducing both contact area and surface tension of oil with the solid al rossies et al 2010 the surfactant was chosen for its ability to develop low interfacial tension at low concentrations the experiments herein relied on the principal mechanism of surfactant induced mobilization rather than solubilization for the removal and remediation of crude oil napl under low surfactant concentration conditions e g ghosh and tick 2013 booth 2018 ghosh et al 2019 this surfactant was developed specifically for enhanced oil recovery eor and surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear applications this surfactant was also shown to experience minimal adsorption to the solid phase goddard et al 2004 and high salinity tolerance wu et al 2005 it should be noted that the time interval between surfactant flushing and image capture was 4 h limiting the extent of surfactant adsorption on silica sand and mixtures of silica sand calcareous grains as observed by preliminary tests ghosh 2011 preliminary tests were carried out to ensure that the concentration of the surfactant solution was below the critical micelle concentration cmc 0 9 while simultaneously optimizing the reduction of interfacial tension between the oil and surfactant solution ensuring that mobilization was the dominant mechanism of oil removal ghosh 2011 ghosh and tick 2013 booth 2018 ghosh et al 2019 previous research shows that the branched alkyl surfactant has the greater ability to reduce interfacial tension in comparison to straight chain alkyl group at very low concentrations even lower than rosen et al 2005 moreover this surfactant was specifically formulated for oil extraction purposes eor and for oil remediation and it has been effectively used to mobilize crude oil remediation from shallow aquifers jayanti et al 2002 it also showed high salinity tolerance and is therefore assumed to be applicable for reservoirs with high salinity in addition this surfactant showed minimal adsorption to the solid phase and negligible effects from biodegradation goddard et al 2004 ghosh and tick 2013 booth 2018 ghosh et al 2019 silica sand media 40 50 mesh accusand and natural calcareous karst soil were used in these experiments the karst sand is characterized as a poorly sorted sandy loam the soil has an alkaline character with a ph of 8 4 due to the presence of abundant amounts of carbonate 96 and consists of intermediate amounts of organic carbon 1 akyol et al 2011 akyol and yolcubal 2013 the organic carbon content of silica sand materials is very low o c 0 05 properties of the homogeneous silica sand media are further described in ghosh and tick 2013 the physical heterogeneity and associated properties of calcareous karst soil have also been described in greater detail by previous studies akyol and turkkan 2018 akyol 2018 ghosh et al 2019 due to the fact that the calcareous soil natural soil has been well characterized in terms of physical and chemical properties it was selected for addition within silica sand distributions to create different representative porous media mixtures it should be noted that these porous media are not meant to represent the complexities of real world natural media but rather are used to test mixtures with different grain size pore size distributions and chemical properties three different homogeneous sand media were created for the series of flushing experiments including 1 uniform sand which is comprised of only quartz silica accusand 40 50 mesh and characterized with the lowest grain pore size variation and the highest hydraulic conductivity of the media 2 mixture 1 which is comprised of 25 karst carbonate soil and 75 accusand by weight and characterized by a greater grain pore size variation and lower hydraulic conductivity and 3 mixture 2 which is comprised of 50 karst carbnate soil and 50 accusand by weight and characterized by a greater grain pore size distribution and the lowest hydraulic conductivity see table 2 the sands were further characterized by their respective uniformity coefficients cu d60 d10 which describes media grain size uniformity i e 1 being uniform and 4 or greater being non uniform the uniform sand 40 50 mesh accusand has a cu 1 the karst sand mixtures mixture 1 and mixture 2 were prepared in the laboratory and were determined to have uniformity coefficients cu of approximately 5 and 10 respectively these sand mixtures provide valuable comparison to other studies that used the same and or similar media configurations and can also potentially be compared to other more real world systems with more complex physical chemical distributions akyol 2018 akyol and turkkan 2018 ghosh et al 2019 the aqueous cscl flushing solution 60 g l 1 used to create the initial oil residual saturations was determined to have a dynamic viscosity of 0 84 cp 0 0084 dyn s cm 2 table 2 ghosh and tick 2013 the cscl doped surfactant flushing solution was measured to have a dynamic viscosity of 2 21 cp 0 022 dyn s cm 2 ghosh and tick 2013 table 1 interfacial surface tensions tensions σow were measured using a dsa 1 drop shape analyzer kruss gmbh germany and determined to be 20 9 dyn cm 1 for the oil cscl system i e aqueous residual pre surfactant flush and 11 8 dyn cm 1 for the oil surfactant system i e sear flush this reflects an approximately 44 decrease in interfacial surface tension due to the presence of the surfactant solution the alkaline naoh solution ph 12 yielded an even greater reduction in interfacial tension between for the alkaline oil system of 7 3 dyn cm 1 corresponding to a 65 decrease in interfacial tension due to the presence of alkaline solution table 2 a series of five small scale enhanced flushing column experiments were performed using thin walled aluminum porous medium packed columns tables 1 2 and 3 the columns ranged in length 4 5 5 0 cm with an inner diameter i d of 0 5 cm both ends of the columns were outfitted with swagelok end fittings to minimize void space in the end caps a polypropylene frit was inserted between the porous medium and end caps to reduce preferential flow and to keep the porous medium contained within the system during saturation and flushing the sample representative elementary volumes rev for all of these packed systems were achieved to include the scale of all heterogeneities i e porosity and permeability within the column volumes see wildenschild et al 2002 costanza robinson et al 2008 willson et al 2012 ghosh and tick 2013 ghosh et al 2019 rev is the smallest volume over which a measurement can be made that will yield a value representative of the whole achieving a rev has become a de facto criterion for demonstrating the quality of sxm measurements in porous media systems with smaller systems for more discussion refer to costanza robinson et al 2011 it should be noted that preferential flow accumulation of oil napl may occur along column walls however spatial analyses for the representative column sections displayed fig 1 were the same for each system as a means to be as consistent as possible when comparing each of the various experiments the first three columns exp 1 exp 2 and exp 3 were dry packed with the uniform sand 40 50 mesh accusand the fourth column exp 4 was dry packed with mixture 1 25 75 karst accusand the fifth column exp 5 was dry packed with mixture 2 50 50 karst accusand the sand packed columns were then saturated vertically upward to maintain stable displacement with nanopure water using a single piston pump acuflow series ii for a period of 48 h at a pumping rate linear pore velocity v p of 6 8 cm h the columns were weighed over the saturation period until the weight stabilized to ensure that fully saturated conditions were maintained prior to oil napl emplacement once the columns were fully saturated they were independently imbibed vertically injected downward with 4 pore volumes pv of crude oil using a syringe pump kd scientific model 780100 holliston ma to maintain stable displacement of the water from the column by the less dense than water crude oil fraction see methods of pennell et al 1993 bai et al 1997 boving and brusseau 2000 tick and rincon 2009 ghosh and tick 2013 prior to this injection step the oil was first doped with 10 by volume iodobenzene to improve imaging contrast for the oil napl via optimizing maximizing x ray absorption energy above and below the iodine edge for the purposes of synchrotron x ray microtomography sxm the columns were then flushed vertically upwards with nanopure water doped with 60 g l cesium chloride cesium chloride cscl is added to improve imaging contrast for the aqueous phase by maximizing x ray absorption below the cesium k edge see methods ghosh and tick 2013 the flushing of cscl solution was performed in two sequential steps at varying velocities 2 pv at v p of 6 10 cm h and 10 pv at 20 30 cm h to establish residual oil saturation conditions prior to the enhanced flushing experiments the addition of cscl has negligible effect on interfacial tension ift in the aqueous phase and flushing solutions schnaar and brusseau 2006a ghosh 2011 booth 2018 ghosh et al 2019 however the crude oil doped with iodobenzene ib exhibited minor changes in interfacial tension for the bulk oil ghosh and tick 2013 these dopants also showed negligible partitioning to non target fluids in other studies schnaar and brusseau 2006a the methods used to attain residual saturation are similar to those from previous studies ghosh and tick 2013 schnaar and brusseau 2006a 2006b after residual saturation was attained each column was sealed and imaged using synchrotron x ray microtomography sxm sxm was used to specifically quantify oil distribution and blob morphology for a series of surfactant alkaline and sequential alkaline surfactant column flushing experiments all imaging was performed at geosoilenvirocars gsecars bm 13d beamline sector at advanced photon source argonne national laboratory il after each complete initial scan residual saturation condition columns were then subsequently flushed vertically downward to maintain stable displacement processes at a linear pore velocity v p of 20 cm h using cscl doped flushing solution in two steps first a 2 pv flushing period and then a 3 pv flushing period whereby after each respective flush the column was scanned using sxm column 1 exp 1 was flushed with the alkaline solution naoh ph 12 and columns 2 exp 2 4 exp 4 and 5 exp 5 were flushed with the surfactant solution column 3 exp 3 was flushed sequentially with the alkaline solution naoh ph 12 for 2 pv followed immediately by the surfactant flushing for 2 pv 2 2 total of 4 pv and imaged then flushed again sequentially with alkaline solution for 3 pv followed immediately by the surfactant flushing for 3 pv 3 3 total of 6 pv overall this corresponds to 5 pv of alkaline flushing and 5 pv of surfactant flushing 10 pv total over all sequential flushing steps it should be noted that all aqueous flushing solutions were doped with cscl 60 g l prior to being flushed through each column experiment for improved image contrast reasons described previously table 1 lists the conditions associated with each column experiment i e the media used and type of flushing experiment performed etc each sxm scan generated volume files that could be used to resolve 2d and 3d images for the aqueous and napl phases whereby the above iodine k edge energy was used to resolve the oil phase and the below cesium k edge was used to resolve the aqueous phase i e cscl surfactant alkaline solution the image data obtained from sxm were pre processed and reconstructed at aps to produce three dimensional 3 d image arrays with spatial resolution 10 μm 9 4 μm all sxm generated volume image files were pre processed at argonne national laboratory and converted into stacks to be turned into a 3d image arrays the images were then processed using tomographic software tomo display rivers 2006 and image j software and iodine k edge generated volume files were subtracted from the cesium k edge generated volume files to produce image files of only the crude oil napl distribution with the column system blob3d software ketcham 2005 was then used to convert the stack of 2d images to 3d images blob3d was also used to extract quantitative parameters such as oil volume and surface area of the oil and aqueous phases the data were used to quantify blob volume distribution blob radius and diameter blob morphology blob deviation from spheres equivalent surface area to volume and volume recovered conditions and parameters associated with each of the flushing experiments are reported in table 2 further details about sxm imaging collection for geologic media and fluid phases as well as 2d and 3d image processing methods can be found in literature sutton et al 2002 wildenschild et al 2002 schnaar and brusseau 2005 2006a brusseau et al 2007 ghosh and tick 2013 booth 2018 ghosh et al 2019 trapping and mobilization mechanisms of crude oil are controlled by capillary processes due to porous media geometry wettability of the media crude oil viscosity oil solution densities and capillary pressures booth 2018 the data collected from both the sxm and kruss drop shape analyzer instruments were used to determine the potential of oil mobilization and or trapping for the various experiments quantitative results such as oil napl blob size distribution normalized oil surface to volume ratios oil volume recovered for column flushing experiments as well as capillary number n c bond number n b trapping number n t and change in capillary pressure p for the drop shape and interfacial tension experiments were integrated to assess oil mobilization trapping behavior or potential n c n b and n t are dimensionless numbers used to describe the potential for oil mobilization capillary pressure is the difference of pressure across the interface of two immiscible liquids i e oil and aqueous solution the capillary number describes the ratio of viscous forces to interfacial tension forces higher values indicate a greater potential for oil to be mobilized mercer and cohen 1990 have observed that in order initiate oil mobilization capillary numbers should be on the order of 10 5 or greater for complete removal of oil capillary numbers should be on the order of 10 3 or greater depending on specifics of the s l l system and further details describing these trapping mobilization parameters can be found in morrow and songkran 1981 mercer and cohen 1990 boving and brusseau 2000 pennell et al 1994 1996 ghosh 2011 ghosh and tick 2013 mateas et al 2017 booth 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 crude oil napl distribution 3d imaged sections show a random distribution of crude oil under residual saturation conditions in both the uniform sand media accusand and karst carbonate sand mixture mixture 1 and mixture 2 packed columns i e increasing karst carbonate content although the entire columns were scanned for evaluation quantification of mass balance recovery and overall oil blob morphology characterization only representative column sections of the oil distribution are displayed in fig 1 the representative column sections shown are taken within the column center at the same exact spatial location for all column systems and flushing episodes in order to be as consistent as possible when comparing each system oil napl distribution patterns show a variety of blob morphology and configuration disconnected individual blobs known as singlets and doublets can be seen throughout the residual saturation conditions initial sxm scans regions where higher concentrations of oil blobs are present tend to be aggregated in ganglia that are connected within the interconnected pore space the images in fig 1a e show a representative imaged section of each of the five columns at residual oil saturation named image 1 herein after a 2 pv flush image 2 and after a subsequent 3 pv flush total of 5 pv image 3 fig 1a shows converted 3d images for exp 1 column 1 alkaline flush in the uniform sand medium the first column image scan image 1 shows a random distribution of oil blobs for residual saturation the oil distribution image shows that more singlet and doublet blobs exist toward the center of the column and more interconnected ganglia exist toward the edges walls of the column whereby preferential flow i e wall effect can be observed to have occurred image 2 shows and quantified that the oil blobs become smaller in terms of volume and radii and there were a greater number of blobs present compared to the initial saturation condition this redistribution may be due to the larger oil blobs being fragmented dispersed likely from the reduction of interfacial tension between the oil and aqueous phases in combination with potential fluid shearing effects table 4 a greater number of oil blobs can be observed and quantified after this final flushing step i e image after 5 pv total compared to that for image 2 there are some preferential flow paths toward the edge of the column walls that can be observed whereby oil ganglia are distributed and this may be the result of wall effects that are common in column systems overall such wall effects are minimal when analyzing the entire scanned column systems however we point out that this phenomenon was observed under some circumstances progressively smaller blob sizes volume radii are observed quantified after the final 3 pv 5 pv total flushing step i e observed in the final scanned image however some oil ganglia are also observed toward the center of the column in between the sand grains indicating a variable distribution of oil i e singlets doublets and ganglia within the column after a total of 5 pv of flushing fig 1b shows converted 3d images for exp 2 column 2 surfactant flush in the uniform sand medium the first column image scan image 1 of the initial residual oil saturation condition similar to exp 1 shows a random distribution of oil blobs with the formation of ganglia near the column walls due to preferential flow paths image 2 shows a greater number of observed and quantified oil blobs with smaller size and volume compared to that in image 1 the fragmentation of oil ganglia into smaller blobs is likely due to the decreased interfacial tension between the oil phase and flushing phase due to the invading surfactant solution itself table 5 it may be that fluid shearing effects are increased under the reduction of oil aqueous interfacial tension as well however this cannot be directly confirmed some oil ganglia are observed along the column walls i e preferential flow via wall effects as well as distributed within the center of the column in the pore space between the sand grains for image 3 an even greater distribution number of oil blobs i e singlets and doublets can be observed and quantified relative to ganglia distribution this image after the final flushing step shows relatively small oil blobs within the pore spaces between the sand grains with preferential flow of oil distributed i e as ganglia along the column walls fig 1c shows converted 3d images for exp 3 column 3 sequential alkaline surfactant flush in the uniform sand medium the first column image scan similar to exp 1 and exp 2 shows a random distribution of oil blobs with preferential flow of oil distributed i e as ganglia along the column walls for image 2 the distribution of oil blobs is present quantified predominantly as interconnected blobs in the form of ganglia throughout the column under such conditions it is expected that this oil ganglia type distribution may require greater viscous forces pressure differential across the oil body to mobilize and remove from the column thereby providing limited to no benefit over either independent alkaline or surfactant enhanced flushing scenarios for image 3 the number of oil ganglia are observed quantified to decrease in size volume with a greater concentration of oil ganglia present in the pore spaces between the sand grains such conditions may be induced via emulsification processes whereby the oil phase droplets coalesce with the bulk aqueous solution disperse mixture that can be associated with increases of ph sheng 2015 booth 2018 fig 1d shows converted 3d images for exp 4 column 4 surfactant flush in mixture 1 karst sand medium these set of experiments exp 4 and exp 5 were conducted to evaluate the impacts of greater grain pore size variation lower hydraulic conductivity and calcium carbon karst sand content on oil distribution and recovery during surfactant flushing overall the initial residual oil saturation condition image 1 exhibits a random distribution of oil blobs and relatively larger ganglia distributed within the porous medium with larger ganglia observed nearest the column walls i e indication of preferential flow as mentioned prior the presence of the oil ganglia type distribution may require greater viscous forces pressure differential across the oil body to mobilize and remove from the column thereby providing limited to no benefit prior to flushing with a particular enhanced flushing agent image 2 shows that some of the large ganglia are being dispersed fragmented into smaller singlet and doublet oil blobs likely attributed to a reduction in interfacial tension between phases additionally there is a notable decrease in the size volume of the larger oil ganglia throughout the column via visual observation and blob 3d quantified results image 3 shows further fragmentation of the larger ganglia into smaller oil blobs observed and quantified within the center region of the column however the larger oil ganglia nearest the column walls show negligible observed and or quantified change in volume and morphology after the second final surfactant flushing event i e results from the third image compared to that for image 2 fig 1e shows converted 3d images for exp 5 column 5 surfactant flush in mixture 2 karst sand medium the initial residual oil saturation condition exhibits a random distribution of oil blobs and ganglia distributed within the column however the oil blobs and ganglia are generally larger in size volume than those in the previous experiments via visual image observation and blob3d quantification image 1 exhibits the relatively largest oil blob volume fraction compared to the results oil distribution after subsequent surfactant flushing events however the oil blobs are not as evenly uniformly distributed throughout the column due to the relative greater degree of system heterogeneity interestingly a notably higher residual oil volume was observed quantified via blob3d in this system compared to the other column experiments this condition may be due to the greater fraction of karst carbonate soil i e greater pore size variation and or due to potential interfacial dynamics transition of wettability and related chemical interaction between the oil and media from the calcium carbonate karst sand content image 2 shows minimal change in oil distribution from the initial residual condition except for a slight decrease in the volume of the larger oil blobs in the system it can be observed that some extremely small size oil blobs are present visual observation and quantified i e volumes on the order of 10 9 mm3 but fragmentation of the oil blobs is not as noticeable compared to that in the other columns after flushing image 3 exhibits an overall further decrease in size volume of the larger oil blobs observed and quantified however with a relatively lower distribution of very small oil blobs present in the system similar to image 2 this indicates that the smallest oil blobs may have been effectively removed from the system during the final flushing step of particular interest is the fact that the oil distribution for exp 5 is noticeably different than exp 4 which only differs in the carbonate sand content fraction the higher carbonate sand fraction of exp 5 may have induced wettability conditions in favor of forming generally larger ganglia distributions within the porous matrix in fact a series of wettability experiments demonstrate that a transition from oil wet to water wet conditions occur as ph increases booth 2018 under such conditions the oil phase would tend to be repelled by the media grain boundaries potentially aiding in the accumulation coalescence of oil into larger ganglia in the system this may also explain that regardless of particular flushing all oil distributions including the formation of the residual oil distribution show similar larger blob configuration and geometry within the system with minor differences after each flushing step as noted above in this section evaluation of the series of uniform sand column experiments exp 1 alkaline exp 2 surfactant and exp 3 sequential alkaline surfactant show that the fragmentation of oil blobs into smaller blobs occurs progressively after each flushing step particularly for exp 1 and exp 2 hence these two column experiments show a similar general trend whereby a greater number of oil blobs with progressively smaller blob volumes result through each flushing step more specifically there was a greater increase in the number of oil blobs in produced via fragmentation after both the 2 pv and 5 pv flushing events quantified via blob3d for exp 2 in comparison to that for exp 1 this could be due the surfactant s exp 1 ability to yield a greater reduction of ift between the oil and aqueous phases compared to the alkaline solution exp 2 the results for exp 3 show that the oil blobs within the column include a greater number of interconnected ganglia compared to the oil blob distribution within the columns for exp 1 and exp 2 as previously stated this could negatively affect the recovery of oil volume due to greater viscous forces needed to overcome capillary forces which mobilize the entire ganglia body the formation of the interconnected ganglia may also be attributed to the emulsion of the oil into the aqueous phase whereby the oil water exists as a quasi single phase within particular regions of the pore system thomas and ali 1989 the progressive reduction in size volume of the oil ganglia over flushing steps i e images 2 and 3 via image analysis and blob3d quantification indicates that ganglia fragmentation occurs as flushing continues evaluation of the series of surfactant flushing experiments within the uniform sand and sand mixtures mixture 1 and mixture 2 exp 2 exp 4 and exp 5 show that there are notable differences in oil distribution configurations for the initial residual oil condition in general visual observations and quantitative analyses blob3d results show that smaller and more spherical oil blobs are present in exp 2 uniform sand larger interconnected ganglia are present in exp 4 mixture 1 and skewed distribution of oil blobs with relatively large volumes are present in exp 5 mixture 2 differences in observed and quantified oil distributions between exp 2 and exp 4 may be due to increased solution ph carbonate dissolution exp 4 and associated impacts from reductions in ift and or transition in system wettability i e oil water to water wet booth 2018 such conditions may cause the oil to distribute more widely as ganglia within the intergranular pore spaces for exp 5 the larger volume oil blobs ganglia may be attributed to the greater grain pore size distribution and lower permeability and lower hydraulic conductivity where smaller pore spaces restrict oil movement causing pooling or redistribution of the oil in larger pore spaces the effects of the surfactant flushing on oil distribution were relatively similar for each of these column systems wherein the oil blob or ganglia volume continues to decrease via fragmentation as flushing progresses this particular fragmentation blob ganglia reduction with flushing trend is more noticeable in the uniform sand medium exp 2 and less distinct in the karst sand mixtures i e exp 4 and exp 5 respectively in general the results of sxm image analyses and blob3d oil quantification show that enhanced flushing alkaline and surfactant can induce changes in oil blob distribution associated with decreases in oil blob volume and increases in the number of oil blobs and in some cases evolution to an interconnected ganglia oil network or quasi single phase emulsion state as flushing progresses walstra 1993 the sxm generated column images show that at the pore scale level these oil distribution changes can be quite dramatic the reduction of ift due to the effects of the surfactant or alkaline flushing solution allows for expansion of the interfacial surface between the oil and aqueous phases table 2 one mechanism by which this increase in surface occurs is by breaking fragmenting the blobs into smaller blobs and dispersing them into the aqueous phase as smaller fragments levorsen 2001 it should be noted that a general trend in the change from more spherical oil blobs to more flattened blobs was observed and quantified after each progressive enhanced flushing event time series this effect contributes to an overall increase in the total oil surface area that is in contact with the aqueous flushing solution although the overall oil blob volumes decrease in this manner the change in morphology to less spherical i e flattened allows greater surface area of the oil to be in contact with the solid and or aqueous boundary this change in morphology can be attributed to the reduction of ift at the oil water interface and is expected to affect oil recovery as discussed in later sections 3 2 crude oil removal recovery changes in oil or napl distribution particularly changes in oil body blob or ganglia volume and surface area due to enhanced flushing processes can influence the overall rate or percent of oil recovery oil body blob and ganglia volumes and surface areas were quantified using the blob3d software ketcham 2005 before and after sequential enhanced flushing events extraction of these parameters and others from 3d images constructed from sxm were used to relate oil recovery processes to changes in oil morphology and distribution over a range of flushing intervals the total oil blob ganglia volumes for each column experiment exp 1 through exp 5 after initial residual saturation conditions and after each sequential flushing event 2 pv and 3 pv 5 pv total are presented in table 3 for exp 1 alkaline flush uniform sand medium and exp 2 surfactant flush uniform sand medium the calculated oil napl recoveries were comparable after each respective flushing event exp 1 shows an initial oil recovery of 3 14 after 2 pv of flushing after another subsequent 3 pv flush a total of 5 pv of flushing the total recovery of oil increased to 6 71 with respect to the initial total oil volume present in the column prior to enhanced flushing the step wise oil recovery for the 3 pv flushing period 3 68 was consistent with that after the initial 2 pv flushing step 3 14 indicating that removal processes via alkaline flushing were relatively consistent with a slight decrease in efficiency oil removed per pv as flushing progressed additionally from the interfacial tension ift values measured reported for different flooding scenario solutions booth 2018 it can be seen that the presence of naoh has a pronounced impact on reducing ift from 20 9 to 7 0 9 4 dyn cm 1 between the oil and aqueous flushing phases this provides further evidence that alkaline flushing was responsible for these oil mass removals likely in response to a decrease in oil aqueous ift during the naoh injections and flushing events table 4 exp 2 shows an initial oil recovery of 4 95 after 2 pv of surfactant flushing and 7 74 after a total of 5 pv of flushing the step wise oil recovery for the second 3 pv flushing period of 2 93 showed a notable decrease 2 times compared to that quantified after the initial 2 pv flushing step 4 95 indicating that removal processes via surfactant flushing were less efficient as flushing progressed table 5 these results also indicate that the alkaline flushing may be slightly more efficient over longer periods of flushing compared to surfactant flushing exp 3 focused on evaluating oil recovery in uniform sand medium via a combined sequential alkaline surfactant flushing technique whereby alkaline solution was introduced first and then directly followed by surfactant flushing for equal time periods for each flushing step step 1 2 pv step 2 2 pv 4 pv total for the first flush step 3 3pv step 4 3pv 10 total pv for all flushes this alkaline surfactant flush yielded the greatest overall oil recovery when compared to the independent alkaline and surfactant flushing experiments exp 1 and exp 2 this demonstrates that sequential alkaline surfactant flush had a significant effect on oil removal mobilization processes compared to the individual surfactant or naoh flushes some research has indicated that higher solution ph can alter solid liquid wettability from a more oil wet to more water wet condition booth 2018 ghosh et al 2019 the higher ph condition associated with the naoh solution was most likely responsible for changes the wettability and interfacial tension to initiate greater mobilization of the oil phase and easier extraction from the system during sequential flushing experiment exp 2 shows an initial oil recovery of 21 11 after 2 pv of surfactant flushing and 34 02 after a total of 5 pv of flushing the step wise oil recovery for the 3 pv flushing period 16 37 was relatively consistent to that after the initial 2 pv flushing step 21 11 showing only a slight decrease 1 3 times in removal efficiency compared to that quantified after the initial 2 pv flushing step however this condition may indicate that this removal processes associated with dual sequential alkaline surfactant flushing techniques may be slightly less efficient as flushing progresses more importantly the sequential alkaline surfactant flush demonstrated a significant increase in oil recovery 4 4 5 1 times greater compared to the other two independent enhanced flushing experiments which may hold promise for remediation at larger scales flow cells to pilot scale field tests it should be noted that more laboratory and pilot field tests are needed to understand both the recovery and environmental impacts before implementing such aggressive techniques for field scale remediation another series of independent surfactant flushing experiments exp 4 and exp 5 were conducted to evaluate the effects of greater grain pore size variation decreases in hydraulic conductivity and karst carbonate content on oil napl removal and recovery as a function of oil morphology and distribution during flushing addition of the karst sand not only introduces finer grain components thereby increasing pore size variation but also can affect carbonate dissolution processes that can alter system ph solution and grain boundaries potentially influencing oil napl distribution and recovery processes previous literature and experiments confirm that the relatively higher ph associated solution and grain surface in these sand karst mixed systems tend to alter solid liquid s l wettability from more oil wet to more water wet condition booth 2018 under this dynamic trend oil napl will generally become more mobile under such water wet conditions and thereby may be extracted more easily from the subsurface during flushing exp 4 mixture 1 25 75 karst sand medium shows an oil recovery of 9 16 and 14 16 after 2 pv and 5 pv of flushing respectively the step wise oil recovery for the 3 pv flushing period 5 61 showed a decrease 1 6 times compared to that quantified after the first 2 pv flushing step 9 16 indicating that removal processes may be slightly less efficient as flushing progresses compared to the uniform sand conditions of exp 2 40 50 accusand this surfactant flushing experiment showed significant improvement in oil recovery for both initial flushing and later flushing stages even though this system has greater pore size variation and lower hydraulic conductivity permeability most notable was the nearly 2 fold increase in oil removal effectiveness for the complete 5 pv of flushing exp 4 14 2 vs exp 2 7 7 the higher overall oil recovery may have been related to increased solution ph carbonate dissolution and grain boundary charge net negative charge to initiate more water wet conditions and associated higher oil removal rates the effect of the increased ph and potential to alter the system to more water wet may help offset expected reductions in oil recovery due to the associated greater pore size distribution i e lower permeability exp 5 mixture 2 50 50 karst sand medium shows an oil recovery of 4 10 and 21 33 after 2 pv and 5 pv of flushing respectively the step wise oil recovery for the 3 pv flushing period 17 97 showed a notable largest increase 4 4 times compared to that quantified after the first 2 pv flushing step 4 10 indicating that removal processes may be much more efficient oil removed per pv as flushing progresses when calcium carbonate sediments are present compared to the uniform sand conditions of exp 2 40 50 accusand this surfactant flushing experiment showed significant improvement in oil recovery predominantly during the later stages of flushing even though this system has greater pore size variation and lower hydraulic conductivity permeability most notable was the nearly 3 2 fold increase in oil removal effectiveness after the complete 5 pv of flushing exp 5 21 3 vs exp 2 7 7 similar to exp 4 the higher overall oil recovery may have been related to increased solution ph carbonate dissolution grain boundary charge net negative charge and reactions with the oil to initiate more water wet conditions and associated higher oil removal rates since oil recovery rates are relatively consistent for both systems during the early stages of surfactant flushing it may be that the dissolution and reaction processes altering the wettability of the system to more water wet exhibited greater kinetic limitations such an effect may be related to the greater pore size distribution lower permeability condition of the porous medium whereby permeability had greater control on early time oil removal less recovery initially and then subsequent increases in ph with more time carbonate dissolution imposed greater control on removal processes countering the reduced permeability effects and yielding greater oil recovery further studies are needed to explore particular dissolution effects on wettability the significant contrasts in oil blob morphology and impacts on oil phase recovery most notably for these mixed karst sand systems in general overall oil recovery was higher for the karst sand mixtures exp 4 and exp 5 under surfactant flushing conditions compared to the more uniform medium uniform sand column flushing experiments alkaline and surfactant with the exception of the sequential alkaline surfactant flushing experiment as mentioned previously these greater quantified oil recoveries are likely attributed to an increase of ph due to the presence of the karst sand and associated dissolution of calcium carbonate the greatest overall oil recovery was observed for the sequential alkaline surfactant flushing experiment the initial reduction of interfacial tension i e via a decrease contact angle by the alkaline flushing solution was followed by further reduction of ift during the surfactant flush leading to the increase in oil volume recovery the removal process was relatively consistent for each of the flushing steps after 2 pv and after 3 pv 5 pv total indicating that relatively higher associated removal conditions may be maintained as flushing progresses some research has indicated that higher solution ph can alter solid liquid wettability from a more oil wet to a more water wet condition booth 2018 ghosh et al 2019 the higher ph condition associated with the naoh solution was most likely responsible for changes the wettability and interfacial tension to initiate greater mobilization of the oil phase and easier extraction from the system during sequential flushing experiment ghosh et al 2019 in addition although surfactant and alkaline flushing can affect the multiphase systems beyond the reduction of interfacial tension i e unstable stable emulsion phases polarity of the solution etc this study assumes that oil recovery is due primarily to the reduction of ift between the oil and water phases ghosh and tick 2013 because of this ift reduction less capillary pressure is required to displace mobilize the crude oil through the pore network the experimental results clearly show that ift was reduced when alkaline reagent was applied to the column systems as a result geometry of oil blobs vary as flushing progresses a general trend in the change from more spherical oil blobs to more flattened blobs was observed and quantified after each progressive enhanced flushing event over the flushing time series this flattening effect causes greater oil surface area to be in contact with the flushing fluid thereby reducing the ift of the oil body over a greater surface such effects were also observed in other studies for the removal of light and heavy crude oils from homogeneous silica sand ghosh and tick 2013 ghosh et al 2019 3 3 changes in oil morphology on recovery a comparison of the change in oil body blob and ganglia morphology may provide further insight into the recovery processes of crude oil or napl as noted previously oil blob and ganglia morphology was observed to flatten deviate more from spherical after progressive enhanced flushing as shown in 2d and 3d image analyses this flattening effect causes greater oil surface area to be in contact with the flushing fluid thereby reducing the ift of the oil body over a greater surface figs 2a e and 3a e show comparisons of the specific surface area a i e the ratio of the oil blob surface area to its volume for each of the enhanced flushing column experiments fig 2a e specifically compares the conditions at residual oil saturation prior to flushing and after 2 pv of enhanced flushing while fig 3a e compares the conditions at residual oil saturation and after 5 pv of flushing a particular blob volume possesses a minimum surface area as a spherical shape and any deviation from a sphere will result in a greater surface area it should be noted that the graphical representation of blob deviations from a sphere is more robust for distributions of disconnected blobs therefore these analyses and associated graphical plots cannot be successfully applied when the majority of the oil napl phase is connected as ganglia the surface area to volume ratio of a perfect sphere is represented by the black curved model lines figs 2a e and 3a e and denotes the minimum specific surface area as represented by a perfect oil blob sphere the oil blobs below the line smaller blob volumes i e 10 8 mm3 can be attributed to the limitations of the blob3d software and or the parameters assigned during the grayscale thresholding and partitioning of the 2d images before 3d conversion oil bodies blobs or ganglia deviating above the black model line exhibit relative higher surface areas compared to that of a perfect sphere geometry i e become more flattened or deviate more from spherical under such conditions it would be expected that the flushing fluid would be more effective as it contacts greater relative oil napl surface area by reducing ift at this boundary for exp 1 figs 2a and 3a and exp 2 figs 2b and 3b in the uniform sand the oil blobs and ganglia generally become more spherical in shape as flushing progresses i e after 2 pv and 5 pv of flushing especially for lower oil volumes ranges 10 7 mm3 this may be enhanced by the solution contacting larger blobs and ganglia allowing for fragmentation into smaller and more spherical oil blob morphologies as flushing progresses the larger oil blob ganglia volume sizes 10 6 mm3 tend to deviate more from a sphere than the smaller blob volumes i e after 2 pv and 5 pv flushing and although the larger oil blobs tend to remain less spherical overall the blobs tend to become slightly more spherical in shape after 5 pv of flushing for exp 3 figs 2c and 3c the oil blobs and ganglia show a more noticeable change in blob morphology from less spherical to more spherical as flushing progresses the oil blobs in the initial residual oil saturation condition exhibit the greatest deviations from spherical shape but become increasingly spherical with each respective flush event after 2 pv and 5 pv flushing events however similar to exp 1 and exp 2 the larger oil blob ganglia volume sizes tend to deviate more from a sphere for the later flushing event after 5 pv event in contrast to the independent alkaline and surfactant flushing experiments exp 1 and exp 2 overall blob morphology tends to deviate more as flushing progressed for the larger oil blob volume size ranges the karst sand mixture experiments exp 4 mixture 1 and exp 5 mixture 2 show a different blob distribution than what can be observed from the uniform sand accusand columns described above for exp 4 figs 2d and 3d blob variations do not deviate much from that of the initial residual oil distribution as flushing progresses at smaller volumes 10 8 mm3 oil blobs become slightly more spherical oil blob volumes between 10 8 and 10 6 mm3 show slight deviation from spherical shape and the larger ganglia volumes 10 6 mm3 show virtually no deviation from the residual oil blobs which all generally plot above the spherical model line this trend continues as flushing progresses 2 pv to 5 pv for exp 5 figs 2e and 3e the oil blobs show the greatest deviation from spherical shape flattening of the oil blobs compared to exp 4 and exp 2 this notable increase in oil blob flattening deviation from spherical generally occurs for volumes as large as 10 6 mm3 and continues to the smallest volumes of oil with even more deviation from spherical shape as flushing progress from 2 pv to 5pv fig 4e with respect to oil volume recovery exp 4 shows minimal change in the blob shape morphology from that of the initial residual saturation condition the oil volume recovered from this experiment is strictly from the fragmentation of the large ganglia due to reduction of ift between the oil and aqueous phases and the ift reduction is due to surfactant flushing encountering the relatively larger surface area of the oil blobs and ganglia for exp 5 as flushing progresses surface area is increased when in contact with the surfactant causes fragmentation of the larger oil blobs to smaller resulting blobs thus it is presumed that due to the relatively larger surface areas of the oil present in exp 4 and exp 5 the surfactant was in contact with more of the oil this greater surfactant oil contact is likely causing fragmentation of the oil into smaller blobs which are better able to be mobilized within the pore space of the greater pore size distribution sand thus the fragmentation of the oil can be attributed to the higher overall recovery volumes as compared to mobilization of the oil from the more uniform sand uniform sand experiments with exception to exp 3 the greater the surface area to volume ratio the greater potential for reduction of ift between the oil aqueous solid interface and thereby would be expected to yield greater oil recovery similarly for equivalent blob volumes the more spherical the oil blobs are during flushing i e closer to the black spherical model line the less oil area would be available to solution having lower impact via a reduction of ift under such conditions contact angle is reduced or lower and therefore only at smaller oil volumes will the crude oil be mobilized as oil particle size gets smaller spherical shape is preferred for recovery hence the singlet oil blobs tend to exist predominantly as the smallest blob sizes volumes which allow for greater mobilization and recovery with the aqueous phase large volume oil spheres and large ganglia will require greater pressure to move through tiny pore spaces which can make recovery less efficient and less cost effective the drop shape analysis was beneficial for understanding wettability impacts on the napl i e interfacial area and oil solution interfacial tension due the alkaline solution contact angle was measured with the kruss dsa 1 drop shape analyzer booth 2018 contact angles for the medium oil in contact with silica sand were measured at 78 2 108 3 75 6 47 1 and 13 3 for increasing solution ph of 4 7 10 12 and 13 5 respectively contact angles for the medium oil in contact with limestone caco3 were measured to be 93 7 117 7 108 1 99 and 72 1 for increasing solution ph of 4 7 10 12 and 13 5 respectively at higher ph values of the solution a much smaller oil volume is observed due to the decrease of ift between the oil and aqueous phases where the solution causes larger oil particles to fragment into smaller drops the larger contact angles for the crude oils in contact with the limestone media caco3 as compared to the contact angles observed for oils in contact with silica can be explained by the presence of carbonic acid via saturation of co2 in solution booth 2018 3 4 distribution of oil blobs per oil blob volume evaluation of the distribution of oil blob size throughout the column also aids in understanding the potential for oil recovery in the various systems as volumes of the oil blobs are reduced during flushing mobilization potential should increase throughout the pore networks however it should be noted that the distribution of larger blobs will account for most of the total oil volume within the system at any given time of flushing fig 4a e show the cumulative distribution of oil blobs over a range of oil blob volumes where the distribution denotes the percentage of blobs finer than a corresponding volume size these cumulative distribution plots provide a means to assess the overall size distribution of oil blobs within the column as well as the dominant oil blob size volume fraction within the column before and after each respective flushing episode as can be observed most oil blob sizes occur within volume ranges between the smallest and largest blob volume extremes fig 4a e an oil distribution with an extremely high slope over the range of cumulative fraction indicates a relatively uniform oil blob distribution whereby most of the oil blobs within the column are all about the same volume size conversely if the slope of the oil distribution curve is relatively low the oil distribution is uniquely nonuniform whereby a large variation of oil blob sizes volumes are present in the column furthermore such plots provide an effective way to evaluate how mean oil blob size volume at or 50 fraction finer than for the distribution changes evolves during flushing i e after each enhanced flushing episode exp 1 and exp 2 figs 4a and b show similar trends in oil blob distribution over the various flushing episodes the oil blob distributions for the initial residual saturation conditions are relatively uniform with mean blob sizes corresponding to 10 6 mm3 after 2 pv of flushing alkaline and surfactant the oil blob distributions remain relatively uniform but the volume size of the distribution significantly decreases with mean blob sizes corresponding to 10 8 and 10 7 mm3 for exp 1 and exp 2 respectively similarly after 5 pv of flushing the oil blob distributions remain relatively uniform however the volume size of the distribution is fairly consistent to that after the 2 pv flushing events with mean blob sizes of 5 10 8 and 10 7 mm3 for exp 1 and exp 2 respectively the cumulative distribution plots after 2 pv of flushing demonstrate the pronounced reduction in oil blob volumes for the distributions from the initial residual saturation conditions the results show that greater oil recovery was directly related to the reduction of oil blob volume distribution resulting after each respective flushing episode for example the larger the gap between the cumulative distribution curves prior to and after progressive flushing events i e residual saturation 2 pv flush and 5 pv flush indicated generally greater oil recoveries for that system and particular flushing episode although fairly consistent to that after the 2 pv flushes the cumulative oil distributions after 5 pv of flushing yield slightly larger oil blob volume distributions this effect may be attributed to interconnection of oil blobs along preferential flow paths or within the pore spaces as the oil is mobilized for exp 3 fig 4c the oil blob distribution for the initial residual saturation condition shows a relatively non uniform wide variation of volume size distribution of oil blobs compared to exp 1 and exp 2 with a mean blob size corresponding to 10 6 mm3 after 2 pv of flushing alkaline the oil blob distribution remains consistently non uniform in nature i e initial saturation condition and the volume size of the distribution increases slightly primarily for the lowest and highest oil blob volume ranges however the mean oil blob size for the cumulative distribution remains consistent to the initial residual saturation condition of 10 6 mm3 this blob size distribution increase may be due to the interconnection or re coalescing of oil blobs within the pore spaces and or to the formation of oil in water emulsions as the oil is mobilized during flushing such formation of emulsions could explain the slight differences in the cumulative oil distribution curves as a result of enhanced flushing compared to the initial residual oil saturation distribution although fairly consistent to that after the 2 pv alkaline flush the cumulative oil distribution after 3 pv of subsequent surfactant flushing 5 pv total remained consistently non uniform in nature however the blob volume size of the distribution slightly decreases as a result of this final flushing step however similar to the prior alkaline flushing step the mean oil blob size of the cumulative distribution remained approximately the same at 10 6 mm3 over the sequential flushing episodes for exp 4 fig 4d the oil blob distribution for the initial residual saturation condition was relatively uniform however a significant majority of the oil blobs ranged in volume sizes between 10 7 and 10 5 mm3 which demonstrates some variation in blob size distribution non uniformity of the oil phase the mean oil blob size of this distribution i e residual saturation is consistent with the other experiments at approximately 10 6 mm3 overall the oil blob distributions after both the 2 pv and subsequent 3 pv 5 pv total surfactant flushes are nearly identical to the residual saturation oil distribution condition in terms of both blob uniformity or non uniformity and mean blob size however although the blob distribution after both 2 pv and a total of 5 pv of flushing are nearly identical overlap both distributions exhibit slightly larger blob volume size distributions as a result of flushing curves shifted slightly compared to the initial residual distribution condition fig 4d the slightly larger oil blob distribution that ensues after the two flushing episodes in combination with the image analysis shows that slightly larger ganglia are present which may in part be due to emulsification effects during flushing as a result of dissolution of the carbonate sand and associated higher ph values however it should be noted that there were minimal differences in the oil blob distribution before residual saturation and after respective 2 pv and 5 pv total flushing events over the complete duration of surfactant flushing there was more oil volume recovered in terms of recovery from the mixture 1 sand exp 4 column compared to that from the most uniform sand uniform sand experiment exp 2 whereby reduction in the size volume of the oil blobs and ganglia was greater in exp 4 than that of the oil in exp 2 unlike that for exp 4 for exp 5 mixture 2 sand fig 4e the oil blob distribution of the initial residual saturation condition shows a relatively non uniform condition with a wide range of oil blob volume size variation 10 9 10 4 mm3 although the mean oil blob size for the distribution is consistent 10 6 mm3 with the other experiments i e exp 4 and exp 2 the oil blob distribution is significantly different than exp 4 and others in which the distribution profile is notably concave upward compared to the results of all other experiments also of notable interest is the fact that both successive surfactant flushing episodes i e 2 pv and 3 pv 5 pv total had a dramatic effect on reducing the size volume distribution of the oil blobs in fact an overall progressive reduction in oil blob size volume distribution resulted after each successive surfactant flushing episode 2 pv and 3 pv 5 pv total with mean oil blob sizes of approximately 10 8 and 5 10 9 mm3 respectively furthermore a slight increase in oil blob uniformity resulted after each progressive flushing event whereby the oil blob distribution curves over the range of most blob volume sizes sharpened increased slope as flushing continued fig 4e the overall oil volume recovered in exp 5 is more likely due to the reduction of oil blob rather than the mobilization of larger blobs through the porous network the results describe the trends in oil distribution of blob volume size and changes in relative surface area morphology after enhanced flushing improving our understanding of the conditions controlling i e limiting or enhancing oil removal of oil in various porous media systems varying pore size variation chemical composition caco3 etc additionally the pore network structure i e permeability plays a large role in oil recovery larger pore networks will aid in the mobilization of oil even for larger volume oil blobs in general it can be observed that an increase in the preferential flow mobilization of oil occurred in systems with increasing grain pore size variation even though more oil was recovered in exp 5 than that of exp 2 as a result of the overall significant reduction of oil blob size distribution with flushing it is expected that the largest blobs and ganglia remaining in the system will be difficult to remove via enough volume reduction and corresponding mobilization and removal from the pore network under such conditions the largest oil blobs and ganglia trapped within greater pore size distribution porous media and or blocked by the smallest pore sizes will be difficult to remove leading to less cost effective inefficient recovery the capillary number n c describes the ratio of viscous forces to interfacial tension forces the bond number n b describes the ratio of buoyancy forces to interfacial tension and the trapping number n t describes the effect of both buoyancy and viscous forces relative to interfacial forces boving and brusseau 2000 morrow and chatzis 1982 pennell et al 1994 1996 ghosh and tick 2013 mateas et al 2017 ghosh et al 2019 under residual saturation conditions bond numbers were much higher than capillary numbers indicating that buoyancy forces had greater control for the trapping and mobilization of crude oil for all conditions buoyancy forces had a greater effect on trapping and mobilization bond number is an order of magnitude higher than capillary number compared to viscous forces i e n c tables 4 and 5 4 conclusions this study aimed at improving our understanding of the physical and chemical properties controlling crude oil mobilization in saturated porous media by conducting well designed agent enhanced column flushing experiments for the recovery of crude oil from saturated porous media the success of enhanced flushing remediation relies upon the removal of napl from porous media subsurface and the knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for napl mobilization and trapping understanding specific site characteristics such as pore space in the media the composition of the media heterogeneity of the system is also important to the success of remediation this study showed that the pore scale imaging using sxm techniques can help identify the mechanisms responsible for mobilization of crude oil napl many mechanisms can be responsible for mobilization including napl blob morphology capillary forces chemistry of the system viscous and buoyancy forces available napl surface area and interfacial tension along the napl surface the 3d images from sxm showed that the fractionation of napl under different fluid flushes can reduce the volume of oil for both surfactant and alkaline flushing it was shown that sequential alkaline surfactant flushing i e exp 3 was most effective for the recovery of oil in the column experiments the reduction of interfacial tension along the napl aqueous phase boundaries was likely the dominant factor responsible for the mobilization of the napl in these systems also the addition carbonate karst sand was shown to increase the recovery of the oil napl during surfactant flushing due to the increase in ph of the system as a function of carbonate dissolution likely occurring within this medium and due to the resulting increases in the surface area of the oil blobs and ganglia i e greater contact area with flushing agent the sxm 3d imaging methods were critical in showing the distribution of oil blobs as well as the change in morphology during flushing experiments the data show an increase in the fractionation of large blobs to smaller spherical blobs and an increase of surface area for larger blobs and ganglia which can allow the flushing fluid greater contact with the napl causing further fractionation as a result the cost of remediation is dependent on the effectiveness of the solution the time needed to remove the contaminant and the initial cost of the reagents comparing the cost of alkaline flushing surfactant flushing and the sequential flush and based on the results of this research alkaline flushing would be most cost effective in the short term the initial cost compared to the surfactant and sequential flush would be lower however the long term cost of using an alkaline flush could be substantially higher depending the time of remediation as alkaline flushing alone could take longer to remove the napl and the ability to recycle the solution may be more difficult also concerns for the injection of such high ph solutions would have to be considered and could negatively impact soil structure trace metal mobility solubility and soil microbial communities the surfactant flushing has a higher initial cost but surfactants can be recovered and recycled thereby reducing associated long term costs the sequential alkaline surfactant flush has the potential to be the most cost effective method as it would cost less than surfactant flushing alone for the same overall time period of flushing the long term costs would generally be lower due to the effectiveness of the solution to mobilize the napl and reduce the time needed for remediation

1558,the subsurface remediation of nonaqueous liquid napl has proven to be challenging even when implementing more aggressive enhanced flushing techniques the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a combination of alkaline and surfactant based enhanced flushing for the removal of crude oil medium fraction from saturated porous media synchrotron x ray microtomography sxm was used to perform pore scale examination of napl fragmentation and changes in blob morphology and recovery using three different advective flushing methods surface active agent surfactant flushing alkaline flushing and sequential alkaline surfactant flushing this set of experiments was conducted to understand effects on such processes fragmentation and recovery as a function of media composition geochemical mineralogical and ph alterations due to calcium carbonate fraction results showed that the sequential flushing technique alkaline surfactant yielded the highest recovery 32 after 5 pore volumes pv of flushing the crude oil napl distribution varied due to differences in porous medium mixture composition and type of fluid i e surfactant vs alkaline used for flushing the results of this study can be used to aid in the understanding of physical and chemical parameters properties that control mobilization of crude oil in saturated porous media this can help reduce time and cost during remediation of contaminated sites that contain crude oil or less dense napl derivatives consistent with fuel type petroleum hydrocarbons keywords alkaline flushing crude oil napl pore scale remediation surfactant flushing 1 introduction hydrocarbons and fuel derivatives are common contaminants present at hazardous waste and superfund sites across the u s usepa 2000 2003 2007 nonaqueous phase liquids napl are generally classified by their fluid densities relative to that of water whereby light napl lnapl is less dense than water and dense napl dnapl is denser than water most fuel derivatives and petroleum hydrocarbons exist as lnapl and solvents and solvent stabilizers predominantly exist as dnapl oil spills and or unintentional releases i e leakage from underground storage tanks either small or large scale can migrate downward through soil reaching groundwater whereby pure phase napl oil can be retained in pore spaces of consolidated or unconsolidated rocks aquifers and act as a long term source of groundwater contamination connor 1988 pennell et al 1994 1996 it has been well documented that the presence of napl in the subsurface is generally considered to be the primary factor limiting remediation of sites contaminated by organic compounds nrc 1994 1997 1999 2005 although significant progress has been made for the removal or remediation of napl i e solvents crude oils diesels etc from the subsurface over the past few decades significant challenges and limitations still remain for complete source removal ghosh and tick 2013 mateas et al 2017 akyol and turkkan 2018 akyol 2018 in fact it has been shown that significant limitations with currently available remedial technologies persist making it unlikely to reach cleanup goals for complex contaminated groundwater sites in a time period of 50 100 years nrc 2013 typical pump and treat technologies have been used for the remediation of groundwater although they are generally not effective for the removal of napl sources to reach maximum contaminant levels in groundwater mccray et al 2011 akyol and turkkan 2018 a significant percentage of residual napl may remain in groundwater after a conventional pump and treat technique and significant mass can still remain in the subsurface even after more aggressive source zone removal methods have been implemented the residual napl may be trapped in smaller capillaries or adsorbed to the grains of the surrounding rocks or soil enhanced flushing techniques i e surfactant flushing etc can aid in the removal of residual napl source zones mulligan et al 2001 ghosh and tick 2013 akyol et al 2013 akyol 2018 booth 2018 ghosh et al 2019 previous studies have shown that a combination of alkaline and surfactant flushing used by the petroleum industry enhanced oil recovery eor can be a viable method for more efficient oil extraction al rossies et al 2010 du et al 2013 mulligan et al 2001 zhao et al 2013 an understanding of how these enhanced flushing techniques can change the napl distribution and blob morphology along with particular relevant chemical reactions that may occur in the subsurface with various physical heterogeneity or with the napl itself can help when designing and implementing removal strategies for residual napl or oil trapped in groundwater systems over the last decade several novel pore scale imaging

between experiments and sxm imaging technique although not feasible for every experiment due to time constraints associated with imaging these preliminary tests indicated that this technique provided reproducible results validating that the experimental technique used in this study was robust the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a combination of alkaline and surfactant based enhanced flushing techniques for the removal of hydrocarbon napl crude oil from groundwater this research aims to improve our understanding of the pore scale processes that influence napl crude oil during enhanced flushing conditions using a novel synchrotron x ray microtomography sxm imaging technique specifically the objectives include 1 assessing the impact of crude oil napl mobilization by quantifying the changes in oil distribution and morphology during independent surfactant and alkaline flushing and combination sequential alkaline surfactant flushing 2 quantifying oil recovery as a function of changes in oil blob distribution and morphology for various enhanced flushing scenarios and 3 determining the impact of different porous media mixtures on recovery of crude oil during surfactant flushing conditions overall this study aims to compare and contrast removal of napl via two enhanced flushing techniques surfactant agent vs alkaline agent and evaluate a new sequential combination flushing scenario of the two agents i e alkaline surfactant 2 materials and methods a lighter than water lnapl crude oil was chosen as the model non aqueous phase liquid napl and is

however the viscosity and density change due to this doping effect were not measured two different flushing solutions were used to enhance the mobilization of the oil phase including 1 a sodium

phases and the fact that it has been widely used by the petroleum industry for tertiary crude oil recovery schramm 2000 another benefit of alkaline flushing is the ability to change the wettability of the porous medium oil system from oil wet to water wet thereby reducing both contact area and surface tension of oil with the solid al rossies et al 2010 the surfactant was chosen for its ability to develop low interfacial tension at low concentrations the experiments herein relied on the principal mechanism of surfactant induced mobilization rather than solubilization for the removal and remediation of crude oil napl under low surfactant concentration conditions e g ghosh and tick 2013 booth 2018 ghosh et al 2019 this surfactant was developed specifically for enhanced oil recovery eor and surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear applications this surfactant was also shown to experience minimal adsorption to the solid phase goddard et al 2004 and high salinity tolerance wu et al 2005 it should be noted that the time interval between surfactant flushing and image capture was 4 h limiting the extent of surfactant adsorption on silica sand and mixtures of silica sand calcareous grains as observed by preliminary tests ghosh 2011 preliminary tests were carried out to ensure that the concentration of the surfactant solution was below the critical micelle concentration cmc 0 9 while simultaneously optimizing the reduction of interfacial tension between the oil and surfactant solution ensuring that mobilization was the dominant mechanism of oil removal ghosh 2011 ghosh and tick 2013 booth 2018 ghosh et al 2019 previous research shows that the branched alkyl surfactant has the greater ability to reduce interfacial tension in comparison to straight chain alkyl group at very low concentrations even lower than rosen et al 2005 moreover this surfactant was specifically formulated for oil extraction purposes eor and for oil remediation and it has been effectively used to mobilize crude oil remediation from shallow aquifers jayanti et al 2002 it also showed high salinity tolerance and is therefore assumed to be applicable for reservoirs with high salinity in addition this surfactant showed minimal adsorption to the solid phase and negligible effects from biodegradation goddard et al 2004 ghosh and tick 2013 booth 2018 ghosh et al 2019 silica sand media 40 50 mesh accusand and natural calcareous karst soil were used in these experiments the karst sand is characterized as a poorly sorted sandy loam the soil has an alkaline character with a ph of 8 4 due to the presence of abundant amounts of carbonate 96 and consists of intermediate amounts of organic carbon 1 akyol et al 2011 akyol and yolcubal 2013 the organic carbon content of silica sand materials is very low o c 0 05 properties of the homogeneous silica sand media are further described in ghosh and tick 2013 the physical heterogeneity and associated properties of calcareous karst soil have also been described in greater detail by previous studies akyol and turkkan 2018 akyol 2018 ghosh et al 2019 due to the fact that the calcareous soil natural soil has been well characterized in terms of physical and chemical properties it was selected for addition within silica sand distributions to create different representative porous media mixtures it should be noted that these porous media are not meant to represent the complexities of real world natural media but rather are used to test mixtures with different grain size pore size distributions and chemical properties three different homogeneous sand media were created for the series of flushing experiments including 1 uniform sand which is comprised of only quartz silica accusand 40 50 mesh and characterized with the lowest grain pore size variation and the highest hydraulic conductivity of the media 2 mixture 1 which is comprised of 25 karst carbonate soil and 75 accusand by weight and characterized by a greater grain pore size variation and lower hydraulic conductivity and 3 mixture 2 which is comprised of 50 karst carbnate soil and 50 accusand by weight and characterized by a greater grain pore size distribution and the lowest hydraulic conductivity see table 2 the sands were further characterized by their respective uniformity coefficients cu d60 d10 which describes media grain size uniformity i e 1 being uniform and 4 or greater being non uniform the uniform sand 40 50 mesh accusand has a cu 1 the karst sand mixtures mixture 1 and mixture 2 were prepared in the laboratory and were determined to have uniformity coefficients cu of approximately 5 and 10 respectively these sand mixtures provide valuable comparison to other studies that used the same and or similar media configurations and can also potentially be compared to other more real world systems with more complex physical chemical distributions akyol 2018 akyol and turkkan 2018 ghosh et al 2019 the aqueous cscl flushing solution 60 g l 1 used to create the initial oil residual saturations was determined to have a dynamic viscosity of 0 84 cp 0 0084 dyn s cm 2 table 2 ghosh and tick 2013 the cscl doped surfactant flushing solution was measured to have a dynamic viscosity of 2 21 cp 0 022 dyn s cm 2 ghosh and tick 2013 table 1 interfacial surface tensions tensions σow were measured using a dsa 1 drop shape analyzer kruss gmbh germany and determined to be 20 9 dyn cm 1 for the oil cscl system i e aqueous residual pre surfactant flush and 11 8 dyn cm 1 for the oil surfactant system i e sear flush this reflects an approximately 44 decrease in interfacial surface tension due to the presence of the surfactant solution the alkaline naoh solution ph 12 yielded an even greater reduction in interfacial tension between for the alkaline oil system of 7 3 dyn cm 1 corresponding to a 65 decrease in interfacial tension due to the presence of alkaline solution table 2 a series of five small scale enhanced flushing column experiments were performed using thin walled aluminum porous medium packed columns tables 1 2 and 3 the columns ranged in length 4 5 5 0 cm with an inner diameter i d of 0 5 cm both ends of the columns were outfitted with swagelok end fittings to minimize void space in the end caps a polypropylene frit was inserted between the porous medium and end caps to reduce preferential flow and to keep the porous medium contained within the system during saturation and flushing the sample representative elementary volumes rev for all of these packed systems were achieved to include the scale of all heterogeneities i e porosity and permeability within the column volumes see wildenschild et al 2002 costanza robinson et al 2008 willson et al 2012 ghosh and tick 2013 ghosh et al 2019 rev is the smallest volume over which a measurement can be made that will yield a value representative of the whole achieving a rev has become a de facto criterion for demonstrating the quality of sxm measurements in porous media systems with smaller systems for more discussion refer to costanza robinson et al 2011 it should be noted that preferential flow accumulation of oil napl may occur along column walls however spatial analyses for the representative column sections displayed fig 1 were the same for each system as a means to be as consistent as possible when comparing each of the various experiments the first three columns exp 1 exp 2 and exp 3 were dry packed with the uniform sand 40 50 mesh accusand the fourth column exp 4 was dry packed with mixture 1 25 75 karst accusand the fifth column exp 5 was dry packed with mixture 2 50 50 karst accusand the sand packed columns were then saturated vertically upward to maintain stable displacement with nanopure water using a single piston pump acuflow series ii for a period of 48 h at a pumping rate linear pore velocity v p of 6 8 cm h the columns were weighed over the saturation period until the weight stabilized to ensure that fully saturated conditions were maintained prior to oil napl emplacement once the columns were fully saturated they were independently imbibed vertically injected downward with 4 pore volumes pv of crude oil using a syringe pump kd scientific model 780100 holliston ma to maintain stable displacement of the water from the column by the less dense than water crude oil fraction see methods of pennell et al 1993 bai et al 1997 boving and brusseau 2000 tick and rincon 2009 ghosh and tick 2013 prior to this injection step the oil was first doped with 10 by volume iodobenzene to improve imaging contrast for the oil napl via optimizing maximizing x ray absorption energy above and below the iodine edge for the purposes of synchrotron x ray microtomography sxm the columns were then flushed vertically upwards with nanopure water doped with 60 g l cesium chloride cesium chloride cscl is added to improve imaging contrast for the aqueous phase by maximizing x ray absorption below the cesium k edge see methods ghosh and tick 2013 the flushing of cscl solution was performed in two sequential steps at varying velocities 2 pv at v p of 6 10 cm h and 10 pv at 20 30 cm h to establish residual oil saturation conditions prior to the enhanced flushing experiments the addition of cscl has negligible effect on interfacial tension ift in the aqueous phase and flushing solutions schnaar and brusseau 2006a ghosh 2011 booth 2018 ghosh et al 2019 however the crude oil doped with iodobenzene ib exhibited minor changes in interfacial tension for the bulk oil ghosh and tick 2013 these dopants also showed negligible partitioning to non target fluids in other studies schnaar and brusseau 2006a the methods used to attain residual saturation are similar to those from previous studies ghosh and tick 2013 schnaar and brusseau 2006a 2006b after residual saturation was attained each column was sealed and imaged using synchrotron x ray microtomography sxm sxm was used to specifically quantify oil distribution and blob morphology for a series of surfactant alkaline and sequential alkaline surfactant column flushing experiments all imaging was performed at geosoilenvirocars gsecars bm 13d beamline sector at advanced photon source argonne national laboratory il after each complete initial scan residual saturation condition columns were then subsequently flushed vertically downward to maintain stable displacement processes at a linear pore velocity v p of 20 cm h using cscl doped flushing solution in two steps first a 2 pv flushing period and then a 3 pv flushing period whereby after each respective flush the column was scanned using sxm column 1 exp 1 was flushed with the alkaline solution naoh ph 12 and columns 2 exp 2 4 exp 4 and 5 exp 5 were flushed with the surfactant solution column 3 exp 3 was flushed sequentially with the alkaline solution naoh ph 12 for 2 pv followed immediately by the surfactant flushing for 2 pv 2 2 total of 4 pv and imaged then flushed again sequentially with alkaline solution for 3 pv followed immediately by the surfactant flushing for 3 pv 3 3 total of 6 pv overall this corresponds to 5 pv of alkaline flushing and 5 pv of surfactant flushing 10 pv total over all sequential flushing steps it should be noted that all aqueous flushing solutions were doped with cscl 60 g l prior to being flushed through each column experiment for improved image contrast reasons described previously table 1 lists the conditions associated with each column experiment i e the media used and type of flushing experiment performed etc each sxm scan generated volume files that could be used to resolve 2d and 3d images for the aqueous and napl phases whereby the above iodine k edge energy was used to resolve the oil phase and the below cesium k edge was used to resolve the aqueous phase i e cscl surfactant alkaline solution the image data obtained from sxm were pre processed and reconstructed at aps to produce three dimensional 3 d image arrays with spatial resolution 10 μm 9 4 μm all sxm generated volume image files were pre processed at argonne national laboratory and converted into stacks to be turned into a 3d image arrays the images were then processed using tomographic software tomo display rivers 2006 and image j software and iodine k edge generated volume files were subtracted from the cesium k edge generated volume files to produce image files of only the crude oil napl distribution with the column system blob3d software ketcham 2005 was then used to convert the stack of 2d images to 3d images blob3d was also used to extract quantitative parameters such as oil volume and surface area of the oil and aqueous phases the data were used to quantify blob volume distribution blob radius and diameter blob morphology blob deviation from spheres equivalent surface area to volume and volume recovered conditions and parameters associated with each of the flushing experiments are reported in table 2 further details about sxm imaging collection for geologic media and fluid phases as well as 2d and 3d image processing methods can be found in literature sutton et al 2002 wildenschild et al 2002 schnaar and brusseau 2005 2006a brusseau et al 2007 ghosh and tick 2013 booth 2018 ghosh et al 2019 trapping and mobilization mechanisms of crude oil are controlled by capillary processes due to porous media geometry wettability of the media crude oil viscosity oil solution densities and capillary pressures booth 2018 the data collected from both the sxm and kruss drop shape analyzer instruments were used to determine the potential of oil mobilization and or trapping for the various experiments quantitative results such as oil napl blob size distribution normalized oil surface to volume ratios oil volume recovered for column flushing experiments as well as capillary number n c bond number n b trapping number n t and change in capillary pressure p for the drop shape and interfacial tension experiments were integrated to assess oil mobilization trapping behavior or potential n c n b and n t are dimensionless numbers used to describe the potential for oil mobilization capillary pressure is the difference of pressure across the interface of two immiscible liquids i e oil and aqueous solution the capillary number describes the ratio of viscous forces to interfacial tension forces higher values indicate a greater potential for oil to be mobilized mercer and cohen 1990 have observed that in order initiate oil mobilization capillary numbers should be on the order of 10 5 or greater for complete removal of oil capillary numbers should be on the order of 10 3 or greater depending on specifics of the s l l system and further details describing these trapping mobilization parameters can be found in morrow and songkran 1981 mercer and cohen 1990 boving and brusseau 2000 pennell et al 1994 1996 ghosh 2011 ghosh and tick 2013 mateas et al 2017 booth 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 crude oil napl distribution 3d imaged sections show a random distribution of crude oil under residual saturation conditions in both the uniform sand media accusand and karst carbonate sand mixture mixture 1 and mixture 2 packed columns i e increasing karst carbonate content although the entire columns were scanned for evaluation quantification of mass balance recovery and overall oil blob morphology characterization only representative column sections of the oil distribution are displayed in fig 1 the representative column sections shown are taken within the column center at the same exact spatial location for all column systems and flushing episodes in order to be as consistent as possible when comparing each system oil napl distribution patterns show a variety of blob morphology and configuration disconnected individual blobs known as singlets and doublets can be seen throughout the residual saturation conditions initial sxm scans regions where higher concentrations of oil blobs are present tend to be aggregated in ganglia that are connected within the interconnected pore space the images in fig 1a e show a representative imaged section of each of the five columns at residual oil saturation named image 1 herein after a 2 pv flush image 2 and after a subsequent 3 pv flush total of 5 pv image 3 fig 1a shows converted 3d images for exp 1 column 1 alkaline flush in the uniform sand medium the first column image scan image 1 shows a random distribution of oil blobs for residual saturation the oil distribution image shows that more singlet and doublet blobs exist toward the center of the column and more interconnected ganglia exist toward the edges walls of the column whereby preferential flow i e wall effect can be observed to have occurred image 2 shows and quantified that the oil blobs become smaller in terms of volume and radii and there were a greater number of blobs present compared to the initial saturation condition this redistribution may be due to the larger oil blobs being fragmented dispersed likely from the reduction of interfacial tension between the oil and aqueous phases in combination with potential fluid shearing effects table 4 a greater number of oil blobs can be observed and quantified after this final flushing step i e image after 5 pv total compared to that for image 2 there are some preferential flow paths toward the edge of the column walls that can be observed whereby oil ganglia are distributed and this may be the result of wall effects that are common in column systems overall such wall effects are minimal when analyzing the entire scanned column systems however we point out that this phenomenon was observed under some circumstances progressively smaller blob sizes volume radii are observed quantified after the final 3 pv 5 pv total flushing step i e observed in the final scanned image however some oil ganglia are also observed toward the center of the column in between the sand grains indicating a variable distribution of oil i e singlets doublets and ganglia within the column after a total of 5 pv of flushing fig 1b shows converted 3d images for exp 2 column 2 surfactant flush in the uniform sand medium the first column image scan image 1 of the initial residual oil saturation condition similar to exp 1 shows a random distribution of oil blobs with the formation of ganglia near the column walls due to preferential flow paths image 2 shows a greater number of observed and quantified oil blobs with smaller size and volume compared to that in image 1 the fragmentation of oil ganglia into smaller blobs is likely due to the decreased interfacial tension between the oil phase and flushing phase due to the invading surfactant solution itself table 5 it may be that fluid shearing effects are increased under the reduction of oil aqueous interfacial tension as well however this cannot be directly confirmed some oil ganglia are observed along the column walls i e preferential flow via wall effects as well as distributed within the center of the column in the pore space between the sand grains for image 3 an even greater distribution number of oil blobs i e singlets and doublets can be observed and quantified relative to ganglia distribution this image after the final flushing step shows relatively small oil blobs within the pore spaces between the sand grains with preferential flow of oil distributed i e as ganglia along the column walls fig 1c shows converted 3d images for exp 3 column 3 sequential alkaline surfactant flush in the uniform sand medium the first column image scan similar to exp 1 and exp 2 shows a random distribution of oil blobs with preferential flow of oil distributed i e as ganglia along the column walls for image 2 the distribution of oil blobs is present quantified predominantly as interconnected blobs in the form of ganglia throughout the column under such conditions it is expected that this oil ganglia type distribution may require greater viscous forces pressure differential across the oil body to mobilize and remove from the column thereby providing limited to no benefit over either independent alkaline or surfactant enhanced flushing scenarios for image 3 the number of oil ganglia are observed quantified to decrease in size volume with a greater concentration of oil ganglia present in the pore spaces between the sand grains such conditions may be induced via emulsification processes whereby the oil phase droplets coalesce with the bulk aqueous solution disperse mixture that can be associated with increases of ph sheng 2015 booth 2018 fig 1d shows converted 3d images for exp 4 column 4 surfactant flush in mixture 1 karst sand medium these set of experiments exp 4 and exp 5 were conducted to evaluate the impacts of greater grain pore size variation lower hydraulic conductivity and calcium carbon karst sand content on oil distribution and recovery during surfactant flushing overall the initial residual oil saturation condition image 1 exhibits a random distribution of oil blobs and relatively larger ganglia distributed within the porous medium with larger ganglia observed nearest the column walls i e indication of preferential flow as mentioned prior the presence of the oil ganglia type distribution may require greater viscous forces pressure differential across the oil body to mobilize and remove from the column thereby providing limited to no benefit prior to flushing with a particular enhanced flushing agent image 2 shows that some of the large ganglia are being dispersed fragmented into smaller singlet and doublet oil blobs likely attributed to a reduction in interfacial tension between phases additionally there is a notable decrease in the size volume of the larger oil ganglia throughout the column via visual observation and blob 3d quantified results image 3 shows further fragmentation of the larger ganglia into smaller oil blobs observed and quantified within the center region of the column however the larger oil ganglia nearest the column walls show negligible observed and or quantified change in volume and morphology after the second final surfactant flushing event i e results from the third image compared to that for image 2 fig 1e shows converted 3d images for exp 5 column 5 surfactant flush in mixture 2 karst sand medium the initial residual oil saturation condition exhibits a random distribution of oil blobs and ganglia distributed within the column however the oil blobs and ganglia are generally larger in size volume than those in the previous experiments via visual image observation and blob3d quantification image 1 exhibits the relatively largest oil blob volume fraction compared to the results oil distribution after subsequent surfactant flushing events however the oil blobs are not as evenly uniformly distributed throughout the column due to the relative greater degree of system heterogeneity interestingly a notably higher residual oil volume was observed quantified via blob3d in this system compared to the other column experiments this condition may be due to the greater fraction of karst carbonate soil i e greater pore size variation and or due to potential interfacial dynamics transition of wettability and related chemical interaction between the oil and media from the calcium carbonate karst sand content image 2 shows minimal change in oil distribution from the initial residual condition except for a slight decrease in the volume of the larger oil blobs in the system it can be observed that some extremely small size oil blobs are present visual observation and quantified i e volumes on the order of 10 9 mm3 but fragmentation of the oil blobs is not as noticeable compared to that in the other columns after flushing image 3 exhibits an overall further decrease in size volume of the larger oil blobs observed and quantified however with a relatively lower distribution of very small oil blobs present in the system similar to image 2 this indicates that the smallest oil blobs may have been effectively removed from the system during the final flushing step of particular interest is the fact that the oil distribution for exp 5 is noticeably different than exp 4 which only differs in the carbonate sand content fraction the higher carbonate sand fraction of exp 5 may have induced wettability conditions in favor of forming generally larger ganglia distributions within the porous matrix in fact a series of wettability experiments demonstrate that a transition from oil wet to water wet conditions occur as ph increases booth 2018 under such conditions the oil phase would tend to be repelled by the media grain boundaries potentially aiding in the accumulation coalescence of oil into larger ganglia in the system this may also explain that regardless of particular flushing all oil distributions including the formation of the residual oil distribution show similar larger blob configuration and geometry within the system with minor differences after each flushing step as noted above in this section evaluation of the series of uniform sand column experiments exp 1 alkaline exp 2 surfactant and exp 3 sequential alkaline surfactant show that the fragmentation of oil blobs into smaller blobs occurs progressively after each flushing step particularly for exp 1 and exp 2 hence these two column experiments show a similar general trend whereby a greater number of oil blobs with progressively smaller blob volumes result through each flushing step more specifically there was a greater increase in the number of oil blobs in produced via fragmentation after both the 2 pv and 5 pv flushing events quantified via blob3d for exp 2 in comparison to that for exp 1 this could be due the surfactant s exp 1 ability to yield a greater reduction of ift between the oil and aqueous phases compared to the alkaline solution exp 2 the results for exp 3 show that the oil blobs within the column include a greater number of interconnected ganglia compared to the oil blob distribution within the columns for exp 1 and exp 2 as previously stated this could negatively affect the recovery of oil volume due to greater viscous forces needed to overcome capillary forces which mobilize the entire ganglia body the formation of the interconnected ganglia may also be attributed to the emulsion of the oil into the aqueous phase whereby the oil water exists as a quasi single phase within particular regions of the pore system thomas and ali 1989 the progressive reduction in size volume of the oil ganglia over flushing steps i e images 2 and 3 via image analysis and blob3d quantification indicates that ganglia fragmentation occurs as flushing continues evaluation of the series of surfactant flushing experiments within the uniform sand and sand mixtures mixture 1 and mixture 2 exp 2 exp 4 and exp 5 show that there are notable differences in oil distribution configurations for the initial residual oil condition in general visual observations and quantitative analyses blob3d results show that smaller and more spherical oil blobs are present in exp 2 uniform sand larger interconnected ganglia are present in exp 4 mixture 1 and skewed distribution of oil blobs with relatively large volumes are present in exp 5 mixture 2 differences in observed and quantified oil distributions between exp 2 and exp 4 may be due to increased solution ph carbonate dissolution exp 4 and associated impacts from reductions in ift and or transition in system wettability i e oil water to water wet booth 2018 such conditions may cause the oil to distribute more widely as ganglia within the intergranular pore spaces for exp 5 the larger volume oil blobs ganglia may be attributed to the greater grain pore size distribution and lower permeability and lower hydraulic conductivity where smaller pore spaces restrict oil movement causing pooling or redistribution of the oil in larger pore spaces the effects of the surfactant flushing on oil distribution were relatively similar for each of these column systems wherein the oil blob or ganglia volume continues to decrease via fragmentation as flushing progresses this particular fragmentation blob ganglia reduction with flushing trend is more noticeable in the uniform sand medium exp 2 and less distinct in the karst sand mixtures i e exp 4 and exp 5 respectively in general the results of sxm image analyses and blob3d oil quantification show that enhanced flushing alkaline and surfactant can induce changes in oil blob distribution associated with decreases in oil blob volume and increases in the number of oil blobs and in some cases evolution to an interconnected ganglia oil network or quasi single phase emulsion state as flushing progresses walstra 1993 the sxm generated column images show that at the pore scale level these oil distribution changes can be quite dramatic the reduction of ift due to the effects of the surfactant or alkaline flushing solution allows for expansion of the interfacial surface between the oil and aqueous phases table 2 one mechanism by which this increase in surface occurs is by breaking fragmenting the blobs into smaller blobs and dispersing them into the aqueous phase as smaller fragments levorsen 2001 it should be noted that a general trend in the change from more spherical oil blobs to more flattened blobs was observed and quantified after each progressive enhanced flushing event time series this effect contributes to an overall increase in the total oil surface area that is in contact with the aqueous flushing solution although the overall oil blob volumes decrease in this manner the change in morphology to less spherical i e flattened allows greater surface area of the oil to be in contact with the solid and or aqueous boundary this change in morphology can be attributed to the reduction of ift at the oil water interface and is expected to affect oil recovery as discussed in later sections 3 2 crude oil removal recovery changes in oil or napl distribution particularly changes in oil body blob or ganglia volume and surface area due to enhanced flushing processes can influence the overall rate or percent of oil recovery oil body blob and ganglia volumes and surface areas were quantified using the blob3d software ketcham 2005 before and after sequential enhanced flushing events extraction of these parameters and others from 3d images constructed from sxm were used to relate oil recovery processes to changes in oil morphology and distribution over a range of flushing intervals the total oil blob ganglia volumes for each column experiment exp 1 through exp 5 after initial residual saturation conditions and after each sequential flushing event 2 pv and 3 pv 5 pv total are presented in table 3 for exp 1 alkaline flush uniform sand medium and exp 2 surfactant flush uniform sand medium the calculated oil napl recoveries were comparable after each respective flushing event exp 1 shows an initial oil recovery of 3 14 after 2 pv of flushing after another subsequent 3 pv flush a total of 5 pv of flushing the total recovery of oil increased to 6 71 with respect to the initial total oil volume present in the column prior to enhanced flushing the step wise oil recovery for the 3 pv flushing period 3 68 was consistent with that after the initial 2 pv flushing step 3 14 indicating that removal processes via alkaline flushing were relatively consistent with a slight decrease in efficiency oil removed per pv as flushing progressed additionally from the interfacial tension ift values measured reported for different flooding scenario solutions booth 2018 it can be seen that the presence of naoh has a pronounced impact on reducing ift from 20 9 to 7 0 9 4 dyn cm 1 between the oil and aqueous flushing phases this provides further evidence that alkaline flushing was responsible for these oil mass removals likely in response to a decrease in oil aqueous ift during the naoh injections and flushing events table 4 exp 2 shows an initial oil recovery of 4 95 after 2 pv of surfactant flushing and 7 74 after a total of 5 pv of flushing the step wise oil recovery for the second 3 pv flushing period of 2 93 showed a notable decrease 2 times compared to that quantified after the initial 2 pv flushing step 4 95 indicating that removal processes via surfactant flushing were less efficient as flushing progressed table 5 these results also indicate that the alkaline flushing may be slightly more efficient over longer periods of flushing compared to surfactant flushing exp 3 focused on evaluating oil recovery in uniform sand medium via a combined sequential alkaline surfactant flushing technique whereby alkaline solution was introduced first and then directly followed by surfactant flushing for equal time periods for each flushing step step 1 2 pv step 2 2 pv 4 pv total for the first flush step 3 3pv step 4 3pv 10 total pv for all flushes this alkaline surfactant flush yielded the greatest overall oil recovery when compared to the independent alkaline and surfactant flushing experiments exp 1 and exp 2 this demonstrates that sequential alkaline surfactant flush had a significant effect on oil removal mobilization processes compared to the individual surfactant or naoh flushes some research has indicated that higher solution ph can alter solid liquid wettability from a more oil wet to more water wet condition booth 2018 ghosh et al 2019 the higher ph condition associated with the naoh solution was most likely responsible for changes the wettability and interfacial tension to initiate greater mobilization of the oil phase and easier extraction from the system during sequential flushing experiment exp 2 shows an initial oil recovery of 21 11 after 2 pv of surfactant flushing and 34 02 after a total of 5 pv of flushing the step wise oil recovery for the 3 pv flushing period 16 37 was relatively consistent to that after the initial 2 pv flushing step 21 11 showing only a slight decrease 1 3 times in removal efficiency compared to that quantified after the initial 2 pv flushing step however this condition may indicate that this removal processes associated with dual sequential alkaline surfactant flushing techniques may be slightly less efficient as flushing progresses more importantly the sequential alkaline surfactant flush demonstrated a significant increase in oil recovery 4 4 5 1 times greater compared to the other two independent enhanced flushing experiments which may hold promise for remediation at larger scales flow cells to pilot scale field tests it should be noted that more laboratory and pilot field tests are needed to understand both the recovery and environmental impacts before implementing such aggressive techniques for field scale remediation another series of independent surfactant flushing experiments exp 4 and exp 5 were conducted to evaluate the effects of greater grain pore size variation decreases in hydraulic conductivity and karst carbonate content on oil napl removal and recovery as a function of oil morphology and distribution during flushing addition of the karst sand not only introduces finer grain components thereby increasing pore size variation but also can affect carbonate dissolution processes that can alter system ph solution and grain boundaries potentially influencing oil napl distribution and recovery processes previous literature and experiments confirm that the relatively higher ph associated solution and grain surface in these sand karst mixed systems tend to alter solid liquid s l wettability from more oil wet to more water wet condition booth 2018 under this dynamic trend oil napl will generally become more mobile under such water wet conditions and thereby may be extracted more easily from the subsurface during flushing exp 4 mixture 1 25 75 karst sand medium shows an oil recovery of 9 16 and 14 16 after 2 pv and 5 pv of flushing respectively the step wise oil recovery for the 3 pv flushing period 5 61 showed a decrease 1 6 times compared to that quantified after the first 2 pv flushing step 9 16 indicating that removal processes may be slightly less efficient as flushing progresses compared to the uniform sand conditions of exp 2 40 50 accusand this surfactant flushing experiment showed significant improvement in oil recovery for both initial flushing and later flushing stages even though this system has greater pore size variation and lower hydraulic conductivity permeability most notable was the nearly 2 fold increase in oil removal effectiveness for the complete 5 pv of flushing exp 4 14 2 vs exp 2 7 7 the higher overall oil recovery may have been related to increased solution ph carbonate dissolution and grain boundary charge net negative charge to initiate more water wet conditions and associated higher oil removal rates the effect of the increased ph and potential to alter the system to more water wet may help offset expected reductions in oil recovery due to the associated greater pore size distribution i e lower permeability exp 5 mixture 2 50 50 karst sand medium shows an oil recovery of 4 10 and 21 33 after 2 pv and 5 pv of flushing respectively the step wise oil recovery for the 3 pv flushing period 17 97 showed a notable largest increase 4 4 times compared to that quantified after the first 2 pv flushing step 4 10 indicating that removal processes may be much more efficient oil removed per pv as flushing progresses when calcium carbonate sediments are present compared to the uniform sand conditions of exp 2 40 50 accusand this surfactant flushing experiment showed significant improvement in oil recovery predominantly during the later stages of flushing even though this system has greater pore size variation and lower hydraulic conductivity permeability most notable was the nearly 3 2 fold increase in oil removal effectiveness after the complete 5 pv of flushing exp 5 21 3 vs exp 2 7 7 similar to exp 4 the higher overall oil recovery may have been related to increased solution ph carbonate dissolution grain boundary charge net negative charge and reactions with the oil to initiate more water wet conditions and associated higher oil removal rates since oil recovery rates are relatively consistent for both systems during the early stages of surfactant flushing it may be that the dissolution and reaction processes altering the wettability of the system to more water wet exhibited greater kinetic limitations such an effect may be related to the greater pore size distribution lower permeability condition of the porous medium whereby permeability had greater control on early time oil removal less recovery initially and then subsequent increases in ph with more time carbonate dissolution imposed greater control on removal processes countering the reduced permeability effects and yielding greater oil recovery further studies are needed to explore particular dissolution effects on wettability the significant contrasts in oil blob morphology and impacts on oil phase recovery most notably for these mixed karst sand systems in general overall oil recovery was higher for the karst sand mixtures exp 4 and exp 5 under surfactant flushing conditions compared to the more uniform medium uniform sand column flushing experiments alkaline and surfactant with the exception of the sequential alkaline surfactant flushing experiment as mentioned previously these greater quantified oil recoveries are likely attributed to an increase of ph due to the presence of the karst sand and associated dissolution of calcium carbonate the greatest overall oil recovery was observed for the sequential alkaline surfactant flushing experiment the initial reduction of interfacial tension i e via a decrease contact angle by the alkaline flushing solution was followed by further reduction of ift during the surfactant flush leading to the increase in oil volume recovery the removal process was relatively consistent for each of the flushing steps after 2 pv and after 3 pv 5 pv total indicating that relatively higher associated removal conditions may be maintained as flushing progresses some research has indicated that higher solution ph can alter solid liquid wettability from a more oil wet to a more water wet condition booth 2018 ghosh et al 2019 the higher ph condition associated with the naoh solution was most likely responsible for changes the wettability and interfacial tension to initiate greater mobilization of the oil phase and easier extraction from the system during sequential flushing experiment ghosh et al 2019 in addition although surfactant and alkaline flushing can affect the multiphase systems beyond the reduction of interfacial tension i e unstable stable emulsion phases polarity of the solution etc this study assumes that oil recovery is due primarily to the reduction of ift between the oil and water phases ghosh and tick 2013 because of this ift reduction less capillary pressure is required to displace mobilize the crude oil through the pore network the experimental results clearly show that ift was reduced when alkaline reagent was applied to the column systems as a result geometry of oil blobs vary as flushing progresses a general trend in the change from more spherical oil blobs to more flattened blobs was observed and quantified after each progressive enhanced flushing event over the flushing time series this flattening effect causes greater oil surface area to be in contact with the flushing fluid thereby reducing the ift of the oil body over a greater surface such effects were also observed in other studies for the removal of light and heavy crude oils from homogeneous silica sand ghosh and tick 2013 ghosh et al 2019 3 3 changes in oil morphology on recovery a comparison of the change in oil body blob and ganglia morphology may provide further insight into the recovery processes of crude oil or napl as noted previously oil blob and ganglia morphology was observed to flatten deviate more from spherical after progressive enhanced flushing as shown in 2d and 3d image analyses this flattening effect causes greater oil surface area to be in contact with the flushing fluid thereby reducing the ift of the oil body over a greater surface figs 2a e and 3a e show comparisons of the specific surface area a i e the ratio of the oil blob surface area to its volume for each of the enhanced flushing column experiments fig 2a e specifically compares the conditions at residual oil saturation prior to flushing and after 2 pv of enhanced flushing while fig 3a e compares the conditions at residual oil saturation and after 5 pv of flushing a particular blob volume possesses a minimum surface area as a spherical shape and any deviation from a sphere will result in a greater surface area it should be noted that the graphical representation of blob deviations from a sphere is more robust for distributions of disconnected blobs therefore these analyses and associated graphical plots cannot be successfully applied when the majority of the oil napl phase is connected as ganglia the surface area to volume ratio of a perfect sphere is represented by the black curved model lines figs 2a e and 3a e and denotes the minimum specific surface area as represented by a perfect oil blob sphere the oil blobs below the line smaller blob volumes i e 10 8 mm3 can be attributed to the limitations of the blob3d software and or the parameters assigned during the grayscale thresholding and partitioning of the 2d images before 3d conversion oil bodies blobs or ganglia deviating above the black model line exhibit relative higher surface areas compared to that of a perfect sphere geometry i e become more flattened or deviate more from spherical under such conditions it would be expected that the flushing fluid would be more effective as it contacts greater relative oil napl surface area by reducing ift at this boundary for exp 1 figs 2a and 3a and exp 2 figs 2b and 3b in the uniform sand the oil blobs and ganglia generally become more spherical in shape as flushing progresses i e after 2 pv and 5 pv of flushing especially for lower oil volumes ranges 10 7 mm3 this may be enhanced by the solution contacting larger blobs and ganglia allowing for fragmentation into smaller and more spherical oil blob morphologies as flushing progresses the larger oil blob ganglia volume sizes 10 6 mm3 tend to deviate more from a sphere than the smaller blob volumes i e after 2 pv and 5 pv flushing and although the larger oil blobs tend to remain less spherical overall the blobs tend to become slightly more spherical in shape after 5 pv of flushing for exp 3 figs 2c and 3c the oil blobs and ganglia show a more noticeable change in blob morphology from less spherical to more spherical as flushing progresses the oil blobs in the initial residual oil saturation condition exhibit the greatest deviations from spherical shape but become increasingly spherical with each respective flush event after 2 pv and 5 pv flushing events however similar to exp 1 and exp 2 the larger oil blob ganglia volume sizes tend to deviate more from a sphere for the later flushing event after 5 pv event in contrast to the independent alkaline and surfactant flushing experiments exp 1 and exp 2 overall blob morphology tends to deviate more as flushing progressed for the larger oil blob volume size ranges the karst sand mixture experiments exp 4 mixture 1 and exp 5 mixture 2 show a different blob distribution than what can be observed from the uniform sand accusand columns described above for exp 4 figs 2d and 3d blob variations do not deviate much from that of the initial residual oil distribution as flushing progresses at smaller volumes 10 8 mm3 oil blobs become slightly more spherical oil blob volumes between 10 8 and 10 6 mm3 show slight deviation from spherical shape and the larger ganglia volumes 10 6 mm3 show virtually no deviation from the residual oil blobs which all generally plot above the spherical model line this trend continues as flushing progresses 2 pv to 5 pv for exp 5 figs 2e and 3e the oil blobs show the greatest deviation from spherical shape flattening of the oil blobs compared to exp 4 and exp 2 this notable increase in oil blob flattening deviation from spherical generally occurs for volumes as large as 10 6 mm3 and continues to the smallest volumes of oil with even more deviation from spherical shape as flushing progress from 2 pv to 5pv fig 4e with respect to oil volume recovery exp 4 shows minimal change in the blob shape morphology from that of the initial residual saturation condition the oil volume recovered from this experiment is strictly from the fragmentation of the large ganglia due to reduction of ift between the oil and aqueous phases and the ift reduction is due to surfactant flushing encountering the relatively larger surface area of the oil blobs and ganglia for exp 5 as flushing progresses surface area is increased when in contact with the surfactant causes fragmentation of the larger oil blobs to smaller resulting blobs thus it is presumed that due to the relatively larger surface areas of the oil present in exp 4 and exp 5 the surfactant was in contact with more of the oil this greater surfactant oil contact is likely causing fragmentation of the oil into smaller blobs which are better able to be mobilized within the pore space of the greater pore size distribution sand thus the fragmentation of the oil can be attributed to the higher overall recovery volumes as compared to mobilization of the oil from the more uniform sand uniform sand experiments with exception to exp 3 the greater the surface area to volume ratio the greater potential for reduction of ift between the oil aqueous solid interface and thereby would be expected to yield greater oil recovery similarly for equivalent blob volumes the more spherical the oil blobs are during flushing i e closer to the black spherical model line the less oil area would be available to solution having lower impact via a reduction of ift under such conditions contact angle is reduced or lower and therefore only at smaller oil volumes will the crude oil be mobilized as oil particle size gets smaller spherical shape is preferred for recovery hence the singlet oil blobs tend to exist predominantly as the smallest blob sizes volumes which allow for greater mobilization and recovery with the aqueous phase large volume oil spheres and large ganglia will require greater pressure to move through tiny pore spaces which can make recovery less efficient and less cost effective the drop shape analysis was beneficial for understanding wettability impacts on the napl i e interfacial area and oil solution interfacial tension due the alkaline solution contact angle was measured with the kruss dsa 1 drop shape analyzer booth 2018 contact angles for the medium oil in contact with silica sand were measured at 78 2 108 3 75 6 47 1 and 13 3 for increasing solution ph of 4 7 10 12 and 13 5 respectively contact angles for the medium oil in contact with limestone caco3 were measured to be 93 7 117 7 108 1 99 and 72 1 for increasing solution ph of 4 7 10 12 and 13 5 respectively at higher ph values of the solution a much smaller oil volume is observed due to the decrease of ift between the oil and aqueous phases where the solution causes larger oil particles to fragment into smaller drops the larger contact angles for the crude oils in contact with the limestone media caco3 as compared to the contact angles observed for oils in contact with silica can be explained by the presence of carbonic acid via saturation of co2 in solution booth 2018 3 4 distribution of oil blobs per oil blob volume evaluation of the distribution of oil blob size throughout the column also aids in understanding the potential for oil recovery in the various systems as volumes of the oil blobs are reduced during flushing mobilization potential should increase throughout the pore networks however it should be noted that the distribution of larger blobs will account for most of the total oil volume within the system at any given time of flushing fig 4a e show the cumulative distribution of oil blobs over a range of oil blob volumes where the distribution denotes the percentage of blobs finer than a corresponding volume size these cumulative distribution plots provide a means to assess the overall size distribution of oil blobs within the column as well as the dominant oil blob size volume fraction within the column before and after each respective flushing episode as can be observed most oil blob sizes occur within volume ranges between the smallest and largest blob volume extremes fig 4a e an oil distribution with an extremely high slope over the range of cumulative fraction indicates a relatively uniform oil blob distribution whereby most of the oil blobs within the column are all about the same volume size conversely if the slope of the oil distribution curve is relatively low the oil distribution is uniquely nonuniform whereby a large variation of oil blob sizes volumes are present in the column furthermore such plots provide an effective way to evaluate how mean oil blob size volume at or 50 fraction finer than for the distribution changes evolves during flushing i e after each enhanced flushing episode exp 1 and exp 2 figs 4a and b show similar trends in oil blob distribution over the various flushing episodes the oil blob distributions for the initial residual saturation conditions are relatively uniform with mean blob sizes corresponding to 10 6 mm3 after 2 pv of flushing alkaline and surfactant the oil blob distributions remain relatively uniform but the volume size of the distribution significantly decreases with mean blob sizes corresponding to 10 8 and 10 7 mm3 for exp 1 and exp 2 respectively similarly after 5 pv of flushing the oil blob distributions remain relatively uniform however the volume size of the distribution is fairly consistent to that after the 2 pv flushing events with mean blob sizes of 5 10 8 and 10 7 mm3 for exp 1 and exp 2 respectively the cumulative distribution plots after 2 pv of flushing demonstrate the pronounced reduction in oil blob volumes for the distributions from the initial residual saturation conditions the results show that greater oil recovery was directly related to the reduction of oil blob volume distribution resulting after each respective flushing episode for example the larger the gap between the cumulative distribution curves prior to and after progressive flushing events i e residual saturation 2 pv flush and 5 pv flush indicated generally greater oil recoveries for that system and particular flushing episode although fairly consistent to that after the 2 pv flushes the cumulative oil distributions after 5 pv of flushing yield slightly larger oil blob volume distributions this effect may be attributed to interconnection of oil blobs along preferential flow paths or within the pore spaces as the oil is mobilized for exp 3 fig 4c the oil blob distribution for the initial residual saturation condition shows a relatively non uniform wide variation of volume size distribution of oil blobs compared to exp 1 and exp 2 with a mean blob size corresponding to 10 6 mm3 after 2 pv of flushing alkaline the oil blob distribution remains consistently non uniform in nature i e initial saturation condition and the volume size of the distribution increases slightly primarily for the lowest and highest oil blob volume ranges however the mean oil blob size for the cumulative distribution remains consistent to the initial residual saturation condition of 10 6 mm3 this blob size distribution increase may be due to the interconnection or re coalescing of oil blobs within the pore spaces and or to the formation of oil in water emulsions as the oil is mobilized during flushing such formation of emulsions could explain the slight differences in the cumulative oil distribution curves as a result of enhanced flushing compared to the initial residual oil saturation distribution although fairly consistent to that after the 2 pv alkaline flush the cumulative oil distribution after 3 pv of subsequent surfactant flushing 5 pv total remained consistently non uniform in nature however the blob volume size of the distribution slightly decreases as a result of this final flushing step however similar to the prior alkaline flushing step the mean oil blob size of the cumulative distribution remained approximately the same at 10 6 mm3 over the sequential flushing episodes for exp 4 fig 4d the oil blob distribution for the initial residual saturation condition was relatively uniform however a significant majority of the oil blobs ranged in volume sizes between 10 7 and 10 5 mm3 which demonstrates some variation in blob size distribution non uniformity of the oil phase the mean oil blob size of this distribution i e residual saturation is consistent with the other experiments at approximately 10 6 mm3 overall the oil blob distributions after both the 2 pv and subsequent 3 pv 5 pv total surfactant flushes are nearly identical to the residual saturation oil distribution condition in terms of both blob uniformity or non uniformity and mean blob size however although the blob distribution after both 2 pv and a total of 5 pv of flushing are nearly identical overlap both distributions exhibit slightly larger blob volume size distributions as a result of flushing curves shifted slightly compared to the initial residual distribution condition fig 4d the slightly larger oil blob distribution that ensues after the two flushing episodes in combination with the image analysis shows that slightly larger ganglia are present which may in part be due to emulsification effects during flushing as a result of dissolution of the carbonate sand and associated higher ph values however it should be noted that there were minimal differences in the oil blob distribution before residual saturation and after respective 2 pv and 5 pv total flushing events over the complete duration of surfactant flushing there was more oil volume recovered in terms of recovery from the mixture 1 sand exp 4 column compared to that from the most uniform sand uniform sand experiment exp 2 whereby reduction in the size volume of the oil blobs and ganglia was greater in exp 4 than that of the oil in exp 2 unlike that for exp 4 for exp 5 mixture 2 sand fig 4e the oil blob distribution of the initial residual saturation condition shows a relatively non uniform condition with a wide range of oil blob volume size variation 10 9 10 4 mm3 although the mean oil blob size for the distribution is consistent 10 6 mm3 with the other experiments i e exp 4 and exp 2 the oil blob distribution is significantly different than exp 4 and others in which the distribution profile is notably concave upward compared to the results of all other experiments also of notable interest is the fact that both successive surfactant flushing episodes i e 2 pv and 3 pv 5 pv total had a dramatic effect on reducing the size volume distribution of the oil blobs in fact an overall progressive reduction in oil blob size volume distribution resulted after each successive surfactant flushing episode 2 pv and 3 pv 5 pv total with mean oil blob sizes of approximately 10 8 and 5 10 9 mm3 respectively furthermore a slight increase in oil blob uniformity resulted after each progressive flushing event whereby the oil blob distribution curves over the range of most blob volume sizes sharpened increased slope as flushing continued fig 4e the overall oil volume recovered in exp 5 is more likely due to the reduction of oil blob rather than the mobilization of larger blobs through the porous network the results describe the trends in oil distribution of blob volume size and changes in relative surface area morphology after enhanced flushing improving our understanding of the conditions controlling i e limiting or enhancing oil removal of oil in various porous media systems varying pore size variation chemical composition caco3 etc additionally the pore network structure i e permeability plays a large role in oil recovery larger pore networks will aid in the mobilization of oil even for larger volume oil blobs in general it can be observed that an increase in the preferential flow mobilization of oil occurred in systems with increasing grain pore size variation even though more oil was recovered in exp 5 than that of exp 2 as a result of the overall significant reduction of oil blob size distribution with flushing it is expected that the largest blobs and ganglia remaining in the system will be difficult to remove via enough volume reduction and corresponding mobilization and removal from the pore network under such conditions the largest oil blobs and ganglia trapped within greater pore size distribution porous media and or blocked by the smallest pore sizes will be difficult to remove leading to less cost effective inefficient recovery the capillary number n c describes the ratio of viscous forces to interfacial tension forces the bond number n b describes the ratio of buoyancy forces to interfacial tension and the trapping number n t describes the effect of both buoyancy and viscous forces relative to interfacial forces boving and brusseau 2000 morrow and chatzis 1982 pennell et al 1994 1996 ghosh and tick 2013 mateas et al 2017 ghosh et al 2019 under residual saturation conditions bond numbers were much higher than capillary numbers indicating that buoyancy forces had greater control for the trapping and mobilization of crude oil for all conditions buoyancy forces had a greater effect on trapping and mobilization bond number is an order of magnitude higher than capillary number compared to viscous forces i e n c tables 4 and 5 4 conclusions this study aimed at improving our understanding of the physical and chemical properties controlling crude oil mobilization in saturated porous media by conducting well designed agent enhanced column flushing experiments for the recovery of crude oil from saturated porous media the success of enhanced flushing remediation relies upon the removal of napl from porous media subsurface and the knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for napl mobilization and trapping understanding specific site characteristics such as pore space in the media the composition of the media heterogeneity of the system is also important to the success of remediation this study showed that the pore scale imaging using sxm techniques can help identify the mechanisms responsible for mobilization of crude oil napl many mechanisms can be responsible for mobilization including napl blob morphology capillary forces chemistry of the system viscous and buoyancy forces available napl surface area and interfacial tension along the napl surface the 3d images from sxm showed that the fractionation of napl under different fluid flushes can reduce the volume of oil for both surfactant and alkaline flushing it was shown that sequential alkaline surfactant flushing i e exp 3 was most effective for the recovery of oil in the column experiments the reduction of interfacial tension along the napl aqueous phase boundaries was likely the dominant factor responsible for the mobilization of the napl in these systems also the addition carbonate karst sand was shown to increase the recovery of the oil napl during surfactant flushing due to the increase in ph of the system as a function of carbonate dissolution likely occurring within this medium and due to the resulting increases in the surface area of the oil blobs and ganglia i e greater contact area with flushing agent the sxm 3d imaging methods were critical in showing the distribution of oil blobs as well as the change in morphology during flushing experiments the data show an increase in the fractionation of large blobs to smaller spherical blobs and an increase of surface area for larger blobs and ganglia which can allow the flushing fluid greater contact with the napl causing further fractionation as a result the cost of remediation is dependent on the effectiveness of the solution the time needed to remove the contaminant and the initial cost of the reagents comparing the cost of alkaline flushing surfactant flushing and the sequential flush and based on the results of this research alkaline flushing would be most cost effective in the short term the initial cost compared to the surfactant and sequential flush would be lower however the long term cost of using an alkaline flush could be substantially higher depending the time of remediation as alkaline flushing alone could take longer to remove the napl and the ability to recycle the solution may be more difficult also concerns for the injection of such high ph solutions would have to be considered and could negatively impact soil structure trace metal mobility solubility and soil microbial communities the surfactant flushing has a higher initial cost but surfactants can be recovered and recycled thereby reducing associated long term costs the sequential alkaline surfactant flush has the potential to be the most cost effective method as it would cost less than surfactant flushing alone for the same overall time period of flushing the long term costs would generally be lower due to the effectiveness of the solution to mobilize the napl and reduce the time needed for remediation the results of this study provide an improved understanding of various enhanced flushing based strategies in different physically heterogeneous systems to aid future research efforts and selection of

1559,this study investigates the potential impact of climate change on residual contaminants in vadose zones and groundwater we assume that the effect of climate changes can be represented by perturbations in the natural recharge through the aquifer system we perform numerical modeling of unsaturated saturated flow and transport and consider different performance metrics contaminant concentrations at observation wells and contaminant export at the site s boundary we evaluate the effect of increasing and decreasing recharge as well as the impact of potential failure of surface capping structures employed to immobilize vadose zone contaminants our approach is demonstrated in a real case study by simulating transport of non reactive radioactive tritium at the u s department of energy s savannah river site results show that recharge changes significantly affect well concentrations after an initial slight dilution we identify a significant concentration increase at different observation wells some years after the recharge increase and or the cap failure as a consequence of contaminants mobilization this effect is generally emphasized and occurs earlier as the recharge increases under decreased aquifers recharge the concentration could slightly increase for some years due to a decrease of dilution depending on the magnitude of the negative recharge shift we identify trigger levels of recharge above which the concentration export breakthrough curves and the time of exceedance of the maximum contaminant level for tritium are remarkably affected moreover we observe that the contaminant export at the control plane identified as the risk pathway to the downgradient population may only be minimally affected by shifts in the natural recharge regime except for some extreme cases we conclude that more frequent sampling and in situ monitoring near the source zone should be adopted to better explain concentrations anomalies under changing climatic conditions moreover the maintenance of the cap is critical not only to sequester residual contaminants in the vadose zone but also to reduce the uncertainty associated with future precipitation changes finally realistic flow and transport simulations achieved through proper calibration processes rather than conservative modeling should be adopted to identify non trivial trade offs which enable better allocation of resources towards reducing uncertainty in decision making 1 introduction subsurface contamination is recognized as a critical issue in many communities there are more than a thousand superfund sites in the u s categorized under the u s environmental protection agency epa which present large plumes of organic solvents heavy metals and radionuclides us environmental protection agency https www epa gov superfund in addition the epa estimated the presence of more than 450 000 brownfields in the u s contaminated by hazardous substances pollutants or contaminants us environmental protection agency https www epa gov brownfields the practice of soil and groundwater remediation has been changing in recent decades transitioning from intense soil removal and active treatment solutions towards passive remediation techniques such as enhanced biodegradation or monitored natural attenuation ellis and hadley 2009 the latter less intensive remediation approaches often identified as sustainable remediation techniques have been recognized as more advantageous since they can reduce negative side effects that often accompany intensive remediation e g ecological disturbance construction noise traffic intensive energy use and emissions of greenhouse gases additionally sustainable remediation is coupled with more innovative and attractive end use scenarios with restricted subsurface use and longer institutional control in most cases a portion of contaminants are sequestered in the subsurface for a long period of time while natural or enhanced biogeochemical processes occur to reduce contaminant concentrations within this context it is critical to assess the long term stability of residual contaminants subject to sustainable remediation practices and to ensure that the latter will not pose significant environmental and human health risk recently o connell and hou 2015a raised the concern that climate change may pose a major risk in environmental remediation especially with regard to the fate of residual contaminants under sustainable remediation a hydrological shift has been identified as one of the key drivers influencing such risk and uncertainty in changing climate precipitation regimes including amount and timing are expected to change significantly and extreme events such as heavy rains and prolonged droughts could become more frequent climate models also predict increasing temperatures which would affect water budgets and reduce infiltration due to increased evapotranspiration these climatic changes are occurring while groundwater is becoming increasingly important for drinking and irrigation purposes famiglietti 2014 despite the critical need to evaluate risks associated with climate change there is only a limited number of studies that address the effects of climate change on contaminant transport and environmental remediation while the impact of climate change has been investigated extensively from the perspective of water resources gellens and roulin 1998 green et al 2011 middelkoop et al 2001 pfister et al 2004 a limited number of studies have addressed water quality issues visser et al 2012 moreover most literature focuses on surface water wilby et al 2006 van vliet and zwolsman 2008 van bokhoven 2006 futter et al 2009 schiedek et al 2007 due to its visibility and accessibility green et al 2011 while the studies on groundwater are mostly focused on agricultural effluents at the regional scale bloomfield et al 2006 futter et al 2009 li and merchant 2013 olesen et al 2007 sjoeng et al 2009 whitehead et al 2009 wilby et al 2006 darracq et al 2005 destouni and darracq 2009 park et al 2010 current literature lacks site scale hydrological studies that can guide sustainable remediation under changing climate conditions within risk and performance assessments as well as within regulatory frameworks this study aims at evaluating the effects of climate driven hydrological shifts on residual contaminants in vadose zones and groundwater under sustainable remediation we simulate groundwater flow and contaminant transport through unsaturated and saturated domains we assume that the effect of changing precipitation and temperature can be represented by perturbations shifts of natural recharge through the aquifer system the impacts are evaluated on the basis of different decision metrics relevant to public health risk regulatory compliance and site closure such as contaminant concentrations at monitoring wells and exports from site boundaries we demonstrate our approach at the department of energy doe s savannah river site srs f area seepage basins south carolina sc usa where soil and groundwater were contaminated by various metals and radioactive contaminants during the cold war era for brevity the f area seepage basins are referred to hereafter as just f area extensive subsurface characterization and dataset at the srs f area including hundreds of wells geophysics data and various hydrological tests enabled the development of a subsurface model that can be considered as a testbed for flow and transport studies flach 2004 bea et al 2013 sassen et al 2012 wainwright et al 2014 dai et al 2002 the srs hence provides a unique opportunity to investigate the potential consequences of climate change on residual contamination in realistic settings that display multiple representative features of other polluted sites 2 background 2 1 conceptual model we consider a general conceptual hydrological model of a contaminated site characterized by residual contamination in the vadose zone and groundwater fig 1 this model extends to the srs f area bea et al 2013 the description of which is provided in section 2 2 initially contaminants are discharged through a seepage basin located on the top of the model domain the contaminant plume migrates vertically through the vadose zone and laterally downgradient in the aquifer at some sites the plume reaches surface water bodies e g a creek or a river located close to the site boundary through water seepage in order to reduce contaminant migration through the vadose zone the contaminant source zone i e seepage basin is often capped with low permeability material such as clay or silt however residual contaminants located in the vadose zone could become a persistent contaminant source to the groundwater plume zachara et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 contaminant concentrations are typically measured at groundwater monitoring wells to ensure the plume stability and to meet the regulatory compliance the number of wells and frequency of sampling e g quarterly or annually are determined in agreement with a regulatory agency e g the epa concentrations are often compared to the maximum contaminant level mcl recommended by the epa predicting the time of exceedance of mcl for example is an important environmental performance metric epm to plan the site closure or site transfer denham and eddy dilek 2017 in parallel risk and or performance assessments consider a variety of metrics and pathways including contaminant mass flux export at control planes cps e g site boundaries creeks or rivers maxwell and kastenberg 1999 de barros and rubin 2008 de barros et al 2009 2012 atchley et al 2013 on site concentrations are often used to evaluate human health risk doses through direct ingestion drinking pathways while the export at cps are employed to quantify risk of the downgradient population the changes in precipitation and temperature associated with climate change are expected to affect contaminant plumes in groundwater systems and residual contaminants in the vadose zone in a complex manner this impact can be evaluated by considering a perturbation shift of the natural recharge through an aquifer in a long or short time frame o connell and hou 2015b for example an increase in precipitation results in higher aquifer recharge while a decrease in precipitation or higher temperature hence increased evapotranspiration leads to lower aquifer recharge higher recharge then 1 increases vadose zone flow which mobilizes sequestered contaminants 2 raises the groundwater table and increases hydraulic gradients resulting in enhanced plume mobility in groundwater and 3 enhances mixing of the plume with clean water which leads to higher dilution on the other hand a decrease of recharge has opposite effects i e decreases the plume mobility while reducing mixing and dilution the impact of climate change driven altered recharge rates on different decision and performance metrics relevant to environmental remediation could potentially create trade offs that should be quantitatively evaluated 2 2 f area site description the srs is located in south central south carolina usa approximately 100 mi i e 161 km away from the atlantic ocean and occupies an area of about 800 km2 the site was used to produce nuclear materials such as plutonium and tritium 3h for nuclear weapons during the cold war era the f area located in the north central part of the srs included three unlined discharge basins f 1 f 2 and f 3 bea et al 2013 the basins received approximately 7 1 billion liters of acidic low level radioactive waste solutions from processing irradiated uranium between 1955 and 1988 flach et al 2004 killian et al 1986 the waste solution presented various radionuclides such as uranium isotopes 90sr 129i and 99tc among which 3h is the largest dose contributor after the waste discharge operation was terminated in 1988 the f area basins were closed and capped with low permeability material bea et al 2013 currently an acidic contaminant plume extends from the basins approximately 600 m downgradient to the groundwater seepage near the fourmile branch bea et al 2013 enhanced natural attenuation is currently under way using a funnel and gate system which consists of groundwater flow barriers to decrease the groundwater gradient and base injection to neutralize ph and to immobilize uranium tokunaga et al 2012 hydrogeology at this site has been characterized extensively in many studies flach et al 2004 bea et al 2013 sassen et al 2012 wainwright et al 2014 there are three hydrostratigraphic units within the upper three runs aquifer an upper aquifer zone uutra a tan clay confining zone tccz and a lower aquifer zone lutra the uutra and lutra are mainly composed by clean sand while the tccz is a low permeable mixed sand and clay layer the piezometric head measurements indicate that the uutra and lutra units are hydrologically connected the bottom of the lutra consists of a competent clay layer confining unit the continuous gordon confining gc unit which separates the deeper aquifer gordon aquifer from the upper two units the historical monitoring data collected at the srs have shown that the contaminant plume migrates within the uutra and lutra sassen et al 2012 3 methodology 3 1 flow and transport simulations we employ the two dimensional 2d flow and transport model adopted in bea et al 2013 i e a 2d domain approximately 2600 m long and 100 m deep along the groundwater flow line passing through the middle of the f 3 basin of the srs this model has been calibrated and verified using site data bea et al 2013 fig 2 illustrates the 2d cross section model domain the model includes the vadose zone and three hydrostratigraphic units i e uutra lutra and tccz defined in section 2 2 we assume homogeneous average hydrogeological properties within each unit see table 1 whose values are compiled from available site investigation reports table 1 specifies porosity permeability and capillary pressure saturation data for the vadose zone flach et al 2004 phifer et al 2006 bea et al 2013 please refer to appendix a of bea et al 2013 for the parameters description the system is considered to be advective dominated therefore mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion transport processes are neglected we simulate simple 3h decay with a half life of 12 3 years no flow boundary conditions are assigned along the two vertical sides of the 2d cross section see fig 2 according to the groundwater divides flach 2004 bea et al 2013 an impervious flow boundary condition i e no flow is set at the bottom of the computational domain since the confining unit at this location is highly clayey and continuous bea et al 2013 groundwater flow and contaminant transport are simulated by means of the numerical code amanzi which describes coupled vadose zone and groundwater flow as well as reactive transport freshley et al 2012 bea et al 2013 wainwright et al 2015 2016 amanzi uses the mimetic finite difference method for the richards equation and dispersion operators which preserves fundamental mathematical and physical properties in discrete schemes da veiga et al 2014 to discretize the advection operator it uses monotone first order and second order muscl schemes with new limiters that improve accuracy on unstructured meshes lipnikov et al 2010 amanzi has been benchmarked against other flow and transport models as well as analytical solutions for a wide range of hydrological problems we perform numerical simulations within the time frame 1955 2100 i e from the beginning of the discharge operation at the srs our model is discretized into 164 160 cells and we adopt a longitudinal mesh spatial resolution of 1 25 m and a variable vertical spatial resolution with a maximum value of 2 m a steady state simulation is carried out to establish the groundwater table with a given recharge value at the top of the modeled domain of 4 74 10 6 mm s i e 150 mm yr before 1955 this value represents the estimated recharge based on the rainfall records and runoff estimations flach et al 2004 which is kept constant over the entire domain for all the simulation timeframe except for the discharge basin after 1955 we perform transient simulations employing a constant 3h discharge value at the seepage basin between 1955 and 1988 the average 3h concentration and mass discharge rate are respectively 2 17 10 9 mol kgw and around 1 11 10 4 mm s as in bea et al 2013 these values coincide with the average 3h concentration and discharge rate of historical data between 1955 and 1988 see table 8 of bea et al 2013 after the basin is capped in 1988 the recharge through the basin is assumed to be three order of magnitude lower than the value of the surrounding regions for all the simulations performed in our study these recharge values are identified as baseline recharge conditions in our study we model different recharge scenarios which present increased or decreased recharge values with respect to the baseline recharge conditions described above we analyze the impact of recharge shifts on different decision or performance metrics the temporal evolution of 3h concentration at the same two observation wells of bea et al 2013 shown in fig 2 1 the source zone uutra well fsb95d and 2 the downgradient uutra well fsb110d both wells span the upper aquifer please note that we computed the contaminant concentration by taking the average value of the concentration reported at a set of observation points equally spaced within a given well in the upper aquifer in addition we evaluate the 3h export at the cp to the fourmile branch creek see fig 2 which is the main risk pathway at this site the cp is defined at the seepage face indicated in fig 2 where the groundwater flow reaches the surface the concentrations are compared with the epa s mcl for 3h although the mcl criteria is not used for compliance purposes at the srs it has been used to evaluate the timeframe for the site closure and transfer denham and eddy dilek 2017 3 2 modeling scenarios previous studies on the srs have reported an overall trend towards greater rainfall in the region faybishenko et al 2018 according to the national climate assessment south carolina is expected to see precipitation increases of 10 20 by 2100 see fig 7 5 in easterling et al 2017 as well as more extreme precipitation event by up to two folds see fig 7 6 in easterling et al 2017 even if the amount of precipitation is not necessarily equal to the recharge we assume that we can investigate the impact of climate change by simulating a range of different recharge values the range would also account for the uncertainty associated with the climate projections we mainly focus on increased natural recharge conditions although for completeness we also investigate the impact of reduced recharge fig 3 provides an illustration of the recharge scenarios simulated in our analysis we consider a baseline recharge denoted as r b and indicated by the black line in fig 3 to study the effect of climate change induced increased decreased recharge on contaminant transport we define ϵ to be a perturbation from the baseline recharge and r p to identify the perturbed recharge we develop four perturbed recharge scenarios with respect to the baseline recharge conditions corresponding to ϵ 0 described in the section 3 1 the recharge perturbation starts at a certain time set to year 2020 and is illustrated with a specific colour for each scenario in fig 3 in the following we provide a detailed description of the scenarios and of the values adopted for ϵ and we employ t to indicate year 2020 3 2 1 constant positive recharge shift the recharge conditions of the first scenario portrayed in green from year 2020 in fig 3 are illustrated through the following equation 1 r p t r b if t t r b 1 ϵ if t t through this scenario we simulate a constant positive shift i e an increase of recharge from 2020 until the end of the simulation set to year 2100 the perturbation ϵ assumes the following range of values ϵ 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 we therefore simulate a recharge increase of 10 to 50 compared to baseline recharge conditions 3 2 2 constant negative recharge shift by the same token the second scenario blue line from year 2020 in fig 3 is illustarted through the following equation 2 r p t r b if t t r b 1 ϵ if t t this scenario is characterized by a constant negative shift of recharge i e a decrease of 10 to 50 ϵ 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 from eq 2 within the timeframe 2020 2100 3 2 3 one year extreme recharge the third scenario magenta line from 2020 in fig 3 is described by 3 r p t r b if t t r b 1 ϵ if t t t 1 this scenario considers a significant increase of recharge within year 2020 mimicking an extreme precipitation event of a factor of 1 5 2 5 and 10 folds compared to baseline conditions the range of perturbation values of this third scenario according to eq 3 are then ϵ 0 5 1 4 9 3 2 4 cap failure and constant positive recharge shift the cap failure is also evaluated in conjunction with the natural recharge shift although low permeability material is used for capping the f area basins increased vegetation or other mechanisms could threaten the integrity of the source zone capping structure worthy et al 2013a 2013b 2015 in the fourth scenario we assume that the cap will fail at the same time of the recharge increase i e in year 2020 note that the assumption of cap failure in 2020 is solely for the purpose of the modeling exercise and not a prediction of actual cap failure the perturbed recharge conditions of this scenario are then the same of the first scenario i e 4 r p t r b if t t r b 1 ϵ if t t the cap failure is represented by increased source zone recharge to the level of the surrounding region therefore we hypothesize a complete failure of the containment structure although such a sudden failure is unlikely to happen we assume instant failure to evaluate the most extreme case the fourth scenario simulates the failure of the capping structure in arbitrarily assumed year 2020 under baseline recharge conditions and under the increased recharge conditions of the first scenario characterized by ϵ 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 from 2020 to 2100 in reality such precipitation recharge changes are expected to occur gradually or randomly rather than through the step change assumed in this analysis however such simple representations would facilitate our fundamental understanding of various complex impacts of climatic changes on contaminant concentrations and exports for the conditions explored in this study fig 3 we expect that the changes in the recharge rates as described in the scenarios above will impact the concentration breakthrough curves btcs by local dilution as well as by affecting the rate at which the contaminant mass is released from the vadose zone to the groundwater system fig 4 schematically pictures the contaminant btc under baseline conditions and perturbed recharge conditions we expect that increased recharge relative to the baseline values causes a slight dilution phase i in fig 4 followed by a rebound effect in the concentration btc phase ii in fig 4 due to the mobilization of the solute mass located in proximity of the source fig 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal dynamics of the contaminant plume prior to investigating the effects of recharge on transport observables at specific wells and at the cp we provide snapshots of the simulated contaminant plume in the coupled vadose zone groundwater system fig 5 for the baseline case fig 5 shows the plume migration at different years namely 1961 fig 5b 1988 fig 5c 2000 fig 5d and 2033 fig 5e as observed in bea et al 2013 the contaminant plume first moves downward in the vadose zone and then spreads laterally below the groundwater table fig 5b during the operation most of the plume migrates within the upper aquifer although a part of the plume penetrates the tccz and reaches the lower aquifer fig 5c after the operation ends the clean water front arrives from upstream and pushes the plume downgradient fig 5d the contaminant plume displays a stratified distribution since the residual contaminants in the vadose zone constitute a persistent contamination source and the low permeability tccz becomes a secondary source as displayed in fig 5e in year 2033 the vadose zone and tccz continue to be the residual contaminant sources 4 2 contaminant concentration and export btcs we first compare the temporal evolution of the 3h concentrations mol kgw 1 at the observation wells and of the 3h export mol y 1 at the cp among different recharge scenarios figs 6 9 for 0 100 years forward from the assumed recharge perturbations and cap failure i e within the timeframe 2020 2100 under baseline recharge conditions indiated by ϵ 0 in figs 6 9 3h concentrations and export generally decrease within the timeframe 2020 2100 given that the peak concentration and export occur closer to the contaminant discharge operation timeframe 1955 1988 i e before year 2020 when the positive constant shift of recharge occurs fig 6 the concentration initially decreases for approximately 2 10 years at the source zone well fig 6a and for around 5 20 years at the downgradient well fig 6b this slight decrease of concentration is an outcome of dilution attributed to the presence of more water in the system which enhances the mixing of the plume with clean water we then observe a rebound in the concentrations due to the additional recharge during which the concentration increases with respect to the concentration btc obtained for the baseline case ϵ 0 this is attributed to the fact that the residual contaminants in the vadose zone are mobilized under higher recharge as a consequence more solute mass reaches the wells and the cp the concentration increase during the rebound phase is more pronounced at the source zone well fig 6a than at the downgradient well fig 6b given that the latter is located further away from the source zone and consequently less influenced by the mobilization of residual 3h these results are in agreement with previous theoretical analysis which showed that near source locations are more sensitive to changes in the solute mass release at the source zone de barros 2018 by comparing the effects of different magnitudes of recharge shifts on well concentrations we notice that a recharge increase characterized by ϵ 0 1 does not influence the concentration btc significantly on the other hand fig 6a and b show that for larger recharge the timing of the rebound effect happens before and the corresponding peak concentration is higher i e see concentration btcs within the range ϵ 0 2 0 5 we also point out that the concentration decrease after the peak is generally more rapid as ϵ increases see btcs produced by ϵ 0 4 0 5 in fig 6a b indeed under higher recharge a bigger part of the residual 3h is mobilized and flushed out of the aquifer system earlier in time the export on the other hand slightly tends to increase but does not change significantly even under the maximum increase of recharge indicated by ϵ 0 5 fig 6c the minor effects on the export are attributed to the fact that the export is an integrated measure that incorporates the upwelling groundwater from the lower aquifer which is less affected by the recharge changes decreased recharge fig 7 produces minor effects on well concentrations compared to increased recharge compare fig 6a b to fig 7a b lower recharge causes a small increase in the concentration for around 5 20 years at the source zone well fig 7a and for approximately 10 20 years at the downgradient well fig 7b fig 7a depicts a higher peak concentration as ϵ increases this effect takes place because a lower amount of water in the system decreases the dilution potential of the aquifer hence leading to an increase the concentration the differences between the concentration btcs obtained for different ϵ values at both observation wells in fig 7a b are less visible than in fig 6a b we observe that increased recharge has a larger impact on the source zone well fig 7a than on the downgradient well fig 7b whereas decreased recharge causes more uniform effects between the two observation wells this is because the mobilization of 3h caused by increased recharge has more impact closer to the source fig 7a whereas the decrease of dilution emerging from decreased recharge and resulting in higher concentration fig 7a b has a more uniform effect on the aquifer system finally minor effects are displayed on the export fig 7c as noted also for increased recharge conditions see fig 6c however we notice that the 3h export tends to slightly decrease under negative recharge shifts given that less residual 3h is mobilized from the vadose zone we next observe the outcomes of the third scenario i e the one year extreme recharge event in fig 8 one year of extreme recharge significantly increases the well concentrations during the rebound phase over an extended period of time i e for around 10 20 years fig 8a b we then observe that a short extreme event could affect the well concentrations for several decades at the source zone well fig 8a prior to the rebound phase the concentration decreases slightly after the perturbation event in 2020 due to dilution particularly under the most extreme scenario indicated by ϵ 9 on the other hand at the downgradient well fig 8b the concentration decrease due to dilution is more pronounced given that the plume has traveled a longer distance five to ten years after the initial dilution the concentration increases during the rebound phase the extreme one year precipitation indicated by ϵ 0 5 does not significantly affect the concentrations especially at the downgradient well where even the recharge scenario characterized by ϵ 1 does not produce significant changes when compared to baseline conditions ϵ 0 we also observe that higher recharge shifts produce higher peak concentrations in the rebound phase due to the mobilization of the solute mass at the source zone fig 8a b as well as higher initial dilution the effect of recharge changes on the export fig 7c is minor compared to the influence on the concentrations in the wells fig 8a b although we observe a peak of the export around 2020 when ϵ 9 fig 9 reports the results obtained for the scenario characterized by the failure of the capping structure under baseline conditions and constant positive recharge shifts starting in 2020 fig 9 shows that the concentration increase at the wells is significantly larger than the increase observed for undamaged source zone capping conditions the concentration rebound happens after 5 8 years at the source zone well fig 9a and after 10 15 years at the downgradient wells fig 9b the export at the cp also shows a visible increase after around 2035 fig 9c this is due to the fact that under higher recharge and no capping structure the bulk of residual contaminants in the vadose zone migrate to the groundwater system we notice that the increase of concentration export happens earlier in time at the well closer to the contaminant source zone later at the downgradient well and even further when considering the export at the cp located at the right boundary of the domain moreover as the recharge value increases from ϵ 0 1 to ϵ 0 5 the peak concentration export caused by the additional recharge becomes higher and occurs earlier in time see fig 9 the inset log scale plot of fig 9a shows that the extreme concentration increase resulting from the cap failure is followed by a rapid decrease of the concentration as the 3h plume is flushed out of the system earlier when the capping structure fails moving the contamination problem downgradient this effect is amplified as ϵ increases the same observations apply to the downgradient well and to the export see inset log scale plot of fig 9b c we finally notice that the difference between the btcs given by different ϵ values is more pronounced when we assume that the cap fails fig 9 the results of an additional recharge scenario characterized by a range of positive recharge shifts within a timeframe shorter than a year is presented in the supplementary material these outcomes confirm that our findings also apply to a smaller time scale of hydrological shift 4 3 impact of recharge perturbations on key environmental performance metrics we quantify the impact of climate change driven recharge shifts on key epms e g peak contaminant concentration early and late arrival times time of exceedance of mcl given that the recharge shifts considered in our study start from year 2020 after the discharge operation at the srs f area terminated i e during a contaminant concentration export descending tailing phase we do not consider the peak concentration but we analyze the maximum change on the concentration and export btcs induced by the recharge perturbations moreover we investigate the effect of recharge shifts on the time of exceedance of the mcl for 3h 4 3 1 maximum difference between baseline and perturbed btcs we identify the maximum normalized difference between the contaminant concentration or export btc obtained under baseline and perturbed recharge conditions as 5 γ c 1 c b t d max max t c b t c p t 100 where c b t and c p t in 5 are the contaminant concentration mol kgw 1 or contaminant export mol y 1 of the baseline subscript b and the perturbed subscript p recharge scenarios respectively whereas c b t d max is the baseline concentration or export taken at the time where the difference between baseline and perturbed btcs is maximum the metric γ c 5 is plotted in fig 10 as a function of the recharge perturbation ϵ whose values are described in section 3 2 note that from 5 γ c 0 for the baseline scenario indicated by ϵ 0 we recall that only a limited range of recharge perturbations were simulated in our analysis therefore the comments below are based on a linear interpolation between γ c and the analyzed ϵ values when the recharge is positively shifted by a constant value fig 10a the relative change in the well concentrations quantified by γ c 5 exhibit a non linear or step function response to the perturbation ϵ as shown in fig 10a γ c at the source zone well drastically increases from around 10 to almost 120 when the recharge perturbation ϵ changes from 0 1 to 0 2 while γ c at the downgradient well is highly impacted it changes from approximately 20 to 100 when ϵ goes from 0 3 to 0 4 the changes are smaller during the other recharge shifts intervals our results suggest the presence of a threshold or trigger level of recharge above which the well concentrations are significantly affected this trigger level is lower at the source zone well than at the downgradient well a recharge corresponding to ϵ 0 1 could represent this threshold at wells closer to the source zone while a higher trigger level of recharge approximately identified by ϵ 0 3 is identified downgradient the export on the other hand increases in a quasi linear manner with the recharge perturbation fig 10a as shown in the concentration time series see fig 6c the effect of recharge shifts on the export is significantly smaller compared to that on the well concentrations indeed a recharge shift corresponding to ϵ 0 5 results in a value of γ c of approximately 20 when observing the cp export while a recharge shift given by ϵ 0 5 produces values of γ c of approximately 80 100 at the observation wells fig 10b shows the γ c ϵ relationship for the negative recharge shift scenario decreasing the recharge rate generally has a smaller impact on γ c with respect to increased recharge conditions compare the values of γ c in fig 10a and b according to the results in fig 7 we identify non linear responses and trigger levels of recharge perturbation at the downgradient well and at the cp the trigger levels are very small at the downgradient well e g less than ϵ 0 1 and higher for the export i e ϵ 0 2 the maximum difference between the baseline case and the perturbed btc computed via eq 5 is larger at the downgradient well than at the source zone well see fig 10b this is different than what was observed from the results of the positive shift scenario when comparing fig 10a and b we observe that under positive shifts of recharge fig 10a γ c evaluated at the source zone is more sensitive to smaller ϵ values in other terms we could say that the source zone well responds first to the perturbation ϵ this is because the source zone well is more impacted by the mobilization of 3 h given its proximity to the source however when the recharge decreases fig 10b changes in γ c are more prominent at the downgradient well for smaller perturbations ϵ i e the downgradient well responds first than the source zone well indeed the changes in the concentration are more uniform between the source zone well and the downgradient well compare fig 7a and b under lower recharge because they happen due to the concentration or less dilution as opposed to the mobilization of contaminants moreover these changes take place at a later time downgradient when the baseline concentration is smaller resulting in higher γ c downgradient under the extreme one year recharge scenario fig 10c the trigger level is larger around ϵ 1 when compared to the results obtained for the constant positive recharge shift scenario at both observation wells compare fig 10a and c we observe that the γ c ϵ relationship is quite similar for the two observation wells until ϵ 4 however when ϵ 9 the recharge increase impact at the downgradient well becomes quite significant in quantitative terms this impact is approximately two times that at the source zone well compare red and blue lines in fig 10c finally the impact of the extreme event on the contaminant export is quite limited and increases linearly with the perturbation ϵ fig 10c however a significant increase of the export is detected for the most extreme one year precipitation event investigated in this study i e when ϵ 9 γ c equals 65 the cap failure scenario fig 10d also shows a non linear response when evaluating the sensitivities of the wells concentrations and the export to the perturbation ϵ we observe an extreme increase of γ c caused by the signification mobilization of the residual contaminants entrapped in the vadose zone when the capping structure fails confirming the importance of the latter containment system successive increases of recharge do not significantly affect the value of γ c i e γ c reaches a plateau under capping failure conditions the almost constant value of γ c is generally higher at the source zone well than at the donwgradient well and at the cp our analysis then suggests that the failure of the capping can be identified as a trigger situation after which major changes in both well concentrations and on the export are expected 4 3 2 difference of time above mcl between baseline and perturbed btcs in this section we identify the metric γ t as the normalized difference of the time of exceedance of the mcl for 3 h between the baseline recharge scenario and the perturbed recharge scenarios as 6 γ t 1 t c b t mcl t c b t mcl t c p t mcl 100 with t c b t mcl and t c p t mcl respectively being the time d during which the contaminant concentration exceeds the epa s mcl for 3 h for the baseline subscript b and the perturbed subscript p recharge scenarios as before the metric γ t 6 expressed in percentage is plotted as a function of ϵ for each recharge scenario in fig 11 and from 6 γ t 0 for the baseline scenario i e when ϵ 0 similarly to before our observations are based on a linear interpolation between γ t and the range of ϵ values considered under the positive shift of recharge scenario fig 11a γ t shows a non linear response to the recharge perturbation ϵ at the source zone well in red in this case γ t increases until its maximum value under a perturbation ϵ 0 2 and ϵ 0 3 but decreases afterwards we then notice that the intermediate values of ϵ produce the highest influence on the timeframe of mcl exceedance as compared to the highest values of ϵ indeed positive recharge shifts initially dilute the plume in the tailing phase and increase the 3h mobilization leading to an increase of the concentration during the rebound phase but afterwards flush the plume out of the system i e at a later stage the 3h concentration values reach the 3h mcl faster see btcs characterized by ϵ 0 4 0 5 in fig 6a the higher the recharge the higher is the concentration rebound peak and the faster the plume is flushed out of the aquifer therefore the maximum increase of the time above mcl is produced by intermediate value of recharge for example given by ϵ 0 2 0 3 on the other hand γ t 6 increases almost linearly with the permanent positive recharge perturbation at the downgradient well in blue but the maximum change of γ t 6 with respect to the baseline recharge scenario is only around 15 decreased recharge fig 11b also results in a non linear response of γ t to ϵ compared to the positive recharge shift scenario in which the source zone well responds first fig 11a when the recharge is negatively shifted fig 11b the downgradient well responds first a decrease of the natural recharge does not significantly influence the time when the 3h concentration exceeds mcl at the source zone well in red given that the minor concentration increase takes place when the baseline concentration exceeds the mcl however we identify the value of ϵ 0 2 as the trigger level of recharge decrease after which the time above mcl is significantly affected at the downgradient well in blue the remaining recharge steps produce less significant changes at the downgradient well one year of extreme recharge produces relatively smaller changes in the time above mcl as compared to the effect of permanent shifts of recharge when ϵ 1 compare fig 11c with fig 11a this scenario does not influence much the time of mcl exceedance at the source zone well in red where a maximum γ t around 20 is identified when ϵ 4 nevertheless the response at the downgradient well also non linear shows a trigger level represented by ϵ 1 above which the time of exceedance of mcl is highly impacted this significant impact takes place because the increase of concentration downgradient which results in values above the 3h mcl happens later in time compared to the upgradient well when the baseline concentration is already below the mcl when the capping structure fails fig 11d we notice that γ t reaches the maximum value at both wells similarly to what observed when looking at the γ c ϵ results the value of γ t then decreases at both wells when the recharge increases in the presence of no cap this decrease is almost linear at the source zone well in the overall we observe that the capping failure is identified as a trigger condition which causes an important increase of both epms as quantified by γ c and γ t therefore a substantial risk increase when comparing the results in figs 10 and 11 we understand that different recharge s thresholds trigger levels are identified depending on the metric of interest for environmental remediation for instance the maximum concentration export btc s change or the time of exceedance of mcl s change caused by the recharge perturbations the location of the observation location and the measured variable e g contaminant concentration or contaminant export 5 summary and conclusions in this paper we investigate the impact of climate change driven aquifer s recharge shifts on residual contaminants in soil and groundwater subject to sustainable remediation for the sake of simplicity we assume that the changes in precipitation and temperature can be translated into changes of the natural aquifer s recharge we establish the evaluation methodology including the development of potential future scenarios on the basis of national climate assessments site specific model developments and evaluation criteria we illustrate four scenarios characterized by a range of variable recharge values 1 constant positive recharge shift after a certain year 2 constant negative recharge shift after a certain year 3 one year of extreme recharge 4 cap failure and constant positive recharge shift our methodology is demonstrated by simulating the 3h plume migration within the us doe s nuclear reservation savannah river site f area we employ the unsaturated saturated flow model amanzi calibrated and verified using site data in summary our results generally show that changes of the recharge regime even small can significantly affect contaminant concentrations the most noticeable outcome is the concentration rebound effect taking place after an initial slight dilution under higher recharge and or capping failure conditions which is given by the mobilization of the contaminant mass from the source zone and its transfer to the aquifer system the concentration rebound effect is more pronounced and happens earlier as the recharge perturbation increases decreased recharge conditions could also cause a small concentration increase attributed to a decrease in the dilution potential of the aquifer on the other hand the 3h export at the cp is only minimally influenced by recharge shifts except for some extreme recharge scenarios trigger levels of recharge which highly impact the concentration btc at the wells are identified these threshold trigger levels depend on the observation location and on the epm under investigation quantified through γ c and γ t the latter display a non linear response to the perturbation ϵ for example it is interesting to observe that the most significant influence on the time of exceedance of mcl under positive recharge shifts i e first scenario is identified under recharge values in the middle of the range considered given that higher ϵ values cause a steeper decrease of the concentration after the rebound phase i e the concentration reaches the mcl faster our results suggest that close monitoring of wells concentrations should be adopted during precipitation connected to higher aquifers recharge and drought connected to lower aquifers recharge periods however the actual risk of the downgradient population as quantified through the export could be under control even when the well concentrations are remarkably impacted our findings constitute then immediate contribution to guide groundwater monitoring in the presence of increased climatic variabilities particularly in explaining concentration anomalies for example without a proper understanding the concentration increase due to higher or lower recharge could be mistaken for instance attributed to additional leaks or contaminant sources in addition our analysis indicates that source zone wells are critical to early detect mobilized residual contaminants under increased recharge or cap failure conditions it would be advantageous to have more frequent sampling or in situ monitoring in the proximity of the contaminant source zones as an early warning system schmidt et al 2018 aside from monitoring the contaminant concentration characterizing the hydraulic fluxes in the vicinity of the source zone can also aid in understanding the macro dispersive behavior of the plume and corresponding risks to the environment and public health de barros and nowak 2010 henri et al 2016 our work also emphasizes the importance of properly maintaining the capping structure not only to sequester residual contaminants but also to reduce the uncertainty associated with climate variability in fact the difference among recharge scenarios is smaller when the cap is undamaged we finally highlight that currently simplified models adopting conservative assumptions are often used for performance and risk assessments at contaminated sites conservative approaches usually assume the worst case scenario associated with higher recharge rates or higher permeability values to increase the plume mobility the modeling scenarios investigated in this work however call into question the appropriateness of such conservative approaches in fact the non trivial trade offs arising from the interplay between dilution and contaminants mobilization require the use of more realistic and accurate flow and transport simulations achieved through proper calibration processes as well as probabilistic risk assessments maxwell et al 2008 de barros and rubin 2008 siirila and maxwell 2012 atchley et al 2013 libera et al 2017 overall the trade offs identified in our work must be evaluated with respect to the specific time location and performance metric under investigation understanding these trade offs would enable better allocation of available resources towards reducing uncertainty in decision making de barros et al 2009 2012 our work could be expanded by considering a more complex geochemistry setting as well as surface water processes e g evapotranspiration and land model components e g vegetation of the srs f area additionally this study would benefit from an inclusion of different conceptualization of the aquifer s heterogeneous properties together with remediation strategies located at the site e g pump and treat funnel and gate systems in particular the effect of geological heterogeneity should be explored in more detail given that it can significantly augment contaminant plume mixing rates de barros et al 2015 acknowledgements this material is based upon work supported as part of the ascem project which

1559,this study investigates the potential impact of climate change on residual contaminants in vadose zones and groundwater we assume that the effect of climate changes can be represented by perturbations in the natural recharge through the aquifer system we perform numerical modeling of unsaturated saturated flow and transport and consider different performance metrics contaminant concentrations at observation wells and contaminant export at the site s boundary we evaluate the effect of increasing and decreasing recharge as well as the impact of potential failure of surface capping structures employed to immobilize vadose zone contaminants our approach is demonstrated in a real case study by simulating transport of non reactive radioactive tritium at the u s department of energy s savannah river site results show that recharge changes significantly affect well concentrations after an initial slight dilution we identify a significant concentration increase at different observation wells some years after the recharge increase and or the cap failure as a consequence of contaminants mobilization this effect is generally emphasized and occurs earlier as the recharge increases under decreased aquifers recharge the concentration could slightly increase for some years due to a decrease of dilution depending on the magnitude of the negative recharge shift we identify trigger levels of recharge above which the concentration export breakthrough curves and the time of exceedance of the maximum contaminant level for tritium are remarkably affected moreover we observe that the contaminant export at the control plane identified as the risk pathway to the downgradient population may only be minimally affected by shifts in the natural recharge regime except for some extreme cases we conclude that more frequent sampling and in situ monitoring near the source zone should be adopted to better explain concentrations anomalies under changing climatic conditions moreover the maintenance of the cap is critical not only to sequester residual contaminants in the vadose zone but also to reduce the uncertainty associated with future precipitation changes finally realistic flow and transport simulations achieved through proper calibration processes rather than conservative modeling should be adopted to identify non trivial trade offs which enable better allocation of resources towards reducing uncertainty in decision making 1 introduction subsurface contamination is recognized as a critical issue in many communities there are more than a thousand superfund sites in the u s categorized under the u s environmental protection agency epa which present large plumes of organic solvents heavy metals and radionuclides us environmental protection agency https www epa gov superfund in addition the epa estimated the presence of more than 450 000 brownfields in the u s contaminated by hazardous substances pollutants or contaminants us environmental protection agency https www epa gov brownfields the practice of soil and groundwater remediation has been changing in recent decades transitioning from intense soil removal and active treatment solutions towards passive remediation techniques such as enhanced biodegradation or monitored natural attenuation ellis and hadley 2009 the latter less intensive remediation approaches often identified as sustainable remediation techniques have been recognized as more advantageous since they can reduce negative side effects that often accompany intensive remediation e g ecological disturbance construction noise traffic intensive energy use and emissions of greenhouse gases additionally sustainable remediation is coupled with more innovative and attractive end use scenarios with restricted subsurface use and longer institutional control in most cases a portion of contaminants are sequestered in the subsurface for a long period of time while natural or enhanced biogeochemical processes occur to reduce contaminant concentrations within this context it is critical to assess the long term stability of residual contaminants subject to sustainable remediation practices and to ensure that the latter will not pose significant environmental and human health risk recently o connell and hou 2015a raised the concern that climate change may pose a major risk in environmental remediation especially with regard to the fate of residual contaminants under sustainable remediation a hydrological shift has been identified as one of the key drivers influencing such risk and uncertainty in changing climate precipitation regimes including amount and timing are expected to change significantly and extreme events such as heavy rains and prolonged droughts could become more frequent climate models also predict increasing temperatures which would affect water budgets and reduce infiltration due to increased evapotranspiration these climatic changes are occurring while groundwater is becoming increasingly important for drinking and irrigation purposes famiglietti 2014 despite the critical need to evaluate risks associated with climate change there is only a limited number of studies that address the effects of climate change on contaminant transport and environmental remediation while the impact of climate change has been investigated extensively from the perspective of water resources gellens and roulin 1998 green et al 2011 middelkoop et al 2001 pfister et al 2004 a limited number of studies have addressed water quality issues visser et al 2012 moreover most literature focuses on surface water wilby et al 2006 van vliet and zwolsman 2008 van bokhoven 2006 futter et al 2009 schiedek et al 2007 due to its visibility and accessibility green et al 2011 while the studies on groundwater are mostly focused on agricultural effluents at the regional scale bloomfield et al 2006 futter et al 2009 li and merchant 2013 olesen et al 2007 sjoeng et al 2009 whitehead et al 2009 wilby et al 2006 darracq et al 2005 destouni and darracq 2009 park et al 2010 current literature lacks site scale hydrological studies that can guide sustainable remediation under changing climate conditions within risk and performance assessments as well as within regulatory frameworks this study aims at evaluating the effects of climate driven hydrological shifts on residual contaminants in vadose zones and groundwater under sustainable remediation we simulate groundwater flow and contaminant transport through unsaturated and saturated domains we assume that the effect of changing precipitation and temperature can be represented by perturbations shifts of natural recharge through the aquifer system the impacts are evaluated on the basis of different decision metrics relevant to public health risk regulatory compliance and site closure such as contaminant concentrations at monitoring wells and exports from site boundaries we demonstrate our approach at the department of energy doe s savannah river site srs f area seepage basins south carolina sc usa where soil and groundwater were contaminated by various metals and radioactive contaminants during the cold war era for brevity the f area seepage basins are referred to hereafter as just f area extensive subsurface characterization and dataset at the srs f area including hundreds of wells geophysics data and various hydrological tests enabled the development of a subsurface model that can be considered as a testbed for flow and transport studies flach 2004 bea et al 2013 sassen et al 2012 wainwright et al 2014 dai et al 2002 the srs hence provides a unique opportunity to investigate the potential consequences of climate change on residual contamination in realistic settings that display multiple representative features of other polluted sites 2 background 2 1 conceptual model we consider a general conceptual hydrological model of a contaminated site characterized by residual contamination in the vadose zone and groundwater fig 1 this model extends to the srs f area bea et al 2013 the description of which is provided in section 2 2 initially contaminants are discharged through a seepage basin located on the top of the model domain the contaminant plume migrates vertically through the vadose zone and laterally downgradient in the aquifer at some sites the plume reaches surface water bodies e g a creek or a river located close to the site boundary through water seepage in order to reduce contaminant migration through the vadose zone the contaminant source zone i e seepage basin is often capped with low permeability material such as clay or silt however residual contaminants located in the vadose zone could become a persistent contaminant source to the groundwater plume zachara et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 contaminant concentrations are typically measured at groundwater monitoring wells to ensure the plume stability and to meet the regulatory compliance the number of wells and frequency of sampling e g quarterly or annually are determined in agreement with a regulatory agency e g the epa concentrations are often compared to the maximum contaminant level mcl recommended by the epa predicting the time of exceedance of mcl for example is an important environmental performance metric epm to plan the site closure or site transfer denham and eddy dilek 2017 in parallel risk and or performance assessments consider a variety of metrics and pathways including contaminant mass flux export at control planes cps e g site boundaries creeks or rivers maxwell and kastenberg 1999 de barros and rubin 2008 de barros et al 2009 2012 atchley et al 2013 on site concentrations are often used to evaluate human health risk doses through direct ingestion drinking pathways while the export at cps are employed to quantify risk of the downgradient population the changes in precipitation and temperature associated with climate change are expected to affect contaminant plumes in groundwater systems and residual contaminants in the vadose zone in a complex manner this impact can be evaluated by considering a perturbation shift of the natural recharge through an aquifer in a long or short time frame o connell and hou 2015b for example an increase in precipitation results in higher aquifer recharge while a decrease in precipitation or higher temperature hence increased evapotranspiration leads to lower aquifer recharge higher recharge then 1 increases vadose zone flow which mobilizes sequestered contaminants 2 raises the groundwater table and increases hydraulic gradients resulting in enhanced plume mobility in groundwater and 3 enhances mixing of the plume with clean water which leads to higher dilution on the other hand a decrease of recharge has opposite effects i e decreases the plume mobility while reducing mixing and dilution the impact of climate change driven altered recharge rates on different decision and performance metrics relevant to environmental remediation could potentially create trade offs that should be quantitatively evaluated 2 2 f area site description the srs is located in south central south carolina usa approximately 100 mi i e 161 km away from the atlantic ocean and occupies an area of about 800 km2 the site was used to produce nuclear materials such as plutonium and tritium 3h for nuclear weapons during the cold war era the f area located in the north central part of the srs included three unlined discharge basins f 1 f 2 and f 3 bea et al 2013 the basins received approximately 7 1 billion liters of acidic low level radioactive waste solutions from processing irradiated uranium between 1955 and 1988 flach et al 2004 killian et al 1986 the waste solution presented various radionuclides such as uranium isotopes 90sr 129i and 99tc among which 3h is the largest dose contributor after the waste discharge operation was terminated in 1988 the f area basins were closed and capped with low permeability material bea et al 2013 currently an acidic contaminant plume extends from the basins approximately 600 m downgradient to the groundwater seepage near the fourmile branch bea et al 2013 enhanced natural attenuation is currently under way using a funnel and gate system which consists of groundwater flow barriers to decrease the groundwater gradient and base injection to neutralize ph and to immobilize uranium tokunaga et al 2012 hydrogeology at this site has been characterized extensively in many studies flach et al 2004 bea et al 2013 sassen et al 2012 wainwright et al 2014 there are three hydrostratigraphic units within the upper three runs aquifer an upper aquifer zone uutra a tan clay confining zone tccz and a lower aquifer zone lutra the uutra and lutra are mainly composed by clean sand while the tccz is a low permeable mixed sand and clay layer the piezometric head measurements indicate that the uutra and lutra units are hydrologically connected the bottom of the lutra consists of a competent clay layer confining unit the continuous gordon confining gc unit which separates the deeper aquifer gordon aquifer from the upper two units the historical monitoring data collected at the srs have shown that the contaminant plume migrates within the uutra and lutra sassen et al 2012 3 methodology 3 1 flow and transport simulations we employ the two dimensional 2d flow and transport model adopted in bea et al 2013 i e a 2d domain approximately 2600 m long and 100 m deep along the groundwater flow line passing through the middle of the f 3 basin of the srs this model has been calibrated and verified using site data bea et al 2013 fig 2 illustrates the 2d cross section model domain the model includes the vadose zone and three hydrostratigraphic units i e uutra lutra and tccz defined in section 2 2 we assume homogeneous average hydrogeological properties within each unit see table 1 whose values are compiled from available site investigation reports table 1 specifies porosity permeability and capillary pressure saturation data for the vadose zone flach et al 2004 phifer et al 2006 bea et al 2013 please refer to appendix a of bea et al 2013 for the parameters description the system is considered to be advective dominated therefore mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion transport processes are neglected we simulate simple 3h decay with a half life of 12 3 years no flow boundary conditions are assigned along the two vertical sides of the 2d cross section see fig 2 according to the groundwater divides flach 2004 bea et al 2013 an impervious flow boundary condition i e no flow is set at the bottom of the computational domain since the confining unit at this location is highly clayey and continuous bea et al 2013 groundwater flow and contaminant transport are simulated by means of the numerical code amanzi which describes coupled vadose zone and groundwater flow as well as reactive transport freshley et al 2012 bea et al 2013 wainwright et al 2015 2016 amanzi uses the mimetic finite difference method for the richards equation and dispersion operators which preserves fundamental mathematical and physical properties in discrete schemes da veiga et al 2014 to discretize the advection operator it uses monotone first order and second order muscl schemes with new limiters that improve accuracy on unstructured meshes lipnikov et al 2010 amanzi has been benchmarked against other flow and transport models as well as analytical solutions for a wide range of hydrological problems we perform numerical simulations within the time frame 1955 2100 i e from the beginning of the discharge operation at the srs our model is discretized into 164 160 cells and we adopt a longitudinal mesh spatial resolution of 1 25 m and a variable vertical spatial resolution with a maximum value of 2 m a steady state simulation is carried out to establish the groundwater table with a given recharge value at the top of the modeled domain of 4 74 10 6 mm s i e 150 mm yr before 1955 this value represents the estimated recharge based on the rainfall records and runoff estimations flach et al 2004 which is kept constant over the entire domain for all the simulation timeframe except for the discharge basin after 1955 we perform transient simulations employing a constant 3h discharge value at the seepage basin between 1955 and 1988 the average 3h concentration and mass discharge rate are respectively 2 17 10 9 mol kgw and around 1 11 10 4 mm s as in bea et al 2013 these values coincide with the average 3h concentration and discharge rate of historical data between 1955 and 1988 see table 8 of bea et al 2013 after the basin is capped in 1988 the recharge through the basin is assumed to be three order of magnitude lower than the value of the surrounding regions for all the simulations performed in our study these recharge values are identified as baseline recharge conditions in our study we model different recharge scenarios which present increased or decreased recharge values with respect to the baseline recharge conditions described above we analyze the impact of recharge shifts on different decision or performance metrics the temporal evolution of 3h concentration at the same two observation wells of bea et al 2013 shown in fig 2 1 the source zone uutra well fsb95d and 2 the downgradient uutra well fsb110d both wells span the upper aquifer please note that we computed the contaminant concentration by taking the average value of the concentration reported at a set of observation points equally spaced within a given well in the upper aquifer in addition we evaluate the 3h export at the cp to the fourmile branch creek see fig 2 which is the main risk pathway at this site the cp is defined at the seepage face indicated in fig 2 where the groundwater flow reaches the surface the concentrations are compared with the epa s mcl for 3h although the mcl criteria is not used for compliance purposes at the srs it has been used to evaluate the timeframe for the site closure and transfer denham and eddy dilek 2017 3 2 modeling scenarios previous studies on the srs have reported an overall trend towards greater rainfall in the region faybishenko et al 2018 according to the national climate assessment south carolina is expected to see precipitation increases of 10 20 by 2100 see fig 7 5 in easterling et al 2017 as well as more extreme precipitation event by up to two folds see fig 7 6 in easterling et al 2017 even if the amount of precipitation is not necessarily equal to the recharge we assume that we can investigate the impact of climate change by simulating a range of different recharge values the range would also account for the uncertainty associated with the climate projections we mainly focus on increased natural recharge conditions although for completeness we also investigate the impact of reduced recharge fig 3 provides an illustration of the recharge scenarios simulated in our analysis we consider a baseline recharge denoted as r b and indicated by the black line in fig 3 to study the effect of climate change induced increased decreased recharge on contaminant transport we define ϵ to be a perturbation from the baseline recharge and r p to identify the perturbed recharge we develop four perturbed recharge scenarios with respect to the baseline recharge conditions corresponding to ϵ 0 described in the section 3 1 the recharge perturbation starts at a certain time set to year 2020 and is illustrated with a specific colour for each scenario in fig 3 in the following we provide a detailed description of the scenarios and of the values adopted for ϵ and we employ t to indicate year 2020 3 2 1 constant positive recharge shift the recharge conditions of the first scenario portrayed in green from year 2020 in fig 3 are illustrated through the following equation 1 r p t r b if t t r b 1 ϵ if t t through this scenario we simulate a constant positive shift i e an increase of recharge from 2020 until the end of the simulation set to year 2100 the perturbation ϵ assumes the following range of values ϵ 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 we therefore simulate a recharge increase of 10 to 50 compared to baseline recharge conditions 3 2 2 constant negative recharge shift by the same token the second scenario blue line from year 2020 in fig 3 is illustarted through the following equation 2 r p t r b if t t r b 1 ϵ if t t this scenario is characterized by a constant negative shift of recharge i e a decrease of 10 to 50 ϵ 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 from eq 2 within the timeframe 2020 2100 3 2 3 one year extreme recharge the third scenario magenta line from 2020 in fig 3 is described by 3 r p t r b if t t r b 1 ϵ if t t t 1 this scenario considers a significant increase of recharge within year 2020 mimicking an extreme precipitation event of a factor of 1 5 2 5 and 10 folds compared to baseline conditions the range of perturbation values of this third scenario according to eq 3 are then ϵ 0 5 1 4 9 3 2 4 cap failure and constant positive recharge shift the cap failure is also evaluated in conjunction with the natural recharge shift although low permeability material is used for capping the f area basins increased vegetation or other mechanisms could threaten the integrity of the source zone capping structure worthy et al 2013a 2013b 2015 in the fourth scenario we assume that the cap will fail at the same time of the recharge increase i e in year 2020 note that the assumption of cap failure in 2020 is solely for the purpose of the modeling exercise and not a prediction of actual cap failure the perturbed recharge conditions of this scenario are then the same of the first scenario i e 4 r p t r b if t t r b 1 ϵ if t t the cap failure is represented by increased source zone recharge to the level of the surrounding region therefore we hypothesize a complete failure of the containment structure although such a sudden failure is unlikely to happen we assume instant failure to evaluate the most extreme case the fourth scenario simulates the failure of the capping structure in arbitrarily assumed year 2020 under baseline recharge conditions and under the increased recharge conditions of the first scenario characterized by ϵ 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 from 2020 to 2100 in reality such precipitation recharge changes are expected to occur gradually or randomly rather than through the step change assumed in this analysis however such simple representations would facilitate our fundamental understanding of various complex impacts of climatic changes on contaminant concentrations and exports for the conditions explored in this study fig 3 we expect that the changes in the recharge rates as described in the scenarios above will impact the concentration breakthrough curves btcs by local dilution as well as by affecting the rate at which the contaminant mass is released from the vadose zone to the groundwater system fig 4 schematically pictures the contaminant btc under baseline conditions and perturbed recharge conditions we expect that increased recharge relative to the baseline values causes a slight dilution phase i in fig 4 followed by a rebound effect in the concentration btc phase ii in fig 4 due to the mobilization of the solute mass located in proximity of the source fig 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal dynamics of the contaminant plume prior to investigating the effects of recharge on transport observables at specific wells and at the cp we provide snapshots of the simulated contaminant plume in the coupled vadose zone groundwater system fig 5 for the baseline case fig 5 shows the plume migration at different years namely 1961 fig 5b 1988 fig 5c 2000 fig 5d and 2033 fig 5e as observed in bea et al 2013 the contaminant plume first moves downward in the vadose zone and then spreads laterally below the groundwater table fig 5b during the operation most of the plume migrates within the upper aquifer although a part of the plume penetrates the tccz and reaches the lower aquifer fig 5c after the operation ends the clean water front arrives from upstream and pushes the plume downgradient fig 5d the contaminant plume displays a stratified distribution since the residual contaminants in the vadose zone constitute a persistent contamination source and the low permeability tccz becomes a secondary source as displayed in fig 5e in year 2033 the vadose zone and tccz continue to be the residual contaminant sources 4 2 contaminant concentration and export btcs we first compare the temporal evolution of the 3h concentrations mol kgw 1 at the observation wells and of the 3h export mol y 1 at the cp among different recharge scenarios figs 6 9 for 0 100 years forward from the assumed recharge perturbations and cap failure i e within the timeframe 2020 2100 under baseline recharge conditions indiated by ϵ 0 in figs 6 9 3h concentrations and export generally decrease within the timeframe 2020 2100 given that the peak concentration and export occur closer to the contaminant discharge operation timeframe 1955 1988 i e before year 2020 when the positive constant shift of recharge occurs fig 6 the concentration initially decreases for approximately 2 10 years at the source zone well fig 6a and for around 5 20 years at the downgradient well fig 6b this slight decrease of concentration is an outcome of dilution attributed to the presence of more water in the system which enhances the mixing of the plume with clean water we then observe a rebound in the concentrations due to the additional recharge during which the concentration increases with respect to the concentration btc obtained for the baseline case ϵ 0 this is attributed to the fact that the residual contaminants in the vadose zone are mobilized under higher recharge as a consequence more solute mass reaches the wells and the cp the concentration increase during the rebound phase is more pronounced at the source zone well fig 6a than at the downgradient well fig 6b given that the latter is located further away from the source zone and consequently less influenced by the mobilization of residual 3h these results are in agreement with previous theoretical analysis which showed that near source locations are more sensitive to changes in the solute mass release at the source zone de barros 2018 by comparing the effects of different magnitudes of recharge shifts on well concentrations we notice that a recharge increase characterized by ϵ 0 1 does not influence the concentration btc significantly on the other hand fig 6a and b show that for larger recharge the timing of the rebound effect happens before and the corresponding peak concentration is higher i e see concentration btcs within the range ϵ 0 2 0 5 we also point out that the concentration decrease after the peak is generally more rapid as ϵ increases see btcs produced by ϵ 0 4 0 5 in fig 6a b indeed under higher recharge a bigger part of the residual 3h is mobilized and flushed out of the aquifer system earlier in time the export on the other hand slightly tends to increase but does not change significantly even under the maximum increase of recharge indicated by ϵ 0 5 fig 6c the minor effects on the export are attributed to the fact that the export is an integrated measure that incorporates the upwelling groundwater from the lower aquifer which is less affected by the recharge changes decreased recharge fig 7 produces minor effects on well concentrations compared to increased recharge compare fig 6a b to fig 7a b lower recharge causes a small increase in the concentration for around 5 20 years at the source zone well fig 7a and for approximately 10 20 years at the downgradient well fig 7b fig 7a depicts a higher peak concentration as ϵ increases this effect takes place because a lower amount of water in the system decreases the dilution potential of the aquifer hence leading to an increase the concentration the differences between the concentration btcs obtained for different ϵ values at both observation wells in fig 7a b are less visible than in fig 6a b we observe that increased recharge has a larger impact on the source zone well fig 7a than on the downgradient well fig 7b whereas decreased recharge causes more uniform effects between the two observation wells this is because the mobilization of 3h caused by increased recharge has more impact closer to the source fig 7a whereas the decrease of dilution emerging from decreased recharge and resulting in higher concentration fig 7a b has a more uniform effect on the aquifer system finally minor effects are displayed on the export fig 7c as noted also for increased recharge conditions see fig 6c however we notice that the 3h export tends to slightly decrease under negative recharge shifts given that less residual 3h is mobilized from the vadose zone we next observe the outcomes of the third scenario i e the one year extreme recharge event in fig 8 one year of extreme recharge significantly increases the well concentrations during the rebound phase over an extended period of time i e for around 10 20 years fig 8a b we then observe that a short extreme event could affect the well concentrations for several decades at the source zone well fig 8a prior to the rebound phase the concentration decreases slightly after the perturbation event in 2020 due to dilution particularly under the most extreme scenario indicated by ϵ 9 on the other hand at the downgradient well fig 8b the concentration decrease due to dilution is more pronounced given that the plume has traveled a longer distance five to ten years after the initial dilution the concentration increases during the rebound phase the extreme one year precipitation indicated by ϵ 0 5 does not significantly affect the concentrations especially at the downgradient well where even the recharge scenario characterized by ϵ 1 does not produce significant changes when compared to baseline conditions ϵ 0 we also observe that higher recharge shifts produce higher peak concentrations in the rebound phase due to the mobilization of the solute mass at the source zone fig 8a b as well as higher initial dilution the effect of recharge changes on the export fig 7c is minor compared to the influence on the concentrations in the wells fig 8a b although we observe a peak of the export around 2020 when ϵ 9 fig 9 reports the results obtained for the scenario characterized by the failure of the capping structure under baseline conditions and constant positive recharge shifts starting in 2020 fig 9 shows that the concentration increase at the wells is significantly larger than the increase observed for undamaged source zone capping conditions the concentration rebound happens after 5 8 years at the source zone well fig 9a and after 10 15 years at the downgradient wells fig 9b the export at the cp also shows a visible increase after around 2035 fig 9c this is due to the fact that under higher recharge and no capping structure the bulk of residual contaminants in the vadose zone migrate to the groundwater system we notice that the increase of concentration export happens earlier in time at the well closer to the contaminant source zone later at the downgradient well and even further when considering the export at the cp located at the right boundary of the domain moreover as the recharge value increases from ϵ 0 1 to ϵ 0 5 the peak concentration export caused by the additional recharge becomes higher and occurs earlier in time see fig 9 the inset log scale plot of fig 9a shows that the extreme concentration increase resulting from the cap failure is followed by a rapid decrease of the concentration as the 3h plume is flushed out of the system earlier when the capping structure fails moving the contamination problem downgradient this effect is amplified as ϵ increases the same observations apply to the downgradient well and to the export see inset log scale plot of fig 9b c we finally notice that the difference between the btcs given by different ϵ values is more pronounced when we assume that the cap fails fig 9 the results of an additional recharge scenario characterized by a range of positive recharge shifts within a timeframe shorter than a year is presented in the supplementary material these outcomes confirm that our findings also apply to a smaller time scale of hydrological shift 4 3 impact of recharge perturbations on key environmental performance metrics we quantify the impact of climate change driven recharge shifts on key epms e g peak contaminant concentration early and late arrival times time of exceedance of mcl given that the recharge shifts considered in our study start from year 2020 after the discharge operation at the srs f area terminated i e during a contaminant concentration export descending tailing phase we do not consider the peak concentration but we analyze the maximum change on the concentration and export btcs induced by the recharge perturbations moreover we investigate the effect of recharge shifts on the time of exceedance of the mcl for 3h 4 3 1 maximum difference between baseline and perturbed btcs we identify the maximum normalized difference between the contaminant concentration or export btc obtained under baseline and perturbed recharge conditions as 5 γ c 1 c b t d max max t c b t c p t 100 where c b t and c p t in 5 are the contaminant concentration mol kgw 1 or contaminant export mol y 1 of the baseline subscript b and the perturbed subscript p recharge scenarios respectively whereas c b t d max is the baseline concentration or export taken at the time where the difference between baseline and perturbed btcs is maximum the metric γ c 5 is plotted in fig 10 as a function of the recharge perturbation ϵ whose values are described in section 3 2 note that from 5 γ c 0 for the baseline scenario indicated by ϵ 0 we recall that only a limited range of recharge perturbations were simulated in our analysis therefore the comments below are based on a linear interpolation between γ c and the analyzed ϵ values when the recharge is positively shifted by a constant value fig 10a the relative change in the well concentrations quantified by γ c 5 exhibit a non linear or step function response to the perturbation ϵ as shown in fig 10a γ c at the source zone well drastically increases from around 10 to almost 120 when the recharge perturbation ϵ changes from 0 1 to 0 2 while γ c at the downgradient well is highly impacted it changes from approximately 20 to 100 when ϵ goes from 0 3 to 0 4 the changes are smaller during the other recharge shifts intervals our results suggest the presence of a threshold or trigger level of recharge above which the well concentrations are significantly affected this trigger level is lower at the source zone well than at the downgradient well a recharge corresponding to ϵ 0 1 could represent this threshold at wells closer to the source zone while a higher trigger level of recharge approximately identified by ϵ 0 3 is identified downgradient the export on the other hand increases in a quasi linear manner with the recharge perturbation fig 10a as shown in the concentration time series see fig 6c the effect of recharge shifts on the export is significantly smaller compared to that on the well concentrations indeed a recharge shift corresponding to ϵ 0 5 results in a value of γ c of approximately 20 when observing the cp export while a recharge shift given by ϵ 0 5 produces values of γ c of approximately 80 100 at the observation wells fig 10b shows the γ c ϵ relationship for the negative recharge shift scenario decreasing the recharge rate generally has a smaller impact on γ c with respect to increased recharge conditions compare the values of γ c in fig 10a and b according to the results in fig 7 we identify non linear responses and trigger levels of recharge perturbation at the downgradient well and at the cp the trigger levels are very small at the downgradient well e g less than ϵ 0 1 and higher for the export i e ϵ 0 2 the maximum difference between the baseline case and the perturbed btc computed via eq 5 is larger at the downgradient well than at the source zone well see fig 10b this is different than what was observed from the results of the positive shift scenario when comparing fig 10a and b we observe that under positive shifts of recharge fig 10a γ c evaluated at the source zone is more sensitive to smaller ϵ values in other terms we could say that the source zone well responds first to the perturbation ϵ this is because the source zone well is more impacted by the mobilization of 3 h given its proximity to the source however when the recharge decreases fig 10b changes in γ c are more prominent at the downgradient well for smaller perturbations ϵ i e the downgradient well responds first than the source zone well indeed the changes in the concentration are more uniform between the source zone well and the downgradient well compare fig 7a and b under lower recharge because they happen due to the concentration or less dilution as opposed to the mobilization of contaminants moreover these changes take place at a later time downgradient when the baseline concentration is smaller resulting in higher γ c downgradient under the extreme one year recharge scenario fig 10c the trigger level is larger around ϵ 1 when compared to the results obtained for the constant positive recharge shift scenario at both observation wells compare fig 10a and c we observe that the γ c ϵ relationship is quite similar for the two observation wells until ϵ 4 however when ϵ 9 the recharge increase impact at the downgradient well becomes quite significant in quantitative terms this impact is approximately two times that at the source zone well compare red and blue lines in fig 10c finally the impact of the extreme event on the contaminant export is quite limited and increases linearly with the perturbation ϵ fig 10c however a significant increase of the export is detected for the most extreme one year precipitation event investigated in this study i e when ϵ 9 γ c equals 65 the cap failure scenario fig 10d also shows a non linear response when evaluating the sensitivities of the wells concentrations and the export to the perturbation ϵ we observe an extreme increase of γ c caused by the signification mobilization of the residual contaminants entrapped in the vadose zone when the capping structure fails confirming the importance of the latter containment system successive increases of recharge do not significantly affect the value of γ c i e γ c reaches a plateau under capping failure conditions the almost constant value of γ c is generally higher at the source zone well than at the donwgradient well and at the cp our analysis then suggests that the failure of the capping can be identified as a trigger situation after which major changes in both well concentrations and on the export are expected 4 3 2 difference of time above mcl between baseline and perturbed btcs in this section we identify the metric γ t as the normalized difference of the time of exceedance of the mcl for 3 h between the baseline recharge scenario and the perturbed recharge scenarios as 6 γ t 1 t c b t mcl t c b t mcl t c p t mcl 100 with t c b t mcl and t c p t mcl respectively being the time d during which the contaminant concentration exceeds the epa s mcl for 3 h for the baseline subscript b and the perturbed subscript p recharge scenarios as before the metric γ t 6 expressed in percentage is plotted as a function of ϵ for each recharge scenario in fig 11 and from 6 γ t 0 for the baseline scenario i e when ϵ 0 similarly to before our observations are based on a linear interpolation between γ t and the range of ϵ values considered under the positive shift of recharge scenario fig 11a γ t shows a non linear response to the recharge perturbation ϵ at the source zone well in red in this case γ t increases until its maximum value under a perturbation ϵ 0 2 and ϵ 0 3 but decreases afterwards we then notice that the intermediate values of ϵ produce the highest influence on the timeframe of mcl exceedance as compared to the highest values of ϵ indeed positive recharge shifts initially dilute the plume in the tailing phase and increase the 3h mobilization leading to an increase of the concentration during the rebound phase but afterwards flush the plume out of the system i e at a later stage the 3h concentration values reach the 3h mcl faster see btcs characterized by ϵ 0 4 0 5 in fig 6a the higher the recharge the higher is the concentration rebound peak and the faster the plume is flushed out of the aquifer therefore the maximum increase of the time above mcl is produced by intermediate value of recharge for example given by ϵ 0 2 0 3 on the other hand γ t 6 increases almost linearly with the permanent positive recharge perturbation at the downgradient well in blue but the maximum change of γ t 6 with respect to the baseline recharge scenario is only around 15 decreased recharge fig 11b also results in a non linear response of γ t to ϵ compared to the positive recharge shift scenario in which the source zone well responds first fig 11a when the recharge is negatively shifted fig 11b the downgradient well responds first a decrease of the natural recharge does not significantly influence the time when the 3h concentration exceeds mcl at the source zone well in red given that the minor concentration increase takes place when the baseline concentration exceeds the mcl however we identify the value of ϵ 0 2 as the trigger level of recharge decrease after which the time above mcl is significantly affected at the downgradient well in blue the remaining recharge steps produce less significant changes at the downgradient well one year of extreme recharge produces relatively smaller changes in the time above mcl as compared to the effect of permanent shifts of recharge when ϵ 1 compare fig 11c with fig 11a this scenario does not influence much the time of mcl exceedance at the source zone well in red where a maximum γ t around 20 is identified when ϵ 4 nevertheless the response at the downgradient well also non linear shows a trigger level represented by ϵ 1 above which the time of exceedance of mcl is highly impacted this significant impact takes place because the increase of concentration downgradient which results in values above the 3h mcl happens later in time compared to the upgradient well when the baseline concentration is already below the mcl when the capping structure fails fig 11d we notice that γ t reaches the maximum value at both wells similarly to what observed when looking at the γ c ϵ results the value of γ t then decreases at both wells when the recharge increases in the presence of no cap this decrease is almost linear at the source zone well in the overall we observe that the capping failure is identified as a trigger condition which causes an important increase of both epms as quantified by γ c and γ t therefore a substantial risk increase when comparing the results in figs 10 and 11 we understand that different recharge s thresholds trigger levels are identified depending on the metric of interest for environmental remediation for instance the maximum concentration export btc s change or the time of exceedance of mcl s change caused by the recharge perturbations the location of the observation location and the measured variable e g contaminant concentration or contaminant export 5 summary and conclusions in this paper we investigate the impact of climate change driven aquifer s recharge shifts on residual contaminants in soil and groundwater subject to sustainable remediation for the sake of simplicity we assume that the changes in precipitation and temperature can be translated into changes of the natural aquifer s recharge we establish the evaluation methodology including the development of potential future scenarios on the basis of national climate assessments site specific model developments and evaluation criteria we illustrate four scenarios characterized by a range of variable recharge values 1 constant positive recharge shift after a certain year 2 constant negative recharge shift after a certain year 3 one year of extreme recharge 4 cap failure and constant positive recharge shift our methodology is demonstrated by simulating the 3h plume migration within the us doe s nuclear reservation savannah river site f area we employ the unsaturated saturated flow model amanzi calibrated and verified using site data in summary our results generally show that changes of the recharge regime even small can significantly affect contaminant concentrations the most noticeable outcome is the concentration rebound effect taking place after an initial slight dilution under higher recharge and or capping failure conditions which is given by the mobilization of the contaminant mass from the source zone and its transfer to the aquifer system the concentration rebound effect is more pronounced and happens earlier as the recharge perturbation increases decreased recharge conditions could also cause a small concentration increase attributed to a decrease in the dilution potential of the aquifer on the other hand the 3h export at the cp is only minimally influenced by recharge shifts except for some extreme recharge scenarios trigger levels of recharge which highly impact the concentration btc at the wells are identified these threshold trigger levels depend on the observation location and on the epm under investigation quantified through γ c and γ t the latter display a non linear response to the perturbation ϵ for example it is interesting to observe that the most significant influence on the time of exceedance of mcl under positive recharge shifts i e first scenario is identified under recharge values in the middle of the range considered given that higher ϵ values cause a steeper decrease of the concentration after the rebound phase i e the concentration reaches the mcl faster our results suggest that close monitoring of wells concentrations should be adopted during precipitation connected to higher aquifers recharge and drought connected to lower aquifers recharge periods however the actual risk of the downgradient population as quantified through the export could be under control even when the well concentrations are remarkably impacted our findings constitute then immediate contribution to guide groundwater monitoring in the presence of increased climatic variabilities particularly in explaining concentration anomalies for example without a proper understanding the concentration increase due to higher or lower recharge could be mistaken for instance attributed to additional leaks or contaminant sources in addition our analysis indicates that source zone wells are critical to early detect mobilized residual contaminants under increased recharge or cap failure conditions it would be advantageous to have more frequent sampling or in situ monitoring in the proximity of the contaminant source zones as an early warning system schmidt et al 2018 aside from monitoring the contaminant concentration characterizing the hydraulic fluxes in the vicinity of the source zone can also aid in understanding the macro dispersive behavior of the plume and corresponding risks to the environment and public health de barros and nowak 2010 henri et al 2016 our work also emphasizes the importance of properly maintaining the capping structure not only to sequester residual contaminants but also to reduce the uncertainty associated with climate variability in fact the difference among recharge scenarios is smaller when the cap is undamaged we finally highlight that currently simplified models adopting conservative assumptions are often used for performance and risk assessments at contaminated sites conservative approaches usually assume the worst case scenario associated with higher recharge rates or higher permeability values to increase the plume mobility the modeling scenarios investigated in this work however call into question the appropriateness of such conservative approaches in fact the non trivial trade offs arising from the interplay between dilution and contaminants mobilization require the use of more realistic and accurate flow and transport simulations achieved through proper calibration processes as well as probabilistic risk assessments maxwell et al 2008 de barros and rubin 2008 siirila and maxwell 2012 atchley et al 2013 libera et al 2017 overall the trade offs identified in our work must be evaluated with respect to the specific time location and performance metric under investigation understanding these trade offs would enable better allocation of available resources towards reducing uncertainty in decision making de barros et al 2009 2012 our work could be expanded by considering a more complex geochemistry setting as well as surface water processes e g evapotranspiration and land model components e g vegetation of the srs f area additionally this study would benefit from an inclusion of different conceptualization of the aquifer s heterogeneous properties together with remediation strategies located at the site e g pump and treat funnel and gate systems in particular the effect of geological heterogeneity should be explored in more detail given that it can significantly augment contaminant plume mixing rates de barros et al 2015 acknowledgements this material is based upon work supported as part of the ascem project which
