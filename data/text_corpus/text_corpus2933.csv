14665,uv cl and uv h2o2 are advanced oxidation processes aops used for drinking water treatment and water reuse this work explored the hypothesis that uv cl becomes more competitive to uv h2o2 at neutral to high ph as the concentration of total organic carbon toc increases lab experiments and kinetic modelling were used to compare initial pseudo first order contaminant decay rate coefficients between the aops at various ph and toc conditions the relative effect of increasing toc concentrations on uv cl vs uv h2o2 depended on the ph contaminant and organic matter reactivity towards radicals for example while the reaction rate coefficients during both aops generally decreased with increasing toc the uv cl reaction rate coefficients for the solely oh reactive sucralose decreased 41 138 less than the uv h2o2 coefficients as the toc concentration was increased from 0 to 5 mg c l 1 however uv cl was more affected than uv h2o2 when targeting caffeine a contaminant reactive to chlorine radicals the data were used to define toc ph conditions for which either aop would be more energy efficient under a set of standard conditions the results suggest that uv cl may be competitive to uv h2o2 under a wider range of treatment scenarios than has been conventionally thought based on tests in pure water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv based advanced oxidation uv chlorine uv hydrogen peroxide scavenging organic matter 1 introduction there is growing interest in uv chlorine uv cl advanced oxidation as an alternative to the more conventional uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 for potable reuse and drinking water treatment in the case of drinking water treatment where typical total organic carbon levels are 2 5 mg l there are legitimate opportunities to use either of these processes even in relatively high ph and high organic carbon contexts in response to challenges such as harmful algal blooms stefan 2018 in those scenarios using chlorine instead of hydrogen peroxide can be preferred for economic or operational reasons in both of these uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops the radicals that are generated by the uv photolysis of the activator chemical free chlorine or hydrogen peroxide drive oxidation for most target contaminants for uv h2o2 a variety of radicals can form during the process including reactive oxygen and carbon species but the highly oxidative hydroxyl radical oh controls contaminant degradation in many water treatment scenarios li et al 2017 for uv cl it can more often be a combination of radicals including oh and reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl and clo that degrades contaminants with the contribution of each radical depending on factors like the target contaminant s reactivity with each radical and the background water quality li et al 2017 wu et al 2017 sucralose for example is a primarily oh reactive compound it has been found to be susceptible to oxidation by oh but only weakly reactive to rcs fang 2016 lester et al 2014 the performance of uv aops is limited by the variety of water constituents which scavenge radicals decreasing the concentration of radicals available to react with the target contaminant and slowing contaminant decay fang et al 2014 wu et al 2016 xie et al 2015 the rate at which oh is scavenged is given by eq 1 1 oh scavenging rate m s 1 s k s o h s oh where ks oh is the second order reaction rate coefficient for the reaction between the radical scavenger s and oh s is the concentration of the radical scavenger and oh is the oh concentration wang et al 2020 the activator chemical itself can affect the scavenging demand of water and decrease contaminant decay rates table 1 the suitability of uv h2o2 vs uv cl i e which one leads to faster or more cost effective contaminant decay under a set of comparable operational and water quality conditions depends in part on the radical scavenging characteristics of both processes published literature generally holds that uv cl outperforms uv h2o2 in acidic waters rosenfeldt et al 2013 wang et al 2012 watts et al 2007 outside of the acidic ph range uv h2o2 tends to outperform uv cl because of faster generation of reactive radicals from hocl than ocl and because of rapid scavenging of radicals by ocl watts et al 2012 2007 recent uv cl modelling by wang et al 2012 using medium pressure uv and fang 2016 using low pressure uv suggests that increasing concentrations of organic carbon have less of an adverse effect on uv cl than on uv h2o2 at mid to high ph the performance of both processes decreases as the organic carbon concentration increases under those ph conditions but the performance of uv cl decreases less than the performance of uv h2o2 in the mid to high ph range the organic carbon was estimated to have a negligible effect on the uv cl steady state oh concentration because ocl dominates the overall scavenging this would mean that while uv h2o2 may outperform uv cl in waters with little to no organic carbon uv cl becomes more competitive to uv h2o2 at mid to high ph in higher organic carbon content waters potentially becoming more efficient than uv h2o2 at a certain organic carbon concentration for a given ph however the cited works used simplified models which considered oh oxidation as the only contaminant degradation pathway during uv cl and only considered a single surrogate contaminant which is unreactive to rcs that work therefore does not account for the impact of radicals other than oh does not provide insight into compounds that are susceptible to other radicals and does not address potential differences between modelled and practical uv aop treatment for example factors that are currently unknown and are therefore not included in the model the objective of this work was to investigate the hypothesis that uv cl becomes more competitive to uv h2o2 at neutral to high ph as the concentration of organic carbon increases with low pressure uv and approximately equimolar chlorine and hydrogen peroxide doses lab scale experimental results were combined with kinetic modelling to better understand the circumstances under which each process is the more energy efficient option based on fluence and under ideal collimated beam conditions sucralose was used as a surrogate oh reactive micropollutant to identify the effect of organic carbon on aop degradation rates of oh reactive contaminants caffeine was used as a surrogate micropollutant to explore the degradation rates of contaminants reactive to other non oh radicals including rcs and co3 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all samples were prepared in milli q water high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade sucralose assay 98 0 and food chemical codex fcc grade caffeine assay 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich suwannee river natural organic matter nom ro isolation purchased from the international humic substances society was used to adjust sample total organic carbon toc concentrations sample ph was adjusted using 5 mm phosphate buffers for ph 5 and 7 5 and a 5 mm borate buffer for ph 10 activator chemical concentrations were adjusted using 30 by weight reagent grade hydrogen peroxide or 10 15 reagent grade sodium hypochlorite both purchased from sigma aldrich sodium sulfite reagent grade 99 purity bioshop was used to quench oxidant residuals all other chemicals used were of analytical grade or higher 2 2 experimental procedures laboratory scale collimated beam uv exposures and a chemical reaction kinetics model were used to compare micropollutant degradation by uv h2o2 and uv cl the collimated beam was equipped with a 40 w low pressure lamp and was used to irradiate 15 ml water samples according to the methods described by bolton and linden 2003 before being irradiated samples were spiked with 100 µg l 1 of sucralose and 100 µg l 1 of caffeine and with either 10 mg l 1 of free chlorine as cl2 5 mg l 1 of h2o2 or no oxidant for a direct photolysis control direct photolysis typically accounted for approximately 1 of the reaction rate coefficients to be discussed these free chlorine as cl2 and h2o2 concentrations are approximately equimolar approximately 1 4 10 4 mol l 1 the 5 mg l 1 of hydrogen peroxide is in the range of what has been applied in full scale aop practice the 10 mg l 1 dose of free chlorine is high but also at the upper end of what has been applied in practice samples were also spiked with 0 1 3 or 5 mg c l 1 of toc as suwannee river nom and were adjusted to ph 5 7 5 or 10 during irradiation samples were contained in a pyrex petri dish covered by a washer with an inner diameter of 4 5 cm and with a quartz plate to limit co2 absorption from the atmosphere at high ph water absorbs co2 from the atmosphere which leads to an increase in the inorganic carbon content of the water fang 2016 fluence rates at 254 nm generally in the 1 2 mw cm 2 range were measured regularly using an international light technologies ilt1400 radiometer photometer and were confirmed using ki kio3 actinometry bolton et al 2011 the uv fluences were in the range of 25 6000 mj cm 2 after irradiation the residual oxidant concentration was measured and then samples were collected in amber glass vials the residual oxidant was quenched using sodium sulfite and the samples were analysed for ph as well as uv absorbence at 254 nm uv254 samples were stored in the dark at 4 c ahead of sucralose and caffeine analysis the reaction kinetics model was built in matlab and was used as a semi quantitative tool to compare the trends in uv cl vs uv h2o2 micropollutant destruction under the same conditions as the collimated beam experiments including initial ph uv transmittance oxidant concentration toc uv fluence rate and uv exposure time more information on the model including the photochemical parameters that were used may be found in the supplementary information table s1 the rate coefficient of the reaction between the suwannee river nom and oh that was used in the kinetic model was determined in this study at ph 5 7 5 and 10 and before and after chlorination with 10 mg l 1 of free chlorine and a chlorination time of approximately 7 4 h corresponding to the maximum exposure time that was used in any of the uv cl collimated beam experiments each of these rate coefficient values was calculated to be in the range of 1 35 4 52 108 m 1 s 1 depending on ph and extent of chlorination which is similar to the 3 0 108 m 1 s 1 reported by westerhoff et al 1999 for nom isolates from lake michigan il supplementary information figure s1 the rate coefficients were found by spiking milli q water with 3 mg c l 1 of toc buffering it to the desired ph and then chlorinating it when applicable the ph buffers were calculated to contribute approximately 1 to the overall scavenging capacity of the water the oh scavenging capacity was measured using the method described by wang et al 2020 the total inorganic carbon tic concentration was measured and its contribution mathematically subtracted from the overall scavenging capacity the rate coefficient was then derived from this corrected scavenging capacity using chemical reaction kinetics 2 3 data and sample analysis the aops were compared based on their initial pseudo first order micropollutant degradation rate coefficients the rate coefficients were calculated using eq 2 over the fluence range where the coefficient does not change with fluence 2 d m d f k u v m ac k a c m a c r k r m r ss m

first order micropollutant decay rate coefficient comprised of direct uv photolysis direct chemical oxidation and radical oxidation mechanisms mj 1 cm2 for each experimental condition log micropollutant destruction was measured at several fluences the ktotal was calculated as the slope of the linear portion of that log destruction to fluence relationship chlorine is photolyzed relatively quickly under uv irradiation compared to hydrogen peroxide such that radical concentrations and micropollutant decay rates decrease over the uv exposure time the ph and uv transmittance also change during uv exposure which confounds this phenomenon the present study is concerned with comparing the initial rates of contaminant degradation calculated over fluence ranges through which the oxidant concentrations are effectively constant as a result considering the effect of chlorine decay for example uv cl may demonstrate lesser performance than implied by the reaction rate coefficients determined in this study when targeting high reduction for example 1 log of recalcitrant compounds for example sucralose at neutral to high ph sample ph was measured using an orion star a111 ph metre thermo scientific uv254 and uv transmittance were measured using an agilent 8453 uv vis spectrophotometer free chlorine was measured using the dpd method with a hach dr 2500 spectrophotometer and permachem reagent packs hach hydrogen peroxide was measured using the triiodide method described by klassen et al 1994 toc and tic were measured according to standard method 5310 d apha et al 2012 using an aurora 1030 toc analyzer sucralose and caffeine were measured using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry 6460 triple quad lc ms agilent technologies with sucralose d6 and caffeine 13c3 as internal standards 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of organic carbon and ph on contaminant decay rates initial pseudo first order sucralose and caffeine rates were determined using collimated beam experiments fig 1 as expected the performance of both aops tended to decrease as the concentration of suwannee river nom toc increased regardless of the ph the results of the collimated beam experiments can be summarized with the following three observations first the decay rates of sucralose during uv cl were not reduced as sharply as they were during uv h2o2 by the introduction of organic matter for uv h2o2 the rate coefficient decreased by 86 89 as the toc concentration increased from 0 to 5 mg c l 1 regardless of ph in comparison the uv cl reaction rate coefficient decreased by only 46 at ph 5 and only 27 at ph 10 at ph 7 5 the rate coefficient was relatively more stable standard deviation 1 25 10 5 mj 1 cm2 visually extrapolating the results shown in the figure it appears that the toc concentration of convergence between the 2 aop s rate coefficients was inversely proportional to the ph this first observation specifically regarding sucralose oxidation supports the research hypothesis the uv cl rate coefficients for sucralose decay an oh reactive micropollutant became more competitive to uv h2o2 rate coefficients at neutral to high ph with increasing toc the second observation is that for caffeine which decays due to both oh and rcs reactions the uv cl decay rate coefficients decreased relative to the uv h2o2 coefficients at ph 10 as the toc concentration increased the uv cl coefficient was 31 times greater than the uv h2o2 coefficient when the toc was 0 mg c l 1 and only 1 6 times greater when the toc was 5 mg c l 1 this is opposite to the trend with increasing toc that was observed for sucralose it is also different from what was observed for caffeine at the other 2 ph conditions where the toc had relatively little effect on the ratio of the uv cl to uv h2o2 caffeine decay rate coefficients the third observation which is specific to uv cl is that the caffeine decay rate coefficients decreased more than the sucralose decay rate coefficients did as the toc was increased relative to the coefficients at a toc of 0 mg l 1 these second and third observations show that the research hypothesis may depend on the target contaminant which is expanded upon in the following section 3 2 effect of organic carbon and ph on uv cl vs uv h2o2 efficiency as mentioned in the previous section suwannee river nom affected uv cl and uv h2o2 oxidation rates differently for both sucralose and caffeine for example while uv h2o2 oxidized sucralose faster than uv cl in pure water at ph 7 5 its oxidation rate coefficient decreased faster than that of uv cl as the suwannee river nom concentration increased considering this the kinetic model was used to identify a toc value at a given ph at which the two aops would be equally efficient here equally efficient is defined as the aops having equal initial pseudo first order contaminant decay rate coefficients in a simulated collimated beam at equimolar oxidant doses for lp uv and for a given target contaminant by considering each of the toc values a toc ph region or operating envelope could be identified wherein either process would be the more energy efficient option the operating envelopes for sucralose are shown in fig 2 the ph at which the two processes are equally efficient increases as the toc concentration increases for example in the absence of any toc the ph would need to be 6 for uv cl to outperform u h2o2 however when the toc concentration is increased to 10 mg c l 1 uv cl outperforms uv h2o2 when the ph is 7 8 or 9 5 in other words at a given ph uv cl is more competitive to uv h2o2 for sucralose oxidation in higher toc waters this agrees with the previous modelling by wang et al 2012 and fang 2016 and it supports the research hypothesis the reason for this phenomenon may be the fate of oh in either process which is described in section 3 3 1 the ph of equal efficiency was also calculated by linear interpolation of the experimental results also in fig 2 the operating envelope where uv cl is more efficient suggested through linear interpolation of the laboratory results is larger than that identified by the kinetic model this means that uv cl appears to be more competitive to uv h2o2 than the current state of uv aop reaction kinetics modelling suggests the differences between the two results may reflect unknowns in uv cl photochemistry stefan 2018 explains that discrepancies in reported uv cl rate coefficients severely impact the accuracy of uv cl models for example feng et al 2007 and watts and linden 2007 report very different quantum yields of hocl photolysis at 254 nm 1 0 vs 1 5 respectively the operating envelopes for caffeine based on the reaction kinetics modelling are shown in fig 3 the model predicts that there is a small low toc high ph region where uv h2o2 outperforms uv cl outside of which uv cl is the more efficient process again this pattern may be explained by the role of radicals during either aop discussed in section 3 3 2 the collimated beam results revealed no conditions for which uv h2o2 was more efficient than uv cl for caffeine destruction the model demonstrates that increasing nom concentration tends to make uv cl more competitive to uv h2o2 at higher ph however while the model used nom concentration as an indicator of scavenging capacity the results would have been similar if the nom concentration had been kept constant and the second order reaction rate coefficient between the nom and oh had been increased instead this is illustrated in figs 4 and 5 where the reaction rate coefficient between toc and oh is arbitrarily increased by factors of 2 and 3 over the original model value by the same logic nom that is less reactive than suwannee river nom would have less of an effect on making uv cl more competitive relative to uv h2o2 the modelling and collimated beam experiments were done using lp uv lamps medium pressure mp uv lamps can alternatively be used for aops the light at wavelengths greater than 300 nm emitted by mp uv lamps can photolyze ocl fang 2016 the photolysis of ocl by mp uv produces radicals and decreases the adverse radical scavenging effects of ocl this would make uv cl more competitive to uv h2o2 when using mp uv than it would be when using lp uv assuming that all other factors are equal the comparisons of uv cl vs uv h2o2 competitiveness in this work only considered oxidation rate coefficients over the fluence range where micropollutant decay rates were constant during uv cl the chlorine concentration decreases relatively quickly due to photolysis compared to a slower change in hydrogen peroxide concentration during uv h2o2 as a result micropollutant decay rates decrease across the uv reactor during uv cl faster than they do during uv h2o2 this can affect the competitiveness of the two processes particularly for recalcitrant micropollutants 3 3 roles of reactive species 3 3 1 oh sucralose is used in this study to represent compounds that are degraded almost entirely by oh during each aop technically sucralose is also susceptible to other radicals for example rcs but very high steady state concentrations of those radicals would be required for them to contribute meaningfully to sucralose destruction concentrations which are only achieved under specific operationally impractical conditions such as ph 4 for rcs fang 2016 aop competitiveness when targeting this class of compounds may be understood by considering the fate of oh during each aop to do this the relative contributions of 6 scavengers to the total oh scavenging were estimated using the kinetic model the rate of oh consumption by each scavenger during initial steady state operation was taken as the slope of the line of total oh consumed vs time over the fluence range of 0 25 mj cm 2 the relative contributions of the 6 scavengers tic toc ocl hocl ho2 and h2o2 are shown in figs 6 and 7 for uv cl and uv h2o2 respectively hocl is a relatively weak scavenger compared to toc despite nearly all free chlorine being present as hocl during uv cl at ph 5 hocl contributes 0 1 to the oh scavenging rate at that ph furthermore despite the strength of ocl as a scavenger its low concentration at ph 5 allows toc to account for a considerable portion of the total oh scavenging for example scavenging by toc accounted for 42 of the total oh consumption rate at a toc concentration of just 1 mg c l 1 toc this increased to 82 at 5 mg c l 1 of toc at ph 7 5 and 10 much more of the free chlorine is in the form of ocl than it is at ph 5 48 8 and 99 7 and ph 7 5 and 10 respectively the presence of ocl increases overall oh scavenging ocl is the dominant oh scavenger at those high ph conditions and toc has a relatively small influence on the overall oh scavenging increasing the toc concentration to 5 mg c l 1 had only a minor effect on the total oh consumption as only 12 of radicals were scavenged by toc at ph 7 5 compared to 88 of scavenging coming from ocl as such changes to the toc concentration at neutral to high ph are relatively unimportant having little effect on the decay rate of an oh reactive compound during uv cl unlike in uv cl oh scavenging by the activator chemical in uv h2o2 is relatively consistent across the ph 5 10 range for example combined h2o2 and ho2 accounts for 6 23 5 22 and 8 10 of total radical scavenging with 1 5 mg c l 1 of toc present at ph 5 7 5 and 10 respectively toc is a strong scavenger compared to h2o2 so toc has a consistently large contribution to total oh scavenging compared to the activator chemical across the ph and toc range tested as a result increasing the toc concentration leads to appreciable decreases in the decay rate coefficient of oh reactive compounds across the entire 5 10 ph range to summarize at neutral to high ph uv cl performance was relatively unaffected by an increasing presence of toc as a radical scavenger because the dominance of ocl as a scavenger meant that changes in toc concentration are relatively unimportant to oh concentrations when compared to the impact of ocl on oh concentrations in contrast uv h2o2 performance was adversely affected by increasing toc concentrations because toc has a relatively strong influence on overall oh concentrations during uv h2o2 from ph 5 10 the result is that uv cl becomes increasingly competitive to uv h2o2 for degrading oh reactive compounds at neutral to high ph as the toc content of the water increases this explains the sucralose destruction trend described in section 3 2 importantly this work was largely conducted with toc as the only dominant scavenger outside of the activator chemical the impact of tic at ph 10 provides an idea of how the presence of other dominant scavengers might affect this increasing uv cl competitiveness the kinetic model was fit with bicarbonate and carbonate concentrations from the collimated beam experiments at ph 10 the tic concentration was much larger than at ph 5 and 7 5 22 7 27 4 mg c l 1 at ph 10 vs 1 1 mg c l 1 at ph 5 and 7 5 and was present in the form of the relatively strong scavenger carbonate this increased carbonate was still only a minor contributor to the oh scavenging rate during uv cl 17 20 as there was sufficient ocl to dominate the overall oh scavenging for uv h2o2 tic was the dominant scavenger 73 88 contribution this may have 2 outcomes 1 the presence of tic or other dominant scavengers may lessen the consequence of increasing toc on uv h2o2 performance decreasing the rate at which uv cl becomes more competitive 2 other scavengers like tic may operate similarly to toc and have a larger negative effect on the performance of uv h2o2 than uv cl at high ph again allowing uv cl to become increasingly competitive additional research would be needed to confirm this 3 3 2 rcs earlier it was described that uv cl greatly outperformed uv h2o2 for caffeine oxidation at low toc concentrations but that the efficiency of the 2 processes began to converge with increasing toc at ph 5 uv cl outperforms uv h2o2 largely for the same reason it did with sucralose the efficient net production of oh by hocl compared to that by h2o2 the performance of uv cl for caffeine at ph 7 5 and to a greater extent at ph 10 may be explained by the other radicals that are produced caffeine is used in this study to represent the class of contaminants that are susceptible to oh as well as more selective radicals such as rcs fig 8 shows the model predicted percent contribution of various radicals to the initial pseudo first order decay rate coefficient of caffeine during uv cl where caffeine represents an rcs reactive contaminant during uv cl there is less net oh production at ph 7 5 and 10 than at lower ph according to the model this leads to clo having a large contribution to the destruction of rcs reactive compounds at neutral to high ph 12 90 contribution for caffeine using batch reactor experiments and kinetic modelling wu et al 2017 also found a high contribution by clo to caffeine and nalidixic acid oxidation they found that oh and cl concentrations decreased by 80 and 77 respectively as ph increased from 4 7 to 8 4 but that the clo concentration did not change such that the contribution of clo to caffeine destruction increased uv h2o2 in comparison is driven mainly by oh across the same ph range co3 may have a large role for tic rich waters but it contributed 0 1 to the modelled initial pseudo first order caffeine degradation rate coefficient during uvh2o2 in this work clo has been observed to be scavenged by toc faster than oh wu et al 2017 this may explain the observation described earlier where uv cl caffeine decay rate coefficients decreased relative to uv h2o2 rate coefficients at ph 10 as the toc concentration increased that is high toc during uv cl nullifies the contribution of clo to the destruction of rcs reactive compounds as the toc is increased uv cl decay rates decrease towards uv h2o2 decays rates until clo no longer contributes to oxidation and uv cl like uv h2o2 is driven by oh once that happens the phenomena described in section 3 3 1 for contaminants degraded mainly by oh would take over uv cl would be less impacted by increasing toc than uv h2o2 disregarding the effect of the decreasing activator chemical concentration during uv cl this could explain why as described in section 3 2 based on the collimated beam experiments uv h2o2 was never more efficient than uv cl for caffeine degradation even under high toc conditions at low ph uv cl has more efficient oh production at high ph and the high toc conditions where both processes are driven by oh uv cl is less impacted by oh scavenging there is little information on this theory in the literature wu et al 2017 conducted uv cl modelling at ph 7 and did find that upon increasing from 0 to 5 mg c l 1 of toc suwannee river nom the oh concentration decreased by 27 whereas the clo concentration decreased by 99 of the 4 micropollutants they tested clo had the largest contribution to caffeine destruction and the caffeine decay rate was more significantly reduced than that of the other three micropollutants due to toc this supports the idea that organic matter hinders advanced oxidation driven by clo more than it does advanced oxidation driven by other radicals 3 3 3 other radicals there are other radicals present during uv cl which may affect the performance of uv cl relative to uv h2o2 for example several authors have shown evidence that organic radicals formed through chain reactions during chlorine photolysis in the presence of organic matter react with hocl feng et al 2007 and jin et al 2011 observed that the addition of methanol increased the quantum yield of hocl photodecomposition and feng et al 2010 confirmed this with natural organic matter feng et al 2007 and jin et al 2011 found that the quantum yield of ocl was not affected by increased methanol and jin et al 2011 confirmed that this chain reaction does not occur during uv h2o2 at ph conditions where hocl is present a decrease in uv cl efficiency due to the presence of organic matter may be a combined effect of radical scavenging by the organic matter and faster loss of hocl due to organic radicals similarly there are other radicals e g phosphorus or bromine based radicals that can form during chlorine photolysis but whose roles are less understood wu et al 2017 further research is needed to distinguish the impacts of scavenging radical promotion and other effects such as organic matter absorbing light and decreasing the rate at which free chlorine is photolyzed to reactive radicals 4 conclusion conventional uv aop wisdom holds that uv h2o2 is more efficient than uv cl under all but acidic ph conditions recent modelling has suggested however that uv cl may become increasingly competitive to uv h2o2 at high ph as the concentration of organic carbon increases as such there was a need to clarify the conditions under which uv cl may provide more energy efficient treatment than uv h2o2 where more energy efficient refers to the aop having a greater initial pseudo first order contaminant decay rate coefficient in a simulated collimated beam at equimolar oxidant doses 10 mg l 1 of free chlorine as cl2 or 5 mg l 1 of h2o2 for lp uv and for a given target contaminant the modelled and experimental results of this study showed that for sucralose which reacts mostly with oh the ph at which uv cl and uv h2o2 provided equally efficient treatment increased as the concentration of organic carbon increased for caffeine which is reactive to rcs as well as oh uv cl was always lab scale experiments or almost always modelling more efficient than uv h2o2 regardless of the toc concentration although uv cl was almost always more efficient than uv h2o2 at high ph the caffeine decay rate coefficient during uv cl did decrease relative to the coefficient during uv h2o2 as the toc concentration increased that is toc appeared to impact uv cl more than uv h2o2 additionally toc hindered caffeine destruction by uv cl more than sucralose destruction by uv cl implying that toc may have a greater inhibitory effect on rcs pathways of contaminant destruction than on oh pathways to understand these different results between sucralose and caffeine as well as the greater significance of this work it is helpful to distinguish between 1 contaminants degraded by solely by oh and 2 contaminants susceptible to other more selective radicals for oh reactive compounds like sucralose the modelling showed ocl dominates oh scavenging at high ph even in the presence of 5 mg c l 1 toc for uv h2o2 in organic carbon was the main scavenger as a result the rate of sucralose degradation during uv cl is not as impacted by increased toc as it is during uv h2o2 for caffeine a contaminant susceptible to radicals other than oh clo was the main contributor to contaminant destruction and was more readily scavenged by organic matter than oh this may explain the decrease in uv cl performance relative to uv h2o2 some caution should be taken when viewing these results as current unknowns in uv cl photochemistry limit the accuracy of uv cl modelling moreover this analysis only considered initial contaminant decay rates in reality micropollutant decay would slow as the water travels across the uv reactor during uv cl faster than it would during uv h2o2 due to rapid chlorine photolysis this would decrease the competitiveness of uv cl to uv h2o2 when high log reduction of a recalcitrant compound is required an assessment of the impacts of rapid chlorine photolysis through the uv reactor along with the site specific operational conditions including oxidant dose and lamp type and water quality conditions such as ph toc concentration the presence other scavengers and the nom reactivity would be required to understand the true competitiveness of uv cl to uv h2o2 under a given treatment scenario additional research on the impact of inorganic carbon and other radicals on uv cl vs uv h2o2 efficiency is also needed for a better understanding of uv cl suitability still this work shows that uv cl may be more competitive to uv h2o2 than is commonly thought in waters with elevated background radical

14665,uv cl and uv h2o2 are advanced oxidation processes aops used for drinking water treatment and water reuse this work explored the hypothesis that uv cl becomes more competitive to uv h2o2 at neutral to high ph as the concentration of total organic carbon toc increases lab experiments and kinetic modelling were used to compare initial pseudo first order contaminant decay rate coefficients between the aops at various ph and toc conditions the relative effect of increasing toc concentrations on uv cl vs uv h2o2 depended on the ph contaminant and organic matter reactivity towards radicals

reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl and clo that degrades contaminants with the contribution of each radical depending on factors like the target contaminant s reactivity with each radical and the background water quality li et al 2017 wu et al 2017 sucralose for example is a primarily oh reactive compound it has been found to be susceptible to oxidation by oh but only weakly reactive to rcs fang 2016 lester et al 2014 the performance of uv aops is limited by the variety of water constituents which scavenge radicals decreasing the concentration of radicals available to react with the target contaminant and slowing contaminant decay fang et al 2014 wu et al 2016 xie et al 2015 the rate at which oh is scavenged is given by eq 1 1 oh scavenging rate m s 1 s k s o h s oh where ks oh is the second order reaction rate coefficient for the reaction between the radical scavenger s and oh s is the concentration of the radical scavenger and oh is the oh concentration wang et al 2020 the activator chemical itself can affect the scavenging demand of water and decrease contaminant decay rates table 1 the suitability of uv h2o2 vs uv cl i e which one leads to faster or more cost effective contaminant decay under a set of comparable operational and water quality conditions depends in part on the radical scavenging characteristics of both processes published literature generally holds that uv cl outperforms uv h2o2 in acidic waters rosenfeldt et al 2013 wang et al 2012 watts et al 2007 outside of the acidic ph range uv h2o2 tends to outperform uv cl because of faster generation of reactive radicals from hocl than ocl and because of rapid scavenging of radicals by ocl watts et al 2012 2007 recent uv cl modelling by wang et al 2012 using medium pressure uv and fang 2016 using low pressure uv suggests that increasing concentrations of organic carbon have less of an adverse effect on uv cl than on uv h2o2 at mid to high ph the performance of both processes decreases as the organic carbon concentration increases under those ph conditions but the performance of uv cl decreases less than the performance of uv h2o2 in the mid to high ph range the organic carbon was estimated to have a negligible effect on the uv cl steady state oh concentration because ocl dominates the overall scavenging this would mean that while uv h2o2 may outperform uv cl in waters with little to no organic carbon uv cl becomes more competitive to uv h2o2 at mid to high ph in higher organic carbon content waters potentially becoming more efficient than uv h2o2 at a certain organic carbon concentration for a given ph however the cited works used simplified models which considered oh oxidation as the only contaminant degradation pathway during uv cl and only considered a single surrogate contaminant which is unreactive to rcs that work therefore does not account for the impact of radicals other than oh does not provide insight into compounds that are susceptible to other radicals and does not address potential differences between modelled and practical uv aop treatment for example factors that are currently unknown and are therefore not included in the model the objective of this work was to investigate the hypothesis that uv cl becomes more competitive to uv h2o2 at neutral to high ph as the concentration of organic carbon increases with low pressure uv and approximately equimolar chlorine and hydrogen peroxide doses lab scale experimental results were combined with kinetic modelling to better understand the circumstances under which each process is the more energy efficient option based on fluence and under ideal collimated beam conditions sucralose was used as a surrogate oh reactive micropollutant to identify the effect of organic carbon on aop degradation rates of oh reactive contaminants caffeine was used as a surrogate micropollutant to explore the degradation rates of contaminants reactive to other non oh radicals including rcs and co3 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all samples were prepared in milli q water high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade sucralose assay 98 0 and food chemical codex fcc grade caffeine assay 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich suwannee river natural organic matter nom ro isolation purchased from the international humic substances society was used to adjust sample total organic carbon toc concentrations sample ph was adjusted using 5 mm phosphate buffers for ph 5 and 7 5 and a 5 mm borate buffer for ph 10 activator chemical concentrations were adjusted using 30 by weight reagent grade hydrogen peroxide or 10 15 reagent grade sodium hypochlorite both purchased from sigma aldrich sodium sulfite reagent grade 99 purity bioshop was used to quench oxidant residuals all other chemicals used were of analytical grade or higher 2 2 experimental procedures laboratory scale collimated beam uv exposures and a chemical reaction kinetics model were used to compare micropollutant degradation by uv h2o2 and uv cl the collimated beam was equipped with a 40 w low pressure lamp and was used to irradiate 15 ml water samples according to the methods described by bolton and linden 2003 before being irradiated samples were spiked with 100 µg l 1 of sucralose and 100 µg l 1 of caffeine and with either 10 mg l 1 of free chlorine as cl2 5 mg l 1 of h2o2 or no oxidant for a direct photolysis control direct photolysis typically accounted for approximately 1 of the reaction rate coefficients to be discussed these free chlorine as cl2 and h2o2 concentrations are approximately equimolar approximately 1 4 10 4 mol l 1 the 5 mg l 1 of hydrogen peroxide is in the range of what has been applied in full scale aop practice the 10 mg l 1 dose of free chlorine is high but also at the upper end of what has been applied in practice samples were also spiked with 0 1 3 or 5 mg c l 1 of toc as suwannee river nom and were adjusted to ph 5 7 5 or 10 during irradiation samples were contained in a pyrex petri dish covered by a washer with an inner diameter of 4 5 cm and with a quartz plate to limit co2 absorption from the atmosphere at high ph water absorbs co2 from the atmosphere which leads to an increase in the inorganic carbon content of the water fang 2016 fluence rates at 254 nm generally in the 1 2 mw cm 2 range were measured regularly using an international light technologies ilt1400 radiometer photometer and were confirmed using ki kio3 actinometry bolton et al 2011 the uv fluences were in the range of 25 6000 mj cm 2 after irradiation the residual oxidant concentration was measured and then samples were collected in amber glass vials the residual oxidant was quenched using sodium sulfite and the samples were analysed for ph as well as uv absorbence at 254 nm uv254 samples were stored in the dark at 4 c ahead of sucralose and caffeine analysis the reaction kinetics model was built in matlab and was used as a semi quantitative tool to compare the trends in uv cl vs uv h2o2 micropollutant destruction under the same conditions as the collimated beam experiments including initial ph uv transmittance oxidant concentration toc uv fluence rate and uv exposure time more information on the model including the photochemical parameters that were used may be found in the supplementary information table s1 the rate coefficient of the reaction between the suwannee river nom and oh that was used in the kinetic model was determined in this study at ph 5 7 5 and 10 and before and after chlorination with 10 mg l 1 of free chlorine and a chlorination time of approximately 7 4 h corresponding to the maximum exposure time that was used in any of the uv cl collimated beam experiments each of these rate coefficient values was calculated to be in the range of 1 35 4 52 108 m 1 s 1 depending on ph and extent of chlorination which is similar to the 3 0 108 m 1 s 1 reported by westerhoff et al 1999 for nom isolates from lake michigan il supplementary information figure s1 the rate coefficients were found by spiking milli q water with 3 mg c l 1 of toc buffering it to the desired ph and then chlorinating it when applicable the ph buffers were calculated to contribute approximately 1 to the overall scavenging capacity of the water the oh scavenging capacity was measured using the method described by wang et al 2020 the total inorganic carbon tic concentration was measured and its contribution mathematically subtracted from the overall scavenging capacity the rate coefficient was then derived from this corrected scavenging capacity using chemical reaction kinetics 2 3 data and sample analysis the aops were compared based on their initial pseudo first order micropollutant degradation rate coefficients the rate coefficients were calculated using eq 2 over the fluence range where the coefficient does not change with fluence 2 d m d f k u v m ac k a c m a c r k r m r ss m

first order micropollutant decay rate coefficient comprised of direct uv photolysis direct chemical oxidation and radical oxidation mechanisms mj 1 cm2 for each experimental condition log micropollutant destruction was measured at several fluences the ktotal was calculated as the slope of the linear portion of that log destruction to fluence relationship chlorine is photolyzed relatively quickly under uv irradiation compared to hydrogen peroxide such that radical concentrations and micropollutant decay rates decrease over the uv exposure time the ph and uv transmittance also change during uv exposure which confounds this phenomenon the present study is concerned with comparing the initial rates of contaminant degradation calculated over fluence ranges through which the oxidant concentrations are effectively constant as a result considering the effect of chlorine decay for example uv cl may demonstrate lesser performance than implied by the reaction rate coefficients determined in this study when targeting high reduction for example 1 log of recalcitrant compounds for example sucralose at neutral to high ph sample ph was measured using an orion star a111 ph metre thermo scientific uv254 and uv transmittance were measured using an agilent 8453 uv vis spectrophotometer free chlorine was measured using the dpd method with a hach dr 2500 spectrophotometer and permachem reagent packs hach hydrogen peroxide was measured using the triiodide method described by klassen et al 1994 toc and tic were measured according to standard method 5310 d apha et al 2012 using an aurora 1030 toc analyzer sucralose and caffeine were measured using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry 6460 triple quad lc ms agilent technologies with sucralose d6 and caffeine 13c3 as internal standards 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of organic carbon and ph on contaminant decay rates initial pseudo first order sucralose and caffeine rates were determined using collimated beam experiments fig 1 as expected the performance of both aops tended to decrease as the concentration of suwannee river nom toc increased regardless of the ph the results of the collimated beam experiments can be summarized with the following three observations first the decay rates of sucralose during uv cl were not reduced as sharply as they were during uv h2o2 by the introduction of organic matter for uv h2o2 the rate coefficient decreased by 86 89 as the toc concentration increased from 0 to 5 mg c l 1 regardless of ph in comparison the uv cl reaction rate coefficient decreased by only 46 at ph 5 and only 27 at ph 10 at ph 7 5 the rate coefficient was relatively more stable standard deviation 1 25 10 5 mj 1 cm2 visually extrapolating the results shown in the figure it appears that the toc concentration of convergence between the 2 aop s rate coefficients was inversely proportional to the ph this first observation specifically regarding sucralose oxidation supports the research hypothesis the uv cl rate coefficients for sucralose decay an oh reactive micropollutant became more competitive to uv h2o2 rate coefficients at neutral to high ph with increasing toc the second observation is that for caffeine which decays due to both oh and rcs reactions the uv cl decay rate coefficients decreased relative to the uv h2o2 coefficients at ph 10 as the toc concentration increased the uv cl coefficient was 31 times greater than the uv h2o2 coefficient when the toc was 0 mg c l 1 and only 1 6 times greater when the toc was 5 mg c l 1 this is opposite to the trend with increasing toc that was observed for sucralose it is also different from what was observed for caffeine at the other 2 ph conditions where the toc had relatively little effect on the ratio of the uv cl to uv h2o2 caffeine decay rate coefficients the third observation which is specific to uv cl is that the caffeine decay rate coefficients decreased more than the sucralose decay rate coefficients did as the toc was increased relative to the coefficients at a toc of 0 mg l 1 these second and third observations show that the research hypothesis may depend on the target contaminant which is expanded upon in the following section 3 2 effect of organic carbon and ph on uv cl vs uv h2o2 efficiency as mentioned in the previous section suwannee river nom affected uv cl and uv h2o2 oxidation rates differently for both sucralose and caffeine for example while uv h2o2 oxidized sucralose faster than uv cl in pure water at ph 7 5 its oxidation rate coefficient decreased faster than that of uv cl as the suwannee river nom concentration increased considering this the kinetic model was used to identify a toc value at a given ph at which the two aops would be equally efficient here equally efficient is defined as the aops having equal initial pseudo first order contaminant decay rate coefficients in a simulated collimated beam at equimolar oxidant doses for lp uv and for a given target contaminant by considering each of the toc values a toc ph region or operating envelope could be identified wherein either process would be the more energy efficient option the operating envelopes for sucralose are shown in fig 2 the ph at which the two processes are equally efficient increases as the toc concentration increases for example in the absence of any toc the ph would need to be 6 for uv cl to outperform u h2o2 however when the toc concentration is increased to 10 mg c l 1 uv cl outperforms uv h2o2 when the ph is 7 8 or 9 5 in other words at a given ph uv cl is more competitive to uv h2o2 for sucralose oxidation in higher toc waters this agrees with the previous modelling by wang et al 2012 and fang 2016 and it supports the research hypothesis the reason for this phenomenon may be the fate of oh in either process which is described in section 3 3 1 the ph of equal efficiency was also calculated by linear interpolation of the experimental results also in fig 2 the operating envelope where uv cl is more efficient suggested through linear interpolation of the laboratory results is larger than that identified by the kinetic model this means that uv cl appears to be more competitive to uv h2o2 than the current state of uv aop reaction kinetics modelling suggests the differences between the two results may reflect unknowns in uv cl photochemistry stefan 2018 explains that discrepancies in reported uv cl rate coefficients severely impact the accuracy of uv cl models for example feng et al 2007 and watts and linden 2007 report very different quantum yields of hocl photolysis at 254 nm 1 0 vs 1 5 respectively the operating envelopes for caffeine based on the reaction kinetics modelling are shown in fig 3 the model predicts that there is a small low toc high ph region where uv h2o2 outperforms uv cl outside of which uv cl is the more efficient process again this pattern may be explained by the role of radicals during either aop discussed in section 3 3 2 the collimated beam results revealed no conditions for which uv h2o2 was more efficient than uv cl for caffeine destruction the model demonstrates that increasing nom concentration tends to make uv cl more competitive to uv h2o2 at higher ph however while the model used nom concentration as an indicator of scavenging capacity the results would have been similar if the nom concentration had been kept constant and the second order reaction rate coefficient between the nom and oh had been increased instead this is illustrated in figs 4 and 5 where the reaction rate coefficient between toc and oh is arbitrarily increased by factors of 2 and 3 over the original model value by the same logic nom that is less reactive than suwannee river nom would have less of an effect on making uv cl more competitive relative to uv h2o2 the modelling and collimated beam experiments were done using lp uv lamps medium pressure mp uv lamps can alternatively be used for aops the light at wavelengths greater than 300 nm emitted by mp uv lamps can photolyze ocl fang 2016 the photolysis of ocl by mp uv produces radicals and decreases the adverse radical scavenging effects of ocl this would make uv cl more competitive to uv h2o2 when using mp uv than it would be when using lp uv assuming that all other factors are equal the comparisons of uv cl vs uv h2o2 competitiveness in this work only considered oxidation rate coefficients over the fluence range where micropollutant decay rates were constant during uv cl the chlorine concentration decreases relatively quickly due to photolysis compared to a slower change in hydrogen peroxide concentration during uv h2o2 as a result micropollutant decay rates decrease across the uv reactor during uv cl faster than they do during uv h2o2 this can affect the competitiveness of the two processes particularly for recalcitrant micropollutants 3 3 roles of reactive species 3 3 1 oh sucralose is used in this study to represent compounds that are degraded almost entirely by oh during each aop technically sucralose is also susceptible to other radicals for example rcs but very high steady state concentrations of those radicals would be required for them to contribute meaningfully to sucralose destruction concentrations which are only achieved under specific operationally impractical conditions such as ph 4 for rcs fang 2016 aop competitiveness when targeting this class of compounds may be understood by considering the fate of oh during each aop to do this the relative contributions of 6 scavengers to the total oh scavenging were estimated using the kinetic model the rate of oh consumption by each scavenger during initial steady state operation was taken as the slope of the line of total oh consumed vs time over the fluence range of 0 25 mj cm 2 the relative contributions of the 6 scavengers tic toc ocl hocl ho2 and h2o2 are shown in figs 6 and 7 for uv cl and uv h2o2 respectively hocl is a relatively weak scavenger compared to toc despite nearly all free chlorine being present as hocl during uv cl at ph 5 hocl contributes 0 1 to the oh scavenging rate at that ph furthermore despite the strength of ocl as a scavenger its low concentration at ph 5 allows toc to account for a considerable portion of the total oh scavenging for example scavenging by toc accounted for 42 of the total oh consumption rate at a toc concentration of just 1 mg c l 1 toc this increased to 82 at 5 mg c l 1 of toc at ph 7 5 and 10 much more of the free chlorine is in the form of ocl than it is at ph 5 48 8 and 99 7 and ph 7 5 and 10 respectively the presence of ocl increases overall oh scavenging ocl is the dominant oh scavenger at those high ph conditions and toc has a relatively small influence on the overall oh scavenging increasing the toc concentration to 5 mg c l 1 had only a minor effect on the total oh consumption as only 12 of radicals were scavenged by toc at ph 7 5 compared to 88 of scavenging coming from ocl as such changes to the toc concentration at neutral to high ph are relatively unimportant having little effect on the decay rate of an oh reactive compound during uv cl unlike in uv cl oh scavenging by the activator chemical in uv h2o2 is relatively consistent across the ph 5 10 range for example combined h2o2 and ho2 accounts for 6 23 5 22 and 8 10 of total radical scavenging with 1 5 mg c l 1 of toc present at ph 5 7 5 and 10 respectively toc is a strong scavenger compared to h2o2 so toc has a consistently large contribution to total oh scavenging compared to the activator chemical across the ph and toc range tested as a result increasing the toc concentration leads to appreciable decreases in the decay rate coefficient of oh reactive compounds across the entire 5 10 ph range to summarize at neutral to high ph uv cl performance was relatively unaffected by an increasing presence of toc as a radical scavenger because the dominance of ocl as a scavenger meant that changes in toc concentration are relatively unimportant to oh concentrations when compared to the impact of ocl on oh concentrations in contrast uv h2o2 performance was adversely affected by increasing toc concentrations because toc has a relatively strong influence on overall oh concentrations during uv h2o2 from ph 5 10 the result is that uv cl becomes increasingly competitive to uv h2o2 for degrading oh reactive compounds at neutral to high ph as the toc content of the water increases this explains the sucralose destruction trend described in section 3 2 importantly this work was largely conducted with toc as the only dominant scavenger outside of the activator chemical the impact of tic at ph 10 provides an idea of how the presence of other dominant scavengers might affect this increasing uv cl competitiveness the kinetic model was fit with bicarbonate and carbonate concentrations from the collimated beam experiments at ph 10 the tic concentration was much larger than at ph 5 and 7 5 22 7 27 4 mg c l 1 at ph 10 vs 1 1 mg c l 1 at ph 5 and 7 5 and was present in the form of the relatively strong scavenger carbonate this increased carbonate was still only a minor contributor to the oh scavenging rate during uv cl 17 20 as there was sufficient ocl to dominate the overall oh scavenging for uv h2o2 tic was the dominant scavenger 73 88 contribution this may have 2 outcomes 1 the presence of tic or other dominant scavengers may lessen the consequence of increasing toc on uv h2o2 performance decreasing the rate at which uv cl becomes more competitive 2 other scavengers like tic may operate similarly to toc and have a larger negative effect on the performance of uv h2o2 than uv cl at high ph again allowing uv cl to become increasingly competitive additional research would be needed to confirm this 3 3 2 rcs earlier it was described that uv cl greatly outperformed uv h2o2 for caffeine oxidation at low toc concentrations but that the efficiency of the 2 processes began to converge with increasing toc at ph 5 uv cl outperforms uv h2o2 largely for the same reason it did with sucralose the efficient net production of oh by hocl compared to that by h2o2 the performance of uv cl for caffeine at ph 7 5 and to a greater extent at ph 10 may be explained by the other radicals that are produced caffeine is used in this study to represent the class of contaminants that are susceptible to oh as well as more selective radicals such as rcs fig 8 shows the model predicted percent contribution of various radicals to the initial pseudo first order decay rate coefficient of caffeine during uv cl where caffeine represents an rcs reactive contaminant during uv cl there is less net oh production at ph 7 5 and 10 than at lower ph according to the model this leads to clo having a large contribution to the destruction of rcs reactive compounds at neutral to high ph 12 90 contribution for caffeine using batch reactor experiments and kinetic modelling wu et al 2017 also found a high contribution by clo to caffeine and nalidixic acid oxidation they found that oh and cl concentrations decreased by 80 and 77 respectively as ph increased from 4 7 to 8 4 but that the clo concentration did not change such that the contribution of clo to caffeine destruction increased uv h2o2 in comparison is driven mainly by oh across the same ph range co3 may have a large role for tic rich waters but it contributed 0 1 to the modelled initial pseudo first order caffeine degradation rate coefficient during uvh2o2 in this work clo has been observed to be scavenged by toc faster than oh wu et al 2017 this may explain the observation described earlier where uv cl caffeine decay rate coefficients decreased relative to uv h2o2 rate coefficients at ph 10 as the toc concentration increased that is high toc during uv cl nullifies the contribution of clo to the destruction of rcs reactive compounds as the toc is increased uv cl decay rates decrease towards uv h2o2 decays rates until clo no longer contributes to oxidation and uv cl like uv h2o2 is driven by oh once that happens the phenomena described in section 3 3 1 for contaminants degraded mainly by oh would take over uv cl would be less impacted by increasing toc than uv h2o2 disregarding the effect of the decreasing activator chemical concentration during uv cl this could explain why as described in section 3 2 based on the collimated beam experiments uv h2o2 was never more efficient than uv cl for caffeine degradation even under high toc conditions at low ph uv cl has more efficient oh production at high ph and the high toc conditions where both processes are driven by oh uv cl is less impacted by oh scavenging there is little information on this theory in the literature wu et al 2017 conducted uv cl modelling at ph 7 and did find that upon increasing from 0 to 5 mg c l 1 of toc suwannee river nom the oh concentration decreased by 27 whereas the clo concentration decreased by 99 of the 4 micropollutants they tested clo had the largest contribution to caffeine destruction and the caffeine decay rate was more significantly reduced than that of the other three micropollutants due to toc this supports the idea that organic matter hinders advanced oxidation driven by clo more than it does advanced oxidation driven by other radicals 3 3 3 other radicals there are other radicals present during uv cl which may affect the performance of uv cl relative to uv h2o2 for example several authors have shown evidence that organic radicals formed through chain reactions during chlorine photolysis in the presence of organic matter react with hocl feng et al 2007 and jin et al 2011 observed that the addition of methanol increased the quantum yield of hocl photodecomposition and feng et al 2010 confirmed this with natural organic matter feng et al 2007 and jin et al 2011 found that the quantum yield of ocl was not affected by increased methanol and jin et al 2011 confirmed that this chain reaction does not occur during uv h2o2 at ph conditions where hocl is present a decrease in uv cl efficiency due to the presence of organic matter may be a combined effect of radical scavenging by the organic matter and faster loss of hocl due to organic radicals similarly there are other radicals e g phosphorus or bromine based radicals that can form during chlorine photolysis but whose roles are less understood wu et al 2017 further research is needed to distinguish the impacts of scavenging radical promotion and other effects such as organic matter absorbing light and decreasing the rate at which free chlorine is photolyzed to reactive radicals 4 conclusion conventional uv aop wisdom holds that uv h2o2 is more efficient than uv cl under all but acidic ph conditions recent modelling has suggested however that uv cl may become increasingly competitive to uv h2o2 at high ph as the concentration of organic carbon increases as such there was a need to clarify the conditions under which uv cl may provide more energy efficient treatment than uv h2o2 where more energy efficient refers to the aop having a greater initial pseudo first order contaminant decay rate coefficient in a simulated collimated beam at equimolar oxidant doses 10 mg l 1 of free chlorine as cl2 or 5 mg l 1 of h2o2 for lp uv and for a given target contaminant the modelled and experimental results of this study showed that for sucralose which reacts mostly with oh the ph at which uv cl and uv h2o2 provided equally efficient treatment increased as the concentration of organic carbon increased for caffeine which is reactive to rcs as well as oh uv cl was always lab scale experiments or almost always modelling more efficient than uv h2o2 regardless of the toc concentration although uv cl was almost always more efficient than uv h2o2 at high ph the caffeine decay rate coefficient during uv cl did decrease relative to the coefficient during uv h2o2 as the toc concentration increased that is toc appeared to impact uv cl more than uv h2o2 additionally toc hindered caffeine destruction by uv cl more than sucralose destruction by uv cl implying that toc may have a greater inhibitory effect on rcs pathways of contaminant destruction than on oh pathways to understand these different results between sucralose and caffeine as well as the greater significance of this work it is helpful to distinguish between 1 contaminants degraded by solely by oh and 2 contaminants susceptible to other more selective radicals for oh reactive compounds like sucralose the modelling showed ocl dominates oh scavenging at high ph even in the presence of 5 mg c l 1 toc for uv h2o2 in organic carbon was the main scavenger as a result the rate of sucralose degradation during uv cl is not as impacted by increased toc as it is during uv h2o2 for caffeine a contaminant susceptible to radicals other than oh clo was the main contributor to contaminant destruction and was more readily scavenged by organic matter than oh this may explain the decrease in uv cl performance relative to uv h2o2 some caution should be taken when viewing these results as current unknowns in uv cl photochemistry limit the accuracy of uv cl modelling moreover this analysis only considered initial contaminant decay rates in reality micropollutant decay would slow as the water travels across the uv reactor during uv cl faster than it would during uv h2o2 due to rapid chlorine photolysis this would decrease the competitiveness of uv cl to uv h2o2 when high log reduction of a recalcitrant compound is required an assessment of the impacts of rapid chlorine photolysis through the uv reactor along with the site specific operational conditions including oxidant dose and lamp type and water quality conditions such as ph toc concentration the presence other scavengers and the nom reactivity would be required to understand the true competitiveness of uv cl to uv h2o2 under a given treatment scenario additional research on the impact of inorganic carbon and other radicals on uv cl vs uv h2o2 efficiency is also needed for a better understanding of uv cl suitability still this work shows that uv cl may be more competitive to uv h2o2 than is commonly thought in waters with elevated background radical

14666,carbonated beverages are characterized by low temperatures multiple microbubbles high pressure and an acidic environment creating ideal conditions for releasing contaminants from plastic bottles however the release patterns of microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps are poorly understood we investigated the effects of plastic type co2 filling volume temperature sugar content and additive on

volume driven by the synergistic effect of co2 bubbles and pressure after 4 freeze thaw cycles the release of mps and nps significantly increased reaching 450 38 65 mps and 2 91 0 10 108 nps per liter respectively the presence of sugar leads to an elevation in mps release compared to sucrose free carbonated water while the addition of additives to carbonated water exhibits negligible effects on mps

walking down a hot summer street the oppressive heat seems endless as if the earth is thirsty and crying out for water even breathing feels hot and sweat drips down the neck and back but a refreshing glass of ice cold carbonated beverage can offer a welcome respite the cold liquid bursts with a dessert like sweetness and a rush of cooling bubbles that erupted in the mouth delivering exhilaration however while enjoying these drinks have you ever considered the potential release of microplastics mps and other pollutants which could pose a health risk mps defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm in diameter weithmann et al 2018 pose potential threats to human health when ingested in vitro experiments have demonstrated mps ability to infiltrate human cell membranes inducing the generation of reactive oxygen species triggering inflammatory responses and eliciting neurotoxic effects huang et al 2021 these findings emphasize the urgent need for a comprehensive investigation into the release patterns of mps originating from carbonated beverages numerous studies have documented that high temperatures can cause plastic polymers to degrade and fracture leading to the release of mps into ordinary food and beverages astner et al 2019 ranjan et al 2021 nevertheless it is critical to note that low temperatures can also alter the physical characteristics of plastics astner et al 2019 for example plastic becomes fragile when frozen fu et al 2015 presenting a comparable possibility of mps being released unfortunately few studies have examined the pattern of mps release at low temperatures carbon dioxide co2 exhibits higher solubility at lower temperatures liger belair 2019 the shaking when drinking carbonated beverages releases large amounts of co2 microbubbles despite their small size these bubbles may generate destructive forces when they collapse submerged objects such as ship rudders or propellers are susceptible to severe corrosion or mechanical damage from cavitation erosion caused by bubble rupture kadivar et al 2021 moreover mps exhibit greater affinity with bubbles than with ice and water vega martínez et al 2020 enabling their transportation from surfaces to solutions via bubbles consequently the release of mps should also be considered within the context of bubbles it is noteworthy that the release of co2 from carbonated beverages causes an indirect increase in pressure in plastic bottles approximately 0 2 mpa of pressure exists inside a chilled carbonated beverage bottle kuntzleman and sturgis 2020 however higher gas pressure 0 5 mpa can cause severe cracks in the container s physical structure xie et al 2017 observations have revealed that a crack could be formed under low stress for a long time and slowly grow until brittle failure juan et al 2020 these results indicate that the inner walls of plastic bottles are susceptible to leaking significant quantities of mps into the carbonated beverages due to indirect pressure increases by the release of co2 yet this potential pressure effect has been overlooked in past studies considering that high concentrations of co2 released from the carbonated beverages not only scour the plastic bottle s inner wall but also increase the pressure inside it is particularly important to examine the combined effect and their interaction on the mps release dissolved co2 in carbonated beverages also creates a low ph environment prior research has shown that heavy metal leaching from plastic additives is strongly ph dependent with the maximum amounts of the examined elements detected in an acidic environment krol et al 2020 saria et al 2006 the mobility of heavy metals was also accelerated on acidic occasions ph 2 saria et al 2006 therefore the acidity of carbonated beverages may affect the concentration of heavy metals released from plastic bottles in addition to mps the overlooked issue of nanoplastic nps release from plastic bottles deserves attention nps denoting plastic particles with minute dimensions 1 μm gigault et al 2021 are ingested by individuals through a variety of consumer products remarkably a single cup of beverage has been found to contain an astonishing quantity of 3 1 billion nps hernandez et al 2019 while disposable food containers have been observed to harbor approximately 1 million nps liu et al 2022 importantly nps possess a higher potential to harm human health compared to mps rist et al 2018 as they can effectively permeate biological membranes wu et al 2019 research findings indicate that exposure of human hematopoietic cells to nps can instigate cellular oxidative stress and induce primary dna damage rubio et al 2020 therefore it is imperative to consider the release of nps alongside mps the quantification of mps and nps includes the utilization of both mass based methodologies which determine particle quantities based on their mass and number based methodologies which assess particle abundance however to acquire comprehensive information regarding the size morphology concentration and composition of mps nps a synergistic integration of multiple techniques is indispensable as elucidated in the accompanying text s1 this study evaluated the impact of plastic types co2 filling volumes storage temperature freeze thaw cycles sugar content and additives on the release of mps nps and heavy metals from plastic bottles containing carbonated beverages the investigation included an assessment of the individual and combined effects of pressure and co2 bubbles on the release of mps nps induced by co2 filling we aimed to assess the environmental risks from the release of contaminants such as mps nps and heavy metals in carbonated beverages and to investigate the characteristics and patterns of mps nps release in the unique carbonated beverage environment providing important insights to reduce their risk to human health 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of plastic bottles beverage storage bottles with a total volume of 500 ml made of polyethylene pe polypropylene pp and polyethylene terephthalate pet were procured from suzhou qiaojing trading ltd we chose these bottle types based on their widespread use in beverage packaging changwichan and gheewala 2020 poortinga and whitaker 2018 the chemical composition of the bottles was confirmed using micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy μ ftir spectrometer nicolet in10 thermo fisher scientific usa and the corresponding spectra are shown in fig s1 2 2 different treatment of plastic bottles the pristine plastic bottles were subjected to a rinsing procedure with ultrapure water following the guidelines outlined in the general specification for rinsing filling capping machines of plastic bottles general administration of quality supervision 2011 to replicate the pre treatment of plastic bottles prior to their incorporation in an authentic production process subsequently the bottles were carefully air dried in an inverted position to prevent the ingress of airborne contaminants the detailed treatment procedures are delineated in fig 1 a to investigate the impact of plastic bottle types on mps nps release 450 ml of ultrapure water at 4 c was poured into pe pp and pet bottles and 3 6 g l of co2 was injected into them using a soda machine cocosoda dongguan linuo electric co china to simulate carbonated beverages liger belair 2019 liger belair et al 2015 a filter membrane mec membrane 25 mm diameter 0 22 μm pore size bkman was installed between the plastic tube and the glass tube to prevent mps from the co2 and plastic tube entering the bottle during inflation fig 1a the plastic bottles were refrigerated at 4 c for 12 h to mimic chilled beverage storage and then agitated in a shaker at 110 rpm for 15 min to replicate consumer behavior while consuming drinks the period of 15 min was chosen because most consumers prefer to enjoy their drinks within 15 min of receiving their drinks ranjan et al 2021 moreover we conducted repetitive co2 inflation experiments 1 3 times using the same plastic bottles to examine the release pattern of mps we also examined the effect of co2 filling volume 0 g l 3 6 g l 5 4 g l 7 2 g l and storage temperature 18 c 4 c 25 c on the release of mps nps from pet bottles under the conditions described above since carbonated beverages may freeze again after being thawed according to most people s consumption habits experiments were conducted with 1 4 freeze thaw cycles at 18 c for 8 h and 25 c for 16 h the effect of bubbles or pressure on the release of mps nps from plastic bottles was further investigated using a custom setting as shown in fig 1b there were two hoses inserted into the bottle s cap one connecting to a valve that controlled the inhalation of co2 and the other to the atmosphere directly or to a pressure gauge two treatments were implemented for the first one the pet bottle contained 450 ml ultrapure water and the right hose was connected to the atmosphere directly to allow the pressure inside and outside the bottle to be balanced while the left valve was opened to inject 3 6 7 2 g l co2 this treatment simulated the impact of co2 bubbles in the absence of pressure for the second one the pet bottle was empty and the right hose was connected to a pressure gauge yn 60 1mpa yueqing brady instrument factory while the left hose injected the same volume of co2 as the above then 450ml ultrapure water was poured into the plastic bottle after refrigeration at 4 c for 12 h this treatment replicated the impact of pressure without co2 bubbles to assess the influence of constituents food additives and sugar in carbonated beverages general administration of quality supervision 2008 on the release of mps we examined several frequently used food additives namely sucralose acesulfame sunset yellow and carmine the concentrations of these additives were determined based on the maximum allowable levels specified in the relevant standard commission 2022 with concentrations set at 0 25 g l 0 3 g l 0 1 g l and 0 05 g l respectively the effect of sugar on mps release from plastic bottles was investigated by adding sucrose reagent grade product no v900116 sigma aldrich at concentrations of 0 30 60 and 90 g l representing typical sugar contents in carbonated beverages wierzejska 2022 to eliminate any potential confounding effects originating from mps present in the sucrose itself the sugar laden water underwent exclusive filtration prior to the experiment see text s2 finally the quantities of mps present in two distinct commercial brands of carbonated beverages were meticulously determined aiming to evaluate the potential risks associated with mps release in real world beverages a triplicate of all treatments was performed and the water was then analyzed to determine the number of mps nps and heavy metals that might have leached into the liquid 2 3 mps extraction identification and quantification in this study particles of two sizes mps 1 μm 5 mm and nps 1 μm were considered to identify mps we implemented nile red staining in conjunction with μ ftir spectrometer nicolet in10 thermo fisher scientific usa while the analysis of nps involved the utilization of field emission scanning electron microscope fesem zeiss sigma 300 germany combined with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds mapping as well as nanoparticle tracking analysis nta nanosight ns300 malvern panalytical england in conjunction with pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms py 3030d frontier lab japan 7890b 5977a agilent usa to ensure the accuracy of the methodologies for detecting mps and nps we conducted validation experiments using two positive control samples these samples consisted of predetermined quantities of blue 30 μm polystyrene ps beads product no 84135 sigma aldrich and red 200 nm uniform ps microspheres product no 43302 sigma aldrich the recovery rates for the 30 μm ps beads as determined by nile red staining and μ ftir analysis were found to be 89 4 3 51 and 92 6 4 47 respectively with a percentage difference of 3 46 4 29 observed between the groups additionally the combination of fesem and eds mapping confirmed the absence of any dust contamination in the samples thereby yielding a recovery rate of 81 5 6 97 for the 200 nm ps microspheres similarly nta analysis yielded a recovery rate of 85 6 6 82 for the 200 nm ps microspheres while py gc ms analysis confirmed the composition of the sample as ps the percentage difference between the fesem and nta groups was determined to be 4 91 6 73 these positive control experiments demonstrated acceptable levels of quality 80 110 throughout the experimental procedures bannick et al 2019 the detailed extraction identification and quantification procedures are presented in fig 1c an entire bottle of water was vacuum filtered through a polycarbonate track etched filter membrane pcte 25 mm diameter whatman with a pore size of 1 μm to minimize detection errors of mps furthermore in cases where the sample contains sugar it was rinsed multiple times with deionized water to eliminate any influence from the sugar component to address the possibility of additives particles exhibiting spectra similar to those of mps a washing step employing 30 ml of ethanol high performance liquid chromatography grade product no 64175 sigma aldrich was conducted to mitigate the interference from such particles as reported by li et al 2022 then nile red staining was used to identify the mps retained on the membranes using a method modified from erni cassola et al 2017 a higher nile red solution of 10 μg ml compared to erni cassola et al 2017 was prepared by dissolving nile red technical grade product no n3013 sigma aldrich in methanol to improve the hue after adding approximately 0 05 ml of nile red solution to each filter the filters were kept dark at 60 c with coverslips for 30 min the stained filters were viewed using an inverted fluorescence microscope nikon ti2 e 4x japan under green light 460 550 nm the fluorescent images were used to quantify the particles using the image j software and triplicates were analyzed for each treatment following nile red a comprehensive analysis was conducted on 1 8th of the filter area using the μ ftir spectrometer in visual mode ftir spectra were recorded in transmittance as described in our previous study luo et al 2023 the spectra thus obtained were compared to those in a standard ir library knowitall ir library and those displaying a similarity of more than 85 were identified as mps fig s2 results from nile red and μ ftir were compared if the percentage difference was below 3 46 the average value became the final count for mps otherwise the experiment was repeated the number of nps present in the leachates was estimated using a fesem zeiss sigma 300 germany following the protocol described by hernandez et al 2019 to achieve a homogeneous dispersion of nps the filtrate was supplemented with 10 mg l of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs technical grade product no 25155 30 0 sigma aldrich furthermore to prevent the formation of coffee rings during the drying process the leachates were carefully deposited onto silicon wafers in 10 μl aliquots the drops were incrementally added until a final volume of 200 μl was reached ensuring the uniform dispersion of nps on the silicon substrate fig s3 subsequently sem imaging was performed after the samples were coated with aurum a magnification 50000 was taken to view the nps fig s4a and then counted by image j software considering the relatively simple composition of our experimental samples devoid of complex organic constituents the potential influence stemming from dustfall is the primary factor to be considered the eds mapping was performed on the same samples to differentiate between nps and any potential dust contaminants based on elemental composition inclusion of samples containing carbon and oxygen while lacking magnesium mg and calcium ca was done for nps enumeration purposes fig s4b and s4c additionally the quantification of nps in the leachates was also conducted using the nta technique specifically 10 ml of the filtrate was carefully pipetted and the addition of 10 mg l sdbs ensured the uniform dispersion of nps nta measurements were then performed to count the nps subsequently the chemical composition of the particles in the filtrate was determined by utilizing py gc ms equipment fig s5 the quantification results obtained from fesem and nta techniques were compared if the percentage difference between the two methods was less than 4 91 the average value was used as the final count of mps otherwise the experiment was repeated for improved accuracy and reliability given the inherent challenges associated with maintaining stringent quality control measures refer to text s3 the quantification of nps in the leachate resulting from additive treatment and in actual carbonated beverages was not determined 2 4 analysis a scanning electron microscope sem tescan mira lms czech was utilized to observe the morphological characteristics of the inner surfaces of plastic bottles additionally 3d images of these surfaces were captured using atomic force microscopy afm bruker dimension icon germany the analysis of heavy metals was described in text s4 2 5 quality assurance and quality control to prevent contamination from mps and nps rigorous measures were implemented throughout our experimental procedures for a comprehensive overview of these measures please refer to text s5 2 6 statistical analysis utilizing spss 27 0 statistical analysis was conducted to examine the correlation between various heavy metal concentrations in the leachate the detail can be seen in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of plastic bottle types on the release of mps and nps the results presented in fig 2 a reveal that the number of mps released from different plastic bottle types varied significantly after a single inflation experiment f 1165 36 p 0 001 pp bottles had the highest number of mps released 234 9 66 particles l followed by pet 161 14 94 particles l and the lowest in pe 68 6 20 particles l a higher release of mps from pp compared to pet was also observed by mortula et al 2021 the relatively low release of mps from pe bottles may be attributed to the highly stable secondary carbon in the carbon chain of pe material gewert et al 2015 similarly nps followed the same pattern as mps with pp bottles exhibiting the highest number of nps released 9 21 0 73 107 particles l pet bottles showing an intermediate release 6 32 0 60 107 particles l and pe bottles having the least nps released 3 02 0 59 107 particles l f 464 62 p 0 001 fig 2b therefore it is essential for beverage manufacturers to carefully choose the plastic material for their bottles to reduce the health risks posed by mps particularly nps notably the number of nps was approximately six orders greater than that of mps probably due to the further dissociation of mps mitrano et al 2021 sharma et al 2022 these findings highlight that the consumption of carbonated beverages leads to a greater intake of nps than mps it should be noted however that most publications do not consider nps table s2 despite the fact that they are capable of causing greater environmental harm and human toxicity dong et al 2022 gaylarde et al 2021 yin et al 2021 fig 2c and 2d depicts the amounts of mps and nps released after additional inflation tests of particular interest was that a second inflation treatment resulted in significant reductions of mps 78 9 79 2 68 4 and nps 70 3 52 1 71 0 in pet pp and pe bottles fig 2c and 2d these reductions are much higher than those reported by zhou et al 2023 for washing plastic cups suggesting that carbonated water is more effective than ultrapure water in removing mps nps from plastic bottles moreover after 3 repetitions of the inflation test the removal of mps nps from all plastic bottles reached 91 65 93 18 these findings indicate that high pressure carbonated water treatment similar to repeated inflation experiments before use can effectively minimize the health risks associated with their ingestion to identify the cause of this reduction in mps nps release sem was used to characterize the inner surfaces of the bottles before and after three repeated inflation experiments fig 3 images taken at high resolution revealed that the original pp and pet plastic bottles had a large number of particles attached to the inner wall fig 3a and 3e while the original pe bottles had uneven folds and films fig 3c this difference might be related to the various plastic bottle production methods pet and pp plastic bottles are both made by injecting molten masterbatch into molds under pressure whereas pe plastic bottles are created by blowing plastic blanks and adhering to the interior of the mold and then demolding them after cooling du et al 2020 in this case the plastic particles may break apart into finer granules during the pressurization process and adhere to the surface of the plastic bottles resulting in that pristine bottle being the significant source of mps and nps despite being rinsed with water before use a substantial number of mps and nps were still released fig 2a and 2b fortunately after three inflation treatments the inner walls of the bottles became smooth and clean fig 3b 3d and 3f and the removal of mps nps reached 91 65 93 18 fig 2c and 2d 3 2 the effect of co2 filling volume on the release of mps and nps the co2 filling volume also affected the release of mps nps as observed in fig 4 increasing co2 filling volume significantly enhanced their release mps f 339 16 p 0 001 nps f 2205 33 p 0 001 a possible explanation for this variation was that bubbles could generate stress waves that travel through solid materials when they rupture haosheng and shihan 2009 resulting in plastic particles adhering to the bottle s inner surface falling out considering the high affinity of bubbles for plastic liger belair 2019 zhang et al 2022 these bubbles will adhere to the mps nps on the inner wall and then be transferred to the liquid kim et al 2020 masry et al 2021 obviously the increased filling volume caused a tremendous amount destructive co2 to be released leading to higher mps nps numbers additionally another part of the bubbles would burst on the surface of the attached mps producing finer nps this might explain why the number of nps increased with increasing inflation the destruction of the bubbles continues until they are destroyed xu et al 2021 in a solution the bubbles interact combine to form more giant bubbles disperse and finally cease to form however the bubbles on the walls continued to grow for a long time vega martínez et al 2020 resulting in the continuous release of mps nps while consumers drink carbonated beverages in addition to the cavitation caused and disturbance by bubbles on the bottle s inner surfaces a pressure effect was also involved in drinking carbonated beverages the pressure inside the bottle presented a significant increase with increasing co2 filling volume f 640 43 p 0 001 fig 5 a at a filling amount of 7 2 g l the pressure reached 0 281 mpa equivalent to 2 8 atmospheres fig 5a it was thus clear that the pressure of co2 on the inner walls of pet bottles cannot be ignored to quantify the influence of bubbles and pressure on the release of mps we conducted two separate treatments and the results are presented in fig 5b in the pressure only experiment 142 8 34 particles l mps and 4 94 0 22 107 nps were observed while in the bubble only experiment 118 9 66 particles l mps and 4 27 0 39 107 particles l nps were detected fig 5b our findings indicated that bubbles and pressure as indirect factors induced by co2 injection significantly contribute to the release of mps nps however to the best of our knowledge the individual effects of these factors on mps and nps release have not been evaluated in previous studies therefore a comprehensive investigation on the effects of bubbles and pressure on mps release in other occasions is necessary in the future given their ubiquity in the environment for instance in shallow water substrates the absence or reduction of dissolved oxygen concentration can lead to the activation of anaerobic processes which generate deoxidized gases such as methane hydrogen sulfide and ammonia golosov et al 2012 joye et al 2004 this process can result in the generation of bubbles leading to the weathering of plastics in sediments and the production of mps nps on the other hand water pressure increases at a rate of 0 1 mpa per 10 m depth as seawater depth increases reaching up to approximately 20 mpa at a depth of 2000 m kobayashi et al 2021 this significant pressure can cause the decomposition of plastic products and result in the release of mps nps in the deep sea it should be noted that the combined effect of pressure and bubbles was greater than that of pressure or bubbles alone as indicated by the significantly higher release of mps and nps mps f 69 44 p 0 001 nps f 116 43 p 0 001 fig 5b these results suggest that bubbles and pressure have a synergistic effect on the release of mps nps from plastic bottles the significance of this finding extends to environmental settings particularly in anaerobic zones and natural gas seeps in the deep sea where high pressure and bubble conditions may lead to substantial release of mps nps posing adverse impacts on marine ecosystems and ultimately on human health additionally the presence of co2 in carbonated beverages confers an acidic nature that trigger heavy metal leaching fig s6a with the concentrations of cr ni cu zn cd pb and mn significantly increasing as ph decreases of note the concentration of zn was the highest 125 94 ppb likely due to its extensive use as a plasticizer stabilizer and fungicide in plastic additives chubarenko 2022 kobayashi et al 2021 moreover a noteworthy correlation was found among heavy metal leaching fig s6b highlighting that the investigation of heavy metal leaching from plastic products should not be restricted to a single type 3 3 the effect of temperature on the release of mps and nps the effect of storage temperature on mps nps release was investigated the results revealed a significant positive correlation between decreasing temperature and increased release of mps nps mps f 456 05 p 0 001 nps f 700 69 p 0 001 specifically the release of mps was 307 30 39 159 18 98 and 91 17 74 particles l at 18 c 4 c and 25 c respectively fig 6 a the release of nps was similar with values of 1 09 0 09 10 8 6 32 0 60 10 7 and 3 43 0 21 10 7 particles l at the respective temperatures fig 6b in contrast zhou et al 2023 found that a low temperature of 5 c did not promote the release of mps compared to room temperature which was inconsistent with our findings this discrepancy might be due to the indirect effect of pressure generated by co2 in our experiments the pressure inside the bottle at 4 c was higher than at 25 c fig s7 which likely contributed to the elevated release of mps nps at a temperature of 18 c carbonated beverages were observed to freeze and experienced a 40 increase in volume fig s8 this expansion potentially resulted in plastic cracking and delamination chubarenko 2022 additionally the low temperature and ice rich environment restricted molecular mobility causing the plastic to become more brittle and increasing the likelihood of plastic fragmentation and mps nps release fig 7 b zheng et al 2020 the pressure inside the bottle prior to melting was recorded as zero however after complete melting the pressure reached 0 162 mpa which is likely due to co2 bubble release therefore the combined influence of co2 bubbles pressure and the ice rich environment contributed to the elevated release of mps nps at 18 c making it the condition with the highest release rate the results of sem and afm tests confirmed that the freeze thaw treatment led to the rupture of the plastic bottles the inner surface of the original bottles was relatively clean and smooth with most features less than 3 nm in roughness fig 7a whereas the surface subjected to one freeze thaw cycle showed the formation of fissures with roughness around 6 5 nm and a length of about a dozen micrometers fig 7b this was in agreement with previous findings that reported a rougher surface texture of high density polyethylene bags after a cold storage treatment hee et al 2022 it is evident that plastic containers release a large quantity of mps nps when subjected to high temperatures with concentrations ranging from 78 16 1 10¹¹ particles l table s2 our investigation report that the levels of mps nps released in low temperatures range from 68 4 66 108 particles l a magnitude that should not be overlooked these results underscore the need for further research into the effects of low temperature on the release of mps as the current literature regarding this topic is limited table s2 common consumption practices can lead to the repeated freezing and thawing of carbonated beverages to study the impact of these conditions we performed experiments with 1 to 4 freeze thaw cycles our results shown in fig 6c and 6d indicated a significant increase in the release of mps and nps from plastic bottles as the number of freeze thaw cycles increased mps f 81 92 p 0 001 nps f 797 40 p 0 001 after 4 cycles the release of mps and nps reached 450 38 65 and 2 91 0 10 108 nps per liter respectively additionally more pronounced cracks were observed on the inner wall of the bottles with a mean roughness of 12 7 nm and a root mean square roughness of 15 6 nm fig 7b and 7c therefore consumers are advised to reduce the number of freeze thaw cycles when consuming such carbonated beverages to avoid excessive intake of mps and nps in conclusion repeated freeze thaw processes accelerated the aging and degradation of plastic leading to an increase in mps nps abundance and a decrease in particle sizes the expansion of ice crystals during freezing causes friction against the plastic and subsequently disrupts the polymer molecular chemistry which is a potential mechanism for the subsequent release of mps nps during thawing koutnik et al 2022 the freeze thaw cycle is a very common phenomenon at high latitudes high altitudes and in some temperate regions with approximately 55 of the total land area in the northern hemisphere experiencing annual freeze thaw wang et al 2017 however the duration time intensity and frequency of freeze thaw cycles are likely to increase with global climate change given that freeze thaw cycles are widespread on earth s terrestrial surface this presents a significant risk to ecosystem security and human health by contributing to the release of mps into the environment 3 4 the effect of sugar and food additives on the release of mps the addition of sugar to carbonated water yielded a considerable release of mps in the range of 179 14 18 218 12 32 particles l fig 8 a moreover an upward trend in mps release was observed with increasing sugar content although the trend exhibited a moderate degree of significance the presence of sugar 90 g l led to a rise of approximately 36 57 in mps release compared to carbonated water without sugar the incorporation of sugar enhanced the viscosity of the solution impeding bubble coalescence zhou et al 2021 and promoting the entrapment of mps on the inner surfaces of plastic bottles ultimately facilitating their release into the solution henry and craig 2009 the introduction of additives into carbonated water yielded a range of mps concentrations from 157 81 12 58 to 164 24 13 73 particles l fig 8b importantly no statistically significant differences were observed in the mps content between carbonated water samples with various additives and those without additives mps f 0 825 p 0 512 it is noteworthy that the relatively low dosage of additives compared to co2 and sugar limited their influence on the release of mps in the final phase of our study we selected two brands of carbonated beverages to investigate the release of mps in these genuine market products the outcome unraveled notable quantities of mps with concentrations measuring 281 38 61 33 and 260 52 27 18 particles l respectively fig 8c these values considerably surpass the maximum releases observed in our well controlled experimental setup exhibiting an augmentation ranging from 19 58 to 78 30 the actual composition of carbonated beverages is notably more intricate and might harbor substantial concentrations of mps as corroborated by our preliminary experiments where sugar water at a concentration of 90 g l exhibited levels of 36 1 48 particles l consistent with the findings reported by afrin et al 2022 moreover the handling and storage of actual carbonated beverages involving repeated shaking during transportation and recurrent freeze thaw cycles may potentiate the liberation of mps within the actual beverages unfortunately due to the challenges associated with ensuring stringent quality control measures see text s3 data on nps in actual carbonated beverages were not assessed however drawing from the evidence furnished in this study it is justifiable to infer that the presence of nps within actual carbonated beverages warrants careful consideration and cannot be deemed negligible 4 conclusion our study reported that the levels of mps nps released in iced carbonated beverage bottles range from 68 4 66 108 particles l potentially posing health risks to humans pp bottles released more mps nps than pet and polyethylene pe bottles following 3 repetitions of the inflation test the removal of mps nps from all plastic bottles reached 91 65 93 18 these results suggest that beverage manufacturers could mitigate the ingestion of mps nps in chilled carbonated beverage bottles by choosing appropriate plastic materials or by adopting techniques such as high pressure carbonated water pretreatment our study also revealed for the first time that indirect variables such as co2 bubbles and pressure caused by co2 filling significantly increased the release of mps and nps from plastic bottles furthermore the combined effect of these variables was greater than their individual effects providing cues for further investigation of mps nps release behavior in natural environments characterized by high pressure and bubbles such as the bottom of deep water in addition our research found that repeated freeze thaw cycles from 18 c to 25 c considerably amplified the release of mps and nps attributable to the combined impact of co2 bubbles pressure and the ice rich environment thus it is recommended that consumers limit the number of freeze thaw cycles when consuming carbonated beverages to minimize their ingestion of mps and nps moreover considering the widespread occurrence of freeze thaw cycles on earth s terrestrial surface this phenomenon may accelerate the aging and degradation of plastics in the environment thereby posing potential hazards to ecosystem security the influence of sugar on the release of mps is significant and should not be underestimated conversely the presence of additives in carbonated water has a negligible impact on the release of mps due to their low concentrations importantly our study highlights that actual beverages exhibit a higher release of mps compared to our experimental results emphasizing the need for further investigation and control of mps release in real world scenarios in conclusion our study enhanced the understanding of the risks associated with the release of mps and nps from carbonated beverage bottles and offered strategies for reducing the intake of mps in carbonated beverages furthermore our study could inspire researchers to explore further the release

14666,carbonated beverages are characterized by low temperatures multiple microbubbles high pressure and an acidic environment creating ideal conditions for releasing contaminants from plastic bottles however the release patterns of microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps are poorly understood we investigated the effects of plastic type co2 filling volume temperature sugar content and additive on the leakage of mps nps and heavy metals our results showed that polypropylene bottles released greater mps 234 9 66 particles l and nps 9 21 0 73 107 particles l than polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate bottles however subjecting the plastic bottles to 3 repeated inflation treatments resulted in 91 65 93 18 removal of mps nps the release of mps nps increased with increasing co2 filling volume driven by the synergistic effect of co2 bubbles and pressure after 4 freeze thaw cycles the release of mps and nps significantly increased reaching 450 38 65 mps and 2 91 0 10 108 nps per liter respectively the presence of sugar leads to an elevation in mps release compared to sucrose free carbonated water while the addition of additives to carbonated water exhibits negligible effects on mps release interestingly actual carbonated beverages demonstrated higher mps concentrations 260 52 27 18 281 38 61 33 particles l than those observed in our well controlled experimental setup our study highlights the non negligible risk of mps nps in carbonated beverages at low temperatures and suggests strategies to mitigate human ingestion of mps nps such as selecting appropriate plastic materials high pressure carbonated water pretreatment and minimizing freeze thaw cycles our findings provide insights for further study of the release patterns of the contaminants in natural environments with bubbles pressure low temperature and freeze thaw conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics nanoplastics pressure bubbles freeze thaw cycles 1 introduction when walking down a hot summer street the oppressive heat seems endless as if the earth is thirsty and crying out for water even breathing feels hot and sweat drips down the neck and back but a refreshing glass of ice cold carbonated beverage can offer a welcome respite the cold liquid bursts with a dessert like sweetness and a rush of cooling bubbles that erupted in the mouth delivering exhilaration however while enjoying these drinks have you ever considered the potential release of microplastics mps and other pollutants which could pose a health risk mps defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm in diameter weithmann et al 2018 pose potential threats to human health when ingested in vitro experiments have demonstrated mps ability to infiltrate human cell membranes inducing the generation of reactive oxygen species triggering inflammatory responses and eliciting neurotoxic effects huang et al 2021 these findings emphasize the urgent need for a comprehensive investigation into the release patterns of mps originating from carbonated beverages numerous studies have documented that high temperatures can cause plastic polymers to degrade and fracture leading to the release of mps into ordinary food and beverages astner et al 2019 ranjan et al 2021 nevertheless it is critical to note that low temperatures can also alter the physical characteristics of plastics astner et al 2019 for example plastic becomes fragile when frozen fu et al 2015 presenting a comparable possibility of mps being released unfortunately few studies have examined the pattern of mps release at low temperatures carbon dioxide co2 exhibits higher solubility at lower temperatures liger belair 2019 the shaking when drinking carbonated beverages releases large amounts of co2 microbubbles despite their small size these bubbles may generate destructive forces when they collapse submerged objects such as ship rudders or propellers are susceptible to severe corrosion or mechanical damage from cavitation erosion caused by bubble rupture kadivar et al 2021 moreover mps exhibit greater affinity with bubbles than with ice and water vega martínez et al 2020 enabling their transportation from surfaces to solutions via bubbles consequently the release of mps should also be considered within the context of bubbles it is noteworthy that the release of co2 from carbonated beverages causes an indirect increase in pressure in plastic bottles approximately 0 2 mpa of pressure exists inside a chilled carbonated beverage bottle kuntzleman and sturgis 2020 however higher gas pressure 0 5 mpa can cause severe cracks in the container s physical structure xie et al 2017 observations have revealed that a crack could be formed under low stress for a long time and slowly grow until brittle failure juan et al 2020 these results indicate that the inner walls of plastic bottles are susceptible to leaking significant quantities of mps into the carbonated beverages due to indirect pressure increases by the release of co2 yet this potential pressure effect has been overlooked in past studies considering that high concentrations of co2 released from the carbonated beverages not only scour the plastic bottle s inner wall but also increase the pressure inside it is particularly important to examine the combined effect and their interaction on the mps release dissolved co2 in carbonated beverages also creates a low ph environment prior research has shown that heavy metal leaching from plastic additives is strongly ph dependent with the maximum amounts of the examined elements detected in an acidic environment krol et al 2020 saria et al 2006 the mobility of heavy metals was also accelerated on acidic occasions ph 2 saria et al 2006 therefore the acidity of carbonated beverages may affect the concentration of heavy metals released from plastic bottles in addition to mps the overlooked issue of nanoplastic nps release from plastic bottles deserves attention nps denoting plastic particles with minute dimensions 1 μm gigault et al 2021 are ingested by individuals through a variety of consumer products remarkably a single cup of beverage has been found to contain an astonishing quantity of 3 1 billion nps hernandez et al 2019 while disposable food containers have been observed to harbor approximately 1 million nps liu et al 2022 importantly nps possess a higher potential to harm human health compared to mps rist et al 2018 as they can effectively permeate biological membranes wu et al 2019 research findings indicate that exposure of human hematopoietic cells to nps can instigate cellular oxidative stress and induce primary dna damage rubio et al 2020 therefore it is imperative to consider the release of nps alongside mps the quantification of mps and nps includes the utilization of both mass based methodologies which determine particle quantities based on their mass and number based methodologies which assess particle abundance however to acquire comprehensive information regarding the size morphology concentration and composition of mps nps a synergistic integration of multiple techniques is indispensable as elucidated in the accompanying text s1 this study evaluated the impact of plastic types co2 filling volumes storage temperature freeze thaw cycles sugar content and additives on the release of mps nps and heavy metals from plastic bottles containing carbonated beverages the investigation included an assessment of the individual and combined effects of pressure and co2 bubbles on the release of mps nps induced by co2 filling we aimed to assess the environmental risks from the release of contaminants such as mps nps and heavy metals in carbonated beverages and to investigate the characteristics and patterns of mps nps release in the unique carbonated beverage environment providing important insights to reduce their risk to human health 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of plastic bottles beverage storage bottles with a total volume of 500 ml made of polyethylene pe polypropylene pp and polyethylene terephthalate pet were procured from suzhou qiaojing trading ltd we chose these bottle types based on their widespread use in beverage packaging changwichan and gheewala 2020 poortinga and whitaker 2018 the chemical composition of the bottles was confirmed using micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy μ ftir spectrometer nicolet in10 thermo fisher scientific usa and the corresponding spectra are shown in fig s1 2 2 different treatment of plastic bottles the pristine plastic bottles were subjected to a rinsing procedure with ultrapure water following the guidelines outlined in the general specification for rinsing filling capping machines of plastic bottles general administration of quality supervision 2011 to replicate the pre treatment of plastic bottles prior to their incorporation in an authentic production process subsequently the bottles were carefully air dried in an inverted position to prevent the ingress of airborne contaminants the detailed treatment procedures are delineated in fig 1 a to investigate the impact of plastic bottle types on mps nps release 450 ml of ultrapure water at 4 c was poured into pe pp and pet bottles and 3 6 g l of co2 was injected into them using a soda machine cocosoda dongguan linuo electric co china to simulate carbonated beverages liger belair 2019 liger belair et al 2015 a filter membrane mec membrane 25 mm diameter 0 22 μm pore size bkman was installed between the plastic tube and the glass tube to prevent mps from the co2 and plastic tube entering the bottle during inflation fig 1a the plastic bottles were refrigerated at 4 c for 12 h to mimic chilled beverage storage and then agitated in a shaker at 110 rpm for 15 min to replicate consumer behavior while consuming drinks the period of 15 min was chosen because most consumers prefer to enjoy their drinks within 15 min of receiving their drinks ranjan et al 2021 moreover we conducted repetitive co2 inflation experiments 1 3 times using the same plastic bottles to examine the release pattern of mps we also examined the effect of co2 filling volume 0 g l 3 6 g l 5 4 g l 7 2 g l and storage temperature 18 c 4 c 25 c on the release of mps nps from pet bottles under the conditions described above since carbonated beverages may freeze again after being thawed according to most people s consumption habits experiments were conducted with 1 4 freeze thaw cycles at 18 c for 8 h and 25 c for 16 h the effect of bubbles or pressure on the release of mps nps from plastic bottles was further investigated using a custom setting as shown in fig 1b there were two hoses inserted into the bottle s cap one connecting to a valve that controlled the inhalation of co2 and the other to the atmosphere directly or to a pressure gauge two treatments were implemented for the first one the pet bottle contained 450 ml ultrapure water and the right hose was connected to the atmosphere directly to allow the pressure inside and outside the bottle to be balanced while the left valve was opened to inject 3 6 7 2 g l co2 this treatment simulated the impact of co2 bubbles in the absence of pressure for the second one the pet bottle was empty and the right hose was connected to a pressure gauge yn 60 1mpa yueqing brady instrument factory while the left hose injected the same volume of co2 as the above then 450ml ultrapure water was poured into the plastic bottle after refrigeration at 4 c for 12 h this treatment replicated the impact of pressure without co2 bubbles to assess the influence of constituents food additives and sugar in carbonated beverages general administration of quality supervision 2008 on the release of mps we examined several frequently used food additives namely sucralose acesulfame sunset yellow and carmine the concentrations of these additives were determined based on the maximum allowable levels specified in the relevant standard commission 2022 with concentrations set at 0 25 g l 0 3 g l 0 1 g l and 0 05 g l respectively the effect of sugar on mps release from plastic bottles was investigated by adding sucrose reagent grade product no v900116 sigma aldrich at concentrations of 0 30 60 and 90 g l representing typical sugar contents in carbonated beverages wierzejska 2022 to eliminate any potential confounding effects originating from mps present in the sucrose itself the sugar laden water underwent exclusive filtration prior to the experiment see text s2 finally the quantities of mps present in two distinct commercial brands of carbonated beverages were meticulously determined aiming to evaluate the potential risks associated with mps release in real world beverages a triplicate of all treatments was performed and the water was then analyzed to determine the number of mps nps and heavy metals that might have leached into the liquid 2 3 mps extraction identification and quantification in this study particles of two sizes mps 1 μm 5 mm and nps 1 μm were considered to identify mps we implemented nile red staining in conjunction with μ ftir spectrometer nicolet in10 thermo fisher scientific usa while the analysis of nps involved the utilization of field emission scanning electron microscope fesem zeiss sigma 300 germany combined with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds mapping as well as nanoparticle tracking analysis nta nanosight ns300 malvern panalytical england in conjunction with pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms py 3030d frontier lab japan 7890b 5977a agilent usa to ensure the accuracy of the methodologies for detecting mps and nps we conducted validation experiments using two positive control samples these samples consisted of predetermined quantities of blue 30 μm polystyrene ps beads product no 84135 sigma aldrich and red 200 nm uniform ps microspheres product no 43302 sigma aldrich the recovery rates for the 30 μm ps beads as determined by nile red staining and μ ftir analysis were found to be 89 4 3 51 and 92 6 4 47 respectively with a percentage difference of 3 46 4 29 observed between the groups additionally the combination of fesem and eds mapping confirmed the absence of any dust contamination in the samples thereby yielding a recovery rate of 81 5 6 97 for the 200 nm ps microspheres similarly nta analysis yielded a recovery rate of 85 6 6 82 for the 200 nm ps microspheres while py gc ms analysis confirmed the composition of the sample as ps the percentage difference between the fesem and nta groups was determined to be 4 91 6 73 these positive control experiments demonstrated acceptable levels of quality 80 110 throughout the experimental procedures bannick et al 2019 the detailed extraction identification and quantification procedures are presented in fig 1c an entire bottle of water was vacuum filtered through a polycarbonate track etched filter membrane pcte 25 mm diameter whatman with a pore size of 1 μm to minimize detection errors of mps furthermore in cases where the sample contains sugar it was rinsed multiple times with deionized water to eliminate any influence from the sugar component to address the possibility of additives particles exhibiting spectra similar to those of mps a washing step employing 30 ml of ethanol high performance liquid chromatography grade product no 64175 sigma aldrich was conducted to mitigate the interference from such particles as reported by li et al 2022 then nile red staining was used to identify the mps retained on the membranes using a method modified from erni cassola et al 2017 a higher nile red solution of 10 μg ml compared to erni cassola et al 2017 was prepared by dissolving nile red technical grade product no n3013 sigma aldrich in methanol to improve the hue after adding approximately 0 05 ml of nile red solution to each filter the filters were kept dark at 60 c with coverslips for 30 min the stained filters were viewed using an inverted fluorescence microscope nikon ti2 e 4x japan under green light 460 550 nm the fluorescent images were used to quantify the particles using the image j software and triplicates were analyzed for each treatment following nile red a comprehensive analysis was conducted on 1 8th of the filter area using the μ ftir spectrometer in visual mode ftir spectra were recorded in transmittance as described in our previous study luo et al 2023 the spectra thus obtained were compared to those in a standard ir library knowitall ir library and those displaying a similarity of more than 85 were identified as mps fig s2 results from nile red and μ ftir were compared if the percentage difference was below 3 46 the average value became the final count for mps otherwise the experiment was repeated the number of nps present in the leachates was estimated using a fesem zeiss sigma 300 germany following the protocol described by hernandez et al 2019 to achieve a homogeneous dispersion of nps the filtrate was supplemented with 10 mg l of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate sdbs technical grade product no 25155 30 0 sigma aldrich furthermore to prevent the formation of coffee rings during the drying process the leachates were carefully deposited onto silicon wafers in 10 μl aliquots the drops were incrementally added until a final volume of 200 μl was reached ensuring the uniform dispersion of nps on the silicon substrate fig s3 subsequently sem imaging was performed after the samples were coated with aurum a magnification 50000 was taken to view the nps fig s4a and then counted by image j software considering the relatively simple composition of our experimental samples devoid of complex organic constituents the potential influence stemming from dustfall is the primary factor to be considered the eds mapping was performed on the same samples to differentiate between nps and any potential dust contaminants based on elemental composition inclusion of samples containing carbon and oxygen while lacking magnesium mg and calcium ca was done for nps enumeration purposes fig s4b and s4c additionally the quantification of nps in the leachates was also conducted using the nta technique specifically 10 ml of the filtrate was carefully pipetted and the addition of 10 mg l sdbs ensured the uniform dispersion of nps nta measurements were then performed to count the nps subsequently the chemical composition of the particles in the filtrate was determined by utilizing py gc ms equipment fig s5 the quantification results obtained from fesem and nta techniques were compared if the percentage difference between the two methods was less than 4 91 the average value was used as the final count of mps otherwise the experiment was repeated for improved accuracy and reliability given the inherent challenges associated with maintaining stringent quality control measures refer to text s3 the quantification of nps in the leachate resulting from additive treatment and in actual carbonated beverages was not determined 2 4 analysis a scanning electron microscope sem tescan mira lms czech was utilized to observe the morphological characteristics of the inner surfaces of plastic bottles additionally 3d images of these surfaces were captured using atomic force microscopy afm bruker dimension icon germany the analysis of heavy metals was described in text s4 2 5 quality assurance and quality control to prevent contamination from mps and nps rigorous measures were implemented throughout our experimental procedures for a comprehensive overview of these measures please refer to text s5 2 6 statistical analysis utilizing spss 27 0 statistical analysis was conducted to examine the correlation between various heavy metal concentrations in the leachate the detail can be seen in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of plastic bottle types on the release of mps and nps the results presented in fig 2 a reveal that the number of mps released from different plastic bottle types varied significantly after a single inflation experiment f 1165 36 p 0 001 pp bottles had the highest number of mps released 234 9 66 particles l followed by pet 161 14 94 particles l and the lowest in pe 68 6 20 particles l a higher release of mps from pp compared to pet was also observed by mortula et al 2021 the relatively low release of mps from pe bottles may be attributed to the highly stable secondary carbon in the carbon chain of pe material gewert et al 2015 similarly nps followed the same pattern as mps with pp bottles exhibiting the highest number of nps released 9 21 0 73 107 particles l pet bottles showing an intermediate release 6 32 0 60 107 particles l and pe bottles having the least nps released 3 02 0 59 107 particles l f 464 62 p 0 001 fig 2b therefore it is essential for beverage manufacturers to carefully choose the plastic material for their bottles to reduce the health risks posed by mps particularly nps notably the number of nps was approximately six orders greater than that of mps probably due to the further dissociation of mps mitrano et al 2021 sharma et al 2022 these findings highlight that the consumption of carbonated beverages leads to a greater intake of nps than mps it should be noted however that most publications do not consider nps table s2 despite the fact that they are capable of causing greater environmental harm and human toxicity dong et al 2022 gaylarde et al 2021 yin et al 2021 fig 2c and 2d depicts the amounts of mps and nps released after additional inflation tests of particular interest was that a second inflation treatment resulted in significant reductions of mps 78 9 79 2 68 4 and nps 70 3 52 1 71 0 in pet pp and pe bottles fig 2c and 2d these reductions are much higher than those reported by zhou et al 2023 for washing plastic cups suggesting that carbonated water is more effective than ultrapure water in removing mps nps from plastic bottles moreover after 3 repetitions of the inflation test the removal of mps nps from all plastic bottles reached 91 65 93 18 these findings indicate that high pressure carbonated water treatment similar to repeated inflation experiments before use can effectively minimize the health risks associated with their ingestion to identify the cause of this reduction in mps nps release sem was used to characterize the inner surfaces of the bottles before and after three repeated inflation experiments fig 3 images taken at high resolution revealed that the original pp and pet plastic bottles had a large number of particles attached to the inner wall fig 3a and 3e while the original pe bottles had uneven folds and films fig 3c this difference might be related to the various plastic bottle production methods pet and pp plastic bottles are both made by injecting molten masterbatch into molds under pressure whereas pe plastic bottles are created by blowing plastic blanks and adhering to the interior of the mold and then demolding them after cooling du et al 2020 in this case the plastic particles may break apart into finer granules during the pressurization process and adhere to the surface of the plastic bottles resulting in that pristine bottle being the significant source of mps and nps despite being rinsed with water before use a substantial number of mps and nps were still released fig 2a and 2b fortunately after three inflation treatments the inner walls of the bottles became smooth and clean fig 3b 3d and 3f and the removal of mps nps reached 91 65 93 18 fig 2c and 2d 3 2 the effect of co2 filling volume on the release of mps and nps the co2 filling volume also affected the release of mps nps as observed in fig 4 increasing co2 filling volume significantly enhanced their release mps f 339 16 p 0 001 nps f 2205 33 p 0 001 a possible explanation for this variation was that bubbles could generate stress waves that travel through solid materials when they rupture haosheng and shihan 2009 resulting in plastic particles adhering to the bottle s inner surface falling out considering the high affinity of bubbles for plastic liger belair 2019 zhang et al 2022 these bubbles will adhere to the mps nps on the inner wall and then be transferred to the liquid kim et al 2020 masry et al 2021 obviously the increased filling volume caused a tremendous amount destructive co2 to be released leading to higher mps nps numbers additionally another part of the bubbles would burst on the surface of the attached mps producing finer nps this might explain why the number of nps increased with increasing inflation the destruction of the bubbles continues until they are destroyed xu et al 2021 in a solution the bubbles interact combine to form more giant bubbles disperse and finally cease to form however the bubbles on the walls continued to grow for a long time vega martínez et al 2020 resulting in the continuous release of mps nps while consumers drink carbonated beverages in addition to the cavitation caused and disturbance by bubbles on the bottle s inner surfaces a pressure effect was also involved in drinking carbonated beverages the pressure inside the bottle presented a significant increase with increasing co2 filling volume f 640 43 p 0 001 fig 5 a at a filling amount of 7 2 g l the pressure reached 0 281 mpa equivalent to 2 8 atmospheres fig 5a it was thus clear that the pressure of co2 on the inner walls of pet bottles cannot be ignored to quantify the influence of bubbles and pressure on the release of mps we conducted two separate treatments and the results are presented in fig 5b in the pressure only experiment 142 8 34 particles l mps and 4 94 0 22 107 nps were observed while in the bubble only experiment 118 9 66 particles l mps and 4 27 0 39 107 particles l nps were detected fig 5b our findings indicated that bubbles and pressure as indirect factors induced by co2 injection significantly contribute to the release of mps nps however to the best of our knowledge the individual effects of these factors on mps and nps release have not been evaluated in previous studies therefore a comprehensive investigation on the effects of bubbles and pressure on mps release in other occasions is necessary in the future given their ubiquity in the environment for instance in shallow water substrates the absence or reduction of dissolved oxygen concentration can lead to the activation of anaerobic processes which generate deoxidized gases such as methane hydrogen sulfide and ammonia golosov et al 2012 joye et al 2004 this process can result in the generation of bubbles leading to the weathering of plastics in sediments and the production of mps nps on the other hand water pressure increases at a rate of 0 1 mpa per 10 m depth as seawater depth increases reaching up to approximately 20 mpa at a depth of 2000 m kobayashi et al 2021 this significant pressure can cause the decomposition of plastic products and result in the release of mps nps in the deep sea it should be noted that the combined effect of pressure and bubbles was greater than that of pressure or bubbles alone as indicated by the significantly higher release of mps and nps mps f 69 44 p 0 001 nps f 116 43 p 0 001 fig 5b these results suggest that bubbles and pressure have a synergistic effect on the release of mps nps from plastic bottles the significance of this finding extends to environmental settings particularly in anaerobic zones and natural gas seeps in the deep sea where high pressure and bubble conditions may lead to substantial release of mps nps posing adverse impacts on marine ecosystems and ultimately on human health additionally the presence of co2 in carbonated beverages confers an acidic nature that trigger heavy metal leaching fig s6a with the concentrations of cr ni cu zn cd pb and mn significantly increasing as ph decreases of note the concentration of zn was the highest 125 94 ppb likely due to its extensive use as a plasticizer stabilizer and fungicide in plastic additives chubarenko 2022 kobayashi et al 2021 moreover a noteworthy correlation was found among heavy metal leaching fig s6b highlighting that the investigation of heavy metal leaching from plastic products should not be restricted to a single type 3 3 the effect of temperature on the release of mps and nps the effect of storage temperature on mps nps release was investigated the results revealed a significant positive correlation between decreasing temperature and increased release of mps nps mps f 456 05 p 0 001 nps f 700 69 p 0 001 specifically the release of mps was 307 30 39 159 18 98 and 91 17 74 particles l at 18 c 4 c and 25 c respectively fig 6 a the release of nps was similar with values of 1 09 0 09 10 8 6 32 0 60 10 7 and 3 43 0 21 10 7 particles l at the respective temperatures fig 6b in contrast zhou et al 2023 found that a low temperature of 5 c did not promote the release of mps compared to room temperature which was inconsistent with our findings this discrepancy might be due to the indirect effect of pressure generated by co2 in our experiments the pressure inside the bottle at 4 c was higher than at 25 c fig s7 which likely contributed to the elevated release of mps nps at a temperature of 18 c carbonated beverages were observed to freeze and experienced a 40 increase in volume fig s8 this expansion potentially resulted in plastic cracking and delamination chubarenko 2022 additionally the low temperature and ice rich environment restricted molecular mobility causing the plastic to become more brittle and increasing the likelihood of plastic fragmentation and mps nps release fig 7 b zheng et al 2020 the pressure inside the bottle prior to melting was recorded as zero however after complete melting the pressure reached 0 162 mpa which is likely due to co2 bubble release therefore the combined influence of co2 bubbles pressure and the ice rich environment contributed to the elevated release of mps nps at 18 c making it the condition with the highest release rate the results of sem and afm tests confirmed that the freeze thaw treatment led to the rupture of the plastic bottles the inner surface of the original bottles was relatively clean and smooth with most features less than 3 nm in roughness fig 7a whereas the surface subjected to one freeze thaw cycle showed the formation of fissures with roughness around 6 5 nm and a length of about a dozen micrometers fig 7b this was in agreement with previous findings that reported a rougher surface texture of high density polyethylene bags after a cold storage treatment hee et al 2022 it is evident that plastic containers release a large quantity of mps nps when subjected to high temperatures with concentrations ranging from 78 16 1 10¹¹ particles l table s2 our investigation report that the levels of mps nps released in low temperatures range from 68 4 66 108 particles l a magnitude that should not be overlooked these results underscore the need for further research into the effects of low temperature on the release of mps as the current literature regarding this topic is limited table s2 common consumption practices can lead to the repeated freezing and thawing of carbonated beverages to study the impact of these conditions we performed experiments with 1 to 4 freeze thaw cycles our results shown in fig 6c and 6d indicated a significant increase in the release of mps and nps from plastic bottles as the number of freeze thaw cycles increased mps f 81 92 p 0 001 nps f 797 40 p 0 001 after 4 cycles the release of mps and nps reached 450 38 65 and 2 91 0 10 108 nps per liter respectively additionally more pronounced cracks were observed on the inner wall of the bottles with a mean roughness of 12 7 nm and a root mean square roughness of 15 6 nm fig 7b and 7c therefore consumers are advised to reduce the number of freeze thaw cycles when consuming such carbonated beverages to avoid excessive intake of mps and nps in conclusion repeated freeze thaw processes accelerated the aging and degradation of plastic leading to an increase in mps nps abundance and a decrease in particle sizes the expansion of ice crystals during freezing causes friction against the plastic and subsequently disrupts the polymer molecular chemistry which is a potential mechanism for the subsequent release of mps nps during thawing koutnik et al 2022 the freeze thaw cycle is a very common phenomenon at high latitudes high altitudes and in some temperate regions with approximately 55 of the total land area in the northern hemisphere experiencing annual freeze thaw wang et al 2017 however the duration time intensity and frequency of freeze thaw cycles are likely to increase with global climate change given that freeze thaw cycles are widespread on earth s terrestrial surface this presents a significant risk to ecosystem security and human health by contributing to the release of mps into the environment 3 4 the effect of sugar and food additives on the release of mps the addition of sugar to carbonated water yielded a considerable release of mps in the range of 179 14 18 218 12 32 particles l fig 8 a moreover an upward trend in mps release was observed with increasing sugar content although the trend exhibited a moderate degree of significance the presence of sugar 90 g l led to a rise of approximately 36 57 in mps release compared to carbonated water without sugar the incorporation of sugar enhanced the viscosity of the solution impeding bubble coalescence zhou et al 2021 and promoting the entrapment of mps on the inner surfaces of plastic bottles ultimately facilitating their release into the solution henry and craig 2009 the introduction of additives into carbonated water yielded a range of mps concentrations from 157 81 12 58 to 164 24 13 73 particles l fig 8b importantly no statistically significant differences were observed in the mps content between carbonated water samples with various additives and those without additives mps f 0 825 p 0 512 it is noteworthy that the relatively low dosage of additives compared to co2 and sugar limited their influence on the release of mps in the final phase of our study we selected two brands of carbonated beverages to investigate the release of mps in these genuine market products the outcome unraveled notable quantities of mps with concentrations measuring 281 38 61 33 and 260 52 27 18 particles l respectively fig 8c these values considerably surpass the maximum releases observed in our well controlled experimental setup exhibiting an augmentation ranging from 19 58 to 78 30 the actual composition of carbonated beverages is notably more intricate and might harbor substantial concentrations of mps as corroborated by our preliminary experiments where sugar water at a concentration of 90 g l exhibited levels of 36 1 48 particles l consistent with the findings reported by afrin et al 2022 moreover the handling and storage of actual carbonated beverages involving repeated shaking during transportation and recurrent freeze thaw cycles may potentiate the liberation of mps within the actual beverages unfortunately due to the challenges associated with ensuring stringent quality control measures see text s3 data on nps in actual carbonated beverages were not assessed however drawing from the evidence furnished in this study it is justifiable to infer that the presence of nps within actual carbonated beverages warrants careful consideration and cannot be deemed negligible 4 conclusion our study reported that the levels of mps nps released in iced carbonated beverage bottles range from 68 4 66 108 particles l potentially posing health risks to humans pp bottles released more mps nps than pet and polyethylene pe bottles following 3 repetitions of the inflation test the removal of mps nps from all plastic bottles reached 91 65 93 18 these results suggest that beverage manufacturers could mitigate the ingestion of mps nps in chilled carbonated beverage bottles by choosing appropriate plastic materials or by adopting techniques such as high pressure carbonated water pretreatment our study also revealed for the first time that indirect variables such as co2 bubbles and pressure caused by co2 filling significantly increased the release of mps and nps from plastic bottles furthermore the combined effect of these variables was greater than their individual effects providing cues for further investigation of mps nps release behavior in natural environments characterized by high pressure and bubbles such as the bottom of deep water in addition our research found that repeated freeze thaw cycles from 18 c to 25 c considerably amplified the release of mps and nps attributable to the combined impact of co2 bubbles pressure and the ice rich environment thus it is recommended that consumers limit the number of freeze thaw cycles when consuming carbonated beverages to minimize their ingestion of mps and nps moreover considering the widespread occurrence of freeze thaw cycles on earth s terrestrial surface this phenomenon may accelerate the aging and degradation of plastics in the environment thereby posing potential hazards to ecosystem security the influence of sugar on the release of mps is significant and should not be underestimated conversely the presence of additives in carbonated water has a negligible impact on the release of mps due to their low concentrations importantly our study highlights that actual beverages exhibit a higher release of mps compared to our experimental results emphasizing the need for further investigation and control of mps release in real world scenarios in conclusion our study enhanced the understanding of the risks associated with the release of mps and nps from carbonated beverage bottles and offered strategies for reducing the intake of mps in carbonated beverages furthermore our study could inspire researchers to explore further the release

14667,green ammonia production from wastewater via electrochemical nitrate reduction contributes substantially to the realization of carbon neutrality nonetheless the current electrochemical technology is largely limited by the lack of suitable device for efficient and continuous electroreduction nitrate into ammonia and in situ ammonia recovery here we report a flow through coupled

circulating nitrate containing wastewater using an efficient and selective cl modified cu foam electrode nearly 100 no3 electroreduction efficiency and over 82 5 nh3 faradaic efficiency was realized for a wide range of nitrate containing wastewater from 50 to 200 mg no3 n l 1 moreover this flow through coupled device can continuingly operate at a large current of 800 ma over 100 h with a sustained nh3 yield rate of 420 μg h 1 cm 2 for nitrate containing wastewater treatment 50 mg no3 n l 1 when driven by solar energy the flow through coupled device can also exhibit exceptional real wastewater treatment performance delivering great potential for practical application this work paves a new avenue for clean energy production and environmental sustainability as well as carbon neutrality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrate electroreduction ammonia recovery cl modified cu electrode membrane free electrolyzer flow through coupled device data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction nitrate no3 contributes substantially to the eutrophication and the imbalance of global nitrogen cycle rosca et al 2009 wang et al 2021 globally about 26 22 million tons of nitrate is discharged into the water bodies every year accounting for 19 of the world s fertilizer production lin et al 2001 nevertheless the recovery of nitrate from wastewaters is extremely difficult because of its great solubility and stability in comparison with nitrate ammonia nh3 is a chemical feedstock and zero carbon fuel chang et al 2022 garrido barros et al 2022 and more easily separated and recovered from wastewaters christiaens et al 2017 dutta et al 2022 therefore selective conversion of nitrate into nh3 and in situ nh3 recovery with renewable energy is a feasible pathway to reduce carbon emissions of 76 09 million tons per year contributing to carbon neutrality lim et al 2021 renewable energy driven electrochemical technology may be the best choice to succeed this pathway especially for nitrate containing wastewater of low carbon to nitrogen ratio that are unfeasible by biological denitrification technology treatment tian and yu 2020 however this scenario is largely limited by the lack of suitable device for highly efficient and continuous reduction of nitrate into nh3 and in situ nh3 recovery because previous studies mainly focused on synthesizing high efficiency catalysts to improve the electrochemical no3 to nh3 nitrr performance i e nh3 faradaic efficiency nh3 yield rate in three electrode systems cerrón calle et al 2023 fang et al 2021 he et al 2022 li et al 2020 sun et al 2021 yao et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 overlooking the subsequent nh3 separation and recovery atrashkevich et al 2022 chen et al 2022 although traditional air stripping method was used to ex situ collect nh3 from the electrolytes after nitrr the escape of nh3 during the transfer process may give rise to secondary pollution gao et al 2020 moreover the current nh3 collection methods i e air stripping chen et al 2021b ion exchange huo et al 2020 and adsorption kale et al 2020 sun et al 2022b highly rely on the precise control of ph and or the employment of heating to attain satisfactory nh3 recovery efficiency xiang et al 2020 and thus are unsuitable to connect with the electrochemical nitrr cell for the in situ nh3 recovery as well therefore the development of novel device with simultaneous achievement of nitrate reduction and in situ nh3 recovery is highly attractive and challenging while its core is the rational design of reactor electrolytic nitrr reactor is conducive to converting no3 into nh3 but its efficiency suffers from the limitation of mass transfer at low no3 concentration optimization of the flow model with the porous electrode in reactor has been demonstrated as an effective way to overcome the mass transfer limitation chaplin 2019 when the solution penetrates directly through the electrode pores with a flow through mode the diffusional boundary layer thickness will be reduced to 1μm much lower than that of conventional flow by mode 100 μm thus promoting mass transfer rate liu et al 2021 moreover an undivided and compact electrolytic reactor was designed to avoid membrane pollution and reduce ohmic losses it is well known that the considerable generation and accumulation of oh by product during the nitrr can greatly elevate the ph value facilitating the phase transition of ionic nh4 into gaseous nh3 this process inspired the nh3 recovery by applying a porous gas liquid membrane to construct gas path interfaces and acidic solution to trap nh3 xie et al 2022 meanwhile hollow fiber membrane was adopted for the fast transportation of generated nh3 from the electrolytic reactor to minimize the nh3 oxidation when nh3 containing electrolyte flowed into the hollow fibers the difference in vapor pressure between the electrolyte and acidic solution would drive the diffusion of nh3 through the membrane to acidic solution such a design ensured the biased penetration of gaseous nh3 but prevented the permeation of impurity ions for nh3 recovery as high purity ammonium i e nh4cl nh4 2so4 sun et al 2022a zhang et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 once equipped with a robust nitrr electrode this flow through coupled device could realize the continuous treatment of no3 containing wastewater and in situ nh3 recovery in this study we reported a flow through coupled device for renewable energy driven electrochemical nitrr and in situ nh3 recovery the cores of the coupled device are the efficient cu based electrocatalyst to drive the nitrr preferentially and the novel flow through electrocatalytic cell for continuous wastewater treatment as well as the nh3 recovery reactor which is seamlessly coupled with the electrocatalytic cell and work without any ph adjustment impressively the designed flow through coupled device could continuingly operate at a large current of 800 ma over 100 h with a continuous nh3 yield rate of 420 μg h 1 cm 2 for nitrate containing wastewater treatment further driven by solar energy this flow through coupled device also exhibited exceptional real wastewater treatment capacity delivering great promise for practical application 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents details of chemicals and reagents are provided in text s1 of the supporting information 2 2 fabrication of cl cu electrode a piece of copper foam cu with a standard geometry area 2 0 cm 2 5 cm was ultrasonically cleaned by acetone 1 m hcl and deionized water for 10 minutes respectively to remove organic pollutants metal oxide and residual chemical reagent on its surface and then dried by argon gas next the as mentioned cleaned copper foam was immersed into 0 1 m cucl2 solution in argon atmosphere for 5 minutes to grew a cucl film on the cu surface immediately followed by washing with deionized water subsequently the cucl was reduced in 0 1 m k2so4 solution by lsv from 0 65 v to 0 75 v vs rhe and the cl cu electrode was eventually obtained 2 3 materials characterization the methods of characterization in this study are shown in text s2 of the supplementary materials 2 4 electrochemical measurements all electrochemical measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation chi 660d chenhua shanghai the as obtained electrode 2 0 cm 2 5 cm pt plate and saturated calomel electrode sce were used as the working electrode counter electrode and reference electrode respectively the electrode area immersed in the electrolyte was controlled with 4 cm2 80 ml 0 1 m k2so4 containing 50 mg no3 n l 1 nitrate was evenly added to an h type electrolytic cell separated by a nafion 117 membrane dupont chronoamperometry i t tests at different potentials were conducted to evaluate the nitrate reduction activity of electrocatalysts all polarization curves were obtained until the appearance of steady state curves as for the tests of lsv cv eis curves the cathode area was controlled with 0 5 cm2 the steady linear sweep voltammetry lsv curves were measured at a scan rate of 10 mv s 1 cyclic voltammetry cv curves were performed in the potential window where none faradaic current happened electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was performed in 0 1 m k2so4 solution containing kno3 50 mg no3 n l 1 with frequency ranging from 1 to 100 khz at 0 65 v vs rhe with an amplitude of 5 mv 2 5 the configuration of the flow through coupled device the electrolytic reactor as an undivided cell was mainly composed of two flat identical chambers internal dimensions 9 9 0 5 cm3 made of plexiglass poly methyl methacrylate pmma the cl cu cathode 80 cm2 and dsa anode 80 cm2 were fixed into the chambers and separated by the silicone gaskets with 4 mm spacing to prevent short circuits two ti foils 2 5 cm 1 cm were selected as the current collector 50 bundles of hollow polypropylene pp fiber were assembled into the home made fiber arrays which were placed in acidic solution to act as an nh3 recovery reactor the two open ends of the membrane arrays were fixed with epoxy resin for connecting with electrolytic reactor by rubber tube the length of the single fiber was 45 cm with a wall thickness of 25 7 μm and an internal diameter of 300 μm 2 6 the experiment of nitrate electroreduction and in situ ammonia recovery in flow through coupled device the nitrate containing solution 250 ml with 0 1 m k2so4 was used as synthetic wastewater and circulated by a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 60 ml min 1 the applied current was controlled to 800 ma by a dc power supply during operation nitrate containing wastewater flowed from the anode into the cathode to be reduced into nh3 containing wastewater and then directly guided into the hollow pp fiber arrays immersed into 1 m hcl solution 250 ml to recover nh3 to investigate the stability of the coupled device based on the cl cu electrode 2000 ml synthetic wastewater 50 mg no3 n l 1 was used and refreshed with an interval of 5 hours of electrolysis real industrial wastewater obtained from shanghai aircraft manufacturing co ltd was treated under optimal conditions as for the tests in a continuous flow mode the flow rate of the industrial wastewater was controlled to 30 ml min 1 for ensuring a high conversion efficiency total nitrogen removal efficiency tnremoval and recovery efficiency tnrecovery were adopted as two parameters to evaluate the ability of wastewater denitrification and nitrogen recovery in the flow through coupled device the tnremoval and tnrecovery were calculated according to eqs 1 2 1 t n removal c recoverable theoretical c residual c recoverable theoretical 100 2 t n recovery c recoverable c recoverable theoretical 100 where the cresidual was all the final concentration of n species including no3 n no2 n and nh4 n in the synthetic water or real wastewater after treatment while the crecoverable was the concentration of recovered nh4 n crecoverable theoretical was the initial concentration of nitrate spiked in solution for the synthetic water or was all the initial concentration of n species that may contribute to the recovery part including no3 n no2 n and nh4 n for the real wastewater 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of cl modified cu foam electrode for nitrr although cu electrode is widely used for nitrr bai et al 2022 ge et al 2022 yuan et al 2021 its efficiency still suffers from the weak nitrate adsorption and the sluggish water dissociation abilities carvalho et al 2022 hu et al 2021 recently halogen modification has been identified as an effective method to regulate the electronic structure of metal catalysts for improving reaction kinetics and facilitating water dissociation guo et al 2022 li et al 2021b yang et al 2022b we therefore designed a cl modified cu foam cl cu electrode for nitrr in the designed coupled device because of the following two reasons the first reason is the large electronegativity differences of cl and cu so that cl modification can induce the formation of electronic deficient cu species cuδ to promote the no3 adsorption on the cu electrode surface via electrostatic interaction jiang et al 2022 li et al 2021a the second one is the strong interaction between surface cl species and h2o which is prone to form cl h oh via the transfer of lone pair electrons of cl to the antibonding orbital of o h bond of h2o van der lubbe and fonseca guerra 2019 this process can significantly lengthen and weaken the h oh bond to boost the water dissociation herbert and carter fenk 2021 the cl cu electrode was prepared through a mild oxidation combined with electrochemical reduction method figs s1 and s2 to be specific we first synthesized cucl nanocrystals on the cu foam surface by a rapid redox reaction of cucl2 and cu0 then the as prepared cucl nanocrystals were subjected to an electrochemical reduction process to remove cl atoms by the linear sweep voltammetry lsv scan figs 2 a and s3 s6 under precise control of the electrochemical scanning cycles trace cl modified cu was obtained finally figs 2b and s7 the residual cl on the cu surface was revealed by the corresponding electronic energy loss spectrum eels elemental mapping with cl homogeneously distributed throughout the cu matrix and the cl content in cl cu was estimated to be 1 18 according to the energy dispersive spectroscopy eds quantitative analysis figs 2c and s8 we thus employed x ray photoelectron spectra xps and x ray absorption fine structure xafs to clarify the electronic structure regulation on cu by cl modification fig s9 the cu lmm auger peaks of cl cu were located between those of cucl and cu indicating that the valence state of cu was in the range of 0 1 fig 2d the positively charged cu cuδ in cl cu was also confirmed by x ray absorption near edge structure xanes analysis fig 2e the presence of electronic deficient cuδ in cl cu was originated from the electron transfer from cu to cl chen et al 2021a by further normalizing the threshold intensity in xanes spectrum the average valence state of cu in cl cu was estimated to be 0 32 fig s10 similar to the exafs spectra of cu foil cl cu possessed one dominant peak around 2 54 å assigned to the cu cu metallic coordination fig 2f by fitting the exafs curves the coordination number of cu cl in cl cu electrode was determined to be 0 99 signifying that trace cl was in a low coordination state in comparison with that of the cucl reference 4 figs s11 s13 and table s1 3 2 nitrr performance of cl cu electrode before assessing the effectiveness of cl cu electrode in the proposed flow through coupled device we first sought to evaluate the nitrr activity in a three electrode system to optimize the reaction conditions i e voltage no3 concentrations we adopted the simulated wastewater consisting of 50 mg no3 n l 1 as the electrolyte for nitrr measurements figs s14 and s15 as shown in the lsv curves fig 3 a the addition of no3 into the electrolyte resulted in a more positive onset potential 0 18 v and a greater current density for cl cu compared to cu 0 57 v indicating that the introduction of cl largely improved the no3 reduction ability of cu notably a distinct reduction peak at 0 08 v was visible in the lsv curve of cl cu corresponding to the reduction of cuδ to cu0 however this reduction peak did not appear for cu validating the contribution of residual cl to the formation of cuδ zhou et al 2022 along with the potentials changing from 0 35 v to 0 75 v the nh3 yield rate and nh3 faradaic efficiency fenh3 displayed a volcano like relationship fig 3b and figs s16 s18 the maximal fenh3 of 82 5 appeared at 0 65 v with an outstanding nh3 yield rate of 789 μg h 1 cm 2 41 2 fold higher than that of cu 18 5 μg h 1 cm 2 figs s19 s20 and table s2 to further compare the intrinsic activities of the electrodes we calculated the nh3 yield rate normalized to the electrochemical surface area ecsa to rule out the morphology effect and found cl cu still displayed a 7 fold higher nh3 yield rate than that of cu confirming its better intrinsic activity fig s21 cerrón calle et al 2022 impressively no3 removal efficiency nh3 yield rate and fenh3 of cl cu were superior than those of cu and other reported nitrr electrocatalysts figs 3c s22 s26 and table s3 considering wastewater from different sources with a wide range of nitrate concentrations we investigated the applicability of cl cu in treating wastewater of initial nitrate concentrations from 50 to 200 mg no3 n l 1 noticeably cl cu displayed striking no3 reduction capacities with nearly 100 no3 removal efficiency and over 82 5 fenh3 no matter what initial nitrate concentration fig s27 more importantly cl cu exhibited robust durability during the lasting 20 cycles of reaction which is of great importance for practical applications impressively the cl species stably existed in cl cu based on the results of cl 2p xps spectra after the cycle tests further confirming the excellent stability of electrode figs 3d and s28 s32 besides this cl modicication strategy was also applicable to other metal electrode including fe and sn for fabricating more efficient nitrr electrode fig s33 to comprehensively understand the excellent nitrr activity of cl cu we intended to investigate the functions of cl and cuδ species figs s34 s38 kumar et al 2022 the cl cu was treated in h2 ar atmosphere to adjust the cl content and check the effect of cl towards nitrr after the treatment the cl atomic ratio decreased from 1 25 to 0 65 and the no3 removal rate constant declined from 0 048 min 1 to 0 019 min 1 demonstrating that the cl content played a vital role in nitrr performance fig s39 considering that cuδ may have an electrostatic interaction with no3 to promote no3 absorption time resolved attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir spectra was conducted figs s40 s42 mikhaylov et al 2013 wu and cheng 2006 as shown in fig 4 a the intensity of no3 adsorption peak on cl cu gradually enhanced with the increment of time in atr ftir spectra implying its stronger no3 adsorption ability than that of cu meanwhile the no3 adsorption peak for cl cu slightly shifted to lower wavenumber 1215 cm 1 suggesting the stronger electronic interaction between cuδ sites and no3 consequently stretching the n o bond fig 4b hirakawa et al 2017 furthermore we applied the in situ atr ftir to dynamically monitor the evolution of adsorbates on the electrodes surface during nitrr figs 4c and s43 the absorption band of no3 turned to be negative going representing the consumption of nitrate interestingly the δhoh mode at 1630 cm 1 on cl cu was red shifted by 18 cm 1 with respect to that of cu which was ascribed to the largely stretching the h oh bond by the newly formed cl h oh bond li et al 2022b wuttig et al 2016 the formation of cl h oh bond was found to improve the water dissociation ability of cu favoring the generation of atomic h h as the h signals of cl cu were markedly stronger than that of cu and then dramatically attenuated after introducing nitrate into the electrolyte fig 4d the deep participation of h in nitrr was validated by the apparent rate constant declined from 0 048 min 1 to 0 024 min 1 with the addition of tertiary butanol tba as a scavenger to quench atomic h for cl cu as well as a smaller kinetic isotope effect kie of cl cu kie 1 69 than that of cu kie 3 84 figs s44 and s45 xu et al 2022 zheng et al 2021 because the formed h bond in cl cu could greatly accelerate the proton delivery process compared to cu dft calculations were also performed to gain insights into the role of cl in catalyzing nitrr according to the bader charge and electron localization function elf analysis the cl could obtain 0 28 electrons from the directly bonded cu atoms leading to the formation of cuδ figs 4e and s46 s48 and we found that the newly formed cuδ sites on cl cu were preferable to absorbing no3 owing to more negative adsorption energy 0 65 ev than that 0 28 ev of cu in good agreement with the time resolved atr ftir results figs 4f and s49 s50 wang et al 2020 meanwhile we investigated the influence of cl modification for h2o dissociation kinetics to unveil the better nitrr performance of cl cu fig 4g and figs s51 s53 the cl modification of cu results in the formation of cl h oh hydrogen bond which could stretch the o h bond of the adsorbed h2o from 0 98 å to 1 05 å consistent with the red shift of the o h vibration on the cl cu in in situ atr ftir especially the h bond dramatically lowered the energy barrier of h2o dissociation from 0 81 ev to 0 39 ev confirming that h2o could be efficiently dissociated on cl cu the above results have revealed that the excellent nitrr performance of cl cu stems from the dual promotion of nitrate adsorption and water dissociation where the electron deficient cuδ sites are responsible for enhancing the absorption of no3 while the cl sites facilitate the water dissociation to generate atomic h for promoting the subsequent reduction and hydrogenation of no3 3 3 the performance of flow through coupled device based on the cl cu electrode the exceptional nitrr performance of the cl cu electrode and its self supported nature therefore allowed us to construct the proposed flow through coupled device for continuous electroreduction nitrate to ammonia and in situ ammonia recovery christiaens et al 2019 gao et al 2021 gao et al 2022 we selected a commercial ruirti dsa electrode as the anode and a gas permeable polypropylene pp fiber membrane with hollow structure to improve the subsequent gas separation efficiency as well as 1 m hcl solution to adsorb the produced nh3 to produce nh4cl figs 5 a and s54 s59 for a simulated nitrate containing wastewater 50 mg no3 n l 1 this coupled device based on cl cu electrode removed 99 7 of tnremval and synchronously recovered 99 2 of tnrecovery at 10 ma cm 2 in 120 min fig 5b and 5c for practical application a long term durability at a large current is of great significance fig 5d impressively cl cu exhibited robust durability for the continuing operation at 800 ma with a stable nh3 yield rate of 420 μg h 1 cm 2 after 100 h of operation approximately 10 6 g solid power was obtained via rotary evaporation of nh3 recovery solution which was found to be ammonium chloride nh4cl by x ray diffraction spectra xrd 1h nmr spectroscopy and ion chromatography ic figs 5e and s60 s63 the flow through coupled device based on the cl cu electrode was further used to treat real industrial wastewater whose c n ratio gcod gn was merely 0 64 far below the requirement for traditional biological denitrification technology with a c n ratio of 3 5 table s4 tian and yu 2020 as shown in fig 5f the incorporation of robust cl cu into the coupled device could rapidly remove total nitrogen and recover ammonia finally achieving 91 2 of tnremoval with 87 5 of tnrecovery in sharp contrast after substituting cl cu with cu electrode such performances were significantly dropped to 57 4 and 49 8 respectively fig s64 to further assess the potential utility of flow through coupled device it was requisite to operate the device in a continuous flow mode in view of the variations in the wastewater quality of the influent adjusting the operational parameters like increasing the number of devices endowed a strong anti interference ability for ensuring a high conversion efficiency kuang et al 2022 as expected two tandem units could more obviously decrease the effluent concentration of tn and nh4 n in industrial wastewater than single unit fig s65 and s66a b strikingly this assembled system of two tandem units could realize 91 6 of tnremoval with 89 7 of tnrecovery and decline the concentration of toxic no2 n by product to 0 3 mg l 1 during the continuous flow operation of treating industrial wastewater at a high flux of 112 5 l m 2 l 1 figs 5g and s66c meanwhile the concentration of residual no3 n and nh4 n in the effluent was as low as 8 3 and 0 78 mg l 1 respectively far below the world health organization who regulations for drinking water 10 mg no3 n l 1 15 nh4 n mg l 1 fig s67 furthermore the concentration of cu released from cl cu during the continuous flow treatment was below 0 05 mg l 1 fig s68 fulfilling the standard of emission regulations of chinese electroplating pollutants gb 25467 2010 less than 1 0 mg l 1 for cu2 note that there was no apparent sign of activity attenuation at the end of the measurement suggesting that the assembled system based on cl cu electrode hold a huge potential for long term practical applications at near realistic conditions 3 4 economic feasibility analysis of flow through coupled device the excellent performance of flow through coupled device has been validated from a technological point of view and the economic feasibility is another key parameter to be considered through the utilization of cl cu the energy consumption of flow through coupled device was calculated to be 4 8 kw m 3 and 1 34 kw mol 1 which was lower than those of mostly reported electrocatalytic reactor for nitrate removal tables s5 and s6 although the cost of electrochemical nitrogen reovery was still higher that that of traditional biological denitrification our strategy would be more attractive for the low c n ratio or carbon free wastewater treatment impressively the electrochemical nitrogen reovery can significantly decrease carbon emmission of 909 1680 gco2 per 1 ton no3 containing wastewater 105 1 mg n l 1 c n 0 64 while the biological denitrification requires additional carbon source 3 5 gc gn and results in carbon emmission to a certain extent yang et al 2022a more importantly the expenditure of 1 ton no3 containing wastewater treatment with the flow through coupled device was significantly reduced by 21 to 33 after considering the profits of the recovered nh3 fig 6 a table s7 in pursuit of further cost down for sustainable wastewater denitrification and green nh3 production we adopted a solar cell to drive the flow through coupled device fig 6b li et al 2022a strikingly the solar energy driven flow through coupled device realized 93 5 of tnremoval and 89 7 of tnrecovery in 3 h under simulated solar illumination 100 mw cm 2 fig s69 when switching the light source from simulated solar illumination to sunlight fig 6c the solar energy driven coupled device remained excellent performance more importantly during the long time sunlight irradiation from 8 30 to 15 30 the concentration of recovered nh4 n continuously increased up to 509 mg l 1 and the average fe of nh4 n reached 50 7 during 7 hours of operation fig 6d winkler et al 2013 overall we have demonstrated that this flow through coupled device based on cl cu electrode is very promising and affordable for the industrial treatment of n containing wastewater and resource recovery 4 conclusions in summary we have designed a flow through coupled device composed of a novel compact flow through electrochemical cell and an ammonia recovery unit for simultaneous nitrate electroreduction to ammonia and in situ ammonia recovery for the first time the cores of the coupled device are the cl modified cu foam cathode to drive the nitrr preferentially with the commercial dsa anode spatially separated by a silicone pad instead of traditional ions exchange membrane accelerating the mass transfer to guarantee the quick conversion of nitrr and the fast transportation of produced nh3 to the recovery unit to minimize the possible nh3 oxidation and the nh3 recovery reactor which is seamlessly coupled with the electrocatalytic cell and work without any ph adjustment and additional energy input of wastewater the cl modified cu foam cathode displayed nearly 100 no3 electroreduction efficiency and over 82 5 nh3 faradaic efficiency in 120 min electrolysis no matter what initial nitrate concentration in range of 50 to 200 mg no3 n l 1 the flow through coupled device could continuingly operate at a large current of 800 ma over 100 h with a continuous nh3 yield rate of 420 μg h 1 cm 2 for nitrate containing wastewater treatment 50 mg no3 n l 1 when driven by solar energy the flow through coupled device also exhibited exceptional practical wastewater treatment performance offering a promising strategy for carbon neutrality declaration

mass transfer rate liu et al 2021 moreover an undivided and compact electrolytic reactor was designed to avoid membrane pollution and reduce ohmic losses it is well known that the considerable generation and accumulation of oh by product during the nitrr can greatly elevate the ph value facilitating the phase transition of ionic nh4 into gaseous nh3 this process inspired the nh3 recovery by applying a porous gas liquid membrane to construct gas path interfaces and acidic solution to trap nh3 xie et al 2022 meanwhile hollow fiber membrane was adopted for the fast transportation of generated nh3 from the electrolytic reactor to minimize the nh3 oxidation when nh3 containing electrolyte flowed into the hollow fibers the difference in vapor pressure between the electrolyte and acidic solution would drive the diffusion of nh3 through the membrane to acidic solution such a design ensured the biased penetration of gaseous nh3 but prevented the permeation of impurity ions for nh3 recovery as high purity ammonium i e nh4cl nh4 2so4 sun et al 2022a zhang et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 once equipped with a robust nitrr electrode this flow through coupled device could realize the continuous treatment of no3 containing wastewater and in situ nh3 recovery in this study we reported a flow through coupled device for renewable energy driven electrochemical nitrr and in situ nh3 recovery the cores of the coupled device are the efficient cu based electrocatalyst to drive the nitrr preferentially and the novel flow through electrocatalytic cell for continuous wastewater treatment as well as the nh3 recovery reactor which is seamlessly coupled with the electrocatalytic cell and work without any ph adjustment impressively the designed flow through coupled device could continuingly operate at a large current of 800 ma over 100 h with a continuous nh3 yield rate of 420 μg h 1 cm 2 for nitrate containing wastewater treatment further driven by solar energy this flow through coupled device also exhibited exceptional real wastewater treatment capacity delivering great promise for practical application 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents details of chemicals and reagents are provided in text s1 of the supporting information 2 2 fabrication of cl cu electrode a piece of copper foam cu with a standard geometry area 2 0 cm 2 5 cm was ultrasonically cleaned by acetone 1 m hcl and deionized water for 10 minutes respectively to remove organic pollutants metal oxide and residual chemical reagent on its surface and then dried by argon gas next the as mentioned cleaned copper foam was immersed into 0 1 m cucl2 solution in argon atmosphere for 5 minutes to grew a cucl film on the cu surface immediately followed by washing with deionized water subsequently the cucl was reduced in 0 1 m k2so4 solution by lsv from 0 65 v to 0 75 v vs rhe and the cl cu electrode was eventually obtained 2 3 materials characterization the methods of characterization in this study are shown in text s2 of the supplementary materials 2 4 electrochemical measurements all electrochemical measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation chi 660d chenhua shanghai the as obtained electrode 2 0 cm 2 5 cm pt plate and saturated calomel electrode sce were used as the working electrode counter electrode and reference electrode respectively the electrode area immersed in the electrolyte was controlled with 4 cm2 80 ml 0 1 m k2so4 containing 50 mg no3 n l 1 nitrate was evenly added to an h type electrolytic cell separated by a nafion 117 membrane dupont chronoamperometry i t tests at different potentials were conducted to evaluate the nitrate reduction activity of electrocatalysts all polarization curves were obtained until the appearance of steady state curves as for the tests of lsv cv eis curves the cathode area was controlled with 0 5 cm2 the steady linear sweep voltammetry lsv curves were measured at a scan rate of 10 mv s 1 cyclic voltammetry cv curves were performed in the potential window where none faradaic current happened electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was performed in 0 1 m k2so4 solution containing kno3 50 mg no3 n l 1 with frequency ranging from 1 to 100 khz at 0 65 v vs rhe with an amplitude of 5 mv 2 5 the configuration of the flow through coupled device the electrolytic reactor as an undivided cell was mainly composed of two flat identical chambers internal dimensions 9 9 0 5 cm3 made of plexiglass poly methyl methacrylate pmma the cl cu cathode 80 cm2 and dsa anode 80 cm2 were fixed into the chambers and separated by the silicone gaskets with 4 mm spacing to prevent short circuits two ti foils 2 5 cm 1 cm were selected as the current collector 50 bundles of hollow polypropylene pp fiber were assembled into the home made fiber arrays which were placed in acidic solution to act as an nh3 recovery reactor the two open ends of the membrane arrays were fixed with epoxy resin for connecting with electrolytic reactor by rubber tube the length of the single fiber was 45 cm with a wall thickness of 25 7 μm and an internal diameter of 300 μm 2 6 the experiment of nitrate electroreduction and in situ ammonia recovery in flow through coupled device the nitrate containing solution 250 ml with 0 1 m k2so4 was used as synthetic wastewater and circulated by a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 60 ml min 1 the applied current was controlled to 800 ma by a dc power supply during operation nitrate containing wastewater flowed from the anode into the cathode to be reduced into nh3 containing wastewater and then directly guided into the hollow pp fiber arrays immersed into 1 m hcl solution 250 ml to recover nh3 to investigate the stability of the coupled device based on the cl cu electrode 2000 ml synthetic wastewater 50 mg no3 n l 1 was used and refreshed with an interval of 5 hours of electrolysis real industrial wastewater obtained from shanghai aircraft manufacturing co ltd was treated under optimal conditions as for the tests in a continuous flow mode the flow rate of the industrial wastewater was controlled to 30 ml min 1 for ensuring a high conversion efficiency total nitrogen removal efficiency tnremoval and recovery efficiency tnrecovery were adopted as two parameters to evaluate the ability of wastewater denitrification and nitrogen recovery in the flow through coupled device the tnremoval and tnrecovery were calculated according to eqs 1 2 1 t n removal c recoverable theoretical c residual c recoverable theoretical 100 2 t n recovery c recoverable c recoverable theoretical 100 where the cresidual was all the final concentration of n species including no3 n no2 n and nh4 n in the synthetic water or real wastewater after treatment while the crecoverable was the concentration of recovered nh4 n crecoverable theoretical was the initial concentration of nitrate spiked in solution for the synthetic water or was all the initial concentration of n species that may contribute to the recovery part including no3 n no2 n and nh4 n for the real wastewater 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of cl modified cu foam electrode for nitrr although cu electrode is widely used for nitrr bai et al 2022 ge et al 2022 yuan et al 2021 its efficiency still suffers from the weak nitrate adsorption and the sluggish water dissociation abilities carvalho et al 2022 hu et al 2021 recently halogen modification has been identified as an effective method to regulate the electronic structure of metal catalysts for improving reaction kinetics and facilitating water dissociation guo et al 2022 li et al 2021b yang et al 2022b we therefore designed a cl modified cu foam cl cu electrode for nitrr in the designed coupled device because of the following two reasons the first reason is the large electronegativity differences of cl and cu so that cl modification can induce the formation of electronic deficient cu species cuδ to promote the no3 adsorption on the cu electrode surface via electrostatic interaction jiang et al 2022 li et al 2021a the second one is the strong interaction between surface cl species and h2o which is prone to form cl h oh via the transfer of lone pair electrons of cl to the antibonding orbital of o h bond of h2o van der lubbe and fonseca guerra 2019 this process can significantly lengthen and weaken the h oh bond to boost the water dissociation herbert and carter fenk 2021 the cl cu electrode was prepared through a mild oxidation combined with electrochemical reduction method figs s1 and s2 to be specific we first synthesized cucl nanocrystals on the cu foam surface by a rapid redox reaction of cucl2 and cu0 then the as prepared cucl nanocrystals were subjected to an electrochemical reduction process to remove cl atoms by the linear sweep voltammetry lsv scan figs 2 a and s3 s6 under precise control of the electrochemical scanning cycles trace cl modified cu was obtained finally figs 2b and s7 the residual cl on the cu surface was revealed by the corresponding electronic energy loss spectrum eels elemental mapping with cl homogeneously distributed throughout the cu matrix and the cl content in cl cu was estimated to be 1 18 according to the energy dispersive spectroscopy eds quantitative analysis figs 2c and s8 we thus employed x ray photoelectron spectra xps and x ray absorption fine structure xafs to clarify the electronic structure regulation on cu by cl modification fig s9 the cu lmm auger peaks of cl cu were located between those of cucl and cu indicating that the valence state of cu was in the range of 0 1 fig 2d the positively charged cu cuδ in cl cu was also confirmed by x ray absorption near edge structure xanes analysis fig 2e the presence of electronic deficient cuδ in cl cu was originated from the electron transfer from cu to cl chen et al 2021a by further normalizing the threshold intensity in xanes spectrum the average valence state of cu in cl cu was estimated to be 0 32 fig s10 similar to the exafs spectra of cu foil cl cu possessed one dominant peak around 2 54 å assigned to the cu cu metallic coordination fig 2f by fitting the exafs curves the coordination number of cu cl in cl cu electrode was determined to be 0 99 signifying that trace cl was in a low coordination state in comparison with that of the cucl reference 4 figs s11 s13 and table s1 3 2 nitrr performance of cl cu electrode before assessing the effectiveness of cl cu electrode in the proposed flow through coupled device we first sought to evaluate the nitrr activity in a three electrode system to optimize the reaction conditions i e voltage no3 concentrations we adopted the simulated wastewater consisting of 50 mg no3 n l 1 as the electrolyte for nitrr measurements figs s14 and s15 as shown in the lsv curves fig 3 a the addition of no3 into the electrolyte resulted in a more positive onset potential 0 18 v and a greater current density for cl cu compared to cu 0 57 v indicating that the introduction of cl largely improved the no3 reduction ability of cu notably a distinct reduction peak at 0 08 v was visible in the lsv curve of cl cu corresponding to the reduction of cuδ to cu0 however this reduction peak did not appear for cu validating the contribution of residual cl to the formation of cuδ zhou et al 2022 along with the potentials changing from 0 35 v to 0 75 v the nh3 yield rate and nh3 faradaic efficiency fenh3 displayed a volcano like relationship fig 3b and figs s16 s18 the maximal fenh3 of 82 5 appeared at 0 65 v with an outstanding nh3 yield rate of 789 μg h 1 cm 2 41 2 fold higher than that of cu 18 5 μg h 1 cm 2 figs s19 s20 and table s2 to further compare the intrinsic activities of the electrodes we calculated the nh3 yield rate normalized to the electrochemical surface area ecsa to rule out the morphology effect and found cl cu still displayed a 7 fold higher nh3 yield rate than that of cu confirming its better intrinsic activity fig s21 cerrón calle et al 2022 impressively no3 removal efficiency nh3 yield rate and fenh3 of cl cu were superior than those of cu and other reported nitrr electrocatalysts figs 3c s22 s26 and table s3 considering wastewater from different sources with a wide range of nitrate concentrations we investigated the applicability of cl cu in treating wastewater of initial nitrate concentrations from 50 to 200 mg no3 n l 1 noticeably cl cu displayed striking no3 reduction capacities with nearly 100 no3 removal efficiency and over 82 5 fenh3 no matter what initial nitrate concentration fig s27 more importantly cl cu exhibited robust durability during the lasting 20 cycles of reaction which is of great importance for practical applications impressively the cl species stably existed in cl cu based on the results of cl 2p xps spectra after the cycle tests further confirming the excellent stability of electrode figs 3d and s28 s32 besides this cl modicication strategy was also applicable to other metal electrode including fe and sn for fabricating more efficient nitrr electrode fig s33 to comprehensively understand the excellent nitrr activity of cl cu we intended to investigate the functions of cl and cuδ species figs s34 s38 kumar et al 2022 the cl cu was treated in h2 ar atmosphere to adjust the cl content and check the effect of cl towards nitrr after the treatment the cl atomic ratio decreased from 1 25 to 0 65 and the no3 removal rate constant declined from 0 048 min 1 to 0 019 min 1 demonstrating that the cl content played a vital role in nitrr performance fig s39 considering that cuδ may have an electrostatic interaction with no3 to promote no3 absorption time resolved attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir spectra was conducted figs s40 s42 mikhaylov et al 2013 wu and cheng 2006 as shown in fig 4 a the intensity of no3 adsorption peak on cl cu gradually enhanced with the increment of time in atr ftir spectra implying its stronger no3 adsorption ability than that of cu meanwhile the no3 adsorption peak for cl cu slightly shifted to lower wavenumber 1215 cm 1 suggesting the stronger electronic interaction between cuδ sites and no3 consequently stretching the n o bond fig 4b hirakawa et al 2017 furthermore we applied the in situ atr ftir to dynamically monitor the evolution of adsorbates on the electrodes surface during nitrr figs 4c and s43 the absorption band of no3 turned to be negative going representing the consumption of nitrate interestingly the δhoh mode at 1630 cm 1 on cl cu was red shifted by 18 cm 1 with respect to that of cu which was ascribed to the largely stretching the h oh bond by the newly formed cl h oh bond li et al 2022b wuttig et al 2016 the formation of cl h oh bond was found to improve the water dissociation ability of cu favoring the generation of atomic h h as the h signals of cl cu were markedly stronger than that of cu and then dramatically attenuated after introducing nitrate into the electrolyte fig 4d the deep participation of h in nitrr was validated by the apparent rate constant declined from 0 048 min 1 to 0 024 min 1 with the addition of tertiary butanol tba as a scavenger to quench atomic h for cl cu as well as a smaller kinetic isotope effect kie of cl cu kie 1 69 than that of cu kie 3 84 figs s44 and s45 xu et al 2022 zheng et al 2021 because the formed h bond in cl cu could greatly accelerate the proton delivery process compared to cu dft calculations were also performed to gain insights into the role of cl in catalyzing nitrr according to the bader charge and electron localization function elf analysis the cl could obtain 0 28 electrons from the directly bonded cu atoms leading to the formation of cuδ figs 4e and s46 s48 and we found that the newly formed cuδ sites on cl cu were preferable to absorbing no3 owing to more negative adsorption energy 0 65 ev than that 0 28 ev of cu in good agreement with the time resolved atr ftir results figs 4f and s49 s50 wang et al 2020 meanwhile we investigated the influence of cl modification for h2o dissociation kinetics to unveil the better nitrr performance of cl cu fig 4g and figs s51 s53 the cl modification of cu results in the formation of cl h oh hydrogen bond which could stretch the o h bond of the adsorbed h2o from 0 98 å to 1 05 å consistent with the red shift of the o h vibration on the cl cu in in situ atr ftir especially the h bond dramatically lowered the energy barrier of h2o dissociation from 0 81 ev to 0 39 ev confirming that h2o could be efficiently dissociated on cl cu the above results have revealed that the excellent nitrr performance of cl cu stems from the dual promotion of nitrate adsorption and water dissociation where the electron deficient cuδ sites are responsible for enhancing the absorption of no3 while the cl sites facilitate the water dissociation to generate atomic h for promoting the subsequent reduction and hydrogenation of no3 3 3 the performance of flow through coupled device based on the cl cu electrode the exceptional nitrr performance of the cl cu electrode and its self supported nature therefore allowed us to construct the proposed flow through coupled device for continuous electroreduction nitrate to ammonia and in situ ammonia recovery christiaens et al 2019 gao et al 2021 gao et al 2022 we selected a commercial ruirti dsa electrode as the anode and a gas permeable polypropylene pp fiber membrane with hollow structure to improve the subsequent gas separation efficiency as well as 1 m hcl solution to adsorb the produced nh3 to produce nh4cl figs 5 a and s54 s59 for a simulated nitrate containing wastewater 50 mg no3 n l 1 this coupled device based on cl cu electrode removed 99 7 of tnremval and synchronously recovered 99 2 of tnrecovery at 10 ma cm 2 in 120 min fig 5b and 5c for practical application a long term durability at a large current is of great significance fig 5d impressively cl cu exhibited robust durability for the continuing operation at 800 ma with a stable nh3 yield rate of 420 μg h 1 cm 2 after 100 h of operation approximately 10 6 g solid power was obtained via rotary evaporation of nh3 recovery solution which was found to be ammonium chloride nh4cl by x ray diffraction spectra xrd 1h nmr spectroscopy and ion chromatography ic figs 5e and s60 s63 the flow through coupled device based on the cl cu electrode was further used to treat real industrial wastewater whose c n ratio gcod gn was merely 0 64 far below the requirement for traditional biological denitrification technology with a c n ratio of 3 5 table s4 tian and yu 2020 as shown in fig 5f the incorporation of robust cl cu into the coupled device could rapidly remove total nitrogen and recover ammonia finally achieving 91 2 of tnremoval with 87 5 of tnrecovery in sharp contrast after substituting cl cu with cu electrode such performances were significantly dropped to 57 4 and 49 8 respectively fig s64 to further assess the potential utility of flow through coupled device it was requisite to operate the device in a continuous flow mode in view of the variations in the wastewater quality of the influent adjusting the operational parameters like increasing the number of devices endowed a strong anti interference ability for ensuring a high conversion efficiency kuang et al 2022 as expected two tandem units could more obviously decrease the effluent concentration of tn and nh4 n in industrial wastewater than single unit fig s65 and s66a b strikingly this assembled system of two tandem units could realize 91 6 of tnremoval with 89 7 of tnrecovery and decline the concentration of toxic no2 n by product to 0 3 mg l 1 during the continuous flow operation of treating industrial wastewater at a high flux of 112 5 l m 2 l 1 figs 5g and s66c meanwhile the concentration of residual no3 n and nh4 n in the effluent was as low as 8 3 and 0 78 mg l 1 respectively far below the world health organization who regulations for drinking water 10 mg no3 n l 1 15 nh4 n mg l 1 fig s67 furthermore the concentration of cu released from cl cu during the continuous flow treatment was below 0 05 mg l 1 fig s68 fulfilling the standard of emission regulations of chinese electroplating pollutants gb 25467 2010 less than 1 0 mg l 1 for cu2 note that there was no apparent sign of activity attenuation at the end of the measurement suggesting that the assembled system based on cl cu electrode hold a huge potential for long term practical applications at near realistic conditions 3 4 economic feasibility analysis of flow through coupled device the excellent performance of flow through coupled device has been validated from a technological point of view and the economic feasibility is another key parameter to be considered through the utilization of cl cu the energy consumption of flow through coupled device was calculated to be 4 8 kw m 3 and 1 34 kw mol 1 which was lower than those of mostly reported electrocatalytic reactor for nitrate removal tables s5 and s6 although the cost of electrochemical nitrogen reovery was still higher that that of traditional biological denitrification our strategy would be more attractive for the low c n ratio or carbon free wastewater treatment impressively the electrochemical nitrogen reovery can significantly decrease carbon emmission of 909 1680 gco2 per 1 ton no3 containing wastewater 105 1 mg n l 1 c n 0 64 while the biological denitrification requires additional carbon source 3 5 gc gn and results in carbon emmission to a certain extent yang et al 2022a more importantly the expenditure of 1 ton no3 containing wastewater treatment with the flow through coupled device was significantly reduced by 21 to 33 after considering the profits of the recovered nh3 fig 6 a table s7 in pursuit of further cost down for sustainable wastewater denitrification and green nh3 production we adopted a solar cell to drive the flow through coupled device fig 6b li et al 2022a strikingly the solar energy driven flow through coupled device realized 93 5 of tnremoval and 89 7 of tnrecovery in 3 h under simulated solar illumination 100 mw cm 2 fig s69 when switching the light source from simulated solar illumination to sunlight fig 6c the solar energy driven coupled device remained excellent performance more importantly during the long time sunlight irradiation from 8 30 to 15 30 the concentration of recovered nh4 n continuously increased up to 509 mg l 1 and the average fe of nh4 n reached 50 7 during 7 hours of operation fig 6d winkler et al 2013 overall we have demonstrated that this flow through coupled device based on cl cu electrode is very promising and affordable for the industrial treatment of n containing wastewater and resource recovery 4 conclusions in summary we have designed a flow through coupled device composed of a novel compact flow through electrochemical cell and an ammonia recovery unit for simultaneous nitrate electroreduction to ammonia and in situ ammonia recovery for the first time the cores of the coupled device are the cl modified cu foam cathode to drive the nitrr preferentially with the commercial dsa anode spatially separated by a silicone pad instead of traditional ions exchange membrane accelerating the mass transfer to guarantee the quick conversion of nitrr and the fast transportation of produced nh3 to the recovery unit to minimize the possible nh3 oxidation and the nh3 recovery reactor which is seamlessly coupled with the electrocatalytic cell and work without any ph adjustment and additional energy input of wastewater the cl modified cu foam cathode displayed nearly 100 no3 electroreduction efficiency and over 82 5 nh3 faradaic efficiency in 120 min electrolysis no matter what initial nitrate concentration in range of 50 to 200 mg no3 n l 1 the flow through coupled device could continuingly operate at a large current of 800 ma over 100 h with a continuous nh3 yield rate of 420 μg h 1 cm 2 for nitrate containing wastewater treatment 50 mg no3 n l 1 when driven by solar energy the flow through coupled device also exhibited exceptional practical wastewater treatment performance offering a promising strategy for carbon neutrality declaration

14668,microplastics plastics 5 mm are emerging contaminants that have been detected in virtually all environments while microplastic research in terrestrial surface waters has been proliferating microplastic contamination in subsurface environments remains understudied karst terrains may be particularly susceptible to microplastic pollution because the presence of large dissolution openings allows fast transport of water through these systems facilitating the introduction of surface contaminants into subsurface habitats furthermore few studies address the prevalence and movement of microparticles composed of semisynthetic and modified natural materials despite their known ecotoxicity our study therefore aims to identify anthropogenic i e synthetic semisynthetic and treated natural microparticle extent sourcing and transport in subsurface karst environments to do so we examined a cave spring under variable flow conditions finding that anthropogenic microparticles were present in all samples and were most frequently fibrous and clear the mean anthropogenic microparticle concentration during baseflow was 9 2 counts l but increased up to 81 3 counts l during floods indicating their enhanced mobilization when relatively dilute acidic and sediment rich event water entered the cave these results suggest that anthropogenic microparticles may originate from surface recharge or sediment resuspension within the cave when we analyzed a subset of microparticles with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir we found that cellulose of known i e dyed and suspected i e clear anthropogenic origin was the most abundant material type we nevertheless confirmed the presence of microplastics in the cave stream under all flow conditions with the most common polymer being polyethylene both the concentrations and relative fractions of microplastics were higher during floods compared to baseflow indicating their increased transport during high flow events we also observed that microplastic polymer types diversified as discharge increased our study gives new insight into how anthropogenic microparticle contamination is transported through karst landscapes that can help inform debris mitigation strategies to protect ecosystems and water resources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microfiber vadose zone emerging contaminant flooding groundwater cave data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics plastics 5 mm are emerging contaminants that are ubiquitous in the environment browne et al 2011 cózar et al 2014 lebreton et al 2017 obbard et al 2014 panno et al 2019 rodrigues et al 2018 and their quantities in the global ocean are projected to increase exponentially over time lebreton et al 2019 due to their small size and high durability microplastics are highly mobile and persistent in a variety of habitats rochman 2018 these microparticles may also contain or adsorb toxic chemicals which present additional ecological risks when ingested by organisms bucci and rochman 2022 they consequently constitute an emerging threat to ecosystem and human health bucci et al 2020 rochman et al 2013 vethaak and legler 2021 historically research on plastic contamination has been largely focused on marine environments but recent work has been trending towards the investigation of microplastic pollution in terrestrial settings rochman 2018 previous estimations suggest that about 80 of plastic contamination in the ocean is land sourced with rivers being the main mode of plastic transport jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 wagner et al 2019 common sources of microplastic contamination in terrestrial environments include sewage sludge littering and landfills rochman 2018 the widespread presence of microplastics on the land surface suggests that these microparticles could potentially be reaching deeper hydrological reservoirs putting subsurface ecosystems and groundwater resources at risk re 2019 however microplastic abundance sourcing and transport in subsurface environments is still mostly unknown viaroli et al 2022 other types of anthropogenic microparticles like semisynthetic and modified natural materials e g cellulosic and proteinaceous compositions also have demonstrated ecotoxicity due to harmful chemical additives athey and erdle 2021 kim et al 2021 most current studies nevertheless exclusively focus on microplastic assessments potentially leading to underestimations of the true impacts of anthropogenic microparticles on a variety of habitats karst landscapes make up 15 of the world s ice free surface goldscheider et al 2020 and karst aquifers are important natural resources that supply 9 of the global population with drinking water stevanović 2019 karst aquifers are characterized by the presence and development of dissolution features in soluble rock such as caves conduits and sinkholes that lead to high connectivity between the surface and subsurface this unique architecture causes karst to have complex water flowpaths i e fast flowpaths through conduit openings and slow flowpaths through the rock matrix and facilitates the introduction of surface contaminants to the vadose and phreatic zones white et al 2016 because of the complexities of karst aquifers and their importance as water resources research efforts to quantify and describe the transport of classic contaminants e g pathogens nutrients and road salt have been extensive kelly et al 2010 khaldi et al 2011 musgrove et al 2016 panno et al 2001 pronk et al 2007 robinson and hasenmueller 2017 karst environments can also host inherently fragile ecosystems and constitute important natural landmarks nps 2021 while previous studies have suggested the potential for microplastics and perhaps other types of anthropogenic microparticles to contaminate the subsurface their belowground presence has rarely been quantified and our understanding of subterranean transport mechanisms is particularly limited re 2019 viaroli et al 2022 laboratory experiments and artificial tracer injections in the field have shown that microplastics can move through alluvial aquifers goeppert and goldscheider 2021 wang et al 2022 but these results are not easily transferable to karst aquifers due to fundamentally different hydrological settings such as the presence of large dissolution conduits in karstic host rock that lead to fast preferential flowpaths that are not found in siliciclastic systems limited work has described the presence of microplastics in springs and wells in karst terrains balestra et al 2023 panno et al 2019 shu et al 2023 valentić et al 2022 but our understanding of how these microparticles move through karst especially over a range of flow conditions is lacking while increased microplastic transport during high flow conditions has been demonstrated in surface streams de carvalho et al 2021 hitchcock 2020 hurley et al 2018 this relationship has not been investigated in vadose water and groundwater systems moreover the presence and movement of additional types of anthropogenic microparticles comprised of semisynthetic and modified natural materials has not been systematically examined in subsurface habitats characterizing anthropogenic microparticle pollution in karst environments can help establish the threat that these emerging contaminants pose on ecosystems and water resources we thus quantified anthropogenic microparticle abundance sourcing and transport for a cave system both over long i e seasonal and short i e flood response timescales to understand their delivery through vulnerable karst landscapes these baseline data are critical for understanding anthropogenic microparticle dynamics in subsurface environments which can ultimately inform debris management and mitigation strategies 2 material and methods 2 1 study site to quantify anthropogenic microparticle contamination in karst we sampled a perennial spring issuing from cliff cave which is located about 20 km south of st louis missouri united states fig 1a cliff cave is a vadose branchwork cave system hosted in mississippian st louis limestone harrison 1997 with 1 4 km of mapped passages maps slo 013 1965 and slo 013 1982 in baker and streamer 2002 the cave stream discharges directly to the mississippi river which is 0 7 km east of the cave outlet cliff cave mainly underlies a forested area cliff cave county park managed by st louis county parks but small portions of mapped passageways extend underneath a residential neighborhood to the southwest of the main entrance commercial areas and a highway missouri route 231 are located to the west of the park the landscape around cliff cave features 40 sinkholes km2 fig 1b and several other smaller caves criss et al 2005 evidencing the high connectivity between the surface and subsurface at the site the cave is gated to abate the spread of white nose syndrome among bats with only a limited number of visitors allowed into the cave on guided tours during the summer 2 2 in situ data and sample collection from february 2020 to february 2021 we continuously monitored in situ water quality parameters and water level at the spring issuing from the main entrance of cliff cave we also collected both weekly and high frequency i e 30 to 120 minute interval samples from the cave stream with the high frequency sampling occurring during four flood events in 2020 for the months of september october november and december all sampling and data collection efforts were performed behind the cave entrance gate to minimize potential disturbances due to park visitors water quality parameters i e temperature specific conductivity ph dissolved o2 cl and turbidity were monitored at 5 minute intervals using a ysi 6600 v2 multiparameter water quality sonde installed at the cave s mouth in addition to continuous monitoring of water quality

hach 2100p portable turbidimeter i e turbidity to validate the continuous data and help with calibration of the deployed water quality logger optical brighteners which are fluorescing whitening agents

level data were recorded with a solinst 3001 levelogger 5 pressure transducer that was compensated for changes in barometric pressure using data collected with a solinst 3001 barologger 5 water velocity and channel shape were measured periodically at the cave outlet during field visits with a sontek flowtracker discharge was subsequently calculated using the 0 6 depth method rantz et al 1982 calculated discharge measurements were combined with stage data to generate a rating curve that was used to convert our continuous stage dataset to discharge see supplementary material section 1 and fig s1 for more detail weekly grab samples for ion and elemental analyses were filtered through 0 20 μm acetate filters into 50 ml polypropylene vials pre rinsed with filtered sample water aliquots for ion analysis via ion chromatography ic got no further treatment after filtration while aliquots for elemental analysis via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes were acidified to 1 hno3 these samples were stored at 4 c until analysis subsamples for h and o stable isotope ratio analyses i e δ2h and δ18o respectively were filtered through 0 45 μm acetate filters into 30 ml glass vials with no headspace to avoid fractionation and stored at ambient temperature until analysis weekly grab samples for anthropogenic microparticle analysis were collected in 1 l amber glass bottles which were triple rinsed in the laboratory with unfiltered 18 2 mω cm distilled deionized water hereafter ddi and on site with spring water before sample collection samples for suspended sediment concentration ssc and dissolved organic carbon doc analyses were collected in pre cleaned 1 l polyethylene bottles triple rinsed with spring water all samples to be analyzed for suspended particle attributes were stored at 4 c until analysis while aliquots for doc analysis were filtered using 0 45 μm polyethersulfone membrane filters following united states environmental protection agency method 415 3 potter and wimsatt 2009 then were frozen until analysis high frequency sampling i e sample collection every 30 120 min of the cave stream was performed during the four flood events a total of 48 samples per flood were collected through vinyl tubing and a polypropylene distributor arm into polypropylene bottles by an automatic water sampler teledyne isco inc 3700 full size portable sampler deployed at the cave entrance to reduce the potential for sample contamination the autosampler bottles were triple rinsed with unfiltered ddi in the laboratory and kept capped until deployed in the instrument the autosampler was also programmed to rinse the full tubing length both before and after sample collection the unfiltered flood samples were immediately transported to the laboratory at 4 c after the end of the collection period and processed for the same analytes as the weekly grab samples hourly precipitation depth data from the national weather service nws station at st louis lambert international airport nws 2021 located 33 km from cliff cave were obtained to use with our flood sample datasets precipitation samples were collected for isotopic analysis from a rain gage located 17 km from the study site these samples were processed in the same manner as the cave spring water samples 2 3 geochemical analyses we analyzed the weekly and high frequency samples for geochemical and suspended sediment parameters to assess water sources for the cave across variable flow conditions to aid in our understanding of anthropogenic microparticle provenance a thermofisher dionex integrion hpic ic was used to analyze water samples for cl so4 2 and no3 instrument accuracy and precision were within 6 based on blanks replicates and check standards total element concentrations including ca k mg si na b fe and sr were analyzed with an icp oes i e perkinelmer optima 8300 icp oes instrument accuracy and precision were within 8 based on blanks duplicates and check standards a picarro l2130 i cavity ring down spectrometer was used to determine δ2h and δ18o values for water samples with data reported relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow instrument accuracy and precision were within 0 2 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o based on duplicates and check standards aliquots for doc were thawed immediately before analysis on an elementar vario toc cube instrument accuracy and precision were within 8 based on blanks duplicates and check standards we measured ssc in each of our water samples by recording the sample volume filtering the sample through a pre weighed 1 50 µm glass microfiber filter oven drying the filter at 105 c for at least 24 h reweighing the dried filter determining the filter mass difference and normalizing the calculated sediment mass with the recorded water volume 2 4 anthropogenic microparticle characterization 2 4 1 visual identification a total of 106 water samples were analyzed for anthropogenic microparticle amounts and characteristics all samples were filtered with 0 45 µm mixed cellulose ester membrane filters in the laboratory using an entirely glass vacuum filtration system rinsed with unfiltered ddi before each sample was processed filters were placed in glass petri dishes after processing to air dry the filters the petri dish lids were propped open and loosely covered with al foil after 48 72 h the petri dish lids were closed then the filters were stored until analysis samples were visually inspected with both a stereo microscope equipped with a built in 5 megapixel camera at 4 5 magnification amscope trinocular stereo microscope and a series of protocols to identify anthropogenic microparticles which include synthetic semisynthetic and treated natural materials we hereafter refer to microparticles that had only undergone visual inspection as suspected anthropogenic microparticles which we characterized as materials with no visible biological structures that were malleable and durable when manipulated with tweezers these microparticles were also classified by their morphology i e fiber film and fragment color and size since these characteristics vary in terms of their potential ecological harm bucci et al 2020 gray and weinstein 2017 paul pont et al 2018 once described the suspected anthropogenic microparticles were photographed for future review then transferred to pre cleaned containers with 10 ethanol pre filtered through 0 45 µm mixed cellulose ester membrane filters for preservation before material identification 2 4 2 material identification a subset n 168 of all n 1130 visually identified microparticles that were suspected to be anthropogenic in origin were analyzed for material type using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir thermo scientific nicolet is10 ftir spectrometer with in5 microscope microparticles for ftir analysis were selected to represent 10 of every morphology color combination within each of 18 selected water samples including samples collected nearest to peak discharge for all four flood events n 4 additional samples distributed across the highest magnitude flood event i e the october 2020 flood n 4 and weekly samples evenly distributed through the study period n 10 background spectra were collected before each sample run and the ftir was programed to perform 100 scans on reflectance mode raw spectra were processed with thermo fisher s omnic software and compared to its material library to crosscheck our results from the omnic software spectra were uploaded to the open specy online platform cowger et al 2021 which includes spectra data from primpke et al 2018 and sukumaran 2022 spectra reprocessing steps on open specy included smoothing baseline correction and range selection the three best spectra matches from each of the two databases were recorded then the microparticles were classified by their best overall matches we defined microparticles that were confirmed to be plastic as microplastics and further classified them by polymer type using the criteria of rochman et al 2022 microparticles comprised of cellulose a material that can have either human or natural origin that were also dyed were classified as anthropogenic cellulosic while microparticles that matched cellulose but lacked visual evidence of dye i e clear in color were classified as suspected anthropogenic cellulosic microparticles categorized as microplastics and anthropogenic cellulosic were grouped as anthropogenic microparticles to estimate concentrations for each material type confirmed by ftir we calculated the fraction of each material classification in a given ftir subsample then multiplied it by the concentration of suspected anthropogenic microparticles for that sample 2 4 3 quality assurance and quality control a challenge for anthropogenic microparticle research is the persistent potential for sample contamination to reduce and account for the possibility for contamination of our samples we 1 handled them in an isolated laboratory space prata et al 2019 2 wore 100 cotton and bright green colored clothing when managing the samples 3 cleaned all surfaces with alcohol before using them 4 used glass equipment whenever possible 5 filtered samples in a fume hood to reduce contamination up to 50 wesch et al 2017 6 kept samples covered when not filtering or visually inspecting them prata et al 2019 and 7 collected periodic blanks sample blanks were used to identify potential contamination from our field and laboratory processing steps filtered ddi was poured into both types of field sample collection bottles i e the 1 l amber glass grab sample bottles n 6 and the 1 l polypropylene autosampler bottles n 4 blanks were then processed in the same manner as the water samples from the cave i e filtered then visually inspected average microparticle morphology color combinations from each type of sample container i e glass or polypropylene blank were used to blank correct natural samples collected in the relevant bottle types this step was performed by subtracting the average counts of each morphology color combination in the blanks from the analogous cave stream microparticle counts for the appropriate container type rochman et al 2022 occasionally blanks contained higher amounts of a specific morphology color combination e g clear fibers compared to natural samples in those cases the cave stream sample morphology color combination was corrected to zero so that no microparticle classifications had negative concentration values when a particular morphology color combination was found in the blanks but not natural samples we did not change the microparticle values for the samples from the cave to assess the potential of both microparticle addition due to atmospheric deposition and loss due to air currents during visual inspection of the filters under the microscope we left previously counted laboratory blanks open on the counter next to the microscope during three counting sessions these blanks were then recounted and the difference in microparticles was reported as the environmental blank value 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 recharge area assessment to understand land cover across cliff cave s recharge area and thus potential anthropogenic microparticle sources to the cave we estimated the recharge area based on a drainage area average discharge relationship for missouri criss 2010 and topography this estimation assumes that water divides approximately follow topographic divides however we acknowledge that karst recharge areas often do not mimic topographic divides with these systems commonly receiving recharge from unexpected areas although this technique is based on assumptions that are not always applicable for karst we believe that it provides the best estimation of the recharge area with the lack of more direct method such as dye tracing this procedure has also successfully been used in other springs in the region robinson and hasenmueller 2017 to account for the uncertainty of our recharge area estimation we compared our land cover analysis results with an additional assessment of three other possible recharge basin configurations of the same size that were up gradient of the cliff cave site all land use characterizations in the estimated recharge areas were performed with arcmap 10 7 1 using national land cover data mrlc 2019 2 5 2 hydrograph separations using our geochemical and discharge data we performed hydrograph separations for the flood events using eqs 1 3 to quantify the relative proportions of potential endmember contributions to flow in the cave stream that could be sources for anthropogenic microparticle pollution 1 q t c t q b c b q e c e 2 x b x e 1 3 x b c t c e c b c e here q is discharge c is a tracer value the subscripts t b and e respectively represent the spring water sample of interest baseflow and event water and x is the relative fraction of a given endmember to the total flow sklash and farvolden 1979 we define baseflow as old subsurface water contributing to the cave stream s flow that is characterized at least 3 days after the last recorded precipitation event event water is classified as new precipitation inputs to the cave suitable tracers include water isotopes renshaw et al 2003 winston and criss 2004 and specific conductivity hasenmueller et al 2017 to successfully apply this technique the endmembers must have tracer values that are significantly different from each other 2 5 3 statistical analyses we tested statistical relationships among our data using pearson correlation analyses and unpaired t tests we used an α value of 0 05 for all our interpretations all statistical analyses were conducted in microsoft excel 3 results 3 1 basin hydrology and spring geochemistry during the study period our continuous stage data and rating curve fig s1 showed that the cliff cave stream had discharge ranging 3 19580 l s fig s2 with an average discharge value of 18 l s the daily baseflow discharge i e the cave stream s flow at least 3 days after a precipitation event ranged 6 12 l s averaging 9 l s during the monitoring period our estimation of the cave s recharge area calculated using the spring s average discharge of 18 l s and a regional correlation from criss 2010 showed that the cave drains an approximate area of 2 2 km2 using local topography to inform our recharge area boundary delineation we found that the inferred recharge area encompasses 78 reported sinkholes fig 1b as well as 66 6 developed area 31 6 forest and 1 8 other land cover types table s1 our assessment of three additional possible recharge area configurations that were all 2 2 km2 and up gradient of the cave demonstrated a maximum standard deviation of 3 1 for any given land use type for the four tested recharge area configurations table s1 this analysis confirmed that our estimation of the spring s recharge area is likely a good interpretation of the land use impacting the cave despite the uncertainty in predicting karst basin boundaries our continuous water quality data for the cave spring showed averages and ranges of 13 3 c and 3 5 22 6 c for temperature 0 8 ms cm and 0 1 2 1 ms cm for specific conductivity 8 1 and 6 9 8 3 for ph 97 6 and 91 9 107 1 for dissolved o2 79 4 mg l and 1 3 592 5 mg l for cl and 13 5 ntu and 0 0 1227 3 ntu for turbidity see fig s2 for example data weekly point data for the spring had averages and ranges of 12 6 rfu and 4 9 43 0 rfu for optical brighteners and 30 8 mg l and 0 8 731 4 mg l for ssc pearson correlation analyses of weekly data for a variety of analytes yielded positive and significant correlations among discharge turbidity and ssc but negative and significant correlations for discharge with specific conductivity ph cl and ca table 1 pearson correlations among other measured parameters are presented in table s2 we also analyzed the precipitation discharge and suspended sediment responses for the four sampled floods in 2020 fig 2 which were relatively small events compared to other recorded flooding at the site fig s2 antecedent moisture conditions were similar for the september october and december floods which were preceded by 14 18 days with no precipitation table 2 the two smallest floods sampled with peak discharges 35 l s were the september and december events which were respectively triggered by 1 5 cm and 2 4 cm of precipitation the october flood was the largest sampled event with a peak discharge of 1977 l s that followed 8 1 cm of precipitation we observed 1 4 cm of rain in the 2 days preceding the november flood leading to wetter basin conditions the 2 5 cm of precipitation that triggered the november event led to a flood peak of 708 l s table 2 both turbidity and ssc peaked within 1 h of the discharge maxima for the september through november floods figs 2 and s3 in contrast the december flood s turbidity and ssc responses were characterized by small peaks near the maximum discharge that were followed by larger 2 5 day long pulses during the flood s falling limb figs 2 and s3 hydrograph separations using both specific conductivity for all floods and δ2h and δ18o for two of the floods showed an initial flush of older stored water to the cave spring at the onset of flooding followed by the predominance of event water fig s4 the detected influx of older water during the rising limb of the flood hydrograph is consistent with prior observations of karst springs in the midwestern united states lee and krothe 2001 robinson and hasenmueller 2017 the larger floods in october and november were characterized by higher contributions of event water i e 90 of the total flow while the smaller floods in september and december had event water contributions of 64 of the total flow 3 2 anthropogenic microparticle characterization 3 2 1 quality assurance and quality control our blanks had average suspected anthropogenic microparticle concentrations of 7 2 counts l for the amber glass grab sample bottles and 10 5 counts l for the plastic autosampler bottles the morphology color combinations of the suspected anthropogenic microparticles found in the blanks which we used to blank correct our natural samples are presented in table s3 we note that after the cessation of sample collection for the project white microplastic fragment contamination from the autosampler bottle caps was detected inside the bottles to avoid interferences from this contamination source white fragments were not included in our final flood response analysis our environmental blanks had additions of 0 to 4 microparticles after exposure to ambient conditions in the laboratory with all the new microparticles being clear or blue fibers we did not observe any microparticle losses from the environmental blanks fibers from the bright green colored clothing used during laboratory handling of samples were not found in any of our blanks the subset of suspected anthropogenic microparticles from our blanks all matched cellulose spectra when analyzed with ftir 3 2 2 anthropogenic microparticle abundances and characteristics 3 2 2 1 comparison of baseflow and high flow microparticle assemblages blank corrected suspected anthropogenic microparticles n 1130 were visually detected in most 91 5 of the analyzed water samples n 106 we observed an average concentration of 9 2 counts l during baseflow conditions i e discharge 12 l s however concentrations increased during high flow i e discharge 12 l s reaching up to 81 3 counts l fig 2 during one of the monitored floods for both weekly and high frequency samples most suspected anthropogenic microparticles were fibers 85 8 followed by films 12 0 and fragments 2 2 fig s5a the most common color was clear 54 5 but other colors were also found fig s5b suspected anthropogenic microparticle sizes were classified according to the udden wentworth scale for natural sediment wentworth 1922 including all flow conditions suspected anthropogenic microparticle sizes followed a normal distribution with an average size of 774 μm corresponding to coarse sand of 500 1000 μm fig s5c to compare suspected anthropogenic microparticle characteristics during baseflow i e discharge 12 l s and high flow i e discharge 12 l s conditions we classified all the microparticles according to the spring s discharge at sample collection in high flow conditions we observed a 6 decrease in fiber content as more films were found in the samples fig 3a microparticle colors were similar under all flow conditions though a small 2 increase in clear microparticles occurred during high flow fig 3b we noted a statistically significant increase in microparticle size during high flow compared to baseflow conditions with respective average microparticle lengths of 938 µm and 713 µm fig 3c the subset of microparticles analyzed for material type using ftir n 168 were predominantly cellulosic 76 8 but synthetic materials were also detected 23 2 we found that 61 3 of the ftir analyzed microparticles were distinctly of anthropogenic origin i e either plastic or cellulose modified with dye compared to only 38 7 clear cellulosic microparticles of unconfirmed origin though we suspect they are also derived from anthropogenic sources based on their similar morphologies to microparticles of known human origin interestingly clear microparticles had the most diverse assemblages of synthetic materials of any microparticle color fig s6 under baseflow conditions average anthropogenic cellulosic microparticle and microplastic concentrations were respectively 4 4 counts l and 0 7 counts l but increased to 11 8 counts l and 10 4 counts l at high flow we also observed that the relative fraction of confirmed microplastics increased by 18 3 while the anthropogenic cellulosic microparticle percentage decreased by 25 4 between baseflow and high flow fig 4a under all flow conditions the most commonly detected polymer was polyethylene but microplastic polymer types diversified during high flow fig 4a 3 2 2 2 anthropogenic microparticle response to flooding events our high frequency flood samples revealed an increase in suspected anthropogenic microparticle transport during and after discharge peaks fig 2 for the september october november and december floods suspected anthropogenic microparticles peaked at 48 6 counts l 81 3 counts l 38 2 counts l and 34 5 counts l respectively table 2 fig 2 the ftir analyses of suspected anthropogenic microparticles collected near the discharge peaks of the four monitored floods showed microplastic concentrations of 6 9 17 1 counts l table 2 compared to baseflow levels of 0 0 1 3 counts l while the largest flood in october did feature the highest microplastic concentration near peak flow 17 1 counts l the second highest microplastic concentration near peak discharge was observed in the smallest recorded flood in september 13 0 counts l followed by the floods in november 10 6 counts l and december 6 9 counts l table 2 our ftir results showed that the overall distribution of microparticle material types remained relatively consistent among the four flood peaks with confirmed anthropogenic microparticles i e the combination of dyed cellulosic and plastic materials making up 46 7 63 2 of all the analyzed microparticles fig 4b plastics comprised 20 0 27 8 of the tested microparticles fig 4b polyethylene was the dominant microplastic type in the two smallest monitored floods in september and december constituting 20 0 of the analyzed suspected anthropogenic microparticles in each flood at peak discharge for the large october flood the dominant polymer was acrylonitrile 15 8 with a smaller fraction of polyvinyl 5 3 during the second largest flood in november peak flow microplastics included polypropylene and polyvinyl in equal proportions 11 1 with a smaller fraction of polyethylene detected 5 6 fig 4b note that polyvinyl which typically has a density up to 1 38 g cm3 wagner and lambert 2018 was only detected during the two largest flood peaks material analyses of suspected anthropogenic microparticles across the october flood showed that polyethylene density of 0 91 0 97 g cm3 wagner and lambert 2018 fibers dominated the microplastic signature during pre and post flood periods even though polyethylene microparticles were not detected at peak discharge which only featured an acrylonitrile and polyvinyl polymer assemblage fig 5 other synthetic materials were detected during the falling limb of the flood including polyamide and polystyrene that have typical densities of 1 12 1 14 g cm3 and 0 96 1 05 g cm3 respectively wagner and lambert 2018 our estimates of microparticle concentrations throughout the flood showed a discrepancy in the peak timing between microplastics and microparticles that were suspected to be anthropogenic i e all cellulosic and microplastic materials and confirmed to be anthropogenic i e dyed cellulosic and microplastic materials fig 5 suspected and confirmed anthropogenic microparticles which include cellulose that has a density up to 1 28 g cm3 wagner and lambert 2018 peaked closer to the flood s discharge and turbidity maxima while microplastic concentrations were highest during the falling limb of the flood fig 5 3 2 2 3 anthropogenic microparticle relationships with cave stream hydrology and geochemistry we compared the suspected anthropogenic microparticle concentrations with other hydrological and geochemical parameters under all flow conditions tables 1 and s2 suspected anthropogenic microparticle concentrations had positive and significant correlations with discharge turbidity ssc optical brighteners and the event water fraction and negative and significant correlations with specific conductivity ph and most ion and element species tables 1 and s2 we also found that confirmed anthropogenic microparticles i e the combination of anthropogenic cellulosic and plastic materials were positively and significantly correlated with ssc r 0 608 however the correlation between microplastics and ssc was weak and non significant r 0 418 4 discussion 4 1 anthropogenic microparticles intrude subsurface environments in karst terrains our novel study demonstrated that anthropogenic microparticles including plastic and cellulosic materials enter subsurface water reservoirs we observed an average suspected anthropogenic microparticle concentration of 9 2 counts l at baseflow which is similar to microplastic amounts found in other karst springs under low flow conditions panno et al 2019 valentić et al 2022 microfibers were the most common morphology we recovered from samples which has been noted previously in a variety of environmental settings such as surface waters athey et al 2020 baldwin et al 2016 rochman et al 2022 rodrigues et al 2018 su et al 2016 and karst vadose and phreatic waters balestra et al 2023 panno et al 2019 valentić et al 2022 this finding suggests that the majority of the anthropogenic microparticles in the cave likely originated from fibers shed from clothing athey et al 2020 browne et al 2011 de falco et al 2020 material analysis with ftir showed that cellulose dominated the microparticle signature in the cave spring at 76 8 of the total characterized microparticles while most studies report only synthetic polymer microparticle abundances and characteristics those that have assessed cellulosic microfibers have found they are ubiquitous in surface water miller et al 2017 ocean water barrows et al 2018 and arctic sediment adams et al 2021 however our study is the first to report them in subsurface water toxicological studies have found that treated natural fibers used in textiles including cellulosic materials are harmful to both aquatic plants and animals cui et al 2022 kim et al 2021 the underreporting of semisynthetic and modified natural microparticles can lead to an underestimation of the collective harm of anthropogenic microparticle assemblages in the environment athey and erdle 2021 their assessment in belowground water resources is therefore critical to understand their ecosystem and human health risks our study also demonstrated the presence of synthetic microparticles in cave waters at 23 2 of the total ftir analyzed materials the most common polymer found under all flow conditions was polyethylene fig 4 which has been shown to dominate microplastic signatures in groundwater cha et al 2023 including in karst terrains balestra et al 2023 panno et al 2019 at baseflow conditions polyvinyl was also detected following a flood event but in smaller quantities than polyethylene fig 4a four additional types of polymers were found at high flow i e acrylonitrile polyamide polypropylene and polystyrene fig 4 our findings confirm that anthropogenic microparticles both of modified natural e g dyed cellulose and synthetic origins intrude subsurface karst environments like other surface contaminants such as bacteria nutrients and road salt kelly et al 2010 khaldi et al 2011 musgrove et al 2016 panno et al 2001 pronk et al 2007 robinson and hasenmueller 2017 4 2 floods enhance anthropogenic microparticle transport through the subsurface we found that in karst systems which are highly susceptible to contamination events due to their substantial surface subsurface connectivity white et al 2016 anthropogenic microparticle transport was enhanced when relatively dilute acidic and sediment rich event water from the surface recharged the subsurface through sinkholes and fractures this finding is supported by statistically significant correlations of suspected anthropogenic microparticle concentrations with various hydrological and geochemical parameters e g their positive relationships with discharge event water turbidity and ssc and negative relationships with specific conductivity ph and a variety of ion and element species tables 1 and s2 our finding of a strong positive relationship between suspected anthropogenic microparticles and indicators of sediment transport i e turbidity and ssc r 0 656 table 1 implies that overall suspended material concentration could be used as a proxy for anthropogenic microparticle contamination in karst terrains which has been suggested for surface water systems waldschläger et al 2022 the suspended sediment and anthropogenic microparticles we observed in our cave stream samples could be sourced from either the land surface or within the cave the presence and accumulation of anthropogenic microparticles in cave sediment has been previously confirmed balestra and bellopede 2022 2023 hasenmueller et al 2023 valentić et al 2022 with a comparison of sediment and water from the cliff cave system showing that sediment contained two orders of magnitude more anthropogenic microparticles than proximal water samples hasenmueller et al 2023 these findings suggest the potential for release of legacy anthropogenic microparticle contamination during flooding events that can trigger particle resuspension thus while our results indicated enhanced anthropogenic microparticle transport in response to high flow events additional work is needed to discern if these microparticles are transported directly from the surface with the event water represent legacy contamination stored within cave sediment that is remobilized by flooding or a combination of both factors our suspected anthropogenic microparticle dataset showed slight shifts in their characteristics under changing hydrologic conditions with higher abundances of fibrous non clear and small microparticles found at low flow fig 3 the ftir analyses illustrated higher concentrations relative abundances and diversity for microplastics near flood discharge peaks table 2 fig 4 which is consistent with reports for rivers worldwide gündoğdu et al 2018 hitchcock 2020 hurley et al 2018 wagner et al 2019 on average we recorded a 15 fold increase in microplastic concentrations during flooding compared to baseflow with a maximum of 17 1 counts l during the largest monitored flood in october 2020 table 2 while the increase in microplastics we observed is lower than reports for rivers where concentrations during flooding can reach up to 43 times those at baseflow hitchcock 2020 our results indicate that microplastic transport in subsurface conduits is comparable to their movement in surface systems however we found that flood discharge magnitude was not consistently correlated with the amount of anthropogenic microparticles transported at peak flow while the highest amount of all anthropogenic microparticle material types was detected during the largest monitored flood in october the second highest value was seen in september which was the smallest monitored flood table 2 fig 2 these observations may be due to varying antecedent moisture conditions prior to each flood event higher microplastic levels have been reported in rivers during dry seasons de carvalho et al 2021 and our results suggest that a similar phenomenon might occur in karst systems for example the september flood was preceded by a period of low precipitation over 1 5 months with no precipitation in the 18 days preceding the event table 2 these dry conditions could have led to an accumulation of anthropogenic microparticles in the system that produced a relatively high peak concentration in september of 48 6 counts l with a microplastic peak of 13 0 counts l despite a maximum flow of only 21 l s table 2 in contrast the november flood which had a higher peak discharge of 708 l s happened after wetter conditions with another rainfall event occurring one day prior to the precipitation event that triggered the flood table 2 previous flooding could have exhausted the system of anthropogenic microparticles leading to a peak concentration in november of only 38 2 counts l with a microplastic peak of 10 6 counts l table 2 thus we found that discharge while positively and significantly correlated with suspected anthropogenic microparticle content in the spring water r 0 369 was a weaker predictor of the movement of these microparticles compared to measurements of suspended sediment i e turbidity and ssc r 0 656 table 1 our data also indicate the potential for differences in the delivery of anthropogenic microparticle compositions due to variable flow magnitudes and material densities of the synthetic materials we measured during the floods the densest polymers e g polyvinyl were only observed during the largest monitored discharge perturbations i e those in october and november fig 4b similarly we detected an offset in the transfer of microplastics compared to total anthropogenic microparticles during the october 2020 flood with the lower density microplastics peaking after both suspected and confirmed anthropogenic microparticles which include denser cellulosic material fig 5 this observation suggests that while high flow events trigger an overall increase in anthropogenic microparticle transport the timing of microplastic conveyance during individual events might not mimic the hydrograph due to variations in polymer densities nevertheless further work is needed to establish any density driven offsets in anthropogenic microparticle transport in karst waters given our limited dataset and the potential for the densities of microparticles recovered from the field to differ from their reported values e g due to degradation or biofouling kaiser et al 2017 4 3 anthropogenic microparticle presence in karst waters has implications for groundwater resources and ecosystem health karstic subsurface environments are valuable natural resources that are inherently vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts understanding the dynamics of contaminants in these systems is therefore essential to develop appropriate mitigation and protection strategies our study demonstrated the presence of anthropogenic microparticles including both plastic and modified cellulosic materials in a cave stream emphasizing the importance of better understanding how these emerging contaminants can threaten karst habitats our continuous discharge dataset showed that the cave is subject to extreme flood events with flows up to 19580 l s fig s2 suggesting that anthropogenic microparticle loads in floodwaters could be much higher than those we recorded in the four sampled floods furthermore microplastic storage in sediment has been demonstrated in both surface drummond et al 2022 hurley et al 2018 xia et al 2021 and subsurface balestra and bellopede 2022 2023 hasenmueller et al 2023 valentić et al 2022 freshwater environments suggesting that legacy contamination in the cave could continue to contribute anthropogenic microparticles to the spring for long periods the presence of both treated natural i e cellulose and synthetic microparticles in the cave is concerning because they have been found to contain or adsorb toxic compounds that can be detrimental to organism functioning athey and erdle 2021 bucci and rochman 2022 rochman et al 2013 flood transported microplastics in particular have been shown to intensify risks to aquatic species because they are typically more degraded and oxidized increasing their potential to adsorb organic pollutants de carvalho et al 2022 ecosystem harm may be further elevated by the predominance of microfibers in the cave stream which have been demonstrated to pose the highest risk for ecotoxicity compared to other morphologies such as spheres bucci and rochman 2022 gray and weinstein 2017 thus our results indicate that flooding events could further jeopardize the health of vulnerable karst habitats due to both increased anthropogenic microparticle abundance and ecotoxicity 5 conclusion our research showed that anthropogenic microparticles intrude karst systems and are present under all flow conditions we most frequently found fibrous and clear microparticles in the cliff cave stream samples which is consistent with assemblages observed in other aquatic environments and suggestive of sourcing from textiles our ftir analyses revealed that cellulose of confirmed i e dyed or suspected i e clear anthropogenic origin was the most prevalent kind of material in the cave regardless of discharge magnitude demonstrating the ubiquity of this underreported microparticle composition fully synthetic microparticles i e microplastics were also present under a range of flow settings however both their concentrations and relative abundances increased during flooding establishing their enhanced transport under high flow conditions polyethylene dominated the overall microplastic signature in the water samples but polymer types diversified with increased discharge geochemical data showed that suspected anthropogenic microparticles increased in the cave stream when relatively dilute acidic and sediment rich event water entered the cave through sinkholes and conduits in the karstified bedrock these results indicate that human sourced microparticles were mobilized from the surface or via resuspension of sediment within the cave as flow increased our results provide the first assessment of subsurface anthropogenic microparticle dynamics during high flow events which has important

14668,microplastics plastics 5 mm are emerging contaminants that have been detected in virtually all environments while microplastic research in terrestrial surface waters has been proliferating microplastic contamination in subsurface environments remains understudied karst terrains may be particularly susceptible to microplastic pollution because the presence of large dissolution openings allows fast transport of water through these systems facilitating the introduction of surface contaminants into subsurface habitats furthermore few studies address the prevalence and movement of microparticles composed of semisynthetic and modified natural materials despite their known ecotoxicity our study therefore aims to identify anthropogenic i e synthetic semisynthetic and treated natural microparticle extent sourcing and transport in subsurface karst environments to do so we examined a cave spring under variable flow conditions finding that anthropogenic microparticles were present in all samples and were most frequently fibrous and clear the mean anthropogenic microparticle concentration during baseflow was 9 2 counts l but increased up to 81 3 counts l during floods indicating their enhanced mobilization when relatively dilute acidic and sediment rich event water entered the cave these results suggest that anthropogenic microparticles may originate from surface recharge or sediment resuspension within the cave when we analyzed a subset of microparticles with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir we found that cellulose of known i e dyed and suspected i e clear anthropogenic origin was the most abundant material type we nevertheless confirmed the presence of microplastics in the cave stream under all flow conditions with the most common polymer being polyethylene both the concentrations and relative fractions of microplastics were higher during floods compared to baseflow indicating their increased transport during high flow events we also observed that microplastic polymer types diversified as discharge increased our study gives new insight into how anthropogenic microparticle contamination is transported through karst landscapes that can help inform debris mitigation strategies to protect ecosystems and water resources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microfiber vadose zone emerging contaminant flooding groundwater cave data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics plastics 5 mm are emerging contaminants that are ubiquitous in the environment browne et al 2011 cózar et al 2014 lebreton et al 2017 obbard et al 2014 panno et al 2019 rodrigues et al 2018 and their quantities in the global ocean are projected to increase exponentially over time lebreton et al 2019 due to their small size and high durability microplastics are highly mobile and persistent in a variety of habitats rochman 2018 these microparticles may also contain or adsorb toxic chemicals which present additional ecological risks when ingested by organisms bucci and rochman 2022 they consequently constitute an emerging threat to ecosystem and human health bucci et al 2020 rochman et al 2013 vethaak and legler 2021 historically research on plastic contamination has been largely focused on marine environments but recent work has been trending towards the investigation of microplastic pollution in terrestrial settings rochman 2018 previous estimations suggest that about 80 of plastic contamination in the ocean is land sourced with rivers being the main mode of plastic transport jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 wagner et al 2019 common sources of microplastic contamination in terrestrial environments include sewage sludge littering and landfills rochman 2018 the widespread presence of microplastics on the land surface suggests that these microparticles could potentially be reaching deeper hydrological reservoirs putting subsurface ecosystems and groundwater resources at risk re 2019 however microplastic abundance sourcing and transport in subsurface environments is still mostly unknown viaroli et al 2022 other types of anthropogenic microparticles like semisynthetic and modified natural materials e g cellulosic and proteinaceous compositions also have demonstrated ecotoxicity due to harmful chemical additives athey and erdle 2021 kim et al 2021 most current studies nevertheless exclusively focus on microplastic assessments potentially leading to underestimations of the true impacts of anthropogenic microparticles on a variety of habitats karst landscapes make up 15 of the world s ice free surface goldscheider et al 2020 and karst aquifers are important natural resources that supply 9 of the global population with drinking water stevanović 2019 karst aquifers are characterized by the presence and development of dissolution features in soluble rock such as caves conduits and sinkholes that lead to high connectivity between the surface and subsurface this unique architecture causes karst to have complex water flowpaths i e fast flowpaths through conduit openings and slow flowpaths through the rock matrix and facilitates the introduction of surface contaminants to the vadose and phreatic zones white et al 2016 because of the complexities of karst aquifers and their importance as water resources research efforts to quantify and describe the transport of classic contaminants e g pathogens nutrients and road salt have been extensive kelly et al 2010 khaldi et al 2011 musgrove et al 2016 panno et al 2001 pronk et al 2007 robinson and hasenmueller 2017 karst environments can also host inherently fragile ecosystems and constitute important natural landmarks nps 2021 while previous studies have suggested the potential for microplastics and perhaps other types of anthropogenic microparticles to contaminate the subsurface their belowground presence has rarely been quantified and our understanding of subterranean transport mechanisms is particularly limited re 2019 viaroli et al 2022 laboratory experiments and artificial tracer injections in the field have shown that microplastics can move through alluvial aquifers goeppert and goldscheider 2021 wang et al 2022 but these results are not easily transferable to karst aquifers due to fundamentally different hydrological settings such as the presence of large dissolution conduits in karstic host rock that lead to fast preferential flowpaths that are not found in siliciclastic systems limited work has described the presence of microplastics in springs and wells in karst terrains balestra et al 2023 panno et al 2019 shu et al 2023 valentić et al 2022 but our understanding of how these microparticles move through karst especially over a range of flow conditions is lacking while increased microplastic transport during high flow conditions has been demonstrated in surface streams de carvalho et al 2021 hitchcock 2020 hurley et al 2018 this relationship has not been investigated in vadose water and groundwater systems moreover the presence and movement of additional types of anthropogenic microparticles comprised of semisynthetic and modified natural materials has not been systematically examined in subsurface habitats characterizing anthropogenic microparticle pollution in karst environments can help establish the threat that these emerging contaminants pose on ecosystems and water resources we thus quantified anthropogenic microparticle abundance sourcing and transport for a cave system both over long i e seasonal and short i e flood response timescales to understand their delivery through vulnerable karst landscapes these baseline data are critical for understanding anthropogenic microparticle dynamics in subsurface environments which can ultimately inform debris management and mitigation strategies 2 material and methods 2 1 study site to quantify anthropogenic microparticle contamination in karst we sampled a perennial spring issuing from cliff cave which is located about 20 km south of st louis missouri united states fig 1a cliff cave is a vadose branchwork cave system hosted in mississippian st louis limestone harrison 1997 with 1 4 km of mapped passages maps slo 013 1965 and slo 013 1982 in baker and streamer 2002 the cave stream discharges directly to the mississippi river which is 0 7 km east of the cave outlet cliff cave mainly underlies a forested area cliff cave county park managed by st louis county parks but small portions of mapped passageways extend underneath a residential neighborhood to the southwest of the main entrance commercial areas and a highway missouri route 231 are located to the west of the park the landscape around cliff cave features 40 sinkholes km2 fig 1b and several other smaller caves criss et al 2005 evidencing the high connectivity between the surface and subsurface at the site the cave is gated to abate the spread of white nose syndrome among bats with only a limited number of visitors allowed into the cave on guided tours during the summer 2 2 in situ data and sample collection from february 2020 to february 2021 we continuously monitored in situ water quality parameters and water level at the spring issuing from the main entrance of cliff cave we also collected both weekly and high frequency i e 30 to 120 minute interval samples from the cave stream with the high frequency sampling occurring during four flood events in 2020 for the months of september october november and december all sampling and data collection efforts were performed behind the cave entrance gate to minimize potential disturbances due to park visitors water quality parameters i e temperature specific conductivity ph dissolved o2 cl and turbidity were monitored at 5 minute intervals using a ysi 6600 v2 multiparameter water quality sonde installed at the cave s mouth in addition to continuous monitoring of water quality weekly in situ point measurements of the same parameters were obtained using a handheld ysi professional plus multiparameter instrument i e temperature specific conductivity ph dissolved o2 and cl and hach 2100p portable turbidimeter i e turbidity to validate the continuous data and help with calibration of the deployed water quality logger optical brighteners which are fluorescing whitening agents typically used in laundry detergents and thus indicative of wastewater contributions to natural waters were also measured weekly on site using a turner designs aquafluor handheld fluorometer water level data were recorded with a solinst 3001 levelogger 5 pressure transducer that was compensated for changes in barometric pressure using data collected with a solinst 3001 barologger 5 water velocity and channel shape were measured periodically at the cave outlet during field visits with a sontek flowtracker discharge was subsequently calculated using the 0 6 depth method rantz et al 1982 calculated discharge measurements were combined with stage data to generate a rating curve that was used to convert our continuous stage dataset to discharge see supplementary material section 1 and fig s1 for more detail weekly grab samples for ion and elemental analyses were filtered through 0 20 μm acetate filters into 50 ml polypropylene vials pre rinsed with filtered sample water aliquots for ion analysis via ion chromatography ic got no further treatment after filtration while aliquots for elemental analysis via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes were acidified to 1 hno3 these samples were stored at 4 c until analysis subsamples for h and o stable isotope ratio analyses i e δ2h and δ18o respectively were filtered through 0 45 μm acetate filters into 30 ml glass vials with no headspace to avoid fractionation and stored at ambient temperature until analysis weekly grab samples for anthropogenic microparticle analysis were collected in 1 l amber glass bottles which were triple rinsed in the laboratory with unfiltered 18 2 mω cm distilled deionized water hereafter ddi and on site with spring water before sample collection samples for suspended sediment concentration ssc and dissolved organic carbon doc analyses were collected in pre cleaned 1 l polyethylene bottles triple rinsed with spring water all samples to be analyzed for suspended particle attributes were stored at 4 c until analysis while aliquots for doc analysis were filtered using 0 45 μm polyethersulfone membrane filters following united states environmental protection agency method 415 3 potter and wimsatt 2009 then were frozen until analysis high frequency sampling i e sample collection every 30 120 min of the cave stream was performed during the four flood events a total of 48 samples per flood were collected through vinyl tubing and a polypropylene distributor arm into polypropylene bottles by an automatic water sampler teledyne isco inc 3700 full size portable sampler deployed at the cave entrance to reduce the potential for sample contamination the autosampler bottles were triple rinsed with unfiltered ddi in the laboratory and kept capped until deployed in the instrument the autosampler was also programmed to rinse the full tubing length both before and after sample collection the unfiltered flood samples were immediately transported to the laboratory at 4 c after the end of the collection period and processed for the same analytes as the weekly grab samples hourly precipitation depth data from the national weather service nws station at st louis lambert international airport nws 2021 located 33 km from cliff cave were obtained to use with our flood sample datasets precipitation samples were collected for isotopic analysis from a rain gage located 17 km from the study site these samples were processed in the same manner as the cave spring water samples 2 3 geochemical analyses we analyzed the weekly and high frequency samples for geochemical and suspended sediment parameters to assess water sources for the cave across variable flow conditions to aid in our understanding of anthropogenic microparticle provenance a thermofisher dionex integrion hpic ic was used to analyze water samples for cl so4 2 and no3 instrument accuracy and precision were within 6 based on blanks replicates and check standards total element concentrations including ca k mg si na b fe and sr were analyzed with an icp oes i e perkinelmer optima 8300 icp oes instrument accuracy and precision were within 8 based on blanks duplicates and check standards a picarro l2130 i cavity ring down spectrometer was used to determine δ2h and δ18o values for water samples with data reported relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow instrument accuracy and precision were within 0 2 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o based on duplicates and check standards aliquots for doc were thawed immediately before analysis on an elementar vario toc cube instrument accuracy and precision were within 8 based on blanks duplicates and check standards we measured ssc in each of our water samples by recording the sample volume filtering the sample through a pre weighed 1 50 µm glass microfiber filter oven drying the filter at 105 c for at least 24 h reweighing the dried filter determining the filter mass difference and normalizing the calculated sediment mass with the recorded water volume 2 4 anthropogenic microparticle characterization 2 4 1 visual identification a total of 106 water samples were analyzed for anthropogenic microparticle amounts and characteristics all samples were filtered with 0 45 µm mixed cellulose ester membrane filters in the laboratory using an entirely glass vacuum filtration system rinsed with unfiltered ddi before each sample was processed filters were placed in glass petri dishes after processing to air dry the filters the petri dish lids were propped open and loosely covered with al foil after 48 72 h the petri dish lids were closed then the filters were stored until analysis samples were visually inspected with both a stereo microscope equipped with a built in 5 megapixel camera at 4 5 magnification amscope trinocular stereo microscope and a series of protocols to identify anthropogenic microparticles which include synthetic semisynthetic and treated natural materials we hereafter refer to microparticles that had only undergone visual inspection as suspected anthropogenic microparticles which we characterized as materials with no visible biological structures that were malleable and durable when manipulated with tweezers these microparticles were also classified by their morphology i e fiber film and fragment color and size since these characteristics vary in terms of their potential ecological harm bucci et al 2020 gray and weinstein 2017 paul pont et al 2018 once described the suspected anthropogenic microparticles were photographed for future review then transferred to pre cleaned containers with 10 ethanol pre filtered through 0 45 µm mixed cellulose ester membrane filters for preservation before material identification 2 4 2 material identification a subset n 168 of all n 1130 visually identified microparticles that were suspected to be anthropogenic in origin were analyzed for material type using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir thermo scientific nicolet is10 ftir spectrometer with in5 microscope microparticles for ftir analysis were selected to represent 10 of every morphology color combination within each of 18 selected water samples including samples collected nearest to peak discharge for all four flood events n 4 additional samples distributed across the highest magnitude flood event i e the october 2020 flood n 4 and weekly samples evenly distributed through the study period n 10 background spectra were collected before each sample run and the ftir was programed to perform 100 scans on reflectance mode raw spectra were processed with thermo fisher s omnic software and compared to its material library to crosscheck our results from the omnic software spectra were uploaded to the open specy online platform cowger et al 2021 which includes spectra data from primpke et al 2018 and sukumaran 2022 spectra reprocessing steps on open specy included smoothing baseline correction and range selection the three best spectra matches from each of the two databases were recorded then the microparticles were classified by their best overall matches we defined microparticles that were confirmed to be plastic as microplastics and further classified them by polymer type using the criteria of rochman et al 2022 microparticles comprised of cellulose a material that can have either human or natural origin that were also dyed were classified as anthropogenic cellulosic while microparticles that matched cellulose but lacked visual evidence of dye i e clear in color were classified as suspected anthropogenic cellulosic microparticles categorized as microplastics and anthropogenic cellulosic were grouped as anthropogenic microparticles to estimate concentrations for each material type confirmed by ftir we calculated the fraction of each material classification in a given ftir subsample then multiplied it by the concentration of suspected anthropogenic microparticles for that sample 2 4 3 quality assurance and quality control a challenge for anthropogenic microparticle research is the persistent potential for sample contamination to reduce and account for the possibility for contamination of our samples we 1 handled them in an isolated laboratory space prata et al 2019 2 wore 100 cotton and bright green colored clothing when managing the samples 3 cleaned all surfaces with alcohol before using them 4 used glass equipment whenever possible 5 filtered samples in a fume hood to reduce contamination up to 50 wesch et al 2017 6 kept samples covered when not filtering or visually inspecting them prata et al 2019 and 7 collected periodic blanks sample blanks were used to identify potential contamination from our field and laboratory processing steps filtered ddi was poured into both types of field sample collection bottles i e the 1 l amber glass grab sample bottles n 6 and the 1 l polypropylene autosampler bottles n 4 blanks were then processed in the same manner as the water samples from the cave i e filtered then visually inspected average microparticle morphology color combinations from each type of sample container i e glass or polypropylene blank were used to blank correct natural samples collected in the relevant bottle types this step was performed by subtracting the average counts of each morphology color combination in the blanks from the analogous cave stream microparticle counts for the appropriate container type rochman et al 2022 occasionally blanks contained higher amounts of a specific morphology color combination e g clear fibers compared to natural samples in those cases the cave stream sample morphology color combination was corrected to zero so that no microparticle classifications had negative concentration values when a particular morphology color combination was found in the blanks but not natural samples we did not change the microparticle values for the samples from the cave to assess the potential of both microparticle addition due to atmospheric deposition and loss due to air currents during visual inspection of the filters under the microscope we left previously counted laboratory blanks open on the counter next to the microscope during three counting sessions these blanks were then recounted and the difference in microparticles was reported as the environmental blank value 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 recharge area assessment to understand land cover across cliff cave s recharge area and thus potential anthropogenic microparticle sources to the cave we estimated the recharge area based on a drainage area average discharge relationship for missouri criss 2010 and topography this estimation assumes that water divides approximately follow topographic divides however we acknowledge that karst recharge areas often do not mimic topographic divides with these systems commonly receiving recharge from unexpected areas although this technique is based on assumptions that are not always applicable for karst we believe that it provides the best estimation of the recharge area with the lack of more direct method such as dye tracing this procedure has also successfully been used in other springs in the region robinson and hasenmueller 2017 to account for the uncertainty of our recharge area estimation we compared our land cover analysis results with an additional assessment of three other possible recharge basin configurations of the same size that were up gradient of the cliff cave site all land use characterizations in the estimated recharge areas were performed with arcmap 10 7 1 using national land cover data mrlc 2019 2 5 2 hydrograph separations using our geochemical and discharge data we performed hydrograph separations for the flood events using eqs 1 3 to quantify the relative proportions of potential endmember contributions to flow in the cave stream that could be sources for anthropogenic microparticle pollution 1 q t c t q b c b q e c e 2 x b x e 1 3 x b c t c e c b c e here q is discharge c is a tracer value the subscripts t b and e respectively represent the spring water sample of interest baseflow and event water and x is the relative fraction of a given endmember to the total flow sklash and farvolden 1979 we define baseflow as old subsurface water contributing to the cave stream s flow that is characterized at least 3 days after the last recorded precipitation event event water is classified as new precipitation inputs to the cave suitable tracers include water isotopes renshaw et al 2003 winston and criss 2004 and specific conductivity hasenmueller et al 2017 to successfully apply this technique the endmembers must have tracer values that are significantly different from each other 2 5 3 statistical analyses we tested statistical relationships among our data using pearson correlation analyses and unpaired t tests we used an α value of 0 05 for all our interpretations all statistical analyses were conducted in microsoft excel 3 results 3 1 basin hydrology and spring geochemistry during the study period our continuous stage data and rating curve fig s1 showed that the cliff cave stream had discharge ranging 3 19580 l s fig s2 with an average discharge value of 18 l s the daily baseflow discharge i e the cave stream s flow at least 3 days after a precipitation event ranged 6 12 l s averaging 9 l s during the monitoring period our estimation of the cave s recharge area calculated using the spring s average discharge of 18 l s and a regional correlation from criss 2010 showed that the cave drains an approximate area of 2 2 km2 using local topography to inform our recharge area boundary delineation we found that the inferred recharge area encompasses 78 reported sinkholes fig 1b as well as 66 6 developed area 31 6 forest and 1 8 other land cover types table s1 our assessment of three additional possible recharge area configurations that were all 2 2 km2 and up gradient of the cave demonstrated a maximum standard deviation of 3 1 for any given land use type for the four tested recharge area configurations table s1 this analysis confirmed that our estimation of the spring s recharge area is likely a good interpretation of the land use impacting the cave despite the uncertainty in predicting karst basin boundaries our continuous water quality data for the cave spring showed averages and ranges of 13 3 c and 3 5 22 6 c for temperature 0 8 ms cm and 0 1 2 1 ms cm for specific conductivity 8 1 and 6 9 8 3 for ph 97 6 and 91 9 107 1 for dissolved o2 79 4 mg l and 1 3 592 5 mg l for cl and 13 5 ntu and 0 0 1227 3 ntu for turbidity see fig s2 for example data weekly point data for the spring had averages and ranges of 12 6 rfu and 4 9 43 0 rfu for optical brighteners and 30 8 mg l and 0 8 731 4 mg l for ssc pearson correlation analyses of weekly data for a variety of analytes yielded positive and significant correlations among discharge turbidity and ssc but negative and significant correlations for discharge with specific conductivity ph cl and ca table 1 pearson correlations among other measured parameters are presented in table s2 we also analyzed the precipitation discharge and suspended sediment responses for the four sampled floods in 2020 fig 2 which were relatively small events compared to other recorded flooding at the site fig s2 antecedent moisture conditions were similar for the september october and december floods which were preceded by 14 18 days with no precipitation table 2 the two smallest floods sampled with peak discharges 35 l s were the september and december events which were respectively triggered by 1 5 cm and 2 4 cm of precipitation the october flood was the largest sampled event with a peak discharge of 1977 l s that followed 8 1 cm of precipitation we observed 1 4 cm of rain in the 2 days preceding the november flood leading to wetter basin conditions the 2 5 cm of precipitation that triggered the november event led to a flood peak of 708 l s table 2 both turbidity and ssc peaked within 1 h of the discharge maxima for the september through november floods figs 2 and s3 in contrast the december flood s turbidity and ssc responses were characterized by small peaks near the maximum discharge that were followed by larger 2 5 day long pulses during the flood s falling limb figs 2 and s3 hydrograph separations using both specific conductivity for all floods and δ2h and δ18o for two of the floods showed an initial flush of older stored water to the cave spring at the onset of flooding followed by the predominance of event water fig s4 the detected influx of older water during the rising limb of the flood hydrograph is consistent with prior observations of karst springs in the midwestern united states lee and krothe 2001 robinson and hasenmueller 2017 the larger floods in october and november were characterized by higher contributions of event water i e 90 of the total flow while the smaller floods in september and december had event water contributions of 64 of the total flow 3 2 anthropogenic microparticle characterization 3 2 1 quality assurance and quality control our blanks had average suspected anthropogenic microparticle concentrations of 7 2 counts l for the amber glass grab sample bottles and 10 5 counts l for the plastic autosampler bottles the morphology color combinations of the suspected anthropogenic microparticles found in the blanks which we used to blank correct our natural samples are presented in table s3 we note that after the cessation of sample collection for the project white microplastic fragment contamination from the autosampler bottle caps was detected inside the bottles to avoid interferences from this contamination source white fragments were not included in our final flood response analysis our environmental blanks had additions of 0 to 4 microparticles after exposure to ambient conditions in the laboratory with all the new microparticles being clear or blue fibers we did not observe any microparticle losses from the environmental blanks fibers from the bright green colored clothing used during laboratory handling of samples were not found in any of our blanks the subset of suspected anthropogenic microparticles from our blanks all matched cellulose spectra when analyzed with ftir 3 2 2 anthropogenic microparticle abundances and characteristics 3 2 2 1 comparison of baseflow and high flow microparticle assemblages blank corrected suspected anthropogenic microparticles n 1130 were visually detected in most 91 5 of the analyzed water samples n 106 we observed an average concentration of 9 2 counts l during baseflow conditions i e discharge 12 l s however concentrations increased during high flow i e discharge 12 l s reaching up to 81 3 counts l fig 2 during one of the monitored floods for both weekly and high frequency samples most suspected anthropogenic microparticles were fibers 85 8 followed by films 12 0 and fragments 2 2 fig s5a the most common color was clear 54 5 but other colors were also found fig s5b suspected anthropogenic microparticle sizes were classified according to the udden wentworth scale for natural sediment wentworth 1922 including all flow conditions suspected anthropogenic microparticle sizes followed a normal distribution with an average size of 774 μm corresponding to coarse sand of 500 1000 μm fig s5c to compare suspected anthropogenic microparticle characteristics during baseflow i e discharge 12 l s and high flow i e discharge 12 l s conditions we classified all the microparticles according to the spring s discharge at sample collection in high flow conditions we observed a 6 decrease in fiber content as more films were found in the samples fig 3a microparticle colors were similar under all flow conditions though a small 2 increase in clear microparticles occurred during high flow fig 3b we noted a statistically significant increase in microparticle size during high flow compared to baseflow conditions with respective average microparticle lengths of 938 µm and 713 µm fig 3c the subset of microparticles analyzed for material type using ftir n 168 were predominantly cellulosic 76 8 but synthetic materials were also detected 23 2 we found that 61 3 of the ftir analyzed microparticles were distinctly of anthropogenic origin i e either plastic or cellulose modified with dye compared to only 38 7 clear cellulosic microparticles of unconfirmed origin though we suspect they are also derived from anthropogenic sources based on their similar morphologies to microparticles of known human origin interestingly clear microparticles had the most diverse assemblages of synthetic materials of any microparticle color fig s6 under baseflow conditions average anthropogenic cellulosic microparticle and microplastic concentrations were respectively 4 4 counts l and 0 7 counts l but increased to 11 8 counts l and 10 4 counts l at high flow we also observed that the relative fraction of confirmed microplastics increased by 18 3 while the anthropogenic cellulosic microparticle percentage decreased by 25 4 between baseflow and high flow fig 4a under all flow conditions the most commonly detected polymer was polyethylene but microplastic polymer types diversified during high flow fig 4a 3 2 2 2 anthropogenic microparticle response to flooding events our high frequency flood samples revealed an increase in suspected anthropogenic microparticle transport during and after discharge peaks fig 2 for the september october november and december floods suspected anthropogenic microparticles peaked at 48 6 counts l 81 3 counts l 38 2 counts l and 34 5 counts l respectively table 2 fig 2 the ftir analyses of suspected anthropogenic microparticles collected near the discharge peaks of the four monitored floods showed microplastic concentrations of 6 9 17 1 counts l table 2 compared to baseflow levels of 0 0 1 3 counts l while the largest flood in october did feature the highest microplastic concentration near peak flow 17 1 counts l the second highest microplastic concentration near peak discharge was observed in the smallest recorded flood in september 13 0 counts l followed by the floods in november 10 6 counts l and december 6 9 counts l table 2 our ftir results showed that the overall distribution of microparticle material types remained relatively consistent among the four flood peaks with confirmed anthropogenic microparticles i e the combination of dyed cellulosic and plastic materials making up 46 7 63 2 of all the analyzed microparticles fig 4b plastics comprised 20 0 27 8 of the tested microparticles fig 4b polyethylene was the dominant microplastic type in the two smallest monitored floods in september and december constituting 20 0 of the analyzed suspected anthropogenic microparticles in each flood at peak discharge for the large october flood the dominant polymer was acrylonitrile 15 8 with a smaller fraction of polyvinyl 5 3 during the second largest flood in november peak flow microplastics included polypropylene and polyvinyl in equal proportions 11 1 with a smaller fraction of polyethylene detected 5 6 fig 4b note that polyvinyl which typically has a density up to 1 38 g cm3 wagner and lambert 2018 was only detected during the two largest flood peaks material analyses of suspected anthropogenic microparticles across the october flood showed that polyethylene density of 0 91 0 97 g cm3 wagner and lambert 2018 fibers dominated the microplastic signature during pre and post flood periods even though polyethylene microparticles were not detected at peak discharge which only featured an acrylonitrile and polyvinyl polymer assemblage fig 5 other synthetic materials were detected during the falling limb of the flood including polyamide and polystyrene that have typical densities of 1 12 1 14 g cm3 and 0 96 1 05 g cm3 respectively wagner and lambert 2018 our estimates of microparticle concentrations throughout the flood showed a discrepancy in the peak timing between microplastics and microparticles that were suspected to be anthropogenic i e all cellulosic and microplastic materials and confirmed to be anthropogenic i e dyed cellulosic and microplastic materials fig 5 suspected and confirmed anthropogenic microparticles which include cellulose that has a density up to 1 28 g cm3 wagner and lambert 2018 peaked closer to the flood s discharge and turbidity maxima while microplastic concentrations were highest during the falling limb of the flood fig 5 3 2 2 3 anthropogenic microparticle relationships with cave stream hydrology and geochemistry we compared the suspected anthropogenic microparticle concentrations with other hydrological and geochemical parameters under all flow conditions tables 1 and s2 suspected anthropogenic microparticle concentrations had positive and significant correlations with discharge turbidity ssc optical brighteners and the event water fraction and negative and significant correlations with specific conductivity ph and most ion and element species tables 1 and s2 we also found that confirmed anthropogenic microparticles i e the combination of anthropogenic cellulosic and plastic materials were positively and significantly correlated with ssc r 0 608 however the correlation between microplastics and ssc was weak and non significant r 0 418 4 discussion 4 1 anthropogenic microparticles intrude subsurface environments in karst terrains our novel study demonstrated that anthropogenic microparticles including plastic and cellulosic materials enter subsurface water reservoirs we observed an average suspected anthropogenic microparticle concentration of 9 2 counts l at baseflow which is similar to microplastic amounts found in other karst springs under low flow conditions panno et al 2019 valentić et al 2022 microfibers were the most common morphology we recovered from samples which has been noted previously in a variety of environmental settings such as surface waters athey et al 2020 baldwin et al 2016 rochman et al 2022 rodrigues et al 2018 su et al 2016 and karst vadose and phreatic waters balestra et al 2023 panno et al 2019 valentić et al 2022 this finding suggests that the majority of the anthropogenic microparticles in the cave likely originated from fibers shed from clothing athey et al 2020 browne et al 2011 de falco et al 2020 material analysis with ftir showed that cellulose dominated the microparticle signature in the cave spring at 76 8 of the total characterized microparticles while most studies report only synthetic polymer microparticle abundances and characteristics those that have assessed cellulosic microfibers have found they are ubiquitous in surface water miller et al 2017 ocean water barrows et al 2018 and arctic sediment adams et al 2021 however our study is the first to report them in subsurface water toxicological studies have found that treated natural fibers used in textiles including cellulosic materials are harmful to both aquatic plants and animals cui et al 2022 kim et al 2021 the underreporting of semisynthetic and modified natural microparticles can lead to an underestimation of the collective harm of anthropogenic microparticle assemblages in the environment athey and erdle 2021 their assessment in belowground water resources is therefore critical to understand their ecosystem and human health risks our study also demonstrated the presence of synthetic microparticles in cave waters at 23 2 of the total ftir analyzed materials the most common polymer found under all flow conditions was polyethylene fig 4 which has been shown to dominate microplastic signatures in groundwater cha et al 2023 including in karst terrains balestra et al 2023 panno et al 2019 at baseflow conditions polyvinyl was also detected following a flood event but in smaller quantities than polyethylene fig 4a four additional types of polymers were found at high flow i e acrylonitrile polyamide polypropylene and polystyrene fig 4 our findings confirm that anthropogenic microparticles both of modified natural e g dyed cellulose and synthetic origins intrude subsurface karst environments like other surface contaminants such as bacteria nutrients and road salt kelly et al 2010 khaldi et al 2011 musgrove et al 2016 panno et al 2001 pronk et al 2007 robinson and hasenmueller 2017 4 2 floods enhance anthropogenic microparticle transport through the subsurface we found that in karst systems which are highly susceptible to contamination events due to their substantial surface subsurface connectivity white et al 2016 anthropogenic microparticle transport was enhanced when relatively dilute acidic and sediment rich event water from the surface recharged the subsurface through sinkholes and fractures this finding is supported by statistically significant correlations of suspected anthropogenic microparticle concentrations with various hydrological and geochemical parameters e g their positive relationships with discharge event water turbidity and ssc and negative relationships with specific conductivity ph and a variety of ion and element species tables 1 and s2 our finding of a strong positive relationship between suspected anthropogenic microparticles and indicators of sediment transport i e turbidity and ssc r 0 656 table 1 implies that overall suspended material concentration could be used as a proxy for anthropogenic microparticle contamination in karst terrains which has been suggested for surface water systems waldschläger et al 2022 the suspended sediment and anthropogenic microparticles we observed in our cave stream samples could be sourced from either the land surface or within the cave the presence and accumulation of anthropogenic microparticles in cave sediment has been previously confirmed balestra and bellopede 2022 2023 hasenmueller et al 2023 valentić et al 2022 with a comparison of sediment and water from the cliff cave system showing that sediment contained two orders of magnitude more anthropogenic microparticles than proximal water samples hasenmueller et al 2023 these findings suggest the potential for release of legacy anthropogenic microparticle contamination during flooding events that can trigger particle resuspension thus while our results indicated enhanced anthropogenic microparticle transport in response to high flow events additional work is needed to discern if these microparticles are transported directly from the surface with the event water represent legacy contamination stored within cave sediment that is remobilized by flooding or a combination of both factors our suspected anthropogenic microparticle dataset showed slight shifts in their characteristics under changing hydrologic conditions with higher abundances of fibrous non clear and small microparticles found at low flow fig 3 the ftir analyses illustrated higher concentrations relative abundances and diversity for microplastics near flood discharge peaks table 2 fig 4 which is consistent with reports for rivers worldwide gündoğdu et al 2018 hitchcock 2020 hurley et al 2018 wagner et al 2019 on average we recorded a 15 fold increase in microplastic concentrations during flooding compared to baseflow with a maximum of 17 1 counts l during the largest monitored flood in october 2020 table 2 while the increase in microplastics we observed is lower than reports for rivers where concentrations during flooding can reach up to 43 times those at baseflow hitchcock 2020 our results indicate that microplastic transport in subsurface conduits is comparable to their movement in surface systems however we found that flood discharge magnitude was not consistently correlated with the amount of anthropogenic microparticles transported at peak flow while the highest amount of all anthropogenic microparticle material types was detected during the largest monitored flood in october the second highest value was seen in september which was the smallest monitored flood table 2 fig 2 these observations may be due to varying antecedent moisture conditions prior to each flood event higher microplastic levels have been reported in rivers during dry seasons de carvalho et al 2021 and our results suggest that a similar phenomenon might occur in karst systems for example the september flood was preceded by a period of low precipitation over 1 5 months with no precipitation in the 18 days preceding the event table 2 these dry conditions could have led to an accumulation of anthropogenic microparticles in the system that produced a relatively high peak concentration in september of 48 6 counts l with a microplastic peak of 13 0 counts l despite a maximum flow of only 21 l s table 2 in contrast the november flood which had a higher peak discharge of 708 l s happened after wetter conditions with another rainfall event occurring one day prior to the precipitation event that triggered the flood table 2 previous flooding could have exhausted the system of anthropogenic microparticles leading to a peak concentration in november of only 38 2 counts l with a microplastic peak of 10 6 counts l table 2 thus we found that discharge while positively and significantly correlated with suspected anthropogenic microparticle content in the spring water r 0 369 was a weaker predictor of the movement of these microparticles compared to measurements of suspended sediment i e turbidity and ssc r 0 656 table 1 our data also indicate the potential for differences in the delivery of anthropogenic microparticle compositions due to variable flow magnitudes and material densities of the synthetic materials we measured during the floods the densest polymers e g polyvinyl were only observed during the largest monitored discharge perturbations i e those in october and november fig 4b similarly we detected an offset in the transfer of microplastics compared to total anthropogenic microparticles during the october 2020 flood with the lower density microplastics peaking after both suspected and confirmed anthropogenic microparticles which include denser cellulosic material fig 5 this observation suggests that while high flow events trigger an overall increase in anthropogenic microparticle transport the timing of microplastic conveyance during individual events might not mimic the hydrograph due to variations in polymer densities nevertheless further work is needed to establish any density driven offsets in anthropogenic microparticle transport in karst waters given our limited dataset and the potential for the densities of microparticles recovered from the field to differ from their reported values e g due to degradation or biofouling kaiser et al 2017 4 3 anthropogenic microparticle presence in karst waters has implications for groundwater resources and ecosystem health karstic subsurface environments are valuable natural resources that are inherently vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts understanding the dynamics of contaminants in these systems is therefore essential to develop appropriate mitigation and protection strategies our study demonstrated the presence of anthropogenic microparticles including both plastic and modified cellulosic materials in a cave stream emphasizing the importance of better understanding how these emerging contaminants can threaten karst habitats our continuous discharge dataset showed that the cave is subject to extreme flood events with flows up to 19580 l s fig s2 suggesting that anthropogenic microparticle loads in floodwaters could be much higher than those we recorded in the four sampled floods furthermore microplastic storage in sediment has been demonstrated in both surface drummond et al 2022 hurley et al 2018 xia et al 2021 and subsurface balestra and bellopede 2022 2023 hasenmueller et al 2023 valentić et al 2022 freshwater environments suggesting that legacy contamination in the cave could continue to contribute anthropogenic microparticles to the spring for long periods the presence of both treated natural i e cellulose and synthetic microparticles in the cave is concerning because they have been found to contain or adsorb toxic compounds that can be detrimental to organism functioning athey and erdle 2021 bucci and rochman 2022 rochman et al 2013 flood transported microplastics in particular have been shown to intensify risks to aquatic species because they are typically more degraded and oxidized increasing their potential to adsorb organic pollutants de carvalho et al 2022 ecosystem harm may be further elevated by the predominance of microfibers in the cave stream which have been demonstrated to pose the highest risk for ecotoxicity compared to other morphologies such as spheres bucci and rochman 2022 gray and weinstein 2017 thus our results indicate that flooding events could further jeopardize the health of vulnerable karst habitats due to both increased anthropogenic microparticle abundance and ecotoxicity 5 conclusion our research showed that anthropogenic microparticles intrude karst systems and are present under all flow conditions we most frequently found fibrous and clear microparticles in the cliff cave stream samples which is consistent with assemblages observed in other aquatic environments and suggestive of sourcing from textiles our ftir analyses revealed that cellulose of confirmed i e dyed or suspected i e clear anthropogenic origin was the most prevalent kind of material in the cave regardless of discharge magnitude demonstrating the ubiquity of this underreported microparticle composition fully synthetic microparticles i e microplastics were also present under a range of flow settings however both their concentrations and relative abundances increased during flooding establishing their enhanced transport under high flow conditions polyethylene dominated the overall microplastic signature in the water samples but polymer types diversified with increased discharge geochemical data showed that suspected anthropogenic microparticles increased in the cave stream when relatively dilute acidic and sediment rich event water entered the cave through sinkholes and conduits in the karstified bedrock these results indicate that human sourced microparticles were mobilized from the surface or via resuspension of sediment within the cave as flow increased our results provide the first assessment of subsurface anthropogenic microparticle dynamics during high flow events which has important

14669,biofouling is a major challenge limiting the practical application of biofiltration facilitated gravity driven membrane gdm systems in drinking water treatment in this study ultraviolet irradiation including ultraviolet uv and vacuum ultraviolet vuv irradiation was used for in situ purification of membrane tanks to control membrane biofouling after using uv and vuv the permeate flux increased significantly by 26 1 and 78 3 respectively which was mainly due to the decreased cake layer resistance rc the permeability of the biofouling layer improved after uv and vuv application as evidenced by the increased surface porosity and decreased thickness the contents of loosely bound extracellular proteins lb pn and tightly bound extracellular proteins tb pn in the biofouling layer were reduced after uv and vuv irradiation the decreased lb pn and tb pn improved the interfacial free energy between the fouling itself and between the fouling and the membrane which contributed to the reduction of interfacial cohesion and adhesion resulting in a looser and thinner biofouling layer and a cleaner membrane the concentration of protein like material in the membrane tank decreased after uv and vuv irradiation significantly altering the bacterial community structure on the membrane surface mantel s r 0 7 p 0 05 the changes in the metabolic state were responsible for the differences in the lb pn and tb pn contents the inhibition of alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and glycine serine and threonine metabolism reduced amino acid biosynthesis which restricted the secretion of lb pn and tb pn critical genera in the proteobacteria phylum such as hirschia rhodobacter nordella candidatus berkiella and limnohabitans were involved in metabolite transformation overall the in situ application of uv and vuv can be an effective alternative strategy to mitigate membrane biofouling which would facilitate the practical application of biofiltration facilitated gdm systems in drinking water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gravity driven membrane gdm ultraviolet uv vacuum ultraviolet vuv metabolic pathway extracellular polymeric substances eps interface free energy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ultrafiltration uf membrane systems have been widely used in drinking water production because of their economical and efficient approach for achieving a high quality water supply chang et al 2022 gravity driven membrane gdm processes have received more attention than traditional pressure driven membrane processes because they eliminate the requirements for backwashing physical flushing and chemical cleaning pronk et al 2019 however the low flux caused by membrane fouling is a critical obstacle to achieving a more comprehensive gdm system membrane fouling can decrease filtration performance and shorten the life of the membrane thereby increasing the operational cost of the gdm system membrane fouling is mainly induced by the unfavorable deposition of organic fouling and biofouling in the feed water organic fouling mainly involves biopolymers polysaccharides and proteins and humic substances yu et al 2018 biofouling is induced by extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by microorganisms that adsorb and grow on membrane surfaces it can reduce the compressibility of the biofouling layer and block membrane pores desmond et al 2022 biofiltration pre treatment has proven to be a green efficient and cost effective alternative for reducing membrane fouling in gdm systems lee et al 2019 a biofilter integrated or externally placed can significantly increase the permeate flux of the gdm the biofilter can remove organic materials from feed water by biodegradation by microorganisms colonizing the substrate surface gibert et al 2013 however cultivated bacteria can escape from the biofilter and produce organics such as soluble microbial products smp through cellular metabolism and lysis yu et al 2020 as filtration is carried out continuously bacteria and their metabolites accumulate in the membrane tank due to the rejection effect causing serious membrane biofouling suspended bacteria tend to be transported and attach to membranes promoting biofouling layer formation cai and liu 2016 bacterial metabolites smp as electron donors and nutrients can be used for substance synthesis activities which would promote the generation of active cells and the secretion of eps contributing to the integrity of the structure and function of the biofouling layer meng et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to adopt additional treatment methods to effectively control the accumulation of bacteria and their metabolites before membrane separation particularly in biofiltration facilitated gdm systems effective strategies including membrane modification liu et al 2020 chemical oxidation zhang et al 2022 and ultraviolet exposure feng et al 2022 have been employed to reduce membrane biofouling of the gdm system membrane modification focused on anti bacterial coatings but the continuous consumption of functional layers was a major limiting issue the use of chlorine and permanganate as oxidants produces undesirable water color and disinfection byproducts in contrast ultraviolet irradiation is more suitable for gdm because of its simple operation and the absence of continuous chemical consumption ultraviolet uv 254 nm and vacuum ultraviolet vuv 185 254 nm light sources are commonly used for drinking water treatment because of their high photon energy the emission wavelength of the uv lamp is 254 nm the light quanta produced by 254 nm irradiation facilitate an increase in the number of thymine dimers in the cells thus damaging the dna of the bacteria sinha and häder 2002 the vuv lamp emits photons at wavelengths 185 and 254 nm the 185 nm photons can produce hydroxyl radicals ho by inducing the cracking and ionization of water molecules zoschke et al 2014 the reaction by 185 nm vuv irradiation of water is described by the following equation 1 h 2 o h v 185 h o h 2 h 2 o h v 185 h o h e a q the ho radical site is one of the most reactive and non selective species which reacts indiscriminately with all components of the dna molecule destroying purine and pyrimidine bases as well as the deoxyribose backbone halliwell and gutteridge 2015 furthermore ho can attack electron rich regions of organic matter leading to its decomposition or even mineralization audenaert et al 2013 both uv and vuv irradiation can damage the genetic material of bacteria leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis lim et al 2021 thus reducing the potential for metabolite secretion ultraviolet irradiation pretreatment has been successfully used to mitigate fouling in biofiltration facilitated gdm systems feng et al 2022 this approach focuses on pretreatment prior to biofiltration and the transmission efficiency of photons is limited by scavengers such as natural organic matter and turbidity causing matter kutschera et al 2009 these scavengers can be effectively reduced by biofiltration thus the installation of photoreactors downstream of the biofiltration unit would be more effective for membrane fouling mitigation moreover compared to pretreatment the in situ treatment by ultraviolet irradiation can act directly on the accumulated bacteria and organics in the membrane tank water further improving the water quality before membrane filtration nevertheless information about the in situ use of ultraviolet irradiation is limited mainly due to the deterioration of the polymer membrane induced by direct irradiation in this study ultraviolet irradiation uv and vuv was installed in a gdm system to purify the membrane tank water in situ by internal circulation such an arrangement can provide the potential for in situ applications of ultraviolet irradiation uv and vuv however the effect of the in situ application of ultraviolet irradiation uv and vuv on membrane fouling especially in gdm systems after biofiltration is unknown the composition and structure of the biofouling layer in gdm systems are key factors in determining the permeability performance which is determined by the eps secreted by the bacteria zhang et al 2021 nutrient abundance or scarcity significantly affects bacterial metabolism and growth polz and cordero 2016 the content and composition of organics can be altered by the use of uv and vuv zoschke et al 2014 which changes the carbon source and energy available to the bacteria meng et al 2017 affecting bacterial behavior on the membrane surface to adjust to environmental alterations bacteria upregulate important metabolic pathways such as aspartate and glutamate metabolism to produce more eps proteins to protect themselves feng et al 2018 previous studies on gdm systems have explained eps changes based only on the abundance and function of the bacterial community feng et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 however the effect of in situ application of uv and vuv on eps production at the metabolomic level is still unknown the permeability of the biofouling layer is related to the level of internal adhesion which is dependent on the thermodynamic properties zhao et al 2018 evaluating the influence of the eps content and composition on the thermodynamic properties of the biofouling layer would contribute to a better understanding of membrane fouling in gdm systems to the best of our knowledge this has not yet been reported for gdm systems the microbial mechanisms underlying the alleviation of membrane fouling can be fully elucidated using a combination of multi omics techniques and thermodynamics in this study the effects of two ultraviolet lamps i e uv and vuv in the form of in situ operation on membrane fouling in biofiltration facilitated gdm systems are summarized flux resistance and organic removal were used to evaluate the permeate performance of the system the properties of the biofouling layer including structure composition and interface free energy were investigated to investigate the membrane fouling mechanism to clarify the biological effects the influence of uv and vuv on bacterial communities and metabolic pathways in the biofouling layer was also considered in detail this study provides a promising approach i e in situ application of ultraviolet irradiation to mitigate biofouling in biofiltration facilitated gdm systems and provides comprehensive insights into the mechanism thus expanding the application of this combined system in drinking water supply 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation surface water was obtained from the tonghui river n 39 875867 e 116 444557 supporting information si table s1 the polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf ultrafiltration membrane used in the experiments had a nominal cutoff value of 100 kda the effective membrane area per module was 0 0188 m2 as shown in fig 1 the driving force for each gdm system was the height difference between the liquid levels of the membrane tank and the overflow tank 65 cm the hose connected the permeate outlet of the membrane module to the overflow tank which featured a full pipe flow and flooded discharge to maintain a constant filter head the height of the overflow tank was periodically adjusted the three gdm reactors had the same working volume 2 83 l a membrane tank water discharge device was installed to control the hydraulic residence time hrt based on the inlet flow rate of the gdm system with maximum permeate flux the discharge flow rates of the other gdm systems were adjusted daily to obtain the same inlet flow rate the hrt was calculated by dividing the working volume of the gdm system by the inlet flow rate the hrt of the three gdm reactors was similar during the entire operational period with an average value of approximately 18 h the biofilter was installed prior to the gdm system in the form of a gravity driven up flow slow filtration average filtration speed of 0 19 m h the biofilter was constructed using granular activated carbon gac with a particle size of 2 3 mm and a filling height of 60 cm the uv gph150t5l 4 heraeus co and vuv gph150t5vh 4 heraeus co lamps were protected with quartz tubes and placed in a reactor outside the gdm membrane tank the gdm systems with uv and vuv were named gdm uv and gdm vuv respectively during the experiment each lamp was operated on for 15 min and off for 2 h while a peristaltic pump was used to drive the water flow through the photoreactor and membrane tank this ensured that the water in the membrane tank was actively mixed while being illuminated by the lamp the average residence time of the membrane tank water in the photoreactor was 1 35 min per cycle the vuv lamp emitted photon wavelengths of 254 and 185 nm with intensities of 0 064 mw cm2 and 0 006 mw cm2 respectively the uv lamp emitted light at a wavelength of 254 nm with an intensity of 0 069 mw cm2 each membrane tank was equipped with intermittent aeration each membrane tank was equipped with aeration equipment aeration at 1 0 l min for 1 min followed by a 60 min stop all gdm systems were operated continuously for 60 d without any cleaning measures the flux was calculated by weighing the permeate water as described in text s1 si 2 2

fluorescence properties confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm nikon ax r japan and image acquisition were employed to determine the distribution of proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids in the

austria and dynamic contact angle ca dataphysics tp50 germany respectively to acquire the cross sectional images the biofouling layer and membrane were fractured in liquid nitrogen the surface porosity of the biofouling layer was quantified from the sem images obtained using image pro plus 6 0 according to previous protocols li and yang 2007 eps were extracted from the biofouling layer by a heating process that consisted of loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps proteins were quantified using a bicinchoninic acid bca protein quantification kit beyotime biotechnology the polysaccharide concentration was determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method loosely bound extracellular proteins lb pn and tightly bound extracellular proteins tb pn represent the proteins in

metabolites was constructed using the rstudio software 3 results and discussion 3 1 flux and resistance the evolution of the permeate flux in the gdm system during the entire operation period is shown in fig 2 a during the 60 day filtration period gdm gdm uv and gdm vuv exhibited varying degrees of flux decline which was attributed to the development and maturation of the biofouling layer three stages of flux decline a b and c were observed and delineated by dashed lines in the initial phase a gdm vuv had the slowest decreasing trend from 22 3 l m2 h to 10 6 l m2 h followed by gdm uv from 20 0 l m2 h to 9 0 l m2 h which could be attributed to the excellent control of fouling accumulated in the membrane tanks by the uv and vuv units in stages b and c the flux reduction of all systems slowed and then remained pseudo steady for a long duration the flux curves of gdm uv and gdm vuv were distinctly separated on day 30 which could be attributed to the ingestion of the biofouling layer by the microorganisms the stable flux of gdm was 4 6 l m2 h fig 2b compared to gdm the stable fluxes of gdm uv and gdm vuv were significantly increased by 26 1 and 78 3 respectively p 0 05 this result indicates that the uv and vuv units are effective strategies for flux improvement furthermore the stable flux of gdm vuv showed a significant increase of 41 4 compared to that of gdm uv p 0 05 demonstrating that the vuv unit was superior to uv in flux enhancement the fouling hydraulic resistance of all the membrane systems was opposite to the flux variation which increased until a steady state was reached fig 2c regardless of the time gdm vuv and gdm uv showed relatively lower fouling hydraulic resistances than gdm suggesting that the application of vuv and uv units can effectively limit fouling development the variations in the intrinsic membrane resistance rm cake layer resistance rc and pore blocking resistance rp were further evaluated fig 2d for all filtration systems the resistance values of rm were almost consistent 0 85 1012 m 1 illustrating the consistency and comparability of the membranes used rc had the highest percentage 70 3 78 2 indicating that the resistance of the gdm systems was determined by the biofouling layer which is consistent with a previous report pronk et al 2019 compared with gdm the rc values of gdm uv and gdm vuv were significantly reduced by 24 6 and 43 5 respectively p 0 05 which could be ascribed to the increased heterogeneity of the biofouling layer furthermore the rc values were significantly reduced by 25 2 and 51 2 after the application of uv and vuv respectively p 0 05 the accumulation of fouling in membrane pores was effectively restricted by the uv and vuv units the use of uv and vuv decreased rc and rp which led to an enhanced permeate flux 3 2 organics removal the variations in the doc levels in the raw water membrane tanks and permeate are presented in fig 3 a the doc content in the raw water was 3 14 mg l which decreased to 1 03 mg l after passing through the biofilter the removal of doc may have been due to the adsorption of gac and the biodegradation of microorganisms on its surface yuan et al 2022 in the gdm system doc accumulation was observed in the membrane tank and can be attributed to the decomposition of particulate organics by microorganisms and the rejection of soluble substances by the membrane wu et al 2019 the highest doc content 2 45 mg l was obtained in the membrane tank of the gdm the doc content in the membrane tank was significantly reduced to 1 35 mg l and 1 19 mg l after using uv and vuv respectively p 0 05 photons generated by uv and vuv radiation can effectively degrade organic compounds and improve their biodegradability ratpukdi et al 2010 the degradation of organic compounds is summarized in eqs 3 and 4 uv irradiation had almost no effect on doc removal but showed efficient bacterial inactivation 1 91 log test s7 the reduction in the doc content accumulated in the gdm uv membrane tank can be ascribed to the inhibition of bacterial activity by uv irradiation compared with gdm uv the membrane tank of gdm vuv had a lower accumulated doc content vuv irradiation exhibited a similar ability to inactivate bacteria as uv in the presence of ho scavengers organics text s7 the greater effectiveness of vuv irradiation has been attributed to the generation of ho feng et al 2022 as a highly reactive and nonselective oxidant ho can decompose recalcitrant organic compounds into smaller biodegradable molecules or even mineralize them audenaert et al 2013 the doc content in the permeate water of the three gdm systems was nearly the same 1 03 mg l 3 o r g a n i c s 254 n m p h o t o n s b y p r o d u c t s 4 o r g a n i c s h o b y p r o d u c t s c o 2 h 2 o the uv254 for the gdm membrane tank was 0 0120 cm 1 which dropped to 0 0087 cm 1 and 0 0074 cm 1 after the application of uv and vuv respectively fig s1a the chemical bonds of unsaturated or aromatic organics are destroyed by the photons generated by uv and vuv resulting in a decrease in uv254 for the permeate water the lowest uv254 was detected in gdm vuv 0 0078 cm 1 followed by gdm uv 0 0089 cm 1 the use of uv and vuv light diminished the amount of unsaturated or aromatic organics in the permeated water two fluorescent components components 1 and 2 were obtained by parafac model decomposition on the eem datasets fig 3b the fluorescence spectra and corresponding excitation emission loadings of the parafac model outputs for components 1 and 2 are shown in fig s1b component 1 contained protein like materials and exhibited signal peaks at 225 325 nm ex em and 275 325 nm ex em the ex em wavelength pairs of the component 2 peaks were concentrated at 240 410 nm which are related to humic like substances after biofiltration the maximum fluorescence fmax of component 2 was reduced by 66 4 whereas that of component 1 was reduced by only 5 8 this result meant that the biofilter was effective in removing humic like material but showed limited effectiveness in the removal of protein like substances protein like materials can be replenished by smp released from microbial activity in the gdm membrane tank the accumulation of components 1 and 2 was observed after uv and vuv application sharp decreases in fmax values were consistently noted for all components with 62 8 and 75 8 for component 1 and 18 5 and 49 4 for component 2 respectively accumulated fluorescent organics especially protein like substances can be effectively restricted by uv and vuv light photons generated by uv and vuv irradiation at 254 nm can damage protein structure by attacking the amide group mehmood et al 2022 furthermore the secretion of proteins by bacteria can be inhibited by 254 nm photons owing to dna damage sinha and häder 2002 the 254 nm photons and ho had a synergistic effect on protein damage audenaert et al 2013 thus compared to uv irradiation vuv irradiation was more efficient in restricting protein accumulation protein like substances are biopolymers that can induce the formation of gel layers on membrane surfaces leading to reduced membrane permeability kimura and oki 2017 for the permeate effluent the fmax of all components consistently declined after uv and vuv irradiation indicating that uv and vuv irradiation can improve the removal of protein and humic like substances leading to an enhancement of water quality overall vuv and uv irradiation can effectively reduce the loading of organics on the membrane which could alleviate membrane fouling 3 3 membrane fouling properties the surface morphology of the membrane after the removal of the biofouling layer was observed by sem at the end of the operation fig 4 a the virgin membrane had a smooth surface with clear membrane pores and no visible sediments in contrast after filtering the water from various membrane tanks different amounts of agglomerates were deposited on the membrane surface blocking the membrane pores the membrane surface of the gdm system exhibited the highest number of adhered agglomerates the number of agglomerates on the membrane surface was significantly reduced upon uv irradiation when vuv irradiation was applied the aggregates on the membrane surface vanished and the morphology appeared to be nearly identical to that of the virgin membrane the application of uv and vuv successfully protected the membrane from the deposited pollutants and the effect of vuv was stronger the fluorescence properties of the fouling adhered to the membrane after removal of the biofouling layer are shown in fig 4b the fluorescent organics that adhered to the membrane surface had similar compositions the wavelengths of the peaks were all focused around ex em 260 340 nm which accounts for the protein like material in the smp the gdm membrane exhibited the highest intensity of protein like material owing to the use of uv and vuv light the intensity of the protein like substances that adhered to the gdm uv and gdm vuv membranes decreased sequentially the 2d spectrogram at ex 260 nm further supports these results the presence of uv and vuv diminished the adhesion of the smp to the membrane with vuv playing a more significant role than uv the membrane samples were analyzed using atr ftir and the relevant spectra are shown in fig 4c all samples exhibited similar characteristic peaks but the vibration intensities of the peaks differed obviously the peak at 3330 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of oh which is associated with all possible pollutants the characteristic peak at 1656 cm 1 was related to amide i xu et al 2022 which could be derived from the nitrogen containing functional groups in the protein o h deformation and c o stretching of phenolic compounds occurred at 1400 cm 1 xu et al 2022 and the twisting vibration of ch2 appeared at 1172 cm 1 zhi et al 2014 which could be functional groups related to polysaccharides the two sharp peaks at 872 cm 1 and 840 cm 1 were connected to the c c c stretching vibrations mei et al 2014 which could be attributed to the contribution of humic like compounds these functional groups showed a decreasing trend of vibrational peaks in the order of gdm gdm uv gdm vuv indicating that the application of uv and vuv decreased the deposition of protein like substances polysaccharides and humic like substances on the membrane surface protein like substances and polysaccharides are considered typical biofouling substances suggesting the effectiveness of uv and vuv irradiation in the removal of biofouling the pollutants deposited on the membrane surface and pores can alter the hydrophilicity of the membrane because of the different contact angles of the fouled membrane fig 4d the virgin membrane showed good hydrophilicity average contact angle 56 5 in contrast the contact angle of the gdm fouled membrane increased to 81 9 which may be due to the adhesion of hydrophobic substances after uv and vuv irradiation the contact angles of the membranes decreased to 72 3 and 61 5 for gdm uv and gdm vuv respectively uv and vuv irradiation can reduce the adhesion of hydrophobic substances to membranes leading to an increase in membrane hydrophilicity highly hydrophilic membranes exhibit satisfactory antifouling ability and water permeability zheng et al 2022 3 4 physico chemical characterization of the biofouling layer 3 4 1 physical structure of the biofouling layer as shown in fig 5 a the surface morphology of the biofouling layer was distinct for the different membrane filtration systems the biofouling layer of the gdm system was relatively smooth and a large number of substances bonded together in contrast the surface of the gdm uv biofouling layer was rough and contained more voids the biofouling layer of the gdm vuv was more porous and had larger gaps than that of the gdm uv the presence of uv and vuv light reduced the strength of the connections between the fouling particles in the biofouling layer causing an increase in voids the obtained sem images were processed using image pro plus to measure the surface porosity of the biofouling layer fig s2a the highest surface porosity 7 94 was observed in the biofouling layer of gdm vuv followed by gdm uv 4 57 high surface porosity can provide additional channels for passing water leading to an increase in permeability the use of vuv and uv effectively decreased the thicknesses of the biofouling layers fig 5a the average thickness of the biofouling layer of gdm was approximately 95 3 μm which was reduced to 51 5 μm and 47 4 μm after using uv and vuv respectively fig s2b these results confirmed that the use of uv and vuv significantly eliminated or decreased the accumulation of fouling on the membrane surface 3 4 2 composition analysis of the biofouling layer the c1s spectrum was deconvoluted into four representative peaks fig s3a c the characteristic peak of c c h was located at 284 8 ev which correlated with hydrocarbon like compounds such as lipids and amino acid side chains wang et al 2018 as shown in fig 5b the percentage of c c h in the biofouling layer increased from 45 2 to 56 2 and 62 2 after uv and vuv irradiation respectively which can be attributed to the effective decomposition of eps c o n 286 3 ev represents amines or amides which could be associated with proteins after uv and vuv applications the percentages of c o n in the biofouling layer were reduced to 30 8 and 29 6 respectively which can be ascribed to the degradation of proteins the peak at 288 0 ev was assigned to the o c o and c o bonds which are mainly present in the carboxylic acid group carbonyl group and acetal and hemiacetal groups li et al 2022 the o c o and c o bonds are involved in the formation of highly hydrophilic polysaccharides the lowest o c o and c o bond contents were obtained for gdm vuv 6 4 followed by gdm uv 10 9 these results indicate that the use of uv and vuv decreased the accumulation of polysaccharides in the biofouling layer and the elimination effect of vuv was better than that of uv moreover the weak peak at 289 0 ev was related to the o c oh and o c or functional groups of carboxyl or ester groups badireddy et al 2008 which were not changed obviously in the biofouling layers of the three filtration systems the n 1s peak was separated into two different bands located at the binding energy of 399 6 and 400 17 ev respectively fig s3d f the n c r peak was placed at 399 6 ev which was derived from the amide function of the protein and peptide chain yu et al 2018 after uv and vuv irradiation the n c r content decreased to 40 7 and 22 6 respectively fig 5c this phenomenon reveals that the application of uv and vuv can induce the disintegration of proteins and reduce the protein content in the biofouling layer the peak at 400 17 ev can be attributed to the typical amino acid bond h n c o yu et al 2018 and its content increased to 59 3 for gdm uv and 77 4 for gdm vuv in the biofouling layer proteins are damaged by photons from uv and vuv light resulting in elevated levels of protein monomers i e amino acids the atr ftir spectra showed different stretches of characteristic peaks in the different biofouling layers fig 5d three sharp peaks were identified at 3275 cm 1 1638 cm 1 and 1027 cm 1 which were attributed to oh amide i and c o c vibrations respectively lin et al 2013 wang et al 2018 the oh peak can be associated with highly hydrophilic fouling which can promote bacterial accumulation and increase the filtration resistance of the biofouling layer li et al 2022 amide i and c o c were assigned to the proteins and polysaccharides respectively after uv and vuv irradiation the vibrations of the three characteristic peaks sequentially weakened this result indicated that the accumulation of foulants in the biofouling layer was reduced by uv and vuv irradiation especially for proteins and polysaccharides these observations are consistent with the results of xps analysis which demonstrated the effectiveness of uv and vuv light in restricting the accumulation of proteins and polysaccharides clsm images depict the distribution of polysaccharides proteins and dna on the biofouling layer which are marked in green red and blue respectively fig 5e the most significant differences were observed in protein distribution the biofouling layer of gdm was covered with the largest amount of protein in contrast the protein clusters were dramatically reduced in the biofouling layers of gdm uv and gdm vuv and were the lowest in gdm vuv this result is in accordance with the decrease in rc the use of uv and vuv diminished the protein content in the biofouling layer which could be the main reason for the reduction in biofouling layer resistance the known surface tension parameters of the three probe liquids water glycerol and diiodomethane are listed in table s2 the contact angle and zeta potential measurements of the biofouling layer and membrane are presented in table s3 the individual surface tension parameters were calculated based on these data table s4 the electron donor parameter γ varied significantly among the three samples specifically the γ value of the gdm biofouling layer was 1 52 mj m2 which increased to 7 17 mj m2 for gdm uv and 10 58 mj m2 for gdm vuv this result implies that the fouling of gdm uv and gdm vuv could carry more electrons the repulsive forces induced by polar interactions can be greater in gdm uv and gdm vuv than in gdm resulting in a more difficult fouling aggregation fig 5f shows the cohesive free energy per unit area of the fouling membrane and fouling fouling interfaces based on xdlvo theory for the fouling membrane and fouling fouling samples the lewis acid base fraction δgab always contributed greatly 74 9 93 0 to the total cohesion free energy δgtot while the lifshitz van der waals component δglw and the electrostatic force energy δgel made much smaller contributions a negative value of gtot indicates mutual attraction between the two interfaces for the fouling membrane the δgtot values were ranked as follows gdm 51 5 mj m2 gdm uv 41 1 mj m2 gdm vuv 36 1 mj m2 the use of uv and vuv decreased the adhesion of fouling to the membrane resulting in a cleaner membrane additionally in terms of fouling fouling the δgtot value of gdm uv 48 5 mj m2 and gdm vuv 36 1 mj m2 was much higher than that of gdm 77 5 mj m2 this suggests that the self aggregation potential of fouling was minimized by uv and vuv irradiation leading to a looser and more heterogeneous structure of the biofouling layer to summarize uv and vuv can reduce the adhesion of fouling membrane and the cohesion of fouling fouling mainly by modifying the lewis acid base forces 3 5 eps properties eps is considered a key factor in determining membrane resistance because of its impact on the properties of biofouling layers wang et al 2009 the eem spectra of eps are shown in fig 6 a similar characteristic peaks with different intensities focused in the region of ex em 200 300 250 400 nm were observed in all eem spectra reflecting the similarities and differences in eps between different gdm systems the parafac analysis was performed to quantify the content of each fluorescent component and the detailed spectra and loadings are presented in fig s4 component 1 positioned at ex em 225 310 nm and ex em 275 310 nm was attributed to tyrosine the characteristic peak of component 2 at ex em 275 350 nm was attributed to tryptophan component 3 ex em 250 425 nm was attributed to humic like substances eps was mainly dominated by components 1 and 2 the lb eps content was higher than the tb eps content which was consistent with the eem spectra regardless of lb eps and tb eps the fmax values of components 1 and 2 were the highest in gdm and were attenuated in gdm uv and gdm vuv fig 6b tyrosine and tryptophan are aromatic protein pollutants related to their high adhesion capacity and gel layer formation on the membrane surface which strongly determine the membrane fouling level wu et al 2020 the application of uv and vuv facilitated the destruction of tyrosine and tryptophan which could explain the reduction in the adhesion of the biofouling layer the biofouling layer was mainly composed of proteins which accounted for more than 80 of the total eps fig 6c a greater reduction in lb pn and tb pn content was noted in the eps of gdm uv and gdm vuv 17 4 33 4 the high viscosity of proteins facilitates the formation of a biofouling layer on the membrane surfaces iorhemen et al 2019 the use of uv and vuv irradiation significantly inhibited the secretion of lb pn and tb pn which likely led to a reduction in the thickness of the biofouling layer compared to gdm the protein to polysaccharide pn ps ratios of gdm uv and gdm vuv were 3 0 and 10 6 lower respectively a high pn ps ratio can improve the relative hydrophobicity of the fouling and enhance particle affinity and aggregation arabi and nakhla 2008 the presence of uv and vuv can reduce the pn ps ratio which could be the reason for the decrease in cohesion energy the results of the pls pm model revealed the relationship between eps interface free energy and resistance fig 6d the model fit was good goodness of fit 0 894 eps had a significant effect p 0 05 on gtot fouling membrane and gtot fouling fouling and the path coefficients of both were 0 982 suggesting that the increase in eps contributed to cohesion and adhesion the effect coefficient of δgtot fouling fouling on the resistance 1 349 was much larger than that of δgtot fouling membrane 0 404 suggesting that the internal aggregation effect of fouling was a critical factor influencing the resistance the indirect effect of eps on resistance 0 927 was much stronger than its direct effect 0 053 eps indirectly determined the development of resistance by altering the cohesion of dirt additionally lb pn and tb pn had the highest loadings on the potential eps variables both at 0 305 indicating that the variation in eps was mainly affected by protein content fig 6e compared to rm and rp rc loaded more on the potential variable of resistance 0 403 suggesting that the alteration in resistance was mainly dominated by the permeability of the biofouling layer overall the use of uv and vuv decreased the protein content in eps which weakened the cohesive effect between fouling eventually leading to increased permeability of the biofouling layer 3 6 effects of uv and vuv on bacterial communities good s sequence coverage for all samples was 99 fig s5a which indicated that the sequencing depth was sufficient to represent the diversity of the microbial community the shannon and simpson indices were significantly higher in both the gdm uv and gdm vuv samples than in the gdm samples indicating an increase in bacterial community diversity fig s5b c the total number of operational taxonomic units otus in all biofouling layers was 505 fig 7 a the number of otus shared by the gdm uv gdm vuv samples was 298 which was higher than that shared by the gdm gdm uv 129 otus and gdm gdm vuv samples 153 otus uv and vuv irradiation altered the richness of the bacterial communities in the biofouling layer gdm samples had the highest number of unique otus 415 followed by gdm vuv 355 and gdm uv samples 132 the application of uv and vuv reduced the richness of the bacterial communities to some extent which can be attributed to the inactivation effect of uv and vuv irradiation on the bacteria in the membrane tank water compared to uv irradiation vuv irradiation can degrade organics into lower molecular weight compounds leading to a greater potential for bacterial regeneration zoschke et al 2014 thus the richness of the bacterial communities was higher in the biofouling layer of gdm vuv than in that of gdm uv as shown in the pcoa plots fig 7b each of the three gdm systems had a unique microbial community in the biofouling layer based on the bray curtis distance matrix p 0 05 permanova test indicating that uv and vuv accounted for the differences in the bacterial communities the mantel test was used to determine the environmental variables that were significantly correlated with the bacterial community in the biofouling layer fig 7c doc and fluorescent component 1 were strongly associated with the bacterial community mantel s r 0 7 p 0 01 suggesting that doc and protein like components are important environmental factors affecting bacterial community structure doc showed the highest positive correlation with fluorescence component 1 pearson s r 0 9 suggesting that the dissolved organic matter accumulated in the membrane tank was mainly derived from protein like material protein like substances are directly related to microbial activity frank et al 2018 the reduction in protein like substances was associated with the inhibition of bacterial activity by the use of uv and vuv leading to a decrease in the accumulated doc content in the membrane tank fig 3 decreased protein like content alters the carbon resources available to microorganisms leading to reorganization of the bacterial community zhou et al 2021 a random matrix theory based molecular ecology network of phylogenies was constructed with a similarity threshold of 0 92 nodes represented otus node size was positively correlated with connectivity and edges reflected the correlation between otus gray indicates positive correlation and red indicates negative correlation in the network the modules served as a group of highly self connected otus with fewer connections to otus outside the group microorganisms within the same module perform similar functions eiler et al 2012 the constructed network contained 12 modules with a modularity value of 0 712 fig 7d table s5 which was higher than that of the corresponding random network 0 269 illustrating that the network was modular wu et al 2016 the constructed network consisted of 235 nodes and 1095 edges which characterized the size and complexity of the network in networks positive interactions are associated with mutually beneficial symbioses whereas negative interactions involve competition and predation faust and raes 2012 the total number of positive edges was 1026 which was significantly higher than that of the negative interactions 69 fig 7d demonstrating that microorganisms in the biofouling layer were more likely to cooperate than to compete the nodes in the network belonged to 19 phyla and proteobacteria occupied a relatively high proportion of the modules the relative abundances of these phyla exhibited large variations suggesting a difference in the level of phylum taxonomy fig s5d key taxa play a more important role in maintaining the network structure than other microorganisms in the network and the disappearance of these hypothetical key taxa affects the stability of the network faust and raes 2012 over 90 of otus were divided into peripherals otu 1801 was identified as a connector in the ecological network fig 7e this keystone belongs to the proteobacteria phylum the majority of otus in the network 54 0 were linked to proteobacteria the relative abundance of proteobacteria in the gdm uv and gdm vuv samples was 41 1 and 59 1 respectively which was higher than that of the gdm sample 23 2 the highest linear discriminant analysis lda scores for proteobacteria in the gdm vuv sample also demonstrated its biomarker properties fig s5e the proteobacteria phylum dominated the bacterial community under uv and vuv irradiation proteobacteria phylum has been reported to be multifunctional aromatic degraders that can be helpful in the degradation of aromatic protein like substances song et al 2020 verrucomicrobiota were negatively correlated with proteobacteria and acted as biomarkers in the gdm samples fig s5e verrucomicrobiota another dominant phylum has the potential to secrete organic and amino acid compounds zhu et al 2022 the relative abundance of the verrucomicrobiota phylum in gdm was 14 5 which decreased to 8 7 and 4 3 in gdm uv and gdm vuv respectively fig s5d restriction of amino acid secretion can inhibit the synthesis of proteins in eps in general the ecological network revealed that the key species in the biofouling layer possess the potential to degrade or restrict protein synthesis which can effectively reduce the adhesion of the biofouling layer in proteobacteria the top 30 genera were selected based on relative abundance fig s5f hirschia rubrivivax and hyphomonas were the dominant genera in all samples hirschia plays an important role in the degradation of various monosaccharides amino acids and sugar alcohols wagner et al 2014 rubrivivax possesses multiple mechanisms for energy production and carbon utilization and functions as a degradation agent for various aromatic compounds levy booth et al 2021 hyphomonas is a major member of the microbial community involved in hydrocarbon degradation hung et al 2021 enrichment of these dominant genera could facilitate the degradation of fouling leading to heterogeneity in the biofouling layer 3 7 metabolomic characterization of the biofouling layer metabolic analysis techniques were used to elucidate the role of uv and vuv light on the metabolic activity of the bacteria in total 160 metabolites were identified in the biofouling layer samples and univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed on the metabolomic dataset using metaboanalyst 5 0 permutation analysis of the opls da model was conducted using 100 different model alignments and the results q2 0 5 and r2y 0 5 demonstrated the robustness of the model table s6 in the opls da model a clear separation of the gdm uv group and gdm vuv groups from the control group gdm was observed fig s6a and b indicating that the metabolic features of the low molecular weight compounds were altered by uv and vuv irradiation in addition screening for sams was supported by calculating the vip values based on the opls da results the sams in the gdm uv and gdm vuv samples in comparison to gdm are displayed in the volcano plot fold change 0 5 or 2 p value 0 05 vip 1 figs s6c and d a total of 20 sams were found in the gdm uv gdm group consisting of 14 down regulated metabolites and 6 up regulated metabolites table s7 19 sams were filtered in the gdm vuv gdm group table s8 and the number of downregulated sams 15 was higher than that of the upregulated sams 4 these results suggest that uv and vuv exposure inhibit microbial metabolite secretion as shown in fig s6e a biological pathway enrichment analysis was performed on these sams and shared sams alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and glycine serine and threonine metabolism were the significantly altered pathways in gdm uv gdm and gdm vuv gdm respectively p 0 05 the shared sams were mainly enriched for alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism pathways and these pathways had relatively high impact values on gdm vuv gdm vuv perturbed the pathways more than uv which can be attributed to the powerful destructive force of the non selective ho created by vuv on the nutrients required for bacterial anabolism gharibian and hazrati 2022 the relevant metabolic pathways and metabolites are shown in fig 8 a alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and glycine serine and threonine metabolism were involved in valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis respectively valine leucine and isoleucine are the main branched chain amino acids for protein synthesis and participate in the synthesis of many secondary metabolites and the burst of reactive oxygen species xing and last 2017 arginine is involved in various pathways that regulate and maintain cellular functions such as protein and polyamine production shen et al 2006 the acute impairment of these biochemical pathways can interfere with protein biosynthesis specifically the bacterial metabolite content in the biofouling layer changed after uv and vuv irradiation l aspartic acid and 4 aminobutanoate are sams in gdm uv gdm the l aspartic acid content was significantly reduced by 93 0 and the level of 4 aminobutanoate was remarkably improved by 138 0 following uv application l aspartic acid influences arginine biosynthesis 4 aminobutanoate prevented the secretion of l glutamine by competing with l glutamate consequently disturbing arginine biosynthesis n n dimethylarginine is a metabolic byproduct of the protein modification process and is closely related to arginine hao et al 2021 the decrease in n n dimethylarginine content could indicate a limitation in arginine biosynthesis d glyceric acid content significantly declined by 84 9 after vuv treatment which caused a reduction in the content of d glyceric acid glycine threonine and 2 ketobutyric acid eventually disturbing valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis the lower levels of valine and isoleucine in the gdm vuv sample compared to the gdm further proved the effectiveness of vuv in perturbing this pathway moreover a significant reduction in l aspartic acid content was noted with vuv irradiation which also had a negative effect on arginine biosynthesis compared to uv vuv exhibited a stronger ability to restrict amino acids n n dimethylarginine valine and isoleucine the synthesis of extracellular proteins in bacteria is constrained by amino acids feng et al 2018 the application of uv and vuv can interfere with the biosynthesis pathways of some amino acid substances which can be beneficial for controlling the secretion of extracellular proteins lb pn and tb pn by bacteria as illustrated in fig 8b strong correlations were found between the critical metabolites and the genera of the core phylum proteobacteria r 0 8 p 0 05 for sams l aspartic acid was significantly positively correlated with swb02 whereas a significant negative correlation was observed with candidatus berkiella 4 aminobutanoate exhibited a positive correlation with rhodobacter and sphingopyxis and negatively correlated with limnohabitans d glyceric acid displayed a strong positive relationship with nordella and a negative association with ahniella furthermore valine and isoleucine were strongly negatively correlated with hirschia swb02 nordella and limnohabitans exhibited active amino acid biosynthesis the raw material for amino acid biosynthesis can be consumed by candidatus berkiella and rhodobacter which inhibit the synthesis process synthesized amino acids can be further degraded by hirschia disturbing protein processing in summary uv and vuv irradiation changed the relative abundances of these characteristic genera leading to differential metabolites 3 8 mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation a potential mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation was speculated based on the results of this study fig 9 the organics accumulated in the membrane tank can be derived from bacteria and their metabolites which are important carbon and energy sources for the growth and development of bacteria in the biofouling layer on the membrane surface meng et al 2017 uv irradiation mainly limited the increase in protein like substances by inhibiting bacterial activity through 254 nm photons apart from bacteria inactivation vuv can also produce ho by photolysis of water via 185 nm irradiation which was used to mineralize protein like materials the content of protein like components in the membrane tank was significantly reduced by the application of uv and vuv which altered the bacterial community especially the proteobacteria phylum a reduction in protein like substances can greatly limit the survival of some characteristic genera by inhibiting amino acid biosynthetic pathways owing to the shortage of substrates the synthesis of lb pn and tb pn by the bacteria was restricted thus reducing the cohesion of the fouling and adhesion of the biofouling layer to the membrane this phenomenon induced the formation of porous structures in the biofouling layer leading to cleaner membranes consequently rc and rp decreased promoting permeate flux 4 conclusion in this study uv and vuv were applied for in situ purification of membrane tanks to evaluate their impact on the reduction of membrane biofouling in biofiltration facilitated gdm systems 1 the application of uv and vuv reduced rc and rp resulting in 1 26 fold and 1 78 fold permeate fluxes respectively the content of doc and protein like substances that accumulated in the membrane tank declined after the application of uv and vuv 2 the use of uv and vuv reduced the adhesion of protein like substances polysaccharides and humic like substances to the membrane and improved the hydrophilicity of the membrane compared to gdm uv the membrane of gdm vuv attached less fouling and the membrane surface was cleaner 3 after the application of uv and vuv the biofouling layer became thinner exhibited less protein accumulation and became more porous the contents of lb pn and tb pn in eps were sequentially reduced by the use of uv and vuv which indirectly determined the resistance by increasing δgtot fouling fouling the biofouling layer of the gdm vuv was more heterogeneous and accumulated less protein than that of the gdm uv 4 the use of uv and vuv significantly affected the bacterial community structure on the membrane surface by reducing the protein like protein content in the membrane tank mantel s r 0 7 p 0 05 the proteobacteria phylum served as a connector for the constructed ecological molecular network the differences in the excretion of lb pn and tb pn were linked to valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis which was involved in alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and glycine serine and threonine metabolism respectively the key genera of proteobacteria phylum that participated in altering metabolism were hirschia rhodobacter nordella candidatus berkiella and limnohabitans this study demonstrated that the in situ application of uv and vuv is an effective alternative strategy for alleviating membrane biofouling in biofiltration facilitated gdm

14669,biofouling is a major challenge limiting the practical application of biofiltration facilitated gravity driven membrane gdm systems in drinking water treatment in this study ultraviolet irradiation including ultraviolet uv and vacuum ultraviolet vuv irradiation was used for in situ purification of membrane tanks to control membrane biofouling after using uv and vuv the permeate flux increased significantly by 26 1 and 78 3 respectively which was mainly due to the decreased cake layer resistance rc the permeability of the biofouling layer improved after uv and vuv application as evidenced by the increased surface porosity and decreased thickness the contents of loosely bound extracellular proteins lb pn and tightly bound extracellular proteins tb pn in the biofouling layer were reduced after uv and vuv irradiation the decreased lb pn and tb pn improved the interfacial free energy between the fouling itself and between the fouling and the membrane which contributed to the reduction of interfacial cohesion and adhesion resulting in a looser and thinner biofouling layer and a cleaner membrane the concentration of protein like material in the membrane tank decreased after uv and vuv irradiation significantly altering the bacterial community structure on the membrane surface mantel s r 0 7 p 0 05 the changes in the metabolic state were responsible for the differences in the lb pn and tb pn contents the inhibition of alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and glycine serine and threonine metabolism reduced amino acid biosynthesis which restricted the secretion of lb pn and tb pn critical genera in the proteobacteria phylum such as hirschia rhodobacter nordella candidatus berkiella and limnohabitans were involved in metabolite transformation overall the in situ application of uv and vuv can be an effective alternative strategy to mitigate membrane biofouling which would facilitate the practical application of biofiltration facilitated gdm systems in drinking water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gravity driven membrane gdm ultraviolet uv vacuum ultraviolet vuv metabolic pathway extracellular polymeric substances eps interface free energy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ultrafiltration uf membrane systems have been widely used in drinking water production because of their economical and efficient approach for achieving a high quality water supply chang et al 2022 gravity driven membrane gdm processes have received more attention than traditional pressure driven membrane processes because they eliminate the requirements for backwashing physical flushing and chemical cleaning pronk et al 2019 however the low flux caused by membrane fouling is a critical obstacle to achieving a more comprehensive gdm system membrane fouling can decrease filtration performance and shorten the life of the membrane thereby increasing the operational cost of the gdm system membrane fouling is mainly induced by the unfavorable deposition of organic fouling and biofouling in the feed water organic fouling mainly involves biopolymers polysaccharides and proteins and humic substances yu et al 2018 biofouling is induced by extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by microorganisms that adsorb and grow on membrane surfaces it can reduce the compressibility of the biofouling layer and block membrane pores desmond et al 2022 biofiltration pre treatment has proven to be a green efficient and cost effective alternative for reducing membrane fouling in gdm systems lee et al 2019 a biofilter integrated or externally placed can significantly increase the permeate flux of the gdm the biofilter can remove organic materials from feed water by biodegradation by microorganisms colonizing the substrate surface gibert et al 2013 however cultivated bacteria can escape from the biofilter and produce organics such as soluble microbial products smp through cellular metabolism and lysis yu et al 2020 as filtration is carried out continuously bacteria and their metabolites accumulate in the membrane tank due to the rejection effect causing serious membrane biofouling suspended bacteria tend to be transported and attach to membranes promoting biofouling layer formation cai and liu 2016 bacterial metabolites smp as electron donors and nutrients can be used for substance synthesis activities which would promote the generation of active cells and the secretion of eps contributing to the integrity of the structure and function of the biofouling layer meng et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to adopt additional treatment methods to effectively control the accumulation of bacteria and their metabolites before membrane separation particularly in biofiltration facilitated gdm systems effective strategies including membrane modification liu et al 2020 chemical oxidation zhang et al 2022 and ultraviolet exposure feng et al 2022 have been employed to reduce membrane biofouling of the gdm system membrane modification focused on anti bacterial coatings but the continuous consumption of functional layers was a major limiting issue the use of chlorine and permanganate as oxidants produces undesirable water color and disinfection byproducts in contrast ultraviolet irradiation is more suitable for gdm because of its simple operation and the absence of continuous chemical consumption ultraviolet uv 254 nm and vacuum ultraviolet vuv 185 254 nm light sources are commonly used for drinking water treatment because of their high photon energy the emission wavelength of the uv lamp is 254 nm the light quanta produced by 254 nm irradiation facilitate an increase in the number of thymine dimers in the cells thus damaging the dna of the bacteria sinha and häder 2002 the vuv lamp emits photons at wavelengths 185 and 254 nm the 185 nm photons can produce hydroxyl radicals ho by inducing the cracking and ionization of water molecules zoschke et al 2014 the reaction by 185 nm vuv irradiation of water is described by the following equation 1 h 2 o h v 185 h o h 2 h 2 o h v 185 h o h e a q the ho radical site is one of the most reactive and non selective species which reacts indiscriminately with all components of the dna molecule destroying purine and pyrimidine bases as well as the deoxyribose backbone halliwell and gutteridge 2015 furthermore ho can attack electron rich regions of organic matter leading to its decomposition or even mineralization audenaert et al 2013 both uv and vuv irradiation can damage the genetic material of bacteria leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis lim et al 2021 thus reducing the potential for metabolite secretion ultraviolet irradiation pretreatment has been successfully used to mitigate fouling in biofiltration facilitated gdm systems feng et al 2022 this approach focuses on pretreatment prior to biofiltration and the transmission efficiency of photons is limited by scavengers such as natural organic matter and turbidity causing matter kutschera et al 2009 these scavengers can be effectively reduced by biofiltration thus the installation of photoreactors downstream of the biofiltration unit would be more effective for membrane fouling mitigation moreover compared to pretreatment the in situ treatment by ultraviolet irradiation can act directly on the accumulated bacteria and organics in the membrane tank water further improving the water quality before membrane filtration nevertheless information about the in situ use of ultraviolet irradiation is limited mainly due to the deterioration of the polymer membrane induced by direct irradiation in this study ultraviolet irradiation uv and vuv was installed in a gdm system to purify the membrane tank water in situ by internal circulation such an arrangement can provide the potential for in situ applications of ultraviolet irradiation uv and vuv however the effect of the in situ application of ultraviolet irradiation uv and vuv on membrane fouling especially in gdm systems after biofiltration is unknown the composition and structure of the biofouling layer in gdm systems are key factors in determining the permeability performance which is determined by the eps secreted by the bacteria zhang et al 2021 nutrient abundance or scarcity significantly affects bacterial metabolism and growth polz and cordero 2016 the content and composition of organics can be altered by the use of uv and vuv zoschke et al 2014 which changes the carbon source and energy available to the bacteria meng et al 2017 affecting bacterial behavior on the membrane surface to adjust to environmental alterations bacteria upregulate important metabolic pathways such as aspartate and glutamate metabolism to produce more eps proteins to protect themselves feng et al 2018 previous studies on gdm systems have explained eps changes based only on the abundance and function of the bacterial community feng et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 however the effect of in situ application of uv and vuv on eps production at the metabolomic level is still unknown the permeability of the biofouling layer is related to the level of internal adhesion which is dependent on the thermodynamic properties zhao et al 2018 evaluating the influence of the eps content and composition on the thermodynamic properties of the biofouling layer would contribute to a better understanding of membrane fouling in gdm systems to the best of our knowledge this has not yet been reported for gdm systems the microbial mechanisms underlying the alleviation of membrane fouling can be fully elucidated using a combination of multi omics techniques and thermodynamics in this study the effects of two ultraviolet lamps i e uv and vuv in the form of in situ operation on membrane fouling in biofiltration facilitated gdm systems are summarized flux resistance and organic removal were used to evaluate the permeate performance of the system the properties of the biofouling layer including structure composition and interface free energy were investigated to investigate the membrane fouling mechanism to clarify the biological effects the influence of uv and vuv on bacterial communities and metabolic pathways in the biofouling layer was also considered in detail this study provides a promising approach i e in situ application of ultraviolet irradiation to mitigate biofouling in biofiltration facilitated gdm systems and provides comprehensive insights into the mechanism thus expanding the application of this combined system in drinking water supply 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation surface water was obtained from the tonghui river n 39 875867 e 116 444557 supporting information si table s1 the polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf ultrafiltration membrane used in the experiments had a nominal cutoff value of 100 kda the effective membrane area per module was 0 0188 m2 as shown in fig 1 the driving force for each gdm system was the height difference between the liquid levels of the membrane tank and the overflow tank 65 cm the hose connected the permeate outlet of the membrane module to the overflow tank which featured a full pipe flow and flooded discharge to maintain a constant filter head the height of the overflow tank was periodically adjusted the three gdm reactors had the same working volume 2 83 l a membrane tank water discharge device was installed to control the hydraulic residence time hrt based on the inlet flow rate of the gdm system with maximum permeate flux the discharge flow rates of the other gdm systems were adjusted daily to obtain the same inlet flow rate the hrt was calculated by dividing the working volume of the gdm system by the inlet flow rate the hrt of the three gdm reactors was similar during the entire operational period with an average value of approximately 18 h the biofilter was installed prior

2 3 mm and a filling height of 60 cm the uv gph150t5l 4 heraeus co and vuv gph150t5vh 4 heraeus co lamps were protected with quartz tubes and placed in a reactor outside the gdm membrane tank the gdm systems with uv and vuv were named gdm uv and gdm vuv respectively during the experiment each lamp was operated on for 15 min and off for 2 h while a peristaltic pump was used to drive the water flow through the photoreactor and membrane tank this ensured that the water in the membrane tank was actively mixed while being illuminated by the lamp the average residence time of the membrane tank water in the photoreactor was 1 35 min per cycle the vuv lamp emitted photon wavelengths of 254 and 185 nm with intensities of 0 064 mw cm2 and 0 006 mw cm2 respectively the uv lamp emitted light at a wavelength of 254 nm with an intensity of 0 069 mw cm2 each membrane tank was equipped with intermittent aeration each membrane tank was equipped with aeration equipment aeration at 1 0 l min for 1 min followed by a 60 min stop all gdm systems were operated continuously for 60 d without any cleaning measures the flux was calculated by weighing the permeate water as described in text s1 si 2 2

layer was freeze dried to preserve its original structure the pollutant fraction was extracted from the fouled membranes with 0 01 m naoh and the eem spectra were examined to determine the fluorescence properties confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm nikon ax r japan and image acquisition were employed to determine the distribution of proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids in the

austria and dynamic contact angle ca dataphysics tp50 germany respectively to acquire the cross sectional images the biofouling layer and membrane were fractured in liquid nitrogen the surface porosity of the biofouling layer was quantified from the sem images obtained using image pro plus 6 0 according to previous protocols li and yang 2007 eps were extracted from the biofouling layer by a

polysaccharide concentration was determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method loosely bound extracellular proteins lb pn and tightly bound extracellular proteins tb pn represent the proteins in the lb eps and tb eps respectively the polysaccharides in the lb eps and tb eps were referred to as lb ps and tb ps respectively 2 4 interfacial interaction analysis the interfacial free energy between the interfaces was quantified using the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory which has been used to estimate the membrane fouling potential li and yang 2007 a detailed description is provided in text s4 si 2 5 bioinformatic and metabolomic deciphering at the end of the experiment dna from the biofouling layer was extracted and sequenced as previously described feng et al 2022 the detection of bacterial communities and metabolites in the biofouling layer and data analysis were performed at beijing allwegene technology co ltd beijing china raw reads were uploaded

metabolites was constructed using the rstudio software 3 results and discussion 3 1 flux and resistance the evolution of the permeate flux in the gdm system during the entire operation period is shown in fig 2 a during the 60 day filtration period gdm gdm uv and gdm vuv exhibited varying degrees of flux decline which was attributed to the development and maturation of the biofouling layer three stages of flux decline a b and c were observed and delineated by dashed lines in the initial phase a gdm vuv had the slowest decreasing trend from 22 3 l m2 h to 10 6 l m2 h followed by gdm uv from 20 0 l m2 h to 9 0 l m2 h which could be attributed to the excellent control of fouling accumulated in the membrane tanks by the uv and vuv units in stages b and c the flux reduction of all systems slowed and then remained pseudo steady for a long duration the flux curves of gdm uv and gdm vuv were distinctly separated on day 30 which could be attributed to the ingestion of the biofouling layer by the microorganisms the stable flux of gdm was 4 6 l m2 h fig 2b compared to gdm the stable fluxes of gdm uv and gdm vuv were significantly increased by 26 1 and 78 3 respectively p 0 05 this result indicates that the uv and vuv units are effective strategies for flux improvement furthermore the stable flux of gdm vuv showed a significant increase of 41 4 compared to that of gdm uv p 0 05 demonstrating that the vuv unit was superior to uv in flux enhancement the fouling hydraulic resistance of all the membrane systems was opposite to the flux variation which increased until a steady state was reached fig 2c regardless of the time gdm vuv and gdm uv showed relatively lower fouling hydraulic resistances than gdm suggesting that the application of vuv and uv units can effectively limit fouling development the variations in the intrinsic membrane resistance rm cake layer resistance rc and pore blocking resistance rp were further evaluated fig 2d for all filtration systems the resistance values of rm were almost consistent 0 85 1012 m 1 illustrating the consistency and comparability of the membranes used rc had the highest percentage 70 3 78 2 indicating that the resistance of the gdm systems was determined by the biofouling layer which is consistent with a previous report pronk et al 2019 compared with gdm the rc values of gdm uv and gdm vuv were significantly reduced by 24 6 and 43 5 respectively p 0 05 which could be ascribed to the increased heterogeneity of the biofouling layer furthermore the rc values were significantly reduced by 25 2 and 51 2 after the application of uv and vuv respectively p 0 05 the accumulation of fouling in membrane pores was effectively restricted by the uv and vuv units the use of uv and vuv decreased rc and rp which led to an enhanced permeate flux 3 2 organics removal the variations in the doc levels in the raw water membrane tanks and permeate are presented in fig 3 a the doc content in the raw water was 3 14 mg l which decreased to 1 03 mg l after passing through the biofilter the removal of doc may have been due to the adsorption of gac and the biodegradation of microorganisms on its surface yuan et al 2022 in the gdm system doc accumulation was observed in the membrane tank and can be attributed to the decomposition of particulate organics by microorganisms and the rejection of soluble substances by the membrane wu et al 2019 the highest doc content 2 45 mg l was obtained in the membrane tank of the gdm the doc content in the membrane tank was significantly reduced to 1 35 mg l and 1 19 mg l after using uv and vuv respectively p 0 05 photons generated by uv and vuv radiation can effectively degrade organic compounds and improve their biodegradability ratpukdi et al 2010 the degradation of organic compounds is summarized in eqs 3 and 4 uv irradiation had almost no effect on doc removal but showed efficient bacterial inactivation 1 91 log test s7 the reduction in the doc content accumulated in the gdm uv membrane tank can be ascribed to the inhibition of bacterial activity by uv irradiation compared with gdm uv the membrane tank of gdm vuv had a lower accumulated doc content vuv irradiation exhibited a similar ability to inactivate bacteria as uv in the presence of ho scavengers organics text s7 the greater effectiveness of vuv irradiation has been attributed to the generation of ho feng et al 2022 as a highly reactive and nonselective oxidant ho can decompose recalcitrant organic compounds into smaller biodegradable molecules or even mineralize them audenaert et al 2013 the doc content in the permeate water of the three gdm systems was nearly the same 1 03 mg l 3 o r g a n i c s 254 n m p h o t o n s b y p r o d u c t s 4 o r g a n i c s h o b y p r o d u c t s c o 2 h 2 o the uv254 for the gdm membrane tank was 0 0120 cm 1 which dropped to 0 0087 cm 1 and 0 0074 cm 1 after the application of uv and vuv respectively fig s1a the chemical bonds of unsaturated or aromatic organics are destroyed by the photons generated by uv and vuv resulting in a decrease in uv254 for the permeate water the lowest uv254 was detected in gdm vuv 0 0078 cm 1 followed by gdm uv 0 0089 cm 1 the use of uv and vuv light diminished the amount of unsaturated or aromatic organics in the permeated water two fluorescent components components 1 and 2 were obtained by parafac model decomposition on the eem datasets fig 3b the fluorescence spectra and corresponding excitation emission loadings of the parafac model outputs for components 1 and 2 are shown in fig s1b component 1 contained protein like materials and exhibited signal peaks at 225 325 nm ex em and 275 325 nm ex em the ex em wavelength pairs of the component 2 peaks were concentrated at 240 410 nm which are related to humic like substances after biofiltration the maximum fluorescence fmax of component 2 was reduced by 66 4 whereas that of component 1 was reduced by only 5 8 this result meant that the biofilter was effective in removing humic like material but showed limited effectiveness in the removal of protein like substances protein like materials can be replenished by smp released from microbial activity in the gdm membrane tank the accumulation of components 1 and 2 was observed after uv and vuv application sharp decreases in fmax values were consistently noted for all components with 62 8 and 75 8 for component 1 and 18 5 and 49 4 for component 2 respectively accumulated fluorescent organics especially protein like substances can be effectively restricted by uv and vuv light photons generated by uv and vuv irradiation at 254 nm can damage protein structure by attacking the amide group mehmood et al 2022 furthermore the secretion of proteins by bacteria can be inhibited by 254 nm photons owing to dna damage sinha and häder 2002 the 254 nm photons and ho had a synergistic effect on protein damage audenaert et al 2013 thus compared to uv irradiation vuv irradiation was more efficient in restricting protein accumulation protein like substances are biopolymers that can induce the formation of gel layers on membrane surfaces leading to reduced membrane permeability kimura and oki 2017 for the permeate effluent the fmax of all components consistently declined after uv and vuv irradiation indicating that uv and vuv irradiation can improve the removal of protein and humic like substances leading to an enhancement of water quality overall vuv and uv irradiation can effectively reduce the loading of organics on the membrane which could alleviate membrane fouling 3 3 membrane fouling properties the surface morphology of the membrane after the removal of the biofouling layer was observed by sem at the end of the operation fig 4 a the virgin membrane had a smooth surface with clear membrane pores and no visible sediments in contrast after filtering the water from various membrane tanks different amounts of agglomerates were deposited on the membrane surface blocking the membrane pores the membrane surface of the gdm system exhibited the highest number of adhered agglomerates the number of agglomerates on the membrane surface was significantly reduced upon uv irradiation when vuv irradiation was applied the aggregates on the membrane surface vanished and the morphology appeared to be nearly identical to that of the virgin membrane the application of uv and vuv successfully protected the membrane from the deposited pollutants and the effect of vuv was stronger the fluorescence properties of the fouling adhered to the membrane after removal of the biofouling layer are shown in fig 4b the fluorescent organics that adhered to the membrane surface had similar compositions the wavelengths of the peaks were all focused around ex em 260 340 nm which accounts for the protein like material in the smp the gdm membrane exhibited the highest intensity of protein like material owing to the use of uv and vuv light the intensity of the protein like substances that adhered to the gdm uv and gdm vuv membranes decreased sequentially the 2d spectrogram at ex 260 nm further supports these results the presence of uv and vuv diminished the adhesion of the smp to the membrane with vuv playing a more significant role than uv the membrane samples were analyzed using atr ftir and the relevant spectra are shown in fig 4c all samples exhibited similar characteristic peaks but the vibration intensities of the peaks differed obviously the peak at 3330 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of oh which is associated with all possible pollutants the characteristic peak at 1656 cm 1 was related to amide i xu et al 2022 which could be derived from the nitrogen containing functional groups in the protein o h deformation and c o stretching of phenolic compounds occurred at 1400 cm 1 xu et al 2022 and the twisting vibration of ch2 appeared at 1172 cm 1 zhi et al 2014 which could be functional groups related to polysaccharides the two sharp peaks at 872 cm 1 and 840 cm 1 were connected to the c c c stretching vibrations mei et al 2014 which could be attributed to the contribution of humic like compounds these functional groups showed a decreasing trend of vibrational peaks in the order of gdm gdm uv gdm vuv indicating that the application of uv and vuv decreased the deposition of protein like substances polysaccharides and humic like substances on the membrane surface protein like substances and polysaccharides are considered typical biofouling substances suggesting the effectiveness of uv and vuv irradiation in the removal of biofouling the pollutants deposited on the membrane surface and pores can alter the hydrophilicity of the membrane because of the different contact angles of the fouled membrane fig 4d the virgin membrane showed good hydrophilicity average contact angle 56 5 in contrast the contact angle of the gdm fouled membrane increased to 81 9 which may be due to the adhesion of hydrophobic substances after uv and vuv irradiation the contact angles of the membranes decreased to 72 3 and 61 5 for gdm uv and gdm vuv respectively uv and vuv irradiation can reduce the adhesion of hydrophobic substances to membranes leading to an increase in membrane hydrophilicity highly hydrophilic membranes exhibit satisfactory antifouling ability and water permeability zheng et al 2022 3 4 physico chemical characterization of the biofouling layer 3 4 1 physical structure of the biofouling layer as shown in fig 5 a the surface morphology of the biofouling layer was distinct for the different membrane filtration systems the biofouling layer of the gdm system was relatively smooth and a large number of substances bonded together in contrast the surface of the gdm uv biofouling layer was rough and contained more voids the biofouling layer of the gdm vuv was more porous and had larger gaps than that of the gdm uv the presence of uv and vuv light reduced the strength of the connections between the fouling particles in the biofouling layer causing an increase in voids the obtained sem images were processed using image pro plus to measure the surface porosity of the biofouling layer fig s2a the highest surface porosity 7 94 was observed in the biofouling layer of gdm vuv followed by gdm uv 4 57 high surface porosity can provide additional channels for passing water leading to an increase in permeability the use of vuv and uv effectively decreased the thicknesses of the biofouling layers fig 5a the average thickness of the biofouling layer of gdm was approximately 95 3 μm which was reduced to 51 5 μm and 47 4 μm after using uv and vuv respectively fig s2b these results confirmed that the use of uv and vuv significantly eliminated or decreased the accumulation of fouling on the membrane surface 3 4 2 composition analysis of the biofouling layer the c1s spectrum was deconvoluted into four representative peaks fig s3a c the characteristic peak of c c h was located at 284 8 ev which correlated with hydrocarbon like compounds such as lipids and amino acid side chains wang et al 2018 as shown in fig 5b the percentage of c c h in the biofouling layer increased from 45 2 to 56 2 and 62 2 after uv and vuv irradiation respectively which can be attributed to the effective decomposition of eps c o n 286 3 ev represents amines or amides which could be associated with proteins after uv and vuv applications the percentages of c o n in the biofouling layer were reduced to 30 8 and 29 6 respectively which can be ascribed to the degradation of proteins the peak at 288 0 ev was assigned to the o c o and c o bonds which are mainly present in the carboxylic acid group carbonyl group and acetal and hemiacetal groups li et al 2022 the o c o and c o bonds are involved in the formation of highly hydrophilic polysaccharides the lowest o c o and c o bond contents were obtained for gdm vuv 6 4 followed by gdm uv 10 9 these results indicate that the use of uv and vuv decreased the accumulation of polysaccharides in the biofouling layer and the elimination effect of vuv was better than that of uv moreover the weak peak at 289 0 ev was related to the o c oh and o c or functional groups of carboxyl or ester groups badireddy et al 2008 which were not changed obviously in the biofouling layers of the three filtration systems the n 1s peak was separated into two different bands located at the binding energy of 399 6 and 400 17 ev respectively fig s3d f the n c r peak was placed at 399 6 ev which was derived from the amide function of the protein and peptide chain yu et al 2018 after uv and vuv irradiation the n c r content decreased to 40 7 and 22 6 respectively fig 5c this phenomenon reveals that the application of uv and vuv can induce the disintegration of proteins and reduce the protein content in the biofouling layer the peak at 400 17 ev can be attributed to the typical amino acid bond h n c o yu et al 2018 and its content increased to 59 3 for gdm uv and 77 4 for gdm vuv in the biofouling layer proteins are damaged by photons from uv and vuv light resulting in elevated levels of protein monomers i e amino acids the atr ftir spectra showed different stretches of characteristic peaks in the different biofouling layers fig 5d three sharp peaks were identified at 3275 cm 1 1638 cm 1 and 1027 cm 1 which were attributed to oh amide i and c o c vibrations respectively lin et al 2013 wang et al 2018 the oh peak can be associated with highly hydrophilic fouling which can promote bacterial accumulation and increase the filtration resistance of the biofouling layer li et al 2022 amide i and c o c were assigned to the proteins and polysaccharides respectively after uv and vuv irradiation the vibrations of the three characteristic peaks sequentially weakened this result indicated that the accumulation of foulants in the biofouling layer was reduced by uv and vuv irradiation especially for proteins and polysaccharides these observations are consistent with the results of xps analysis which demonstrated the effectiveness of uv and vuv light in restricting the accumulation of proteins and polysaccharides clsm images depict the distribution of polysaccharides proteins and dna on the biofouling layer which are marked in green red and blue respectively fig 5e the most significant differences were observed in protein distribution the biofouling layer of gdm was covered with the largest amount of protein in contrast the protein clusters were dramatically reduced in the biofouling layers of gdm uv and gdm vuv and were the lowest in gdm vuv this result is in accordance with the decrease in rc the use of uv and vuv diminished the protein content in the biofouling layer which could be the main reason for the reduction in biofouling layer resistance the known surface tension parameters of the three probe liquids water glycerol and diiodomethane are listed in table s2 the contact angle and zeta potential measurements of the biofouling layer and membrane are presented in table s3 the individual surface tension parameters were calculated based on these data table s4 the electron donor parameter γ varied significantly among the three samples specifically the γ value of the gdm biofouling layer was 1 52 mj m2 which increased to 7 17 mj m2 for gdm uv and 10 58 mj m2 for gdm vuv this result implies that the fouling of gdm uv and gdm vuv could carry more electrons the repulsive forces induced by polar interactions can be greater in gdm uv and gdm vuv than in gdm resulting in a more difficult fouling aggregation fig 5f shows the cohesive free energy per unit area of the fouling membrane and fouling fouling interfaces based on xdlvo theory for the fouling membrane and fouling fouling samples the lewis acid base fraction δgab always contributed greatly 74 9 93 0 to the total cohesion free energy δgtot while the lifshitz van der waals component δglw and the electrostatic force energy δgel made much smaller contributions a negative value of gtot indicates mutual attraction between the two interfaces for the fouling membrane the δgtot values were ranked as follows gdm 51 5 mj m2 gdm uv 41 1 mj m2 gdm vuv 36 1 mj m2 the use of uv and vuv decreased the adhesion of fouling to the membrane resulting in a cleaner membrane additionally in terms of fouling fouling the δgtot value of gdm uv 48 5 mj m2 and gdm vuv 36 1 mj m2 was much higher than that of gdm 77 5 mj m2 this suggests that the self aggregation potential of fouling was minimized by uv and vuv irradiation leading to a looser and more heterogeneous structure of the biofouling layer to summarize uv and vuv can reduce the adhesion of fouling membrane and the cohesion of fouling fouling mainly by modifying the lewis acid base forces 3 5 eps properties eps is considered a key factor in determining membrane resistance because of its impact on the properties of biofouling layers wang et al 2009 the eem spectra of eps are shown in fig 6 a similar characteristic peaks with different intensities focused in the region of ex em 200 300 250 400 nm were observed in all eem spectra reflecting the similarities and differences in eps between different gdm systems the parafac analysis was performed to quantify the content of each fluorescent component and the detailed spectra and loadings are presented in fig s4 component 1 positioned at ex em 225 310 nm and ex em 275 310 nm was attributed to tyrosine the characteristic peak of component 2 at ex em 275 350 nm was attributed to tryptophan component 3 ex em 250 425 nm was attributed to humic like substances eps was mainly dominated by components 1 and 2 the lb eps content was higher than the tb eps content which was consistent with the eem spectra regardless of lb eps and tb eps the fmax values of components 1 and 2 were the highest in gdm and were attenuated in gdm uv and gdm vuv fig 6b tyrosine and tryptophan are aromatic protein pollutants related to their high adhesion capacity and gel layer formation on the membrane surface which strongly determine the membrane fouling level wu et al 2020 the application of uv and vuv facilitated the destruction of tyrosine and tryptophan which could explain the reduction in the adhesion of the biofouling layer the biofouling layer was mainly composed of proteins which accounted for more than 80 of the total eps fig 6c a greater reduction in lb pn and tb pn content was noted in the eps of gdm uv and gdm vuv 17 4 33 4 the high viscosity of proteins facilitates the formation of a biofouling layer on the membrane surfaces iorhemen et al 2019 the use of uv and vuv irradiation significantly inhibited the secretion of lb pn and tb pn which likely led to a reduction in the thickness of the biofouling layer compared to gdm the protein to polysaccharide pn ps ratios of gdm uv and gdm vuv were 3 0 and 10 6 lower respectively a high pn ps ratio can improve the relative hydrophobicity of the fouling and enhance particle affinity and aggregation arabi and nakhla 2008 the presence of uv and vuv can reduce the pn ps ratio which could be the reason for the decrease in cohesion energy the results of the pls pm model revealed the relationship between eps interface free energy and resistance fig 6d the model fit was good goodness of fit 0 894 eps had a significant effect p 0 05 on gtot fouling membrane and gtot fouling fouling and the path coefficients of both were 0 982 suggesting that the increase in eps contributed to cohesion and adhesion the effect coefficient of δgtot fouling fouling on the resistance 1 349 was much larger than that of δgtot fouling membrane 0 404 suggesting that the internal aggregation effect of fouling was a critical factor influencing the resistance the indirect effect of eps on resistance 0 927 was much stronger than its direct effect 0 053 eps indirectly determined the development of resistance by altering the cohesion of dirt additionally lb pn and tb pn had the highest loadings on the potential eps variables both at 0 305 indicating that the variation in eps was mainly affected by protein content fig 6e compared to rm and rp rc loaded more on the potential variable of resistance 0 403 suggesting that the alteration in resistance was mainly dominated by the permeability of the biofouling layer overall the use of uv and vuv decreased the protein content in eps which weakened the cohesive effect between fouling eventually leading to increased permeability of the biofouling layer 3 6 effects of uv and vuv on bacterial communities good s sequence coverage for all samples was 99 fig s5a which indicated that the sequencing depth was sufficient to represent the diversity of the microbial community the shannon and simpson indices were significantly higher in both the gdm uv and gdm vuv samples than in the gdm samples indicating an increase in bacterial community diversity fig s5b c the total number of operational taxonomic units otus in all biofouling layers was 505 fig 7 a the number of otus shared by the gdm uv gdm vuv samples was 298 which was higher than that shared by the gdm gdm uv 129 otus and gdm gdm vuv samples 153 otus uv and vuv irradiation altered the richness of the bacterial communities in the biofouling layer gdm samples had the highest number of unique otus 415 followed by gdm vuv 355 and gdm uv samples 132 the application of uv and vuv reduced the richness of the bacterial communities to some extent which can be attributed to the inactivation effect of uv and vuv irradiation on the bacteria in the membrane tank water compared to uv irradiation vuv irradiation can degrade organics into lower molecular weight compounds leading to a greater potential for bacterial regeneration zoschke et al 2014 thus the richness of the bacterial communities was higher in the biofouling layer of gdm vuv than in that of gdm uv as shown in the pcoa plots fig 7b each of the three gdm systems had a unique microbial community in the biofouling layer based on the bray curtis distance matrix p 0 05 permanova test indicating that uv and vuv accounted for the differences in the bacterial communities the mantel test was used to determine the environmental variables that were significantly correlated with the bacterial community in the biofouling layer fig 7c doc and fluorescent component 1 were strongly associated with the bacterial community mantel s r 0 7 p 0 01 suggesting that doc and protein like components are important environmental factors affecting bacterial community structure doc showed the highest positive correlation with fluorescence component 1 pearson s r 0 9 suggesting that the dissolved organic matter accumulated in the membrane tank was mainly derived from protein like material protein like substances are directly related to microbial activity frank et al 2018 the reduction in protein like substances was associated with the inhibition of bacterial activity by the use of uv and vuv leading to a decrease in the accumulated doc content in the membrane tank fig 3 decreased protein like content alters the carbon resources available to microorganisms leading to reorganization of the bacterial community zhou et al 2021 a random matrix theory based molecular ecology network of phylogenies was constructed with a similarity threshold of 0 92 nodes represented otus node size was positively correlated with connectivity and edges reflected the correlation between otus gray indicates positive correlation and red indicates negative correlation in the network the modules served as a group of highly self connected otus with fewer connections to otus outside the group microorganisms within the same module perform similar functions eiler et al 2012 the constructed network contained 12 modules with a modularity value of 0 712 fig 7d table s5 which was higher than that of the corresponding random network 0 269 illustrating that the network was modular wu et al 2016 the constructed network consisted of 235 nodes and 1095 edges which characterized the size and complexity of the network in networks positive interactions are associated with mutually beneficial symbioses whereas negative interactions involve competition and predation faust and raes 2012 the total number of positive edges was 1026 which was significantly higher than that of the negative interactions 69 fig 7d demonstrating that microorganisms in the biofouling layer were more likely to cooperate than to compete the nodes in the network belonged to 19 phyla and proteobacteria occupied a relatively high proportion of the modules the relative abundances of these phyla exhibited large variations suggesting a difference in the level of phylum taxonomy fig s5d key taxa play a more important role in maintaining the network structure than other microorganisms in the network and the disappearance of these hypothetical key taxa affects the stability of the network faust and raes 2012 over 90 of otus were divided into peripherals otu 1801 was identified as a connector in the ecological network fig 7e this keystone belongs to the proteobacteria phylum the majority of otus in the network 54 0 were linked to proteobacteria the relative abundance of proteobacteria in the gdm uv and gdm vuv samples was 41 1 and 59 1 respectively which was higher than that of the gdm sample 23 2 the highest linear discriminant analysis lda scores for proteobacteria in the gdm vuv sample also demonstrated its biomarker properties fig s5e the proteobacteria phylum dominated the bacterial community under uv and vuv irradiation proteobacteria phylum has been reported to be multifunctional aromatic degraders that can be helpful in the degradation of aromatic protein like substances song et al 2020 verrucomicrobiota were negatively correlated with proteobacteria and acted as biomarkers in the gdm samples fig s5e verrucomicrobiota another dominant phylum has the potential to secrete organic and amino acid compounds zhu et al 2022 the relative abundance of the verrucomicrobiota phylum in gdm was 14 5 which decreased to 8 7 and 4 3 in gdm uv and gdm vuv respectively fig s5d restriction of amino acid secretion can inhibit the synthesis of proteins in eps in general the ecological network revealed that the key species in the biofouling layer possess the potential to degrade or restrict protein synthesis which can effectively reduce the adhesion of the biofouling layer in proteobacteria the top 30 genera were selected based on relative abundance fig s5f hirschia rubrivivax and hyphomonas were the dominant genera in all samples hirschia plays an important role in the degradation of various monosaccharides amino acids and sugar alcohols wagner et al 2014 rubrivivax possesses multiple mechanisms for energy production and carbon utilization and functions as a degradation agent for various aromatic compounds levy booth et al 2021 hyphomonas is a major member of the microbial community involved in hydrocarbon degradation hung et al 2021 enrichment of these dominant genera could facilitate the degradation of fouling leading to heterogeneity in the biofouling layer 3 7 metabolomic characterization of the biofouling layer metabolic analysis techniques were used to elucidate the role of uv and vuv light on the metabolic activity of the bacteria in total 160 metabolites were identified in the biofouling layer samples and univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed on the metabolomic dataset using metaboanalyst 5 0 permutation analysis of the opls da model was conducted using 100 different model alignments and the results q2 0 5 and r2y 0 5 demonstrated the robustness of the model table s6 in the opls da model a clear separation of the gdm uv group and gdm vuv groups from the control group gdm was observed fig s6a and b indicating that the metabolic features of the low molecular weight compounds were altered by uv and vuv irradiation in addition screening for sams was supported by calculating the vip values based on the opls da results the sams in the gdm uv and gdm vuv samples in comparison to gdm are displayed in the volcano plot fold change 0 5 or 2 p value 0 05 vip 1 figs s6c and d a total of 20 sams were found in the gdm uv gdm group consisting of 14 down regulated metabolites and 6 up regulated metabolites table s7 19 sams were filtered in the gdm vuv gdm group table s8 and the number of downregulated sams 15 was higher than that of the upregulated sams 4 these results suggest that uv and vuv exposure inhibit microbial metabolite secretion as shown in fig s6e a biological pathway enrichment analysis was performed on these sams and shared sams alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and glycine serine and threonine metabolism were the significantly altered pathways in gdm uv gdm and gdm vuv gdm respectively p 0 05 the shared sams were mainly enriched for alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism pathways and these pathways had relatively high impact values on gdm vuv gdm vuv perturbed the pathways more than uv which can be attributed to the powerful destructive force of the non selective ho created by vuv on the nutrients required for bacterial anabolism gharibian and hazrati 2022 the relevant metabolic pathways and metabolites are shown in fig 8 a alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and glycine serine and threonine metabolism were involved in valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis respectively valine leucine and isoleucine are the main branched chain amino acids for protein synthesis and participate in the synthesis of many secondary metabolites and the burst of reactive oxygen species xing and last 2017 arginine is involved in various pathways that regulate and maintain cellular functions such as protein and polyamine production shen et al 2006 the acute impairment of these biochemical pathways can interfere with protein biosynthesis specifically the bacterial metabolite content in the biofouling layer changed after uv and vuv irradiation l aspartic acid and 4 aminobutanoate are sams in gdm uv gdm the l aspartic acid content was significantly reduced by 93 0 and the level of 4 aminobutanoate was remarkably improved by 138 0 following uv application l aspartic acid influences arginine biosynthesis 4 aminobutanoate prevented the secretion of l glutamine by competing with l glutamate consequently disturbing arginine biosynthesis n n dimethylarginine is a metabolic byproduct of the protein modification process and is closely related to arginine hao et al 2021 the decrease in n n dimethylarginine content could indicate a limitation in arginine biosynthesis d glyceric acid content significantly declined by 84 9 after vuv treatment which caused a reduction in the content of d glyceric acid glycine threonine and 2 ketobutyric acid eventually disturbing valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis the lower levels of valine and isoleucine in the gdm vuv sample compared to the gdm further proved the effectiveness of vuv in perturbing this pathway moreover a significant reduction in l aspartic acid content was noted with vuv irradiation which also had a negative effect on arginine biosynthesis compared to uv vuv exhibited a stronger ability to restrict amino acids n n dimethylarginine valine and isoleucine the synthesis of extracellular proteins in bacteria is constrained by amino acids feng et al 2018 the application of uv and vuv can interfere with the biosynthesis pathways of some amino acid substances which can be beneficial for controlling the secretion of extracellular proteins lb pn and tb pn by bacteria as illustrated in fig 8b strong correlations were found between the critical metabolites and the genera of the core phylum proteobacteria r 0 8 p 0 05 for sams l aspartic acid was significantly positively correlated with swb02 whereas a significant negative correlation was observed with candidatus berkiella 4 aminobutanoate exhibited a positive correlation with rhodobacter and sphingopyxis and negatively correlated with limnohabitans d glyceric acid displayed a strong positive relationship with nordella and a negative association with ahniella furthermore valine and isoleucine were strongly negatively correlated with hirschia swb02 nordella and limnohabitans exhibited active amino acid biosynthesis the raw material for amino acid biosynthesis can be consumed by candidatus berkiella and rhodobacter which inhibit the synthesis process synthesized amino acids can be further degraded by hirschia disturbing protein processing in summary uv and vuv irradiation changed the relative abundances of these characteristic genera leading to differential metabolites 3 8 mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation a potential mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation was speculated based on the results of this study fig 9 the organics accumulated in the membrane tank can be derived from bacteria and their metabolites which are important carbon and energy sources for the growth and development of bacteria in the biofouling layer on the membrane surface meng et al 2017 uv irradiation mainly limited the increase in protein like substances by inhibiting bacterial activity through 254 nm photons apart from bacteria inactivation vuv can also produce ho by photolysis of water via 185 nm irradiation which was used to mineralize protein like materials the content of protein like components in the membrane tank was significantly reduced by the application of uv and vuv which altered the bacterial community especially the proteobacteria phylum a reduction in protein like substances can greatly limit the survival of some characteristic genera by inhibiting amino acid biosynthetic pathways owing to the shortage of substrates the synthesis of lb pn and tb pn by the bacteria was restricted thus reducing the cohesion of the fouling and adhesion of the biofouling layer to the membrane this phenomenon induced the formation of porous structures in the biofouling layer leading to cleaner membranes consequently rc and rp decreased promoting permeate flux 4 conclusion in this study uv and vuv were applied for in situ purification of membrane tanks to evaluate their impact on the reduction of membrane biofouling in biofiltration facilitated gdm systems 1 the application of uv and vuv reduced rc and rp resulting in 1 26 fold and 1 78 fold permeate fluxes respectively the content of doc and protein like substances that accumulated in the membrane tank declined after the application of uv and vuv 2 the use of uv and vuv reduced the adhesion of protein like substances polysaccharides and humic like substances to the membrane and improved the hydrophilicity of the membrane compared to gdm uv the membrane of gdm vuv attached less fouling and the membrane surface was cleaner 3 after the application of uv and vuv the biofouling layer became thinner exhibited less protein accumulation and became more porous the contents of lb pn and tb pn in eps were sequentially reduced by the use of uv and vuv which indirectly determined the resistance by increasing δgtot fouling fouling the biofouling layer of the gdm vuv was more heterogeneous and accumulated less protein than that of the gdm uv 4 the use of uv and vuv significantly affected the bacterial community structure on the membrane surface by reducing the protein like protein content in the membrane tank mantel s r 0 7 p 0 05 the proteobacteria phylum served as a connector for the constructed ecological molecular network the differences in the excretion of lb pn and tb pn were linked to valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis which was involved in alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and glycine serine and threonine metabolism respectively the key genera of proteobacteria phylum that participated in altering metabolism were hirschia rhodobacter nordella candidatus berkiella and limnohabitans this study demonstrated that the in situ application of uv and vuv is an effective alternative strategy for alleviating membrane biofouling in biofiltration facilitated gdm
