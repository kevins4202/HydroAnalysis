22345,in this numerical study the standard actuator line method is modified for simulating ducted tidal turbines and validated against experimental data for two turbines with different geometries the necessary modifications which are based on the unique features of ducted turbines include using a grid based distribution of blade elements employing the local chord length as the length scale for the projection factor and implementing a cylindrical projection this study also provides a guideline to facilitate choosing the projection factor the only parameter in the actuator line method which is chosen empirically the first ducted tidal turbine studied in this work is the cresswell turbine the operation of which is simulated at its design tip speed ratio in axially aligned and yawed onset flows the second turbine developed by clean current power systems is simulated over a range of tip speed ratios in axially aligned onset flow in order to study the effect of the turbulence model on the actuator line method s predictions for this turbine both the detached eddy simulation and k ω turbulence models are employed and the results are compared importantly the actuator line methodology

simulation tsr tip speed ratio uad uniform actuator disk urans unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes 1 introduction electricity generation using tidal turbines is a relatively new technology in the renewable energy field due to their harsh and complex operational environment tidal turbines must be engineered to operate with low maintenance and high efficiency therefore significant research and development is being undertaken to achieve these operational goals and high fidelity numerical tools such as cfd are being applied to the problem research at the university of new brunswick is focused on developing a simulation tool that can predict turbine performance and survivability in the realistic ocean environment with highly site specific turbulent flows there are different cfd methods applicable for numerical simulations of tidal turbines with the full rotor simulation fsr uniform actuator disk uad blade element actuator disk bead and actuator line al methods being the most important in the frs method the rotor geometry is included in the computational domain and is rotated in the approaching flow the moving overset grids and sliding mesh are the two popular techniques used with this method among studies that have employed this method for tidal turbine studies by mcnaughton et al 2014 lloyd et al 2013 fleming et al 2013 o doherty et al 2009b and o doherty et al 2009a can be mentioned while this method if employed with a proper grid resolution can be very accurate the need for a fine grid close to walls makes it forbiddingly computationally expensive for in situ simulations where site specific characteristics of the oceanic environment is included in the uad method the rotor is replaced with an actuator disk with the same diameter and thickness for the control volumes positioned in the actuator disk region a resistance is applied opposite to the flow direction this method is the counterpart of the experimental method known as the porous or static disk harrison et al 2009 shives and crawford 2011 belloni et al 2013 and blackmore et al 2013 have used this method for studying tidal turbines considering the low grid resolution that can be used with this method it is a feasible option for in situ simulations however the absence of wake rotation makes the near wake region obtained from this method inaccurate the bead method was first employed for simulating helicopter rotors see e g zori and rajagopalan 1995 and ship propellers see e g molland and turnock 1996 later this method was used for simulating wind turbines see e g ammara et al 2002 lavaroni et al 2014 and porte agel et al 2011 and more recently is used for investigating tidal turbines see e g batten et al 2013 harrison et al 2010 malki et al 2013 masters et al 2013 and baratchi et al 2017 in this method the turbine rotor is replaced with an actuator disk and the momentum source terms in the navier stokes equations are calculated from the blade element theory it is important to note that the blade element theory forces are calculated using the velocity field from the cfd solution this method is applicable for in situ simulations and is superior to the uad method because the generated wake by this method has the rotational component of velocity however a bead turbine does not reproduce the unsteady structures caused by operation of a real rotor baratchi et al 2017 this method should not be confused with the blade element momentum bem technique which is an analytical method the bem method was originally developed by glauert glauert 1935 and is basically composed of the blade element and momentum theories in this method the rotor is divided into a number of airfoil strips between 10 to 20 hansen 2008 assuming that each strip is independent of the others the imposed force and torque on a given blade section are found from blade element theory and equated with the change in the linear and angular momentum of the flow passing through the rotor disk at this section the resulting set of equations involves the angle of attack axial and tangential induction factors and lift and drag coefficients these equations as discussed by manwell et al 2010 can be solved using an iterative solution for axial and tangential induction factors finally in the al method the blade body forces are modeled with momentum source terms which are distributed around three rotating lines representing the turbine s blades this method was proposed by sørensen and shen 2002 and was implemented with the navier stokes equations in their vorticity velocity form in their study s ϕ rensen and shen used this method to solve the flow field around a 500 kw wind turbine with three lm19 1 blades they validated their results with measurements and reported good agreement for power generation using this method they were able to capture blades tip vortices most of the studies which have utilized the al method have been on wind turbines among these studies troldborg et al 2007 used the al method and investigated the wake of a wind turbine they applied time varying body forces in a plane upstream of the rotor to produce a turbulent inflow with the same spectral characteristics of the real atmospheric flow and compared the results with the uniform inlet velocity sarlak et al 2014 used the al method and compared les results obtained from ellipsys3d the code developed at dtu riso with openfoam for a single and an array of three tandem wind turbines jha et al 2014 studied the effect of the source term distribution in the al method and proposed a new method for determining the radius of source terms projection which varies in the spanwise direction and produces an elliptic distribution in this study they simulated the nrel phase v i and nrel 5 mw wind turbines and compared their results with the available data and also with the results from xturb psu a solver which uses the blade element momentum bem method churchfield et al 2012b used the al method and carried out a large eddy simulation for the lillgrund 48 multi megawatt wind farm employing openfoam this wind farm is composed of 48 turbines and this work is among a few works which have used the al method for analyzing a farm and has taken one million cpu hours troldborg et al 2011 used the al method and les turbulence model and studied the interaction between two tandem wind turbines spaced different distances from each other and in different degrees of ambient turbulence intensity the study by baratchi et al 2017 is one of the few studies which have used the al method for a tidal turbine in their study they used the al method and investigated the wake and operational parameters of the bahaj non ducted tidal turbine bahaj et al 2007 in straight and yawed flows and compared the results with the outcomes from the bead method from these studies one can see that the al method is capable of replicating the unsteady features such as tip and root vortices caused by a turbine operation and is computationally feasible for in situ simulations of tidal turbines also this method has not been used before for ducted turbines which are very popular in the tidal sector however in the standard al method turbine structural components are excluded from the simulation and only the rotor s rotation is simulated while this simplification might be seen as an acceptable approximation when simulating a non ducted turbine it cannot be used for ducted turbines therefore a modified version of the al method capable of simulating ducted turbines is needed this is the focus of this paper and is accomplished by simulating two ducted turbines and modifying the al method based on the unique features of ducted turbines the first turbine in this study is the cresswell ducted turbine cresswell et al 2015 which has been simulated at its design tsr in the straight and yawed flows the second turbine is the clean current turbine clean current 2013 the operation of which is simulated at different tsrs in the straight flow for this turbine alongside des simulations urans simulations are carried out as well to study the effects of turbulence model on the outcomes of the al method parallel research by wilcox et al 2017 developed a cfd based methodology for predicting site specific turbulence at several tidal sites in the bay of fundy the long term objective is to combine the al method with these in situ simulations so that in situ performance and survivability of a turbine can be predicted prior to its deployment 2 computational model 2 1 governing equations conservation of mass and momentum are the two main equations which are solved for this problem in a turbulent flow as 1 v i x i 0 and 2 v i t v i v j x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν ν t v i x j v j x i s i the in the above equations represents spatially filtered or time averaged values depending on the turbulence model the des turbulence model which is a hybrid combination of urans and les is employed for most of the simulations performed in this work the urans turbulence model is only used for the clean current turbine to investigate the influence of the turbulence model on predictions of the al method the urans turbulence model used in this study is the standard wilcox k ω model wilcox 1993 and the des turbulence model employs the standard wilcox k ω model in the urans region and as the subgrid scale model in the les region noting that menter s k ω s s t model uses the k ω model close to walls and k ϵ far from them which in the des is modeled employing les the combination used in this work for the des turbulence model is almost the same as strelets s des strelets 2001 s i in eq 2 is the i component of source term which represents the rotor s operation in the al method and is calculated from the blade element theory in the blade element theory the blade is divided into a number of small airfoils blade elements for each of which the thrust and torque are calculated using the acting lift and drag forces in fig 1 a rotor with a counter clockwise rotation is shown for the blade element located between r d r 2 and r d r 2 the induced tangential velocity is v θ fig 2 shows the side view of the same blade element with the velocity and force vectors being illustrated in fig 2 a w is the relative velocity defined as 3 w v z 2 ω r v θ 2 where v z and v θ are respectively axial and tangential components of velocity and are calculated from u v and w components of velocity obtained from the cfd simulation also from fig 2 a ϕ is the angle between the plane of rotation and the relative velocity and can be found from 4 ϕ arctan v z ω r v θ where ω is the rotational velocity of the rotor to calculate the angle of attack the obtained ϕ angle is used in 5 α ϕ β where the blade element s twist angle β is obtained through linear interpolation from a look up table which provides this parameter and the local chord size c at specific spanwise locations the imposed forces on the blade element in the axial z and tangential θ directions according to fig 2 b in terms of lift and drag forces are 6 d f z d l cos ϕ d d sin ϕ and 7 d f θ d l sin ϕ d d cos ϕ noting that lift and drag coefficients are defined as 8 c l d l 1 2 ρ w 2 c d r and 9 c d d d 1 2 ρ w 2 c d r the imposed forces in the z and θ directions are 10 d f z 1 2 ρ w 2 c d r c l cos ϕ c d sin ϕ and 11 d f θ 1 2 ρ w 2 c d r c l sin ϕ c d cos ϕ the lift and drag coefficients used in eqs 10 and 11 are introduced using a second look up table which provides c l and c d at specified spanwise locations the forces calculated using eqs 10 and 11 with opposite sign will be imposed on the flow by each blade element however in order to avoid oscillations in the solution and divergence due to a finite source term this force is projected smoothly on the control volumes which are located in the vicinity of each blade element this is done by employing a three dimensional gaussian projection function sørensen and shen 2002 12 f c t b 1 b e 1 n d f e b t 1 ϵ 3 π 3 2 e x p r e b r c ϵ 2 where d f e b is the generated force by element e of actuator line b r e b is the position vector of blade element e b r c is the position vector of control volume c which f c is calculated for and ϵ is a constant which controls the width of the projection fig 3 shows a schematic of the projection process from this figure for a blade element the contours of the projected force form spherical surfaces which decrease in strength moving outwards in the radial direction it should be noted that the total projected force for each blade element must be equal to the imposed force by the blade element next the source term for each control volume is calculated by summing the projected force by all the blade elements on the control volume and dividing it by the control volume volume 2 2 cfd solver and procedure the code developed for this study is part of exn aero gerber et al 2013 a gpu based cfd solver being developed at the university of new brunswick with a specific emphasis on tidal energy applications this solver uses a collocated finite volume discretization method rhie and chow 1983 and an implicit in time simplec approach for pressure velocity coupling careto et al 1972 a second order transient is combined with an upwind biased tvd van leer scheme for the advection term darwish and moukalled 2003 an algebraic multigrid hutchinson and raithby 1986 approach is employed to accelerate the solution the simulations in this work have been performed in the unsteady mode and the time step for each simulation has been chosen so that the tip of the blade does not move more than one control volume per time step the number of outer loop iterations for these simulations is 5 with this number of iterations there will be less than 1 change in c p and c t between the two last iterations simulations are continued until the standard deviation of the running average of c p and c t over 10 revolutions is less than 0 001 and the time average of the flow field is calculated after the exit of the initial transient solution from the domain the steps of the al method are shown in fig 4 according to this figure in the al method after determining the new location of the rotor each blade is divided into a number of blade elements and flow velocity is interpolated at each blade element center axial and tangential components of the velocity at the blade element centers are calculated from u v and w fluid velocity components and then the angle of attack is calculated for each blade element using eq 5 using the spanwise location of each blade element and its angle of attack the lift and drag coefficients are determined using a look up table through linear interpolation utilizing eqs 10 and 11 generated axial and tangential forces by each blade element are calculated all of these steps are more suitable to be done by cpus and are assigned to them next using eq 12 the calculated force for each blade element is projected on the flow field around it this step due to its large size of computations is performed on gpus in order to undertake the projection for each control volume an execution thread calculates the total projected force imposed on the control volume by all the blade elements across all of the blades by performing the summations in eq 12 the projected forces produced by a blade element over all the control volumes when summed will not be equal to the blade element s force therefore the ratio of a blade element s force over its total projected force is used to scale the projected forces to make sure they balance in order to find the total projected force a summation process is required that involves other threads the summation employs the atomicadd function available in cuda programming languages to avoid race conditions where multiple threads write to the same memory address at the same time in the final step the imposed force on each control volume is calculated by adding the modified projected force from all the blade elements and then by dividing the axial and tangential components of the resulting force by the control volume s volume s z and s θ will be obtained 3 simulation setup and results for cresswell ducted tidal turbine the ducted turbine studied by cresswell et al 2015 has three blades that have been developed from a naca 63818 profile this turbine is a scaled down model of a tidal turbine and its rotor radius is equal to 0 174 m the duct outlet diameter and duct length of this turbine are respectively 0 5 m and 0 405 m and at tsr 4 its nominal power and rotational speed are 0 3 kw and 4850 rpm respectively the study by cresswell et al 2015 on this turbine is one of the few experimental studies carried out on ducted tidal turbines that are available in open literature the high cost of conducting tests in towing tanks or cavitation tunnel facilities is the main reason for the lack of experimental studies in this area even cresswell et al 2015 tested a scaled down version of their turbine in a wind tunnel and in order to keep the reynolds number in an acceptable range used a high inlet velocity and consequently high rotational velocities therefore considering the mach number at the rotor blade tip for most tsrs examined in their study compressibility effects cannot be neglected which is not the case for tidal turbines thus in this work in order to avoid errors caused by compressibility effects the simulations for the cresswell turbine were carried out only at tsr 4 which is the smallest tsr value tested by cresswell et al 2015 and the resulting flow field can be approximated as incompressible 3 1 cfd domain and boundary conditions for cresswell turbine the domain used for the al simulations of this turbine is shown in fig 5 according to this figure the inlet and outlet boundaries have been located respectively 5 d o upstream and 10 d o downstream from the rotor the height and width of the domain are 8 d o where d o is the duct outlet diameter the projection region is also shown in fig 5 the projection region is a block of control volumes surrounding the rotor swept volume where the distribution of source terms is performed it should be noted that based on eq 12 the projected force source term generated by each blade element decreases exponentially with distance from the blade element center and is practically zero beyond a certain distance therefore the accumulated source term caused by all of the blade elements is zero beyond a certain distance before and aft of the rotor and performing the projection process outside of these boundaries is not necessary and computationally efficient in this work in order to determine the front and back sides of the projection region studies with extended projection regions have been conducted and the boundaries have been decided based on the obtained source terms distribution regarding the boundary conditions employed for this problem the no slip wall condition is used for the hub and duct surfaces for the inlet boundary based on the reynolds number r e d 5 1 1 0 5 a prescribed velocity condition is employed for the outlet a fully developed flow with zero static pressure and for the sides a symmetry boundary condition are assumed noting that this turbine has been tested in a laboratory with controlled conditions the turbulence intensity at the inlet has been set to 0 5 with a low value of turbulence at the inlet the origin of turbulence and unsteadiness in the wake will be limited to the turbine s operation and its structural components the grid developed for this turbine is a multi block structured mesh which is h type in front and behind the hub highlighted in fig 6 and is o type in the rest of the domain choosing a structured mesh for this problem over an unstructured grid which can be produced with less effort has been done due to the advantages of structured grids in a better control on the quality of control volumes less numerical diffusion and faster solution in this grid in order to ensure the accurate implementation of the log law for the walls as can be seen in fig 6 a fine mesh has been applied close to the hub and duct surfaces which becomes coarser moving away from them with that being said on the rotor plane the height of the control volumes on the hub surface is 0 001 m which increases in the normal direction and after reaching a maximum of 0 0035 m decreases and becomes 0 002 m at the blades tips it should be noted that there are 7 control volumes in the gap between the blades tips and the duct s inner surface and the height of the control volume on the duct s inner surface is 0 0008 m with such grid distribution the number of the total control volumes for this grid is 7 3 1 0 6 besides this baseline grid which is labeled case 1 in table 1 an extended grid with the same resolution case 2 and a finer grid with the same domain size case 3 have been simulated obtained mean power and thrust coefficients for the three grids are listed in table 1 which were calculated according to 13 c p r h r ω d t 1 2 ρ a v 3 s θ v c ω d c 1 2 ρ a v 3 and 14 c t f z 1 2 ρ a v 2 s z v c 1 2 ρ a v 2 where v c and d c are respectively control volumes volume and their distance from the rotation axis v is the magnitude of speed at the domain s inlet and the summations are performed on all the control volumes located in the projection region from this table one can see that the changes in mean power and thrust coefficients with change in the domain size or grid resolution are negligible therefore the grid used with case 1 is considered suitable for this problem 3 2 modifications to al method for simulating cresswell turbine in the standard implementation of the al method usually a cartesian grid with an equidistant region which encloses the rotor is typically employed with such a mesh as is illustrated in fig 7 dividing each actuator line into blade elements with equal size results in a balanced distribution of blade elements with regard to the control volumes however when including turbine structural components such as hub and duct the grid spacing in the radial direction needs to change to refine the grid in the boundary layer region close to the hub and duct walls therefore dividing the blades into a number of equally sized blade elements will result in multiple blade elements for control volumes in coarser regions of the grid while in finer regions there will be only one blade element across multiple control volumes this is illustrated in fig 8 for actuator line 1 which is equally divided into 10 blade elements as one can see for this case the number of blade elements per control volume decreases when moving towards the hub this can produce inaccuracy in the al method results because the imposed force on each blade element is calculated based on the flow information at the blade element center and then is projected on the surrounding control volumes in other words in the fine region of the grid the imposed force on many control volumes will be based on the flow information of one blade element which due to the gradients of flow variables is experiencing a different flow condition thus the uniform sampling of the information with the uniform blade elements scheme does not put enough blade elements in fine regions and consequently the calculated forces will not be a correct representation of the real velocity field in those control volumes to address this issue in this paper the actuator lines are divided based on the grid topology and the size of blade elements changes according to the grid s radial spacing the result is actuator line 2 in fig 8 which similar to actuator line 1 has 10 blade elements but has been divided based on the grid size by employing this approach and using the number of the control volumes in the radial direction for the blade elements number there will be one blade element for each control volume which will allow an efficient sampling of flow information based on the local flow field also in the standard al method as was done by troldborg et al 2011 churchfield et al 2012a martinez et al 2012 and baratchi et al 2017 a factor of grid size in the equidistant region of the mesh is used as the length scale for the projection parameter in this work in order to improve the performance of the method the local size of the blade chord is used as the projection length scale using a physical length scale based on the local blade geometry can enhance the accuracy of the al method 3 3 al method s parametric study for cresswell turbine in the al method the projection factor ϵ in eq 12 is an empirical parameter that determines the width over which the imposed force by a blade element is distributed it has been shown previously by martínez tossas et al 2015 and baratchi et al 2017 that the value used for this parameter has a considerable effect on the prediction of the al method for power and thrust coefficients therefore a correct choice for ϵ is crucial in the accuracy of the al method a large projection factor distributes the source terms over a larger area causes over prediction of power and thrust coefficients to the extent that predicted c p can be beyond the betz limit churchfield et al 2017 on the other hand too small a projection factor by generating a sudden change in source terms results in numerical oscillations and even divergence in the solution therefore a suitable projection factor is a small value with a stable solution thus in order to determine the suitable projection factor power and thrust coefficients were calculated for a range of ϵ and their oscillations were used as a metric for numerical oscillations in the solution field fig 9 shows the variation in mean c p and c t with ϵ c for the cresswell turbine at tsr 4 over a range of ϵ between 0 6 c and 1 2 c in their work cresswell et al did not measure the thrust coefficient however their reported power coefficient is shown in fig 9 from this figure one can see that for this turbine by increasing ϵ c from 0 6 to 0 8 the change in mean c p and c t are very small respectively 2 3 and 2 0 this is different from the trend observed previously by baratchi et al 2017 in the standard al where the same ratio of increase in ϵ δ g r i d from 1 5 to 2 caused mean c p and c t to increase respectively by 16 and 8 figs 10 and 11 show the time history of c p and c t versus non dimensional time t t ω 2 π after the initial transient portion of the solution is removed as can be seen from these figures there are small high frequency wiggles for both c p and c t for all values of ϵ c the magnitude of which decreases slightly with an increase in the projection factor this is consistent with the observation made by baratchi et al 2017 when using the standard al method it is worth mentioning that ϵ c 0 4 was the smallest value tested for this turbine and did not result in a converged solution from the above discussion one can see that for ϵ c 0 6 the al method provides solutions with an acceptable level of oscillations and predicts a mean power coefficient that is close to the result reported by the experiment therefore this is the value that were used for all subsequent simulations 3 4 simulation results for cresswell ducted tidal turbine in this section simulation results for the cresswell turbine in straight and yawed flows ζ 1 5 obtained from the al method when combined with the des turbulence model are presented fig 12 shows the distribution of the source terms for this turbine in the straight flow from this figure the distribution of source terms resembles a rotor geometry and in addition the width of the region over which the source terms are distributed changes proportionally to the blade s chord fig 13 shows the instantaneous normalized velocity magnitude u 2 v 2 w 2 v i n l e t and pressure coefficient contours for the cresswell turbine in the straight flow by examining the velocity field high velocity regions can be detected next to the duct s inner surface which occur when the flow passes the gap between the blade tip and the duct as the fluid passes through the gap large axial and tangential components and swirls are induced next to the duct inner surface forming tip vortices the tip vortices predicted by the al method for this turbine will be explored in more detail subsequently in this paper in this figure a separation region with a low velocity is also seen on the duct s outer surface this separation is due to the high angle of the incident flow induced by the partial blockage of the flow by the blades and takes place from the very beginning of the duct and is better illustrated in fig 14 by flow reversal this figure shows the instantaneous normalized velocity magnitude contours alongside velocity vectors from the pressure field a pressure drop can be seen in the flow when passing through the rotor this figure also shows notable unsteadiness after the turbine caused by the turbine s operation and vortex shedding from its components in fig 15 the instantaneous iso surface of normalized vorticity ω ω 0 8 are shown where ω and ω are the magnitude of the total vorticity and the rotational velocity of the rotor respectively from this figure one can see how the vorticity field of the al method resembles that for a real turbine operation and the effect of the blade geometry and tip and root vortices have been produced by employing this method the formation of the tip vortices for this turbine is due to the relatively considerable size of the gap between the blades tips and the duct the layer of separated flow on the outer surface of the duct mentioned previously can be seen better here which forms a swirling vortical structure on the duct s outer surface this structure is generated due to the blades source terms which locally block the flow from entering the duct and push it outward to flow faster over the outer surface of the duct it is worth mentioning that neither the tip and root vortices nor the swirling structure on the duct s outer surface are generated when the bead method is used for simulating a ducted turbine baratchi 2018 the time history of power and thrust coefficients at tsr 4 are presented in fig 16 where the initial transition solution has been removed for this turbine since the turbine structural components have been included in the simulations the imposed forces on the hub and duct are an important part of the turbine thrust force these forces due to the unsteadiness of the wake and the flow passing over these components vary with time this variation causes the turbine s thrust force to be oscillating which can be seen in this figure when a non ducted turbine is exposed to a yawed flow as was discussed by burton et al 2000 and later was confirmed by bahaj et al 2007 and baratchi et al 2017 its c p and c t decrease respectively with a factor of cosine and square cosine of the yaw angle for ducted turbines on the other hand the duct can help align the flow with the rotor s axis a factor which can contribute to an improvement in the turbine s performance thus in order to investigate the effect of the yaw angle on the performance of a ducted turbine the operation of the cresswell turbine in a 1 5 yawed flow is simulated fig 17 shows the instantaneous normalized velocity magnitude and pressure coefficient contours in the yawed flow for tsr 4 by examining this figure carefully the high velocity regions next to the duct s inner surface caused by tip vortices and observed previously in the straight flow are seen here too comparing this figure against fig 13 for the straight flow one can see a larger separation zone on the leeward side of the duct with a frequent departure of vortical structures from the pressure field a pressure difference between the side of the duct which is exposed to the flow and the opposite side is seen this pressure difference along with the imposed frictional force on the duct causes a considerable transverse force in the x direction f x this force added to the axial force f z creates a total force of 44 3 n which when compared with 18 6 n imposed on the duct in the straight flow is much higher front and top views of the instantaneous normalized vorticity iso surface ω ω 0 8 for the yawed flow are shown in fig 18 this figure provides a better visualization of the variation in thickness of the separation region around the duct tip and root vortices and the swirling pattern on the outer surface of the duct generated by the rotating blades can be seen here too since in the case of the yawed flow these swirling structures are washed to one side of the domain the tip vortices which exit the duct s outlet can be seen more easily in terms of the turbine s performance parameters mean c p and c t predicted by the al method for the straight flow are respectively 0 492 and 1 311 the power coefficient for the same tsr reported by the experiment is 0 478 from these values the difference between the mean c p obtained from the al method with the experiment is 2 9 for the yawed flow on the other hand mean c p and c t predicted by the al method are respectively 0 524 and 1 307 noting that the c p value reported by cresswell et al 2015 is 0 486 there is 7 8 difference between c p values from the two methods the higher difference in the case of yawed flow can be due to measurement errors in the experiment or inaccuracy of the al method due to the flow complexities before the rotor caused by the angle between the flow and duct s inlet more simulations and experiments are needed in order to determine the performance of the al method when simulating ducted turbines in yawed flows the mean power and thrust coefficients and mass flow rates predicted by the al method and the power coefficient measured by the experiment have been summarized in table 2 one can see that the al method consistent with the experiment predicts that mean c p increased by 6 5 for the yawed flow in comparison to the straight flow in addition the mass flow rates increased by 1 6 and the mean c t decreased by 0 3 for the yawed flow 4 simulation setup and results for clean current ducted tidal turbine in the previous section the effect of the flow direction on the performance of a ducted turbine at its design tsr was investigated in this section in order to study the effect of the change in tsr on the performance of a ducted turbine the ducted tidal turbine designed by the clean current power systems and tested in a towing tank by the national research council canada clean current 2013 is simulated in the straight flow at different tsrs fig 19 shows the clean current tidal turbine this turbine has three custom designed blades which their lift and drag coefficients at different radii have been provided by the manufacturer clean current 2013 for this turbine the rotor diameter is equal to 1 48 m and the diffuser has a circular inlet with 1 5 m diameter and an almost elliptical outlet with its major and minor axes equal to 2 and 1 5 m respectively at tsr 5 the nominal power and rotational speed of this turbine are respectively 7 5 kw and 160 rpm the tests on this turbine have been conducted in a towing tank which is 200 meters long 12 meters wide and 7 meters deep at 4 different carriage speeds of 2 2 5 3 and 3 5 m s 4 1 cfd domain and boundary conditions for clean current turbine fig 20 shows the solution domain used for the clean current turbine for this turbine at the inlet a specified velocity with r e d 3 7 1 0 6 is used and similar to the cresswell turbine the turbulence intensity is set to t i 0 5 for the side boundaries the symmetry boundary condition is used and for the outlet a fully developed flow with a static pressure equal to zero has been assumed the no slip wall boundary condition is used for the hub and duct surfaces fig 20 also shows the region where the imposed force by the blade elements are projected on their surrounding control volumes since in this case the turbine and its duct are relatively short and the rotor is located almost at the middle of the duct length the whole volume inside the duct has been assigned as the projection region the baseline grid developed for the clean current turbine similar to the one used for the cresswell turbine has a multi block structured topology top and side views of cuts through the turbine s x z and y z mid planes are shown in fig 21 in this figure changes in the grid spacing which is fine close to walls and becomes coarser away from them is shown for this grid on the hub surface at the rotor plane the height of the cells is 0 0008 m this height increases in the normal direction and after reaching a maximum of 0 008 m decreases to 0 001 m at the blade tip with such a distribution the total number of the control volumes along a blade is 86 which according to the grid based distribution of blade elements in the al method is also the number of blade elements it is worth mentioning that 11 control volumes have been applied in the gap between the rotor and duct and the height of the cells on the duct s inner surface is 0 0005 m to ensure that the simulation results will be independent of the domain size and grid resolution a verification process was conducted therefore in addition to the baseline grid case 1 simulations have been carried out using an extended grid case 2 and a grid with higher resolution case 3 at tsr 4 predicted mean power and thrust coefficients for the three cases are compared in table 3 it is worth mentioning that for calculating power and thrust coefficients for this turbine the convention for ducted turbines which uses the duct s outlet area a o u t l e t is applied also power and thrust coefficients are presented in terms of c p and c t which are normalized by the experimentally measured power and thrust coefficients at the design tsr tsr 5 from table 3 one can see that changes in predicted mean normalized power and thrust coefficients for these cases are negligible and therefore the baseline grid is suitable for this study 4 2 modifications to al method for simulating clean current turbine for the al simulations of this turbine similar to the cresswell turbine imposed forces by each blade element calculated from eqs 10 and 11 need to be projected to the control volumes surrounding it following the steps taken for the cresswell turbine by employing the grid based distribution of blade elements the chord based projection factor scheme and the 3d projection method with ϵ c 0 8 the source term distribution for tsr 4 will be according to fig 22 as can be seen in this figure there are regions with high concentration of source terms next to the hub and rotor edge at the instantaneous location of the actuator lines these high concentrations produce a non physical velocity field and consequently inaccurate power and thrust coefficients predictions this is shown in fig 23 where the velocity pattern in the rotor plane produced by this projection is illustrated from this figure one can see that the al method as implemented for the cresswell turbine predicts an erroneous velocity field with non physical values around the hub and behind the blade tips these high concentration regions near the blade tips are due to the nature of the 3d projection which tries to project the imposed force by each blade element in 3 dimensions this causes high values for source terms close to the hub and rotor edge where the projection is blocked by the turbine s components in order to address this issue a cylindrical projection method is proposed for this turbine in the cylindrical projection using eq 12 the force imposed by blade element e b with certain distance from the rotor s axis is projected only on the control volumes which are located at the same radial distance from the rotor s axis fig 24 illustrates this projection method for a single actuator line at one radial location as can be seen in this figure the cylindrical projection method projects the imposed force by a single blade element on a cylindrical surface where the strength of the projected force generated source term decreases according to eq 12 with distance from the blade element s center the distribution of source terms for this turbine using the cylindrical projection at tsr 4 employing ϵ c 0 8 is shown in fig 25 as can be seen no areas with high concentration of source terms appear in this case also velocity magnitude contours at the rotor plane shown in fig 26 present a physically correct pattern it is worth mentioning that in figs 25 and 26 the blades rotate in a counterclockwise direction 4 3 al method s parametric study for clean current turbine similar to the cresswell turbine a suitable value for the projection factor needs to be determined for the clean current turbine this is done by employing a range of ϵ values and investigating power and thrust coefficients in order to find a small projection factor with a stable solution figs 27 and 28 respectively show mean normalized power and thrust coefficients predictions as a function of ϵ c for tsr 5 corresponding values found using the bead method baratchi 2018 and reported values from the experiment are also shown as can be seen from these figures similar to fig 9 between ϵ c 0 6 0 8 the variations in mean c p and c t are minimal and respectively 1 6 and 0 9 that is even smaller than values previously reported for the cresswell turbine with further increase in the projection factor both mean c p and c t values increase slightly and for high ϵ values the two graphs illustrate the asymptotic behavior observed previously by baratchi et al 2017 when using the standard al method for a non ducted turbine figs 29 and 30 show the time history of c p and c t respectively at tsr 5 for the ϵ c values investigated these figures show high frequency numerical wiggles in c p and c t which can be considered as a metric of numerical oscillations in the solution as expected oscillations in the solution decrease with an increase in ϵ c from these figures one can see that similar to the cresswell turbine in the range of ϵ 0 6 c to ϵ 0 8 c the oscillations in the power and thrust coefficients are reasonable therefore considering the fact that when using ϵ 0 8 c oscillations in the solution have notably smaller amplitude and fewer iterations are required at each time step for a converged solution this value is used for the projection factor for the remaining simulations 4 4 simulation results for clean current ducted tidal turbine in this section the simulation results for the clean current turbine using the al method coupled first with the des turbulence model and next with the urans model are presented fig 31 illustrates side and top views of instantaneous normalized velocity magnitude contours predicted by the des at different tsr values from this figure one can see that with each increase in tsr the wake generated behind the hub becomes narrower this is due to the higher mass flow rate and axial velocity for cases with higher tsr the separation of the flow on the inner side of the duct close to its outlet for tsr 6 visible in the top view is also due to the high axial velocity additionally comparing this figure with fig 13 one can see there are no alternating high velocity regions next to the duct s inner surface indicating the tip vortices are not generated in this turbine this is because of the very small clearance between the blades tips and duct s surface which prevents the generation of discernible tip vortices in fig 32 the variations in time averaged normalized axial velocity on y 0 as defined in fig 20 in the cross stream direction are shown at four different locations downstream of the rotor the rotor operation which absorbs the kinematic energy of the flow and the wakes caused by the hub and duct are the three main factors that contribute to the momentum deficit seen behind the turbine the recovery process in the wake on the other hand is mainly due to turbulent mixing and the shear between the wake and free stream from this figure due to the high level of turbulence and mixing behind the hub most of the momentum deficit behind the hub is recovered for all cases by z d 4 however at z d 4 the duct s footprint can still be distinguished in the wake velocity profile which due to the shear effects between the free stream and the low velocity flow behind the turbine is increasingly flattened by moving downstream normalized iso surface of instantaneous vorticity for ω ω 0 3 are shown in fig 33 for different tsr values similar to the cresswell turbine a physical representation of the blades is produced in the vorticity field also the rotation of the rotor induces a swirling pattern on the duct s outer surface which is accompanied by flow separation at low tsrs in this study in order to investigate the effect of the turbulence model on the al method s predictions the al method has also been coupled with the k ω model side and top views of the instantaneous normalized velocity magnitude contours at different tsr values obtained using the k ω turbulence model are shown in fig 34 comparing this figure with fig 31 one can see that a lot of details and complexities of the wake captured using detached eddy simulation are not present here this is due to the time averaged nature of urans models which model turbulence effects and solve for the mean flow however the general outline of the velocity field still shows a wake that is relatively wide in the top view and exhibits an oscillating pattern in the side view also the width of the hub wake still decreases with increasing tsr for high tsrs the time history of normalized power and thrust coefficients for both des and urans simulation at tsr 4 and 5 are shown in fig 35 it should be mentioned that in this figure similar to fig 16 for the cresswell turbine the initial transient part of the solution has been removed from this figure one can see that c p and c t are affected by the employed turbulence model and values obtained using the k ω turbulence model illustrate more sinusoidal behavior when compared with des results this is caused by the more organized alternating wake predicted by the urans simulations discernible in the side view of fig 34 as tsr increases the amplitudes of variations in c p and c t decrease for the urans simulations which is in accordance with the reduction in the wake width previously noted from a comparison between the des results in this figure and fig 16 one will notice larger oscillations amplitude in c p and c t for the clean current turbine this is caused by different vortex shedding patterns from the duct and hub of each turbine evident in figs 31 and 14 which affect the flow field upstream near the actuator lines differently mean normalized power and thrust coefficients predicted by both the des and urans turbulence models are shown in figs 36 and 37 and compared to the reported experimental values in the experiment tests on this turbine were performed at different inlet velocities i e different reynolds numbers and since over the range of the tested re numbers power and thrust coefficients were not significantly affected by re in these figures in addition to v i n l e t 2 5 m s solid circles which has been used for the cfd simulations values reported at v i n l e t 2 m s 3 m s and 3 5 m s are also shown as hollow circles this has been done to better illustrate the trend of mean c p and c t versus tsr by comparing predictions for the two sets of al simulation results a consistent offset between the des and urans simulations is detected where for a given tsr the urans simulation predicts both a higher mean c p and c t from this figure one can also see that the difference between results obtained from the two turbulence models increases with increasing tsr for example at tsr 3 the differences between the values predicted for mean c p and c t by urans and des are respectively 4 9 and 2 6 but the corresponding differences at tsr 6 are 14 4 and 12 4 as was explained previously this difference is caused by the different prediction of the velocity field around the rotor for the two models which results in different distributions of source terms for the des and urans models this difference for tsr 6 can be seen in fig 38 where the distributions of instantaneous total source term obtained from the des and urans turbulence models are compared from this figure one can see that the k ω model predicts higher source term loading values which are especially discernible close to the tips of the blades based on investigations performed in this study the main reason for the differences seen in the source term strengths in fig 38 and mean c p and c t predictions from the des and urans in figs 36 and 37 is differences in predicted local angle of attack across the rotor from the two turbulence models different angles of attack predicted by the two turbulence models lead to different values of c l and c d obtained from the look up table which results in different estimations of d f θ and d f z from eqs 10 and 11 the ultimate result will be the difference in source term strength shown in fig 38 and discrepancy in mean c p and c t values discussed earlier fig 39 shows the percentage change in c l cos ϕ c d sin ϕ and c l sin ϕ c d cos ϕ for one degree change in α at different angles of attack for this turbine s blades at radius r r 0 71 the blade s twist angle at this radius is 15 9 7 c l cos ϕ c d sin ϕ and c l sin ϕ c d cos ϕ are used respectively in eqs 10 and 11 for calculating the axial d f z and the tangential component d f θ of the imposed force by each blade element from this figure one can see that for small angles of attack both terms change significantly with a relatively small change in the angle of attack this is mainly due to the higher relative change of the lift coefficient with angle of attack at small angles which according to theory is equal to 2 π α α in rad this explains the notable differences in source term strengths in fig 38 and in mean c p and c t for tsr 6 which has an instantaneous mean angle of attack averaged for the three lifting lines at r r 0 71 of 0 1 8 for the des and 0 2 7 for urans on the other hand for cases with low tsr corresponding to higher angles of attack the change in predicted angle of attack has a smaller effect on the source term strength and predicted mean normalized power and thrust coefficients this is the case for tsr 3 where the instantaneous mean angle of attack at r r 0 71 has changed from 8 7 0 for the des to 8 8 5 for the urans in addition with the relatively lower sensitivity of c l cos ϕ c d sin ϕ compared to c l sin ϕ c d cos ϕ as can be seen in fig 39 less difference between corresponding mean c t values predicted by the two turbulence models is expected this is confirmed by comparing the differences between the two sets of mean c p and c t predictions in figs 36 and 37 similarly when compared with the experiment a higher error is seen for both mean c p and c t in cases with high tsr i e smaller operational angle of attack because d f θ and d f z are more sensitive to errors in predicted angle of attack finally one can see that despite the special design of the blades in this turbine which operates at relatively low angles of attack the al method still displays a reasonable performance at tsr 5 the difference between the corresponding values of mean normalized power and thrust coefficients found from this method and the experiment are respectively 3 2 and 0 8 for des and 5 5 and 4 3 for urans 5 guidelines for implementing al method for simulating ducted and non ducted tidal turbines based on simulations performed in this research for simulating a ducted turbine and similarly a non ducted turbine when including its structural components in the simulation the following modifications to the al method are recommended 5 1 grid based distribution of blade elements in the standard al method the equidistant grid region around the rotor allows a uniform distribution of blade elements and a balanced sampling of information however when including the turbine s structural components a uniformed blade element distribution does not put enough blade elements close to the walls where due to high gradients of flow variables there is a high concentration of control volumes therefore in this work the grid based distribution of blade elements that divides the actuator line based on the grid resolution is proposed 5 2 projection factor length scale the projection factor which determines the projection width is the only empirical parameter in the al method in the standard al method the projection factor usually is a factor of grid size in the equidistant region troldborg 2008 recommended ϵ 2 δ g r i d which was used later by some other researchers churchfield et al 2012b 2011 and churchfield et al 2012a based on the study performed by baratchi et al 2017 on the projection factor the same value was determined as suitable for simulating the bahaj non ducted turbine however they reported a high dependency of the predicted power and thrust coefficients on the projection factor which can vary with a change in the grid size therefore in the current research the projection factor was based on the blade s chord length which is a more physical length scale and does not vary with the grid resolution by using such a length scale much lower sensitivity in predicted power and thrust coefficients to the projection factor is observed 5 3 projection method when using the standard al method projecting the imposed force by each blade element on the surrounding flow is done uses a 3d gaussian function applying this approach the imposed force by each blade element is projected uniformly in all three directions in space this was the approach used in this work for the cresswell turbine however using the same method for the clean current turbine resulted in regions with a high concentration of source terms close to the hub and rotor s edge this was attributed to the blade s design which produces significant axial and tangential forces close to the hub and duct to address this issue the cylindrical projection method was introduced where the imposed force by each blade element is projected only on the control volumes located at the same radial distance from the rotor axis with this change regions with high source terms concentrations and the resulting non physical velocity field are removed based on further investigations performed in this study while the 3d projection method still can be used for some turbines like the cresswell turbine with narrow blades close to the hub and duct the cylindrical method is applicable for all blades 5 4 projection factor and grid based on the studies conducted for projection factor on the cresswell and clean current turbines it is observed that when using the local chord length as the projection length scale the suitable projection factor is located in a range of ϵ 0 6 c 0 8 c in this range there is a small change in mean power and thrust coefficients predicted by the al method and oscillations in the solution are at a reasonable level therefore with an adequately fine grid in the tangential direction this range is proposed as a guideline for determining the suitable projection factor for coarse grids higher projection factors might be needed to produce a smooth distribution of source terms over enough control volumes and to prevent oscillations in the solution it should be noted that when using the local chord length for the projection length scale oscillations and instability in the solution usually happen close to the blade tip where the chord length is the smallest a small chord length close the tip results in a small projection factor which produces a non smooth distribution of source terms over a few control volumes and ultimately oscillations in the solution this issue becomes more pronounced in o type grids where control volumes tangential length inevitably increases in the radial direction and therefore there are less control volumes for the projection close to the blade tip this is less restrictive in ducted turbines with blades which most often have small span to chord ratios and do not become too narrow at the tip for non ducted turbines on the other hand the blades usually have high span to chord ratios and become increasingly narrow towards the tip and a special attention is needed for grid size and projection factor to produce a smooth distribution of source terms based on the projection factor studies performed for this research which includes additional simulations of the bahaj non ducted tidal turbine including its hub geometry for a stable solution in the recommended range of ϵ a grid with at least two control volumes across the chord at the blade tip is necessary this grid requirement is illustrated in fig 40 as was mentioned previously for coarser grids a higher projection factor might be needed a different approach to cases with coarser grid is to use the average chord length instead of the local chord length as the projection length scale for such cases the suitable projection factor is in the range 0 6 c a v ϵ 0 8 c a v these two approaches have been confirmed by the authors by simulating the bahaj non ducted tidal turbine bahaj et al 2007 table 4 shows mean power and thrust coefficients found for the bahaj non ducted turbine when including its hub geometry with fine and coarse meshes for the fine grid case 1 which follows the above mentioned grid guideline ϵ 0 8 c has been used for the coarse grid ϵ c case 2 and ϵ 0 6 c a v case 3 have been employed as it can be seen from this table mean c p and c t values of all three cases are very similar 6 conclusion in this study the al method was modified so that it can be used to simulate the operation of ducted tidal turbines this was done by simulating two ducted turbines and modifying the method based on observed necessary changes to ensure physically correct solutions were obtained for each case the first turbine studied in this work was the cresswell turbine for the cresswell turbine a grid based distribution of blade elements and a chord based projection factor was employed this turbine was simulated at tsr 4 in straight and yawed flows the results of these simulations showed that the al method produces a physically correct presentation of the blades in the vorticity field successfully reproduces the tip and root vortices and exposes a swirling vortical structure on the duct s outer surface also in terms of the mean power coefficient for straight flow the predicted value was in a good agreement with the experiment with only a 2 9 difference in the yawed flow however while still reasonably close a higher difference of 7 8 with the experiment was noticed the clean current ducted turbine the second turbine studied in this work was simulated for a range of tsrs in the straight flow for simulating this turbine the al method was modified by employing a cylindrical projection method for this turbine the effect of the turbulence model on predicted power and thrust coefficients was studied by employing both des and urans this study showed some difference in predicted turbine parameters especially the mean normalized power coefficient which grows by increase in tsr this was attributed to different predictions of the velocity field in the vicinity of the actuator lines by the two turbulence models and especially to the difference in predicted angles of attack further investigations showed that at small blade angles of attack c l cos ϕ c d sin ϕ and especially c l sin ϕ c d cos ϕ which are used in the blade element theory for calculating the axial and tangential components of imposed force by each blade element change significantly with a slight change in the angle of attack thus considering relatively low operational angles of attack for this turbine the al method still illustrates good performance in predicting the turbine s power and thrust coefficients therefore for a turbine with higher operational angles of attack less sensitivity to the turbulence model is anticipated and for the same reason a better prediction by the al method at high tsrs is expected in this work also the various simulations resulted in a guideline for an appropriate projection factor based on this guideline for an adequately fine grid in the tangential direction the suitable projection factor is in the range between 0 6 c and 0 8 c acknowledgments this work has been funded by the government of canada ecoenergy innovation initiative ecoeii through the project titled reducing the cost of in stream tidal

22345,in this numerical study the standard actuator line method is modified for simulating ducted tidal turbines and validated against experimental data for two turbines with different geometries the necessary modifications which are based on the unique features of ducted turbines include using a grid based distribution of blade elements employing the local chord length as the length scale for the projection factor and implementing a cylindrical projection this study also provides a guideline to facilitate choosing the projection factor the only parameter in the actuator line method which is chosen empirically the first ducted tidal turbine studied in this work is the cresswell turbine the operation of which is simulated at its design tip speed ratio in axially aligned and yawed onset flows the second turbine developed by clean current power systems is simulated over a range of tip speed ratios in axially aligned onset flow in order to study the effect of the turbulence model on the actuator line method s predictions for this turbine both the detached eddy simulation and k ω turbulence models are employed and the results are compared importantly the actuator line methodology

simulation tsr tip speed ratio uad uniform actuator disk urans unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes 1 introduction electricity generation using tidal turbines is a relatively new technology in the renewable energy field due to their harsh and complex operational environment tidal turbines must be engineered to operate with low maintenance and high efficiency therefore significant research and development is being undertaken to achieve these operational goals and high fidelity numerical tools such as cfd are being applied to the problem research at the university of new brunswick is focused on developing a simulation tool that can predict turbine performance and survivability in the realistic ocean environment with highly site specific turbulent flows there are different cfd methods applicable for numerical simulations of tidal turbines with the full rotor simulation fsr uniform actuator disk uad blade element actuator disk bead and actuator line al methods being the most important in the frs method the rotor geometry is included in the computational domain and is rotated in the approaching flow the moving overset grids and sliding mesh are the two popular techniques used with this method among studies that have employed this method for tidal turbine studies by mcnaughton et al 2014 lloyd et al 2013 fleming et al 2013 o doherty et al 2009b and o doherty et al 2009a can be mentioned while this method if employed with a proper grid resolution can be very accurate the need for a fine grid close to walls makes it forbiddingly computationally expensive for in situ simulations where site specific characteristics of the oceanic environment is included in the uad method the rotor is replaced with an actuator disk with the same diameter and thickness for the control volumes positioned in the actuator disk region a resistance is applied opposite to the flow direction this method is the counterpart of the experimental method known as the porous or static disk harrison et al 2009 shives and crawford 2011 belloni et al 2013 and blackmore et al 2013 have used this method for studying tidal turbines considering the low grid resolution that can be used with this method it is a feasible option for in situ simulations however the absence of wake rotation makes the near wake region obtained from this method inaccurate the bead method was first employed for simulating helicopter rotors see e g zori and rajagopalan 1995 and ship propellers see e g molland and turnock 1996 later this method was used for simulating wind turbines see e g ammara et al 2002 lavaroni et al 2014 and porte agel et al 2011 and more recently is used for investigating tidal turbines see e g batten et al 2013 harrison et al 2010 malki et al 2013 masters et al 2013 and baratchi et al 2017 in this method the turbine rotor is replaced with an actuator disk and the momentum source terms in the navier stokes equations are calculated from the blade element theory it is important to note that the blade element theory forces are calculated using the velocity field from the cfd solution this method is applicable for in situ simulations and is superior to the uad method because the generated wake by this method has the rotational component of velocity however a bead turbine does not reproduce the unsteady structures caused by operation of a real rotor baratchi et al 2017 this method should not be confused with the blade element momentum bem technique which is an analytical method the bem method was originally developed by glauert glauert 1935 and is basically composed of the blade element and momentum theories in this method the rotor is divided into a number of airfoil strips between 10 to 20 hansen 2008 assuming that each strip is independent of the others the imposed force and torque on a given blade section are found from blade element theory and equated with the change in the linear and angular momentum of the flow passing through the rotor disk at this section the resulting set of equations involves the angle of attack axial and tangential induction factors and lift and drag coefficients these equations as discussed by manwell et al 2010 can be solved using an iterative solution for axial and tangential induction factors finally in the al method the blade body forces are modeled with momentum source terms which are distributed around three rotating lines representing the turbine s blades this method was proposed by sørensen and shen 2002 and was implemented with the navier stokes equations in their vorticity velocity form in their study s ϕ rensen and shen used this method to solve the flow field around a 500 kw wind turbine with three lm19 1 blades they validated their results with measurements and reported good agreement for power generation using this method they were able to capture blades tip vortices most of the studies which have utilized the al method have been on wind turbines among these studies troldborg et al 2007 used the al method and investigated the wake of a wind turbine they applied time varying body forces in a plane upstream of the rotor to produce a turbulent inflow with the same spectral characteristics of the real atmospheric flow and compared the results with the uniform inlet velocity sarlak et al 2014 used the al method and compared les results obtained from ellipsys3d the code developed at dtu riso with openfoam for a single and an array of three tandem wind turbines jha et al 2014 studied the effect of the source term distribution in the al method and proposed a new method for determining the radius of source terms projection which varies in the spanwise direction and produces an elliptic distribution in this study they simulated the nrel phase v i and nrel 5 mw wind turbines and compared their results with the available data and also with the results from xturb psu a solver which uses the blade element momentum bem method churchfield et al 2012b used the al method and carried out a large eddy simulation for the lillgrund 48 multi megawatt wind farm employing openfoam this wind farm is composed of 48 turbines and this work is among a few works which have used the al method for analyzing a farm and has taken one million cpu hours troldborg et al 2011 used the al method and les turbulence model and studied the interaction between two tandem wind turbines spaced different distances from each other and in different degrees of ambient turbulence intensity the study by baratchi et al 2017 is one of the few studies which have used the al method for a tidal turbine in their study they used the al method and investigated the wake and operational parameters of the bahaj non ducted tidal turbine bahaj et al 2007 in straight and yawed flows and compared the results with the outcomes from the bead method from these studies one can see that the al method is capable of replicating the unsteady features such as tip and root vortices caused by a turbine operation and is computationally feasible for in situ simulations of tidal turbines also this method has not been used before for ducted turbines which are very popular in the tidal sector however in the standard al method turbine structural components are excluded from the simulation and only the rotor s rotation is simulated while this simplification might be seen as an acceptable approximation when simulating a non ducted turbine it cannot be used for ducted turbines therefore a modified version of the al method capable of simulating ducted turbines is needed this is the focus of this paper and is accomplished by simulating two ducted turbines and modifying the al method based on the unique features of ducted turbines the first turbine in this study is the cresswell ducted turbine cresswell et al 2015 which has been simulated at its design tsr in the straight and yawed flows the second turbine is the clean current turbine clean current 2013 the operation of which is simulated at different tsrs in the straight flow for this turbine alongside des simulations urans simulations are carried out as well to study the effects of turbulence model on the outcomes of the al method parallel research by wilcox et al 2017 developed a cfd based methodology for predicting site specific turbulence at several tidal sites in the bay of fundy the long term objective is to combine the al method with these in situ simulations so that in situ performance and survivability of a turbine can be predicted prior to its deployment 2 computational model 2 1 governing equations conservation of mass and momentum are the two main equations which are solved for this problem in a turbulent flow as 1 v i x i 0 and 2 v i t v i v j x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν ν t v i x j v j x i s i the in the above equations represents spatially filtered or time averaged values depending on the turbulence model the des turbulence model which is a hybrid combination of urans and les is employed for most of the simulations performed in this work the urans turbulence model is only used for the clean current turbine to investigate the influence of the turbulence model on predictions of the al method the urans turbulence model used in this study is the standard wilcox k ω model wilcox 1993 and the des turbulence model employs the standard wilcox k ω model in the urans region and as the subgrid scale model in the les region noting that menter s k ω s s t model uses the k ω model close to walls and k ϵ far from them which in the des is modeled employing les the combination used in this work for the des turbulence model is almost the same as strelets s des strelets 2001 s i in eq 2 is the i component of source term which represents the rotor s operation in the al method and is calculated from the blade element theory in the blade element theory the blade is divided into a number of small airfoils blade elements for each of which the thrust and torque are calculated using the acting lift and drag forces in fig 1 a rotor with a counter clockwise rotation is shown for the blade element located between r d r 2 and r d r 2 the induced tangential velocity is v θ fig 2 shows the side view of the same blade element with the velocity and force vectors being illustrated in fig 2 a w is the relative velocity defined as 3 w v z 2 ω r v θ 2 where v z and v θ are respectively axial and tangential components of velocity and are calculated from u v and w components of velocity obtained from the cfd simulation also from fig 2 a ϕ is the angle between the plane of rotation and the relative velocity and can be found from 4 ϕ arctan v z ω r v θ where ω is the rotational velocity of the rotor to calculate the angle of attack the obtained ϕ angle is used in 5 α ϕ β where the blade element s twist angle β is obtained through linear interpolation from a look up table which provides this parameter and the local chord size c at specific spanwise locations the imposed forces on the blade element in the axial z and tangential θ directions according to fig 2 b in terms of lift and drag forces are 6 d f z d l cos ϕ d d sin ϕ and 7 d f θ d l sin ϕ d d cos ϕ noting that lift and drag coefficients are defined as 8 c l d l 1 2 ρ w 2 c d r and 9 c d d d 1 2 ρ w 2 c d r the imposed forces in the z and θ directions are 10 d f z 1 2 ρ w 2 c d r c l cos ϕ c d sin ϕ and 11 d f θ 1 2 ρ w 2 c d r c l sin ϕ c d cos ϕ the lift and drag coefficients used in eqs 10 and 11 are introduced using a second look up table which provides c l and c d at specified spanwise locations the forces calculated using eqs 10 and 11 with opposite sign will be imposed on the flow by each blade element however in order to avoid oscillations in the solution and divergence due to a finite source term this force is projected smoothly on the control volumes which are located in the vicinity of each blade element this is done by employing a three dimensional gaussian projection function sørensen and shen 2002 12 f c t b 1 b e 1 n d f e b t 1 ϵ 3 π 3 2 e x p r e b r c ϵ 2 where d f e b is the generated force by element e of actuator line b r e b is the position vector of blade element e b r c is the position vector of control volume c which f c is calculated for and ϵ is a constant which controls the width of the projection fig 3 shows a schematic of the projection process from this figure for a blade element the contours of the projected force form spherical surfaces which decrease in strength moving outwards in the radial direction it should be noted that the total projected force for each blade element must be equal to the imposed force by the blade element next the source term for each control volume is calculated by summing the projected force by all the blade elements on the control volume and dividing it by the control volume volume 2 2 cfd solver and procedure the code developed for this study is part of exn aero gerber et al 2013 a gpu based cfd solver being developed at the university of new brunswick with a specific emphasis on tidal energy applications this solver uses a collocated finite volume discretization method rhie and chow 1983 and an implicit in time simplec approach for pressure velocity coupling careto et al 1972 a second order transient is combined with an upwind biased tvd van leer scheme for the advection term darwish and moukalled 2003 an algebraic multigrid hutchinson and raithby 1986 approach is employed to accelerate the solution the simulations in this work have been performed in the unsteady mode and the time step for each simulation has been chosen so that the tip of the blade does not move more than one control volume per time step the number of outer loop iterations for these simulations is 5 with this number of iterations there will be less than 1 change in c p and c t between the two last iterations simulations are continued until the standard deviation of the running average of c p and c t over 10 revolutions is less than 0 001 and the time average of the flow field is calculated after the exit of the initial transient solution from the domain the steps of the al method are shown in fig 4 according to this figure in the al method after determining the new location of the rotor each blade is divided into a number of blade elements and flow velocity is interpolated at each blade element center axial and tangential components of the velocity at the blade element centers are calculated from u v and w fluid velocity components and then the angle of attack is calculated for each blade element using eq 5 using the spanwise location of each blade element and its angle of attack the lift and drag coefficients are determined using a look up table through linear interpolation utilizing eqs 10 and 11 generated axial and tangential forces by each blade element are calculated all of these steps are more suitable to be done by cpus and are assigned to them next using eq 12 the calculated force for each blade element is projected on the flow field around it this step due to its large size of computations is performed on gpus in order to undertake the projection for each control volume an execution thread calculates the total projected force imposed on the control volume by all the blade elements across all of the blades by performing the summations in eq 12 the projected forces produced by a blade element over all the control volumes when summed will not be equal to the blade element s force therefore the ratio of a blade element s force over its total projected force is used to scale the projected forces to make sure they balance in order to find the total projected force a summation process is required that involves other threads the summation employs the atomicadd function available in cuda programming languages to avoid race conditions where multiple threads write to the same memory address at the same time in the final step the imposed force on each control volume is calculated by adding the modified projected force from all the blade elements and then by dividing the axial and tangential components of the resulting force by the control volume s volume s z and s θ will be obtained 3 simulation setup and results for cresswell ducted tidal turbine the ducted turbine studied by cresswell et al 2015 has three blades that have been developed from a naca 63818 profile this turbine is a scaled down model of a tidal turbine and its rotor radius is equal to 0 174 m the duct outlet diameter and duct length of this turbine are respectively 0 5 m and 0 405 m and at tsr 4 its nominal power and rotational speed are 0 3 kw and 4850 rpm respectively the study by cresswell et al 2015 on this turbine is one of the few experimental studies carried out on ducted tidal turbines that are available in open literature the high cost of conducting tests in towing tanks or cavitation tunnel facilities is the main reason for the lack of experimental studies in this area even cresswell et al 2015 tested a scaled down version of their turbine in a wind tunnel and in order to keep the reynolds number in an acceptable range used a high inlet velocity and consequently high rotational velocities therefore considering the mach number at the rotor blade tip for most tsrs examined in their study compressibility effects cannot be neglected which is not the case for tidal turbines thus in this work in order to avoid errors caused by compressibility effects the simulations for the cresswell turbine were carried out only at tsr 4 which is the smallest tsr value tested by cresswell et al 2015 and the resulting flow field can be approximated as incompressible 3 1 cfd domain and boundary conditions for cresswell turbine the domain used for the al simulations of this turbine is shown in fig 5 according to this figure the inlet and outlet boundaries have been located respectively 5 d o upstream and 10 d o downstream from the rotor the height and width of the domain are 8 d o where d o is the duct outlet diameter the projection region is also shown in fig 5 the projection region is a block of control volumes surrounding the rotor swept volume where the distribution of source terms is performed it should be noted that based on eq 12 the projected force source term generated by each blade element decreases exponentially with distance from the blade element center and is practically zero beyond a certain distance therefore the accumulated source term caused by all of the blade elements is zero beyond a certain distance before and aft of the rotor and performing the projection process outside of these boundaries is not necessary and computationally efficient in this work in order to determine the front and back sides of the projection region studies with extended projection regions have been conducted and the boundaries have been decided based on the obtained source terms distribution regarding the boundary conditions employed for this problem the no slip wall condition is used for the hub and duct surfaces for the inlet boundary based on the reynolds number r e d 5 1 1 0 5 a prescribed velocity condition is employed for the outlet a fully developed flow with zero static pressure and for the sides a symmetry boundary condition are assumed noting that this turbine has been tested in a laboratory with controlled conditions the turbulence intensity at the inlet has been set to 0 5 with a low value of turbulence at the inlet the origin of turbulence and unsteadiness in the wake will be limited to the turbine s operation and its structural components the grid developed for this turbine is a multi block structured mesh which is h type in front and behind the hub highlighted in fig 6 and is o type in the rest of the domain choosing a structured mesh for this problem over an unstructured grid which can be produced with less effort has been done due to the advantages of structured grids in a better control on the quality of control volumes less numerical diffusion and faster solution in this grid in order to ensure the accurate implementation of the log law for the walls as can be seen in fig 6 a fine mesh has been applied close to the hub and duct surfaces which becomes coarser moving away from them with that being said on the rotor plane the height of the control volumes on the hub surface is 0 001 m which increases in the normal direction and after reaching a maximum of 0 0035 m decreases and becomes 0 002 m at the blades tips it should be noted that there are 7 control volumes in the gap between the blades tips and the duct s inner surface and the height of the control volume on the duct s inner surface is 0 0008 m with such grid distribution the number of the total control volumes for this grid is 7 3 1 0 6 besides this baseline grid which is labeled case 1 in table 1 an extended grid with the same resolution case 2 and a finer grid with the same domain size case 3 have been simulated obtained mean power and thrust coefficients for the three grids are listed in table 1 which were calculated according to 13 c p r h r ω d t 1 2 ρ a v 3 s θ v c ω d c 1 2 ρ a v 3 and 14 c t f z 1 2 ρ a v 2 s z v c 1 2 ρ a v 2 where v c and d c are respectively control volumes volume and their distance from the rotation axis v is the magnitude of speed at the domain s inlet and the summations are performed on all the control volumes located in the projection region from this table one can see that the changes in mean power and thrust coefficients with change in the domain size or grid resolution are negligible therefore the grid used with case 1 is considered suitable for this problem 3 2 modifications to al method for simulating cresswell turbine in the standard implementation of the al method usually a cartesian grid with an equidistant region which encloses the rotor is typically employed with such a mesh as is illustrated in fig 7 dividing each actuator line into blade elements with equal size results in a balanced distribution of blade elements with regard to the control volumes however when including turbine structural components such as hub and duct the grid spacing in the radial direction needs to change to refine the grid in the boundary layer region close to the hub and duct walls therefore dividing the blades into a number of equally sized blade elements will result in multiple blade elements for control volumes in coarser regions of the grid while in finer regions there will be only one blade element across multiple control volumes this is illustrated in fig 8 for actuator line 1 which is equally divided into 10 blade elements as one can see for this case the number of blade elements per control volume decreases when moving towards the hub this can produce inaccuracy in the al method results because the imposed force on each blade element is calculated based on the flow information at the blade element center and then is projected on the surrounding control volumes in other words in the fine region of the grid the imposed force on many control volumes will be based on the flow information of one blade element which due to the gradients of flow variables is experiencing a different flow condition thus the uniform sampling of the information with the uniform blade elements scheme does not put enough blade elements in fine regions and consequently the calculated forces will not be a correct representation of the real velocity field in those control volumes to address this issue in this paper the actuator lines are divided based on the grid topology and the size of blade elements changes according to the grid s radial spacing the result is actuator line 2 in fig 8 which similar to actuator line 1 has 10 blade elements but has been divided based on the grid size by employing this approach and using the number of the control volumes in the radial direction for the blade elements number there will be one blade element for each control volume which will allow an efficient sampling of flow information based on the local flow field also in the standard al method as was done by troldborg et al 2011 churchfield et al 2012a martinez et al 2012 and baratchi et al 2017 a factor of grid size in the equidistant region of the mesh is used as the length scale for the projection parameter in this work in order to improve the performance of the method the local size of the blade chord is used as the projection length scale using a physical length scale based on the local blade geometry can enhance the accuracy of the al method 3 3 al method s parametric study for cresswell turbine in the al method the projection factor ϵ in eq 12 is an empirical parameter that determines the width over which the imposed force by a blade element is distributed it has been shown previously by martínez tossas et al 2015 and baratchi et al 2017 that the value used for this parameter has a considerable effect on the prediction of the al method for power and thrust coefficients therefore a correct choice for ϵ is crucial in the accuracy of the al method a large projection factor distributes the source terms over a larger area causes over prediction of power and thrust coefficients to the extent that predicted c p can be beyond the betz limit churchfield et al 2017 on the other hand too small a projection factor by generating a sudden change in source terms results in numerical oscillations and even divergence in the solution therefore a suitable projection factor is a small value with a stable solution thus in order to determine the suitable projection factor power and thrust coefficients were calculated for a range of ϵ and their oscillations were used as a metric for numerical oscillations in the solution field fig 9 shows the variation in mean c p and c t with ϵ c for the cresswell turbine at tsr 4 over a range of ϵ between 0 6 c and 1 2 c in their work cresswell et al did not measure the thrust coefficient however their reported power coefficient is shown in fig 9 from this figure one can see that for this turbine by increasing ϵ c from 0 6 to 0 8 the change in mean c p and c t are very small respectively 2 3 and 2 0 this is different from the trend observed previously by baratchi et al 2017 in the standard al where the same ratio of increase in ϵ δ g r i d from 1 5 to 2 caused mean c p and c t to increase respectively by 16 and 8 figs 10 and 11 show the time history of c p and c t versus non dimensional time t t ω 2 π after the initial transient portion of the solution is removed as can be seen from these figures there are small high frequency wiggles for both c p and c t for all values of ϵ c the magnitude of which decreases slightly with an increase in the projection factor this is consistent with the observation made by baratchi et al 2017 when using the standard al method it is worth mentioning that ϵ c 0 4 was the smallest value tested for this turbine and did not result in a converged solution from the above discussion one can see that for ϵ c 0 6 the al method provides solutions with an acceptable level of oscillations and predicts a mean power coefficient that is close to the result reported by the experiment therefore this is the value that were used for all subsequent simulations 3 4 simulation results for cresswell ducted tidal turbine in this section simulation results for the cresswell turbine in straight and yawed flows ζ 1 5 obtained from the al method when combined with the des turbulence model are presented fig 12 shows the distribution of the source terms for this turbine in the straight flow from this figure the distribution of source terms resembles a rotor geometry and in addition the width of the region over which the source terms are distributed changes proportionally to the blade s chord fig 13 shows the instantaneous normalized velocity magnitude u 2 v 2 w 2 v i n l e t and pressure coefficient contours for the cresswell turbine in the straight flow by examining the velocity field high velocity regions can be detected next to the duct s inner surface which occur when the flow passes the gap between the blade tip and the duct as the fluid passes through the gap large axial and tangential components and swirls are induced next to the duct inner surface forming tip vortices the tip vortices predicted by the al method for this turbine will be explored in more detail subsequently in this paper in this figure a separation region with a low velocity is also seen on the duct s outer surface this separation is due to the high angle of the incident flow induced by the partial blockage of the flow by the blades and takes place from the very beginning of the duct and is better illustrated in fig 14 by flow reversal this figure shows the instantaneous normalized velocity magnitude contours alongside velocity vectors from the pressure field a pressure drop can be seen in the flow when passing through the rotor this figure also shows notable unsteadiness after the turbine caused by the turbine s operation and vortex shedding from its components in fig 15 the instantaneous iso surface of normalized vorticity ω ω 0 8 are shown where ω and ω are the magnitude of the total vorticity and the rotational velocity of the rotor respectively from this figure one can see how the vorticity field of the al method resembles that for a real turbine operation and the effect of the blade geometry and tip and root vortices have been produced by employing this method the formation of the tip vortices for this turbine is due to the relatively considerable size of the gap between the blades tips and the duct the layer of separated flow on the outer surface of the duct mentioned previously can be seen better here which forms a swirling vortical structure on the duct s outer surface this structure is generated due to the blades source terms which locally block the flow from entering the duct and push it outward to flow faster over the outer surface of the duct it is worth mentioning that neither the tip and root vortices nor the swirling structure on the duct s outer surface are generated when the bead method is used for simulating a ducted turbine baratchi 2018 the time history of power and thrust coefficients at tsr 4 are presented in fig 16 where the initial transition solution has been removed for this turbine since the turbine structural components have been included in the simulations the imposed forces on the hub and duct are an important part of the turbine thrust force these forces due to the unsteadiness of the wake and the flow passing over these components vary with time this variation causes the turbine s thrust force to be oscillating which can be seen in this figure when a non ducted turbine is exposed to a yawed flow as was discussed by burton et al 2000 and later was confirmed by bahaj et al 2007 and baratchi et al 2017 its c p and c t decrease respectively with a factor of cosine and square cosine of the yaw angle for ducted turbines on the other hand the duct can help align the flow with the rotor s axis a factor which can contribute to an improvement in the turbine s performance thus in order to investigate the effect of the yaw angle on the performance of a ducted turbine the operation of the cresswell turbine in a 1 5 yawed flow is simulated fig 17 shows the instantaneous normalized velocity magnitude and pressure coefficient contours in the yawed flow for tsr 4 by examining this figure carefully the high velocity regions next to the duct s inner surface caused by tip vortices and observed previously in the straight flow are seen here too comparing this figure against fig 13 for the straight flow one can see a larger separation zone on the leeward side of the duct with a frequent departure of vortical structures from the pressure field a pressure difference between the side of the duct which is exposed to the flow and the opposite side is seen this pressure difference along with the imposed frictional force on the duct causes a considerable transverse force in the x direction f x this force added to the axial force f z creates a total force of 44 3 n which when compared with 18 6 n imposed on the duct in the straight flow is much higher front and top views of the instantaneous normalized vorticity iso surface ω ω 0 8 for the yawed flow are shown in fig 18 this figure provides a better visualization of the variation in thickness of the separation region around the duct tip and root vortices and the swirling pattern on the outer surface of the duct generated by the rotating blades can be seen here too since in the case of the yawed flow these swirling structures are washed to one side of the domain the tip vortices which exit the duct s outlet can be seen more easily in terms of the turbine s performance parameters mean c p and c t predicted by the al method for the straight flow are respectively 0 492 and 1 311 the power coefficient for the same tsr reported by the experiment is 0 478 from these values the difference between the mean c p obtained from the al method with the experiment is 2 9 for the yawed flow on the other hand mean c p and c t predicted by the al method are respectively 0 524 and 1 307 noting that the c p value reported by cresswell et al 2015 is 0 486 there is 7 8 difference between c p values from the two methods the higher difference in the case of yawed flow can be due to measurement errors in the experiment or inaccuracy of the al method due to the flow complexities before the rotor caused by the angle between the flow and duct s inlet more simulations and experiments are needed in order to determine the performance of the al method when simulating ducted turbines in yawed flows the mean power and thrust coefficients and mass flow rates predicted by the al method and the power coefficient measured by the experiment have been summarized in table 2 one can see that the al method consistent with the experiment predicts that mean c p increased by 6 5 for the yawed flow in comparison to the straight flow in addition the mass flow rates increased by 1 6 and the mean c t decreased by 0 3 for the yawed flow 4 simulation setup and results for clean current ducted tidal turbine in the previous section the effect of the flow direction on the performance of a ducted turbine at its design tsr was investigated in this section in order to study the effect of the change in tsr on the performance of a ducted turbine the ducted tidal turbine designed by the clean current power systems and tested in a towing tank by the national research council canada clean current 2013 is simulated in the straight flow at different tsrs fig 19 shows the clean current tidal turbine this turbine has three custom designed blades which their lift and drag coefficients at different radii have been provided by the manufacturer clean current 2013 for this turbine the rotor diameter is equal to 1 48 m and the diffuser has a circular inlet with 1 5 m diameter and an almost elliptical outlet with its major and minor axes equal to 2 and 1 5 m respectively at tsr 5 the nominal power and rotational speed of this turbine are respectively 7 5 kw and 160 rpm the tests on this turbine have been conducted in a towing tank which is 200 meters long 12 meters wide and 7 meters deep at 4 different carriage speeds of 2 2 5 3 and 3 5 m s 4 1 cfd domain and boundary conditions for clean current turbine fig 20 shows the solution domain used for the clean current turbine for this turbine at the inlet a specified velocity with r e d 3 7 1 0 6 is used and similar to the cresswell turbine the turbulence intensity is set to t i 0 5 for the side boundaries the symmetry boundary condition is used and for the outlet a fully developed flow with a static pressure equal to zero has been assumed the no slip wall boundary condition is used for the hub and duct surfaces fig 20 also shows the region where the imposed force by the blade elements are projected on their surrounding control volumes since in this case the turbine and its duct are relatively short and the rotor is located almost at the middle of the duct length the whole volume inside the duct has been assigned as the projection region the baseline grid developed for the clean current turbine similar to the one used for the cresswell turbine has a multi block structured topology top and side views of cuts through the turbine s x z and y z mid planes are shown in fig 21 in this figure changes in the grid spacing which is fine close to walls and becomes coarser away from them is shown for this grid on the hub surface at the rotor plane the height of the cells is 0 0008 m this height increases in the normal direction and after reaching a maximum of 0 008 m decreases to 0 001 m at the blade tip with such a distribution the total number of the control volumes along a blade is 86 which according to the grid based distribution of blade elements in the al method is also the number of blade elements it is worth mentioning that 11 control volumes have been applied in the gap between the rotor and duct and the height of the cells on the duct s inner surface is 0 0005 m to ensure that the simulation results will be independent of the domain size and grid resolution a verification process was conducted therefore in addition to the baseline grid case 1 simulations have been carried out using an extended grid case 2 and a grid with higher resolution case 3 at tsr 4 predicted mean power and thrust coefficients for the three cases are compared in table 3 it is worth mentioning that for calculating power and thrust coefficients for this turbine the convention for ducted turbines which uses the duct s outlet area a o u t l e t is applied also power and thrust coefficients are presented in terms of c p and c t which are normalized by the experimentally measured power and thrust coefficients at the design tsr tsr 5 from table 3 one can see that changes in predicted mean normalized power and thrust coefficients for these cases are negligible and therefore the baseline grid is suitable for this study 4 2 modifications to al method for simulating clean current turbine for the al simulations of this turbine similar to the cresswell turbine imposed forces by each blade element calculated from eqs 10 and 11 need to be projected to the control volumes surrounding it following the steps taken for the cresswell turbine by employing the grid based distribution of blade elements the chord based projection factor scheme and the 3d projection method with ϵ c 0 8 the source term distribution for tsr 4 will be according to fig 22 as can be seen in this figure there are regions with high concentration of source terms next to the hub and rotor edge at the instantaneous location of the actuator lines these high concentrations produce a non physical velocity field and consequently inaccurate power and thrust coefficients predictions this is shown in fig 23 where the velocity pattern in the rotor plane produced by this projection is illustrated from this figure one can see that the al method as implemented for the cresswell turbine predicts an erroneous velocity field with non physical values around the hub and behind the blade tips these high concentration regions near the blade tips are due to the nature of the 3d projection which tries to project the imposed force by each blade element in 3 dimensions this causes high values for source terms close to the hub and rotor edge where the projection is blocked by the turbine s components in order to address this issue a cylindrical projection method is proposed for this turbine in the cylindrical projection using eq 12 the force imposed by blade element e b with certain distance from the rotor s axis is projected only on the control volumes which are located at the same radial distance from the rotor s axis fig 24 illustrates this projection method for a single actuator line at one radial location as can be seen in this figure the cylindrical projection method projects the imposed force by a single blade element on a cylindrical surface where the strength of the projected force generated source term decreases according to eq 12 with distance from the blade element s center the distribution of source terms for this turbine using the cylindrical projection at tsr 4 employing ϵ c 0 8 is shown in fig 25 as can be seen no areas with high concentration of source terms appear in this case also velocity magnitude contours at the rotor plane shown in fig 26 present a physically correct pattern it is worth mentioning that in figs 25 and 26 the blades rotate in a counterclockwise direction 4 3 al method s parametric study for clean current turbine similar to the cresswell turbine a suitable value for the projection factor needs to be determined for the clean current turbine this is done by employing a range of ϵ values and investigating power and thrust coefficients in order to find a small projection factor with a stable solution figs 27 and 28 respectively show mean normalized power and thrust coefficients predictions as a function of ϵ c for tsr 5 corresponding values found using the bead method baratchi 2018 and reported values from the experiment are also shown as can be seen from these figures similar to fig 9 between ϵ c 0 6 0 8 the variations in mean c p and c t are minimal and respectively 1 6 and 0 9 that is even smaller than values previously reported for the cresswell turbine with further increase in the projection factor both mean c p and c t values increase slightly and for high ϵ values the two graphs illustrate the asymptotic behavior observed previously by baratchi et al 2017 when using the standard al method for a non ducted turbine figs 29 and 30 show the time history of c p and c t respectively at tsr 5 for the ϵ c values investigated these figures show high frequency numerical wiggles in c p and c t which can be considered as a metric of numerical oscillations in the solution as expected oscillations in the solution decrease with an increase in ϵ c from these figures one can see that similar to the cresswell turbine in the range of ϵ 0 6 c to ϵ 0 8 c the oscillations in the power and thrust coefficients are reasonable therefore considering the fact that when using ϵ 0 8 c oscillations in the solution have notably smaller amplitude and fewer iterations are required at each time step for a converged solution this value is used for the projection factor for the remaining simulations 4 4 simulation results for clean current ducted tidal turbine in this section the simulation results for the clean current turbine using the al method coupled first with the des turbulence model and next with the urans model are presented fig 31 illustrates side and top views of instantaneous normalized velocity magnitude contours predicted by the des at different tsr values from this figure one can see that with each increase in tsr the wake generated behind the hub becomes narrower this is due to the higher mass flow rate and axial velocity for cases with higher tsr the separation of the flow on the inner side of the duct close to its outlet for tsr 6 visible in the top view is also due to the high axial velocity additionally comparing this figure with fig 13 one can see there are no alternating high velocity regions next to the duct s inner surface indicating the tip vortices are not generated in this turbine this is because of the very small clearance between the blades tips and duct s surface which prevents the generation of discernible tip vortices in fig 32 the variations in time averaged normalized axial velocity on y 0 as defined in fig 20 in the cross stream direction are shown at four different locations downstream of the rotor the rotor operation which absorbs the kinematic energy of the flow and the wakes caused by the hub and duct are the three main factors that contribute to the momentum deficit seen behind the turbine the recovery process in the wake on the other hand is mainly due to turbulent mixing and the shear between the wake and free stream from this figure due to the high level of turbulence and mixing behind the hub most of the momentum deficit behind the hub is recovered for all cases by z d 4 however at z d 4 the duct s footprint can still be distinguished in the wake velocity profile which due to the shear effects between the free stream and the low velocity flow behind the turbine is increasingly flattened by moving downstream normalized iso surface of instantaneous vorticity for ω ω 0 3 are shown in fig 33 for different tsr values similar to the cresswell turbine a physical representation of the blades is produced in the vorticity field also the rotation of the rotor induces a swirling pattern on the duct s outer surface which is accompanied by flow separation at low tsrs in this study in order to investigate the effect of the turbulence model on the al method s predictions the al method has also been coupled with the k ω model side and top views of the instantaneous normalized velocity magnitude contours at different tsr values obtained using the k ω turbulence model are shown in fig 34 comparing this figure with fig 31 one can see that a lot of details and complexities of the wake captured using detached eddy simulation are not present here this is due to the time averaged nature of urans models which model turbulence effects and solve for the mean flow however the general outline of the velocity field still shows a wake that is relatively wide in the top view and exhibits an oscillating pattern in the side view also the width of the hub wake still decreases with increasing tsr for high tsrs the time history of normalized power and thrust coefficients for both des and urans simulation at tsr 4 and 5 are shown in fig 35 it should be mentioned that in this figure similar to fig 16 for the cresswell turbine the initial transient part of the solution has been removed from this figure one can see that c p and c t are affected by the employed turbulence model and values obtained using the k ω turbulence model illustrate more sinusoidal behavior when compared with des results this is caused by the more organized alternating wake predicted by the urans simulations discernible in the side view of fig 34 as tsr increases the amplitudes of variations in c p and c t decrease for the urans simulations which is in accordance with the reduction in the wake width previously noted from a comparison between the des results in this figure and fig 16 one will notice larger oscillations amplitude in c p and c t for the clean current turbine this is caused by different vortex shedding patterns from the duct and hub of each turbine evident in figs 31 and 14 which affect the flow field upstream near the actuator lines differently mean normalized power and thrust coefficients predicted by both the des and urans turbulence models are shown in figs 36 and 37 and compared to the reported experimental values in the experiment tests on this turbine were performed at different inlet velocities i e different reynolds numbers and since over the range of the tested re numbers power and thrust coefficients were not significantly affected by re in these figures in addition to v i n l e t 2 5 m s solid circles which has been used for the cfd simulations values reported at v i n l e t 2 m s 3 m s and 3 5 m s are also shown as hollow circles this has been done to better illustrate the trend of mean c p and c t versus tsr by comparing predictions for the two sets of al simulation results a consistent offset between the des and urans simulations is detected where for a given tsr the urans simulation predicts both a higher mean c p and c t from this figure one can also see that the difference between results obtained from the two turbulence models increases with increasing tsr for example at tsr 3 the differences between the values predicted for mean c p and c t by urans and des are respectively 4 9 and 2 6 but the corresponding differences at tsr 6 are 14 4 and 12 4 as was explained previously this difference is caused by the different prediction of the velocity field around the rotor for the two models which results in different distributions of source terms for the des and urans models this difference for tsr 6 can be seen in fig 38 where the distributions of instantaneous total source term obtained from the des and urans turbulence models are compared from this figure one can see that the k ω model predicts higher source term loading values which are especially discernible close to the tips of the blades based on investigations performed in this study the main reason for the differences seen in the source term strengths in fig 38 and mean c p and c t predictions from the des and urans in figs 36 and 37 is differences in predicted local angle of attack across the rotor from the two turbulence models different angles of attack predicted by the two turbulence models lead to different values of c l and c d obtained from the look up table which results in different estimations of d f θ and d f z from eqs 10 and 11 the ultimate result will be the difference in source term strength shown in fig 38 and discrepancy in mean c p and c t values discussed earlier fig 39 shows the percentage change in c l cos ϕ c d sin ϕ and c l sin ϕ c d cos ϕ for one degree change in α at different angles of attack for this turbine s blades at radius r r 0 71 the blade s twist angle at this radius is 15 9 7 c l cos ϕ c d sin ϕ and c l sin ϕ c d cos ϕ are used respectively in eqs 10 and 11 for calculating the axial d f z and the tangential component d f θ of the imposed force by each blade element from this figure one can see that for small angles of attack both terms change significantly with a relatively small change in the angle of attack this is mainly due to the higher relative change of the lift coefficient with angle of attack at small angles which according to theory is equal to 2 π α α in rad this explains the notable differences in source term strengths in fig 38 and in mean c p and c t for tsr 6 which has an instantaneous mean angle of attack averaged for the three lifting lines at r r 0 71 of 0 1 8 for the des and 0 2 7 for urans on the other hand for cases with low tsr corresponding to higher angles of attack the change in predicted angle of attack has a smaller effect on the source term strength and predicted mean normalized power and thrust coefficients this is the case for tsr 3 where the instantaneous mean angle of attack at r r 0 71 has changed from 8 7 0 for the des to 8 8 5 for the urans in addition with the relatively lower sensitivity of c l cos ϕ c d sin ϕ compared to c l sin ϕ c d cos ϕ as can be seen in fig 39 less difference between corresponding mean c t values predicted by the two turbulence models is expected this is confirmed by comparing the differences between the two sets of mean c p and c t predictions in figs 36 and 37 similarly when compared with the experiment a higher error is seen for both mean c p and c t in cases with high tsr i e smaller operational angle of attack because d f θ and d f z are more sensitive to errors in predicted angle of attack finally one can see that despite the special design of the blades in this turbine which operates at relatively low angles of attack the al method still displays a reasonable performance at tsr 5 the difference between the corresponding values of mean normalized power and thrust coefficients found from this method and the experiment are respectively 3 2 and 0 8 for des and 5 5 and 4 3 for urans 5 guidelines for implementing al method for simulating ducted and non ducted tidal turbines based on simulations performed in this research for simulating a ducted turbine and similarly a non ducted turbine when including its structural components in the simulation the following modifications to the al method are recommended 5 1 grid based distribution of blade elements in the standard al method the equidistant grid region around the rotor allows a uniform distribution of blade elements and a balanced sampling of information however when including the turbine s structural components a uniformed blade element distribution does not put enough blade elements close to the walls where due to high gradients of flow variables there is a high concentration of control volumes therefore in this work the grid based distribution of blade elements that divides the actuator line based on the grid resolution is proposed 5 2 projection factor length scale the projection factor which determines the projection width is the only empirical parameter in the al method in the standard al method the projection factor usually is a factor of grid size in the equidistant region troldborg 2008 recommended ϵ 2 δ g r i d which was used later by some other researchers churchfield et al 2012b 2011 and churchfield et al 2012a based on the study performed by baratchi et al 2017 on the projection factor the same value was determined as suitable for simulating the bahaj non ducted turbine however they reported a high dependency of the predicted power and thrust coefficients on the projection factor which can vary with a change in the grid size therefore in the current research the projection factor was based on the blade s chord length which is a more physical length scale and does not vary with the grid resolution by using such a length scale much lower sensitivity in predicted power and thrust coefficients to the projection factor is observed 5 3 projection method when using the standard al method projecting the imposed force by each blade element on the surrounding flow is done uses a 3d gaussian function applying this approach the imposed force by each blade element is projected uniformly in all three directions in space this was the approach used in this work for the cresswell turbine however using the same method for the clean current turbine resulted in regions with a high concentration of source terms close to the hub and rotor s edge this was attributed to the blade s design which produces significant axial and tangential forces close to the hub and duct to address this issue the cylindrical projection method was introduced where the imposed force by each blade element is projected only on the control volumes located at the same radial distance from the rotor axis with this change regions with high source terms concentrations and the resulting non physical velocity field are removed based on further investigations performed in this study while the 3d projection method still can be used for some turbines like the cresswell turbine with narrow blades close to the hub and duct the cylindrical method is applicable for all blades 5 4 projection factor and grid based on the studies conducted for projection factor on the cresswell and clean current turbines it is observed that when using the local chord length as the projection length scale the suitable projection factor is located in a range of ϵ 0 6 c 0 8 c in this range there is a small change in mean power and thrust coefficients predicted by the al method and oscillations in the solution are at a reasonable level therefore with an adequately fine grid in the tangential direction this range is proposed as a guideline for determining the suitable projection factor for coarse grids higher projection factors might be needed to produce a smooth distribution of source terms over enough control volumes and to prevent oscillations in the solution it should be noted that when using the local chord length for the projection length scale oscillations and instability in the solution usually happen close to the blade tip where the chord length is the smallest a small chord length close the tip results in a small projection factor which produces a non smooth distribution of source terms over a few control volumes and ultimately oscillations in the solution this issue becomes more pronounced in o type grids where control volumes tangential length inevitably increases in the radial direction and therefore there are less control volumes for the projection close to the blade tip this is less restrictive in ducted turbines with blades which most often have small span to chord ratios and do not become too narrow at the tip for non ducted turbines on the other hand the blades usually have high span to chord ratios and become increasingly narrow towards the tip and a special attention is needed for grid size and projection factor to produce a smooth distribution of source terms based on the projection factor studies performed for this research which includes additional simulations of the bahaj non ducted tidal turbine including its hub geometry for a stable solution in the recommended range of ϵ a grid with at least two control volumes across the chord at the blade tip is necessary this grid requirement is illustrated in fig 40 as was mentioned previously for coarser grids a higher projection factor might be needed a different approach to cases with coarser grid is to use the average chord length instead of the local chord length as the projection length scale for such cases the suitable projection factor is in the range 0 6 c a v ϵ 0 8 c a v these two approaches have been confirmed by the authors by simulating the bahaj non ducted tidal turbine bahaj et al 2007 table 4 shows mean power and thrust coefficients found for the bahaj non ducted turbine when including its hub geometry with fine and coarse meshes for the fine grid case 1 which follows the above mentioned grid guideline ϵ 0 8 c has been used for the coarse grid ϵ c case 2 and ϵ 0 6 c a v case 3 have been employed as it can be seen from this table mean c p and c t values of all three cases are very similar 6 conclusion in this study the al method was modified so that it can be used to simulate the operation of ducted tidal turbines this was done by simulating two ducted turbines and modifying the method based on observed necessary changes to ensure physically correct solutions were obtained for each case the first turbine studied in this work was the cresswell turbine for the cresswell turbine a grid based distribution of blade elements and a chord based projection factor was employed this turbine was simulated at tsr 4 in straight and yawed flows the results of these simulations showed that the al method produces a physically correct presentation of the blades in the vorticity field successfully reproduces the tip and root vortices and exposes a swirling vortical structure on the duct s outer surface also in terms of the mean power coefficient for straight flow the predicted value was in a good agreement with the experiment with only a 2 9 difference in the yawed flow however while still reasonably close a higher difference of 7 8 with the experiment was noticed the clean current ducted turbine the second turbine studied in this work was simulated for a range of tsrs in the straight flow for simulating this turbine the al method was modified by employing a cylindrical projection method for this turbine the effect of the turbulence model on predicted power and thrust coefficients was studied by employing both des and urans this study showed some difference in predicted turbine parameters especially the mean normalized power coefficient which grows by increase in tsr this was attributed to different predictions of the velocity field in the vicinity of the actuator lines by the two turbulence models and especially to the difference in predicted angles of attack further investigations showed that at small blade angles of attack c l cos ϕ c d sin ϕ and especially c l sin ϕ c d cos ϕ which are used in the blade element theory for calculating the axial and tangential components of imposed force by each blade element change significantly with a slight change in the angle of attack thus considering relatively low operational angles of attack for this turbine the al method still illustrates good performance in predicting the turbine s power and thrust coefficients therefore for a turbine with higher operational angles of attack less sensitivity to the turbulence model is anticipated and for the same reason a better prediction by the al method at high tsrs is expected in this work also the various simulations resulted in a guideline for an appropriate projection factor based on this guideline for an adequately fine grid in the tangential direction the suitable projection factor is in the range between 0 6 c and 0 8 c acknowledgments this work has been funded by the government of canada ecoenergy innovation initiative ecoeii through the project titled reducing the cost of in stream tidal

22346,this paper presents empirical formulas for calculating the maximum wave height and period in a numerical wave hindcasting model in terms of significant wave height mean wave period and peakedness parameter the formulas are developed by applying the least square method to the wave data measured at koga e1 and koga s2 which are located in the japan east sea and on the southeast coast of the korean peninsula respectively the developed formulas are validated by comparing with the wave measurements around the korean peninsula the formulas are shown to concur well with the measurements even in the yellow sea where the tide is very strong to examine the applicability of the formulas in a wave hindcasting model numerical simulation has been performed for wind wave generation around the korean peninsula the maximum wave height and period have been calculated using the wave parameters computed in the numerical simulation the calculated maximum wave height and period are then compared with the measurements to show that the developed formulas can be used for long term prediction of the maximum wave height and period in a numerical wave hindcasting model this comparison shows that the predicted maximum wave height and period agree well with the measured ones graphical abstract image 10768 keywords wave height wave period peakedness parameter japan east sea yellow sea wave hindcasting 1 introduction long term wave data is required for the coastal structure design or the coastal zone management it is desirable to obtain the long term data by field measurements if field measurement data are not available wave hindcasting is often performed using the meteorological data which has an additional advantage of providing higher resolution data than field measurements for the wave hindcasting a spectral wave model is implemented which provides wave spectral parameters such as the significant wave height h m 0 and peak wave period t p the significant wave height is commonly used in the design of coastal structures for structures of brittle failure such as offshore structures or vertical breakwaters however the maximum wave height is frequently used nevertheless the maximum wave height cannot be provided by the wave hindcasting because it is given by the zero crossing analysis for this reason several studies have been carried out to estimate the maximum wave height with spectral wave parameters for the design of vertical breakwaters goda 2010 proposed to use the maximum wave height given by h max 1 8 h 1 3 where h 1 3 is the significant wave height from the zero crossing analysis however h max is related to the number of individual waves n so that it is given by 1 h max h 1 3 ln n 2 assuming the rayleigh distribution of the wave height although the parameters in this formula are provided by the zero crossing analysis they can be replaced by the ones from the spectral analysis h 1 3 can be replaced by h m 0 and n can be calculated by dividing the wave record length t t o t a l by the mean wave period t m 01 m 0 m 1 where the n th moment of the wave spectrum is calculated by m n 0 f n s f d f with f frequency and s f spectral density therefore h max can be evaluated from the spectral analysis i e 2 h max h m 0 ln t t o t a l t m 01 2 on the other hand vandever et al 2008 found that h 1 3 h m 0 is linearly related to longuet higgins 1983 spectral bandwidth parameter ν by 3 h 1 3 h m 0 0 9875 0 1343 ν where ν is given as ν m 0 m 2 m 1 2 1 longuet higgins 1983 vandever et al 2008 proposed to use the following equation with the bandwidth correction to estimate the maximum wave height 4 h max 0 9875 0 1343 ν h m 0 ln t t o t a l t m 01 2 they showed that the errors were reduced to within 10 by using the bandwidth corrected significant wave height besides feng et al 2014 proposed a different formula in terms of h m 0 and n as follows 5 h max h m 0 ln n 1 555 1 7 h m 0 1 5 100 even though spectral shape parameters are not included in eq 5 the calculated maximum wave height was highly correlated with the measurement ahn et al 2013 showed that the spectral bandwidth parameter is weakly related to the significant wave height or the peak wave period in spite of the accuracy of the previous formulas it is difficult to use them in a numerical wave hindcasting model because the wave record length is not given in the model on the other hand mori and janssen 2006 showed that h max h m 0 monotonically increases with the wave kurtosis μ 4 when the length of the wave observation was fixed the wave kurtosis is expressed as a function of bfi benjamin feir index 6 μ 4 π 3 bfi 2 3 where bfi ε 2 ν ε k 0 m 0 1 2 is the wave steepness parameter and k 0 is the deep water wave number at the spectral peak feng et al 2014 found that the linear regression of h max h m 0 with μ 4 is h max h m 0 0 49 0 01 μ 4 we use this relationship later to calculate h max in table 2 using the mori and janssen 2006 formula since all the parameters in eq 6 can be calculated from a wave spectrum it can be used to calculate the maximum wave height in a numerical wave hindcasting model mori et al 2014 showed that the maximum wave heights calculated in a wave hindcasting model well agree with the measurements meanwhile it is also required to estimate the maximum wave period t max corresponding to h max studies of the maximum wave period are seldom probably because the wave period varies only a little for the waves of large height goda 2010 proposed to use 7 t max t 1 3 1 2 t where t 1 3 and t denote the significant wave period and mean wave period respectively because t 1 3 is calculated by the zero crossing analysis t max 1 2 t should be used if a spectral analysis is used where t can be replaced by t m 02 m 0 m 2 under the assumption of the narrow banded process chun and suh 2018 showed that the significant to mean wave period ratio is nearly constant but the significant wave period is more accurately calculated in terms of t m 1 0 and goda 1970 peakedness parameter q p which is given by q p 2 m 0 2 0 f s 2 f d f therefore the formula for t max will be developed in terms of h m 0 t m 1 0 and q p in the present study in this study the formulas for h max and t max are developed in terms of the parameters which can be obtained from a wave spectrum so that they can also be used to predict h max and t max in a numerical wave hindcasting model the formulas are developed by applying the least square method to the wave measurement data in the japan east sea jes and on the southeast coast of the korean peninsula the formulas are validated by comparing against the wave data measured at several locations around the korean peninsula the formulas are then used for long term prediction of the maximum wave height and period in a numerical wave hindcasting model which are compared with available measurement data in the model domain this study is an extension of chun and suh 2018 but it differs in that it estimates the maximum not significant wave height and period and that the numerical wave hindcasting model covers not only the jes but also the yellow sea ys where the tide is very strong compared with the jes therefore the developed formulas can be used in areas of strong tide action as well 1 1 formulas for maximum wave height and period the formulas for h max and t max were developed by analyzing the wave measurement data at koga e1 and koga s2 whose locations and descriptions are given in fig 1 and table 1 respectively first the wave parameters were estimated by applying the zero crossing analysis and fft fast fourier transform to the measured wave data then the least square method was used to express h max in terms of the spectral wave parameters such as h m 0 t m 1 0 and q p 8 h max 1 65 h m 0 t m 1 0 0 04 q p 1 0 03 sorensen 1993 stated that q p is about 2 for wind waves and greater than 2 for swell according to eq 8 q p makes the maximum wave height of swell greater than that of wind waves for a given significant wave height however the mean wave period of swell longer than wind waves cancels out the effect of q p in eq 8 as a result h max h m 0 remains constant as 1 5 1 6 for both swell and wind waves on the other hand h max h 1 3 is about 1 6 1 7 which is a little smaller than the common value of 1 8 used in coastal engineering goda 2010 to validate eq 8 a comparison was made between measurement and prediction at koga e1 koga s2 koga w1 hupo sokcho and gyeokpo as shown in fig 2 among them the wave measurement data at koga e1 and koga s2 were already used to develop eq 8 therefore the comparison must be favorable to these stations nevertheless these stations are included to see the difference in accuracy from other stations which were not used in the development of the formula it is shown that eq 8 well agrees with the measurement at other locations of quite different environment indicating that eq 8 can be generally used even though it was developed with the wave data at a few locations particularly koga w1 and gyeokpo are located in the ys where the tide is very strong the wave data at sokcho hupo and gyeokpo were collected in the coastal areas where the water depths were about 20 m a more quantitative comparison is given in table 2 in terms of bias root mean square error rmse scatter index si pearson s correlation coefficient r and willmott 1981 index of agreement the bias rmse si and r are described in pilar et al 2008 the negative value of the bias indicates the over prediction because the bias is estimated by subtracting the prediction from the measurement the pearson s correlation coefficient represents the linear relationship between measurement and prediction while the index of agreement measures the degree to which the formula s prediction agrees with the measurement shih et al 2018 stated that the index of agreement between 0 65 and 1 0 indicates an excellent performance furthermore the ranges of very good performance and good performance are 0 5 0 65 and 0 2 0 5 respectively table 2 shows that the maximum wave heights are slightly over predicted the average rmse is 13 3 cm the pearson s correlation coefficient and index of agreement are close to 1 0 indicating excellent performance of the formula just for comparison h max was also estimated by mori and janssen 2006 formula whose accuracy is presented in table 2 it is shown that the accuracies of the two formulas are almost the same however mori and janssen 2006 formula under predicts the measurement and its rmse is larger than that of the present formula except at gyeokpo the larger rmse at gyeokpo might result from the different method of wave measurement the wave measurement at gyeokpo was made by measuring the water surface displacement which includes the tidal effect the process for removing the tidal effect acted like a high pass filter which caused a narrower bandwidth of the wave spectrum and a larger q p which in turn increased the error however the correlation coefficient and index of agreement of both formulas are similar to each other table 2 this indicates that the performance of eq 8 might deteriorate when the tide is included in the measurement the formula for the maximum wave period t max was also developed in terms of h m 0 t m 1 0 and q p using the least square method as follows 9 t max 0 68 h m 0 0 02 t m 1 0 1 23 q p 1 0 01 as mentioned earlier the peakedness parameter q p increases as the waves change from wind waves to swell as t max is inversely proportional to q p a shorter t max is likely to appear for a greater q p however the maximum wave period of swell is always longer than that of wind waves because the mean wave period of swell is longer than that of wind waves and t max is much more sensitive to t m 1 0 than to q p as shown in eq 9 fig 3 compares the estimated maximum wave period against the measurement more scattering is observed than the maximum wave height shown in fig 2 it is also shown that eq 9 underestimates the maximum wave period in the range of about 5 10 s except at gyeokpo a more quantitative comparison is given in table 3 the average bias is 0 03 s again indicating that eq 9 underestimates the maximum wave period the average si of the maximum wave period is greater by 0 03 than that of the maximum wave height it might be because the determination of the zero level in the zero crossing analysis is influenced by the small waves accompanied by the maximum wave the small waves in a random wave field separate a large wave into several waves the average pearson s correlation coefficient and index of agreement are 0 92 and 0 96 respectively these values are smaller than those for the maximum wave height but they still indicate excellent performance of the formula according to shih et al 2018 criteria the accuracy of goda 2010 formula t max 1 2 t m 02 is compared with the present formula in table 3 the average rmse of the former is larger by 0 31 s than the latter accordingly the average pearson s correlation coefficient and index of agreement are smaller than 0 9 to see the performance of the present formulas comparisons were made in fig 4 with the wave measurements at several locations in the jes in december 2013 when the highest wave height of the measurements appeared in general the predicted wave height and period follow well the measured values even though a greater disagreement is observed for the wave period than the wave height it is also observed that the measured values fluctuate more than the predicted values the measured maximum wave period is one of wave periods from the zero crossing analysis while the other is given by the wave spectral parameters the average si s of the maximum wave height and period are 0 11 and 0 13 respectively being greater than those in tables 2 and 3 the rmse s of the maximum wave height and period at the locations are 31 3 49 6 cm and 1 1 1 47 s respectively the average pearson s correlation coefficients of the maximum wave height and period are 0 96 and 0 80 respectively and the average indices of agreement are 0 96 and 0 87 respectively indicating good agreements between the prediction and the measurement 2 application of the formulas in a wave hindcasting model 2 1 wave hindcasting model the wave hindcasting around the korean peninsula was conducted for ten years from 2005 to 2014 to examine the applicability of the present formulas the numerical model for the wave hindcasting was the same as that of chun and ahn 2017 which was developed by extending wamdi group 1988 wam model to shallow water since the numerical model was extended to shallow water it could be applied to the wave prediction in coastal areas although a large spatial grid was used its governing equation is as follows 10 f t c λ f λ 1 cos φ cos φ c φ f φ ω r c ω r f ω r c θ f θ s where f λ φ ω r θ is the wave energy density λ and φ denote the longitude and latitude respectively and ω r is the relative frequency here the relative frequency is given as ω r 2 g k tanh k h with the wave number k and the local water depth h θ is the wave direction measured clockwise from the north c λ c φ c ω r and c θ are the group velocities in each space in eq 10 s represents the wave generation and dissipation as follows 11 s s i n s d s s n l 3 s n l 4 s b r s b f where s i n is the wave generation by the wind s d s is the white capping dissipation s n l 3 and s n l 4 denote the triad and quadruplet wave wave interaction terms respectively s b r is the wave breaking dissipation and s b f is the bottom friction dissipation following booij et al 1999 battjes and janssen 1978 s b r and elderberky and battjes 1995 s n l 3 were incorporated into the numerical model other terms in eq 11 were adapted from wam cycle 4 in particular komen et al 1994 coefficients for s d s were used as follows 12 s d s c d s ω r k 2 m 0 2 1 δ k k δ k k 2 f where ω r and k are the first order moments of wave spectrum over the relative frequency and wave number respectively and c d s and δ are given as 4 5 and 0 5 the computational domain of the present study is however different from that of chun and ahn 2017 in that the ys was included in the model domain see fig 1 in addition to this both tidal elevation and tidal current were taken into account in the present model to include the effect of the strong tide in the ys the tides and tidal currents were generated using the harmonic constituents provided by matsumoto et al 2000 the wave propagation velocities in the spatial and wave spectral grids were updated along with the water depth changed by the tidal elevation wave refraction and the shift in the relative frequency due to tidal currents were also taken into account tolman 1988 other parameters of the present numerical simulation are the same as those of chun and ahn 2017 the water depths were obtained from 5 min etopo5 data provided by the national centers for environmental information a wave spectrum was divided into 25 frequencies and 48 directional bins following phadke et al 2003 the time increment was 20 min and the spatial grid size was 1 12 the maximum courant numbers for the longitude latitude wave direction and the relative frequency were 5 4 4 4 21 4 and 2 4 respectively for the generation of the wind waves the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf reanalysis was employed to calculate the wind field although the wind field was given every 6 h the extreme waves in the jes by the moving storm such as a typhoon were well predicted chun and ahn 2017 hatada and yamaguchi 1998 of the previous studies hatada and yamaguchi 1998 reproduced the low swell on the pacific coast of japan which were also observed on the west and south coasts of the korean peninsula during the summer 2 2 validation of wave hindcasting model after carrying out the wave hindcasting the calculated significant wave height and period were compared with the measurements in the locations shown in fig 1 see table 4 table 4 shows that the significant wave heights are overestimated on the whole the average rmse si and r of the significant wave height are almost the same as those in chun and ahn 2017 the average index of agreement is 0 94 indicating excellent performance of the model the present model calculates both the peak wave period and mean wave period whereas only the significant wave period was measured in several locations for comparison with the measurements the significant wave period was estimated using chun and suh 2018 formula t s 0 76 t m 1 0 1 11 the results are also given in table 4 the accuracy of the present model result is comparable to that in chun and ahn 2017 except at koga s2 koga w1 and gyeokpo which are located on the south coast of the korean peninsula or in the ys see fig 1 sometimes southerly swells out of the computational domain propagate into these areas which were not correctly calculated by the numerical model because the southern boundary of the model did not cover the philippine sea where the swells were generated this also caused the underestimation of t s i e positive bias in koga w1 and gyeokpo if the numerical model covered the philippine sea the model accuracy in the ys must be improved however since the swell is only observed in summer and its height is small chun and ahn 2018 hatada and yamaguchi 1998 the model domain was not extended to the philippine sea for more efficient computation 2 3 estimation of maximum wave height and period in wave hindcasting model a long term prediction of h max and t max was made by applying eqs 8 and 9 to the result of the wave hindcasting the predicted h max and t max are compared with the measurements in fig 5 and table 5 the average bias of the maximum wave height is 8 08 cm indicating that the maximum wave height was overestimated there are two reasons for the overestimation first the numerical model overestimated the significant wave height see table 4 second eq 8 also over predicted the maximum wave height see table 2 the average rmse of the maximum wave height is 55 46 cm which is larger than that between eq 8 and the measured maximum wave height see table 2 and that between the computed and measured significant wave heights see table 4 the numerical error of the wave hindcasting model is added to the error of eq 8 itself so that the error of eq 8 becomes larger when h max is predicted using the wave hindcasting model result accordingly the average pearson s correlation coefficient and index of agreement for h max in table 5 are smaller than those in table 2 the average bias and rmse of the maximum wave period are 0 16 s and 1 13 s respectively which are greater than those of the significant wave period see tables 4 and 5 accordingly the average pearson s correlation coefficient and index of agreement are 0 76 and 0 86 respectively which are smaller than those of the significant wave period the pearson s correlation coefficient of the maximum wave period is the smallest at koga w1 as also shown in table 4 this result was because the southerly swell was not considered in the present numerical model due to the limitation of the computational domain finally the maximum wave height and period estimated in the wave hindcasting model were compared with the measurement during a storm the storm in february 2008 generated high waves in the entire area of the jes several people were killed by the high waves at gangneung port which is located on the east coast of the korean peninsula however measurement data for the maximum wave height and period are not available on the east coast of the korean peninsula during the storm therefore comparisons were made against the wave measurements at niigata and hamada which are located on the west coast of japan see fig 1 fig 6 shows that the calculated h max and t max agree well with the measurements even though the wave data was missing at niigata during the peak of the storm again the measured values fluctuate more than the predicted values like the comparison between the measurement and the direct use of eq 8 or 9 shown in fig 4 similarly the predicted h max and t max at koga w1 were compared with the measurement during a typhoon in fig 7 there are overall agreements between the predicted maximum wave heights and the measured ones in contrast the predicted maximum wave periods concur well with the measurements during the peak of the typhoon but a large disagreement is observed both before and after the peak of the typhoon the disagreement might be again because the southerly swell generated in the philippine sea was not correctly calculated by the numerical wave hindcasting model 3 conclusion the formulas to calculate h max and t max were developed in terms of such spectral parameters as h m 0 t m 1 0 and q p by applying the least square method to the wave measurements at koga e1 and koga s2 the developed formulas were validated by comparing with the wave measurements at other locations around the korean peninsula the formulas were proven to well predict the maximum wave height and period even at the locations in the ys where the strong tide is observed or at the locations near the coast where the water depth is relatively small implying that the formulas are quite versatile regardless of hydrodynamic environment nevertheless further validation of the formulas may be necessary in other fetch limited seas e g north sea than the jes or ys around the korean peninsula the present formulas were also compared with the previous formulas which use the spectral wave parameters the present formula for the maximum wave height was shown to have essentially the same accuracy as the mori and janssen 2006 formula the present formula for the maximum wave period was shown to be more accurate than the goda 2010 simple formula finally to examine the applicability of the present formulas in numerical wave hindcasting models wave hindcasting was carried out for the seas around the korean peninsula including not only the jes but also the ys where the tide is very strong the results of the numerical simulation were used to calculate h max and t max by applying the present formulas which were then compared with the measured h max and t max even though thus calculated i e by applying the formulas to the wave hindcasting result h max and t max were less accurate than those directly calculated using the measured spectral parameters the developed formulas were shown to predict h max and t max reasonably well in a wave hindcasting model it was shown that the maximum wave period was less accurately predicted than the maximum wave height using the formulas especially the maximum wave period was underestimated in the ys where southerly swells generated in the philippine sea were propagated into but they were not correctly calculated by the numerical model because the model domain did not cover the philippine sea therefore caution should be used if the numerical wave model domain does not cover the large open oceans where swells are generated 
22346,this paper presents empirical formulas for calculating the maximum wave height and period in a numerical wave hindcasting model in terms of significant wave height mean wave period and peakedness parameter the formulas are developed by applying the least square method to the wave data measured at koga e1 and koga s2 which are located in the japan east sea and on the southeast coast of the korean peninsula respectively the developed formulas are validated by comparing with the wave measurements around the korean peninsula the formulas are shown to concur well with the measurements even in the yellow sea where the tide is very strong to examine the applicability of the formulas in a wave hindcasting model numerical simulation has been performed for wind wave generation around the korean peninsula the maximum wave height and period have been calculated using the wave parameters computed in the numerical simulation the calculated maximum wave height and period are then compared with the measurements to show that the developed formulas can be used for long term prediction of the maximum wave height and period in a numerical wave hindcasting model this comparison shows that the predicted maximum wave height and period agree well with the measured ones graphical abstract image 10768 keywords wave height wave period peakedness parameter japan east sea yellow sea wave hindcasting 1 introduction long term wave data is required for the coastal structure design or the coastal zone management it is desirable to obtain the long term data by field measurements if field measurement data are not available wave hindcasting is often performed using the meteorological data which has an additional advantage of providing higher resolution data than field measurements for the wave hindcasting a spectral wave model is implemented which provides wave spectral parameters such as the significant wave height h m 0 and peak wave period t p the significant wave height is commonly used in the design of coastal structures for structures of brittle failure such as offshore structures or vertical breakwaters however the maximum wave height is frequently used nevertheless the maximum wave height cannot be provided by the wave hindcasting because it is given by the zero crossing analysis for this reason several studies have been carried out to estimate the maximum wave height with spectral wave parameters for the design of vertical breakwaters goda 2010 proposed to use the maximum wave height given by h max 1 8 h 1 3 where h 1 3 is the significant wave height from the zero crossing analysis however h max is related to the number of individual waves n so that it is given by 1 h max h 1 3 ln n 2 assuming the rayleigh distribution of the wave height although the parameters in this formula are provided by the zero crossing analysis they can be replaced by the ones from the spectral analysis h 1 3 can be replaced by h m 0 and n can be calculated by dividing the wave record length t t o t a l by the mean wave period t m 01 m 0 m 1 where the n th moment of the wave spectrum is calculated by m n 0 f n s f d f with f frequency and s f spectral density therefore h max can be evaluated from the spectral analysis i e 2 h max h m 0 ln t t o t a l t m 01 2 on the other hand vandever et al 2008 found that h 1 3 h m 0 is linearly related to longuet higgins 1983 spectral bandwidth parameter ν by 3 h 1 3 h m 0 0 9875 0 1343 ν where ν is given as ν m 0 m 2 m 1 2 1 longuet higgins 1983 vandever et al 2008 proposed to use the following equation with the bandwidth correction to estimate the maximum wave height 4 h max 0 9875 0 1343 ν h m 0 ln t t o t a l t m 01 2 they showed that the errors were reduced to within 10 by using the bandwidth corrected significant wave height besides feng et al 2014 proposed a different formula in terms of h m 0 and n as follows 5 h max h m 0 ln n 1 555 1 7 h m 0 1 5 100 even though spectral shape parameters are not included in eq 5 the calculated maximum wave height was highly correlated with the measurement ahn et al 2013 showed that the spectral bandwidth parameter is weakly related to the significant wave height or the peak wave period in spite of the accuracy of the previous formulas it is difficult to use them in a numerical wave hindcasting model because the wave record length is not given in the model on the other hand mori and janssen 2006 showed that h max h m 0 monotonically increases with the wave kurtosis μ 4 when the length of the wave observation was fixed the wave kurtosis is expressed as a function of bfi benjamin feir index 6 μ 4 π 3 bfi 2 3 where bfi ε 2 ν ε k 0 m 0 1 2 is the wave steepness parameter and k 0 is the deep water wave number at the spectral peak feng et al 2014 found that the linear regression of h max h m 0 with μ 4 is h max h m 0 0 49 0 01 μ 4 we use this relationship later to calculate h max in table 2 using the mori and janssen 2006 formula since all the parameters in eq 6 can be calculated from a wave spectrum it can be used to calculate the maximum wave height in a numerical wave hindcasting model mori et al 2014 showed that the maximum wave heights calculated in a wave hindcasting model well agree with the measurements meanwhile it is also required to estimate the maximum wave period t max corresponding to h max studies of the maximum wave period are seldom probably because the wave period varies only a little for the waves of large height goda 2010 proposed to use 7 t max t 1 3 1 2 t where t 1 3 and t denote the significant wave period and mean wave period respectively because t 1 3 is calculated by the zero crossing analysis t max 1 2 t should be used if a spectral analysis is used where t can be replaced by t m 02 m 0 m 2 under the assumption of the narrow banded process chun and suh 2018 showed that the significant to mean wave period ratio is nearly constant but the significant wave period is more accurately calculated in terms of t m 1 0 and goda 1970 peakedness parameter q p which is given by q p 2 m 0 2 0 f s 2 f d f therefore the formula for t max will be developed in terms of h m 0 t m 1 0 and q p in the present study in this study the formulas for h max and t max are developed in terms of the parameters which can be obtained from a wave spectrum so that they can also be used to predict h max and t max in a numerical wave hindcasting model the formulas are developed by applying the least square method to the wave measurement data in the japan east sea jes and on the southeast coast of the korean peninsula the formulas are validated by comparing against the wave data measured at several locations around the korean peninsula the formulas are then used for long term prediction of the maximum wave height and period in a numerical wave hindcasting model which are compared with available measurement data in the model domain this study is an extension of chun and suh 2018 but it differs in that it estimates the maximum not significant wave height and period and that the numerical wave hindcasting model covers not only the jes but also the yellow sea ys where the tide is very strong compared with the jes therefore the developed formulas can be used in areas of strong tide action as well 1 1 formulas for maximum wave height and period the formulas for h max and t max were developed by analyzing the wave measurement data at koga e1 and koga s2 whose locations and descriptions are given in fig 1 and table 1 respectively first the wave parameters were estimated by applying the zero crossing analysis and fft fast fourier transform to the measured wave data then the least square method was used to express h max in terms of the spectral wave parameters such as h m 0 t m 1 0 and q p 8 h max 1 65 h m 0 t m 1 0 0 04 q p 1 0 03 sorensen 1993 stated that q p is about 2 for wind waves and greater than 2 for swell according to eq 8 q p makes the maximum wave height of swell greater than that of wind waves for a given significant wave height however the mean wave period of swell longer than wind waves cancels out the effect of q p in eq 8 as a result h max h m 0 remains constant as 1 5 1 6 for both swell and wind waves on the other hand h max h 1 3 is about 1 6 1 7 which is a little smaller than the common value of 1 8 used in coastal engineering goda 2010 to validate eq 8 a comparison was made between measurement and prediction at koga e1 koga s2 koga w1 hupo sokcho and gyeokpo as shown in fig 2 among them the wave measurement data at koga e1 and koga s2 were already used to develop eq 8 therefore the comparison must be favorable to these stations nevertheless these stations are included to see the difference in accuracy from other stations which were not used in the development of the formula it is shown that eq 8 well agrees with the measurement at other locations of quite different environment indicating that eq 8 can be generally used even though it was developed with the wave data at a few locations particularly koga w1 and gyeokpo are located in the ys where the tide is very strong the wave data at sokcho hupo and gyeokpo were collected in the coastal areas where the water depths were about 20 m a more quantitative comparison is given in table 2 in terms of bias root mean square error rmse scatter index si pearson s correlation coefficient r and willmott 1981 index of agreement the bias rmse si and r are described in pilar et al 2008 the negative value of the bias indicates the over prediction because the bias is estimated by subtracting the prediction from the measurement the pearson s correlation coefficient represents the linear relationship between measurement and prediction while the index of agreement measures the degree to which the formula s prediction agrees with the measurement shih et al 2018 stated that the index of agreement between 0 65 and 1 0 indicates an excellent performance furthermore the ranges of very good performance and good performance are 0 5 0 65 and 0 2 0 5 respectively table 2 shows that the maximum wave heights are slightly over predicted the average rmse is 13 3 cm the pearson s correlation coefficient and index of agreement are close to 1 0 indicating excellent performance of the formula just for comparison h max was also estimated by mori and janssen 2006 formula whose accuracy is presented in table 2 it is shown that the accuracies of the two formulas are almost the same however mori and janssen 2006 formula under predicts the measurement and its rmse is larger than that of the present formula except at gyeokpo the larger rmse at gyeokpo might result from the different method of wave measurement the wave measurement at gyeokpo was made by measuring the water surface displacement which includes the tidal effect the process for removing the tidal effect acted like a high pass filter which caused a narrower bandwidth of the wave spectrum and a larger q p which in turn increased the error however the correlation coefficient and index of agreement of both formulas are similar to each other table 2 this indicates that the performance of eq 8 might deteriorate when the tide is included in the measurement the formula for the maximum wave period t max was also developed in terms of h m 0 t m 1 0 and q p using the least square method as follows 9 t max 0 68 h m 0 0 02 t m 1 0 1 23 q p 1 0 01 as mentioned earlier the peakedness parameter q p increases as the waves change from wind waves to swell as t max is inversely proportional to q p a shorter t max is likely to appear for a greater q p however the maximum wave period of swell is always longer than that of wind waves because the mean wave period of swell is longer than that of wind waves and t max is much more sensitive to t m 1 0 than to q p as shown in eq 9 fig 3 compares the estimated maximum wave period against the measurement more scattering is observed than the maximum wave height shown in fig 2 it is also shown that eq 9 underestimates the maximum wave period in the range of about 5 10 s except at gyeokpo a more quantitative comparison is given in table 3 the average bias is 0 03 s again indicating that eq 9 underestimates the maximum wave period the average si of the maximum wave period is greater by 0 03 than that of the maximum wave height it might be because the determination of the zero level in the zero crossing analysis is influenced by the small waves accompanied by the maximum wave the small waves in a random wave field separate a large wave into several waves the average pearson s correlation coefficient and index of agreement are 0 92 and 0 96 respectively these values are smaller than those for the maximum wave height but they still indicate excellent performance of the formula according to shih et al 2018 criteria the accuracy of goda 2010 formula t max 1 2 t m 02 is compared with the present formula in table 3 the average rmse of the former is larger by 0 31 s than the latter accordingly the average pearson s correlation coefficient and index of agreement are smaller than 0 9 to see the performance of the present formulas comparisons were made in fig 4 with the wave measurements at several locations in the jes in december 2013 when the highest wave height of the measurements appeared in general the predicted wave height and period follow well the measured values even though a greater disagreement is observed for the wave period than the wave height it is also observed that the measured values fluctuate more than the predicted values the measured maximum wave period is one of wave periods from the zero crossing analysis while the other is given by the wave spectral parameters the average si s of the maximum wave height and period are 0 11 and 0 13 respectively being greater than those in tables 2 and 3 the rmse s of the maximum wave height and period at the locations are 31 3 49 6 cm and 1 1 1 47 s respectively the average pearson s correlation coefficients of the maximum wave height and period are 0 96 and 0 80 respectively and the average indices of agreement are 0 96 and 0 87 respectively indicating good agreements between the prediction and the measurement 2 application of the formulas in a wave hindcasting model 2 1 wave hindcasting model the wave hindcasting around the korean peninsula was conducted for ten years from 2005 to 2014 to examine the applicability of the present formulas the numerical model for the wave hindcasting was the same as that of chun and ahn 2017 which was developed by extending wamdi group 1988 wam model to shallow water since the numerical model was extended to shallow water it could be applied to the wave prediction in coastal areas although a large spatial grid was used its governing equation is as follows 10 f t c λ f λ 1 cos φ cos φ c φ f φ ω r c ω r f ω r c θ f θ s where f λ φ ω r θ is the wave energy density λ and φ denote the longitude and latitude respectively and ω r is the relative frequency here the relative frequency is given as ω r 2 g k tanh k h with the wave number k and the local water depth h θ is the wave direction measured clockwise from the north c λ c φ c ω r and c θ are the group velocities in each space in eq 10 s represents the wave generation and dissipation as follows 11 s s i n s d s s n l 3 s n l 4 s b r s b f where s i n is the wave generation by the wind s d s is the white capping dissipation s n l 3 and s n l 4 denote the triad and quadruplet wave wave interaction terms respectively s b r is the wave breaking dissipation and s b f is the bottom friction dissipation following booij et al 1999 battjes and janssen 1978 s b r and elderberky and battjes 1995 s n l 3 were incorporated into the numerical model other terms in eq 11 were adapted from wam cycle 4 in particular komen et al 1994 coefficients for s d s were used as follows 12 s d s c d s ω r k 2 m 0 2 1 δ k k δ k k 2 f where ω r and k are the first order moments of wave spectrum over the relative frequency and wave number respectively and c d s and δ are given as 4 5 and 0 5 the computational domain of the present study is however different from that of chun and ahn 2017 in that the ys was included in the model domain see fig 1 in addition to this both tidal elevation and tidal current were taken into account in the present model to include the effect of the strong tide in the ys the tides and tidal currents were generated using the harmonic constituents provided by matsumoto et al 2000 the wave propagation velocities in the spatial and wave spectral grids were updated along with the water depth changed by the tidal elevation wave refraction and the shift in the relative frequency due to tidal currents were also taken into account tolman 1988 other parameters of the present numerical simulation are the same as those of chun and ahn 2017 the water depths were obtained from 5 min etopo5 data provided by the national centers for environmental information a wave spectrum was divided into 25 frequencies and 48 directional bins following phadke et al 2003 the time increment was 20 min and the spatial grid size was 1 12 the maximum courant numbers for the longitude latitude wave direction and the relative frequency were 5 4 4 4 21 4 and 2 4 respectively for the generation of the wind waves the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf reanalysis was employed to calculate the wind field although the wind field was given every 6 h the extreme waves in the jes by the moving storm such as a typhoon were well predicted chun and ahn 2017 hatada and yamaguchi 1998 of the previous studies hatada and yamaguchi 1998 reproduced the low swell on the pacific coast of japan which were also observed on the west and south coasts of the korean peninsula during the summer 2 2 validation of wave hindcasting model after carrying out the wave hindcasting the calculated significant wave height and period were compared with the measurements in the locations shown in fig 1 see table 4 table 4 shows that the significant wave heights are overestimated on the whole the average rmse si and r of the significant wave height are almost the same as those in chun and ahn 2017 the average index of agreement is 0 94 indicating excellent performance of the model the present model calculates both the peak wave period and mean wave period whereas only the significant wave period was measured in several locations for comparison with the measurements the significant wave period was estimated using chun and suh 2018 formula t s 0 76 t m 1 0 1 11 the results are also given in table 4 the accuracy of the present model result is comparable to that in chun and ahn 2017 except at koga s2 koga w1 and gyeokpo which are located on the south coast of the korean peninsula or in the ys see fig 1 sometimes southerly swells out of the computational domain propagate into these areas which were not correctly calculated by the numerical model because the southern boundary of the model did not cover the philippine sea where the swells were generated this also caused the underestimation of t s i e positive bias in koga w1 and gyeokpo if the numerical model covered the philippine sea the model accuracy in the ys must be improved however since the swell is only observed in summer and its height is small chun and ahn 2018 hatada and yamaguchi 1998 the model domain was not extended to the philippine sea for more efficient computation 2 3 estimation of maximum wave height and period in wave hindcasting model a long term prediction of h max and t max was made by applying eqs 8 and 9 to the result of the wave hindcasting the predicted h max and t max are compared with the measurements in fig 5 and table 5 the average bias of the maximum wave height is 8 08 cm indicating that the maximum wave height was overestimated there are two reasons for the overestimation first the numerical model overestimated the significant wave height see table 4 second eq 8 also over predicted the maximum wave height see table 2 the average rmse of the maximum wave height is 55 46 cm which is larger than that between eq 8 and the measured maximum wave height see table 2 and that between the computed and measured significant wave heights see table 4 the numerical error of the wave hindcasting model is added to the error of eq 8 itself so that the error of eq 8 becomes larger when h max is predicted using the wave hindcasting model result accordingly the average pearson s correlation coefficient and index of agreement for h max in table 5 are smaller than those in table 2 the average bias and rmse of the maximum wave period are 0 16 s and 1 13 s respectively which are greater than those of the significant wave period see tables 4 and 5 accordingly the average pearson s correlation coefficient and index of agreement are 0 76 and 0 86 respectively which are smaller than those of the significant wave period the pearson s correlation coefficient of the maximum wave period is the smallest at koga w1 as also shown in table 4 this result was because the southerly swell was not considered in the present numerical model due to the limitation of the computational domain finally the maximum wave height and period estimated in the wave hindcasting model were compared with the measurement during a storm the storm in february 2008 generated high waves in the entire area of the jes several people were killed by the high waves at gangneung port which is located on the east coast of the korean peninsula however measurement data for the maximum wave height and period are not available on the east coast of the korean peninsula during the storm therefore comparisons were made against the wave measurements at niigata and hamada which are located on the west coast of japan see fig 1 fig 6 shows that the calculated h max and t max agree well with the measurements even though the wave data was missing at niigata during the peak of the storm again the measured values fluctuate more than the predicted values like the comparison between the measurement and the direct use of eq 8 or 9 shown in fig 4 similarly the predicted h max and t max at koga w1 were compared with the measurement during a typhoon in fig 7 there are overall agreements between the predicted maximum wave heights and the measured ones in contrast the predicted maximum wave periods concur well with the measurements during the peak of the typhoon but a large disagreement is observed both before and after the peak of the typhoon the disagreement might be again because the southerly swell generated in the philippine sea was not correctly calculated by the numerical wave hindcasting model 3 conclusion the formulas to calculate h max and t max were developed in terms of such spectral parameters as h m 0 t m 1 0 and q p by applying the least square method to the wave measurements at koga e1 and koga s2 the developed formulas were validated by comparing with the wave measurements at other locations around the korean peninsula the formulas were proven to well predict the maximum wave height and period even at the locations in the ys where the strong tide is observed or at the locations near the coast where the water depth is relatively small implying that the formulas are quite versatile regardless of hydrodynamic environment nevertheless further validation of the formulas may be necessary in other fetch limited seas e g north sea than the jes or ys around the korean peninsula the present formulas were also compared with the previous formulas which use the spectral wave parameters the present formula for the maximum wave height was shown to have essentially the same accuracy as the mori and janssen 2006 formula the present formula for the maximum wave period was shown to be more accurate than the goda 2010 simple formula finally to examine the applicability of the present formulas in numerical wave hindcasting models wave hindcasting was carried out for the seas around the korean peninsula including not only the jes but also the ys where the tide is very strong the results of the numerical simulation were used to calculate h max and t max by applying the present formulas which were then compared with the measured h max and t max even though thus

formulas especially the maximum wave period was underestimated in the ys where southerly swells generated in the philippine sea were propagated into but they were not correctly calculated by the numerical model because the model domain did not cover the philippine sea therefore caution should be used if the numerical wave model domain does not cover the large open oceans where swells are generated 
22347,a model for oblique wave scattering by an asymmetric trench beneath a large floating ice sheet is studied using linearized water wave theory eigenfunction expansion method have been used to calculate the velocity potential explicitly for the associated boundary value problem using condition along the boundaries of the trench a set of integral equations are formed the solutions of the integral equations are obtained by using multi term galerkin approximations with suitably chosen basis functions involving ultraspherical gegenbauer polynomials analytic solution for the reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained and analyzed numerically for a number of figures the role of thin ice sheet on wave scattering in marginal ice zone is studied by analyzing the reflection and transmission coefficients for a set of parameters such as flexural rigidity of ice angle of incidence depth and width of the asymmetric trench we observe that wave reflection decreases in an oscillatory manner with the increase in the dimensionless flexural rigidity parameter the correctness of the present method is confirmed by comparing the results available in the literatures the problem here is to understand how the flexural gravity waves propagate over an asymmetric submarine trench in such an ice field keywords wave scattering asymmetric trench thin ice cover galerkin s method reflection and transmission coefficients 1 introduction in the last few decades there is significant studies on wave structure interaction problem in a fluid which is covered by an ice sheet the incident ocean waves are reflected partially depends highly on thickness of the ice cover and the wave period moreover the amount of reflection and transmission also depends on the young s modulus and poisson s ratio of the ice sheet which is being modeled as an elastic plate studies on wave propagation through marginal ice zone miz in the polar regions are crucial since the transmitted wave may cause fracture of large floes and shore fast ice fox and squire 1990 studied the reflection and transmission coefficients at the edge of shore fast sea ice in which the ice sheet is modeled as an thin elastic sheet analysis on reflection and transmission of obliquely incident ocean waves at the edge of an ice sheet of different thickness done by fox and squire 1994 a similar study can be found in the works of squire et al 1995 meylan and squire 1993 1996 meylan and masson 2006 evans and porter 2003 analyzed the oblique wave scattering by a narrow crack in ice sheets floating on water of finite depth using eigenfunction expansion method and green s function approach das and mandal 2006 investigated the effect of an ice cover on the scattering of obliquely incident waves by a long circular cylinder submerged in deep water vaughan and squire 2006 studied the propagation of ice coupled waves under an ice sheet of variable thickness using low order piecewise polynomials the expansion formulas for the velocity potential have been derived by manam et al 2006 using fourier sine transforms technique maiti and mandal 2010 used hypersingular integral equation method to calculate reflection and transmission coefficients associated with wave scattering by thin inclined semi infinite rigid barrier submerged in infinitely deep water covered by a thin uniform ice sheet a class of problems associated with the scattering of water waves by a rectangular trench have been investigated by many researchers an approach to the solution of such type of problems has typically been to construct solutions in each region with uniform constant depth in terms of eigenfunction expansion of the velocity potential moreover by matching the solutions along a common boundary which separate the regions result a set of linear integral equations that can be solved by iteration for suitable geometries examples of such studies can be found in chakraborty and mandal 2014 2015 earlier lassiter 1972 studied the two dimensional diffraction of surface waves by a submarine trench where the depths on two sides of the trench are constant but not necessarily equal using the variational approach in this work a conformal mapping algorithm following kreisel 1949 have been used to calculate the complex reflection coefficients for rectangular trench lee and ayer 1981 analyzed the effect of a symmetric rectangular trench on the propagation of periodic incident waves explicit solutions are obtained by dividing the fluid domain into two regions which are matched numerically along the mouth of the trench miles 1982 obtained results for normally and obliquely incident long waves in symmetric case however for obliquely incident waves reflection coefficients are calculated through a variational formulation kirby and dalrymple 1983 considered oblique wave diffraction by an asymmetric trench using linearized potential theory eigenfunction expansion of the velocity potentials are obtained for each sub region of constant depth which are then matched along vertical boundaries and solved numerically to get the reflection and transmission coefficients kirby et al 1987 extended their previous work by including the effects of currents flowing parallel to the trench boundary the scattering of normally incident waves by trenches and shoals of finite width with sloped transitions between the depth changes have been studied by bender and dean 2003 using three methods the step method the slope method and the numerical method among them the step method is valid in arbitrary water depth while the slope method and numerical method are applicable in the shallow water region jung et al 2008 developed the analytical solutions for the waves propagating over an asymmetric trench using power series technique two type of solutions are obtained first the long wave solution which is valid only for shallow water second the mild slope solution which is valid for both shallow and deep water depths kim et al 2015 studied the effects of scattered wave fields around the breakwater when the dredging trench exists at the offshore seabed by applying green s function based on the boundary integral approach recently roy et al 2017 studied the problem of obliquely incident wave propagation over an asymmetric trench and the reflection as well as transmission coefficients are calculated analogous to the previous problems kar et al 2018 2019 studied the scattering of gravity waves by multiple trenches using boundary element method the role of multiple trenches is assumed to be a novel problem in understanding of the potential excitation of resonant oscillations within the trenches their study indicates the occurrence of bragg resonance for wave propagation over multiple trenches in their second problem scattering of surface gravity wave by a floating dock in the presence of bottom undulation such as multiple trenches breakwaters or a combination of trenches and breakwaters this work shows that amplitude of bragg resonance diminishes for higher water depth in the case of multiple trenches the study of wave ice interaction has two aspects the physical effects of ice cover on the water waves and waves on an ice cover therefore it is worthy to study wave scattering phenomena in an ocean which is covered by a thin sheet of ice instead of a free surface in the present study we have extended the work of kirby and dalrymple 1983 by considering a fluid bounded above by a thin ice sheet the fluid domain is divided into three regions with uniform but unequal depths the eigenfunction expansion of the velocity potential in each region are derived following the method described by kanoria et al 1999 for the problem of water wave scattering by a thick barrier of rectangular cross section a set of integral equations are obtained for the corresponding unknown horizontal velocity components across the vertical line through the corner point of the trench the solutions of the integral equations are approximated using multi term galerkin approximations involving ultraspherical gegenbauer polynomials cf evans and fernyhough 1995 once the integral equations are solved the reflection and transmission coefficients can be obtained easily numerical results associated with wave scattering by an asymmetric trench are analyzed for a set of physical parameters 2 formulation of the problem we take three dimensional coordinate system with y axis is taken vertically downwards and x z plane is taken along the ice covered surface we consider an asymmetric trench of width l in an ocean which is covered by an infinite ice sheet of very small thickness d the fluid domain is divided into three regions r 1 x 0 0 y h 1 r 2 x l 0 y h 2 and r 3 0 x l 0 y h 3 fig 1 the fluid is assumed to be homogeneous inviscid and incompressible the motion in the fluid is assumed to be irrotational let a harmonically time dependent progressive wave be obliquely incident from negative infinity whose direction makes an angle θ with the x axis for an incident wave with wavelength λ we denote the wavenumber by k 0 1 2 π λ so that α 0 1 k 0 1

parameters such as flexural rigidity of the ice sheet incidence angle trench depth and trench width in the subsequent calculations we have used e 6 gpa ν 0 3 ρ w 1025 0 kg m 3 ρ i 922 5 kg m 3 and g 9 81 m s 2 as we are dealing with linearized water wave theory we assume d h 1 1 implying δ 1 so that the ice cover boundary condition can be applied on y 0 see evans and porter 2003 in the present paper we have considered an ice sheet with very small thickness i e d 0 and the corresponding value of the parameter δ is characterized by a very small constant value 0 001 to solve the linear system given in eq 44 numerically we choose n 4 in the following subsections several cases for asymmetric trenches i e h 1 h 2 are given 5 1 r 1 is deeper than r 2 i e h 1 h 2 for the fluid region in which the depth of r 1 is greater than the depth of r 2 can be described by taking h 2 h 1 1 in figs 2 5 the absolute values of reflection and transmission coefficients are depicted for various asymmetric trenches with h 2 h 1 0 8 in figs 2 a and 2 b r and t are plotted against k 0 1 h 1 for various values of d h 1 4 0 1 0 2 0 3 with h 3 h 1 3 l h 1 5 and θ π 4 from the figures it is clear that both of reflection and transmission coefficients are periodic in nature unlike the case of symmetric trenches the wave reflection vanishes only at k 0 1 h 1 0 in presence of asymmetric trench the transmission coefficients may assumes the value more than unity for smaller wave numbers it is also observed that transmission coefficient increases with an increase in flexural rigidity of the ice sheet and an opposite pattern is found in the case of r this is quite natural because the increasing rigidity of the ice cover reduces the effect of the rectangular trench one feature is also noticeable that the number of oscillations increases with the value of flexural rigidity of the ice sheet the flow is uniform and a small amount of reflection occurred for wave numbers k 0 1 h 1 1 in figs 3 a and 3 b the reflection and transmission coefficients are depicted against non dimensional wave number k 0 1 h 1 for θ π 6 π 4 π 3 with h 2 h 1 0 8 h 3 h 1 3 l h 1 5 and d h 1 4 0 2 it can be seen that the wave transmission increases with an increase in angle of incidence θ the fig 3 b reveals the fact that for smaller values of k 0 1 h 1 transmission coefficient goes beyond one which gradually decreases and attains a value less than one as k 0 1 h 1 increases this phenomena may not be observed at higher incidence angle the effects of trench depth on the reflection and transmission coefficients are plotted against nondimensional wavenumber k 0 1 h 1 in figs 4 a and 4 b for h 2 h 1 0 8 l h 1 5 d h 1 4 0 2 θ π 4 and h 3 h 1 2 3 4 these figures reveals that the wave reflection increases and the transmission decreases with an increase in the trench depth ratio h 3 h 1 therefore a deep trench beneath ice cover may cause high wave reflection in figs 5 a and 5 b the reflection and transmission coefficients are depicted against non dimensional wave number k 0 1 h 1 for three different values of trench width l h 1 the graphs are plotted for the set of parameters given by h 2 h 1 0 8 h 3 h 1 3 d h 1 4 0 2 and l h 1 3 5 7 it is observed that the trench width exhibits lower t and higher r which indicates that a wider trench allows more incident wave energy to reflect beneath the ice sheet and in turn the transmission becomes less 5 2 r 2 is deeper than r 1 i e h 1 h 2 in this subsection we analyze the absolute values of reflection and transmission coefficients for different set of parameters in figs 6 a and 6 b the reflection and transmission coefficients are plotted against k 0 1 h 1 for h 2 h 1 1 8 h 3 h 1 3 l h 1 5 θ π 4 and d h 1 4 0 1 0 2 0 3 it is clear that the transmission coefficient increases with increasing flexural rigidity of the ice we note that the amplitude of transmission coefficients in this case are higher in comparison to that in fig 2 b figs 7 a and 7 b shows the reflection and transmission coefficients for h 2 h 1 1 8 h 3 h 1 3 l h 1 5 d h 1 4 0 2 and θ π 6 π 4 π 3 it is observed that r increases with an increase in the incident angle while t has an opposite pattern fig 7 b reveals that unlike fig 3 b the amplitude of transmission coefficient is high at θ π 4 for smaller values of k 0 1 h 1 for trench depth ratio h 3 h 1 2 3 4 with h 2 h 1 1 8 l h 1 5 d h 1 4 0 2 θ π 4 the reflection and transmission coefficients are plotted against the wave number k 0 1 h 1 in fig 8 a and 8 b this figure shows that the amplitude of the wave reflection increases with an increase in the trench depth ratio h 3 h 1 it is noticed that depth of the trench has no effect on transmission coefficients when k 0 1 h 1 1 1 in figs 9 a and 9 b the variation of reflection coefficient r and transmission coefficient t versus k 0 1 h 1 is plotted for various values of l h 1 3 5 7 for h 2 h 1 1 8 h 3 h 1 3 d h 1 4 0 2 θ π 4 the general patterns for r and t are similar to the observations in fig 5 the present model is validated through a comparison of the present results with the results available in the literature the problems of water wave scattering by an asymmetric trench are available in the work of kirby and dalrymple 1983 we may note that when the thickness of ice sheet is zero the boundary condition given in eq 3 becomes the free surface condition considered by kirby and dalrymple 1983 taking h 2 h 1 1 h 3 h 1 3 d h 1 4 0 θ π 4 and l h 1 20 the transmission coefficients versus k 0 1 h 1 is plotted in fig 10 and compared with fig 5 of kirby and dalrymple 1983 it is found that the results of the present study for d h 1 0 are in good agreement with the results of kirby and dalrymple 1983 for an asymmetric trench we take h 2 h 1 1 5 h 3 h 1 2 5 d h 1 4 0 θ π 4 and l h 1 7 and the transmission coefficients coefficient versus k 0 1 h 1 is plotted in fig 11 and compared with fig 6 b of roy et al 2017 therefore it is evident from figs 10 and 11 that our present results closely agree with the results of kirby and dalrymple 1983 and roy et al 2017 and hence the correctness of the present method is established 6 conclusion in the present study the interaction of flexural gravity wave with an asymmetric trench in an ice covered ocean is analyzed using linearized potential theory the solution of the problem is obtained in two parts first the velocity potential is formulated using the eigenfunction expansions method and the orthogonality property of eigenfunctions are applied matching the conditions along the boundary of the asymmetric trench a set of integral equations is obtained in the second part we solve the integral equations by using n 1 term galerkin approximations technique involving suitably chosen basis functions the basis functions are obtained in terms of gegenbauer polynomial of order 1 6 with suitable weights the reflection and transmission coefficients are computed numerically for various geometry of the problem under consideration and depicted in a number of figures the numerical results are validated with several known results available in the literature unlike the presence of ice cover the phenomena of non zero reflection is recovered from the results it is observed that the flexural rigidity of the ice cover have significant effects on wave reflection and transmission it is found that the presence of ice cover may reduce the wave reflection this nature may relate directly to the hypothetical requirements of the mathematical model to real world applications this work might be provide the basic idea to the engineers about the wave structure interaction phenomena in the coastal region the problem considered in this work can further be extended to study various hydrodynamic properties related to wave scattering by multiple trenches in the ice covered region which would be more useful for the practical engineering problems acknowledgment this work is

22347,a model for oblique wave scattering by an asymmetric trench beneath a large floating ice sheet is studied using linearized water wave theory eigenfunction expansion method have been used to calculate the velocity potential explicitly for the associated boundary value problem using condition along the boundaries of the trench a set of integral equations are formed the solutions of the integral equations are obtained by using multi term galerkin approximations with suitably chosen basis functions involving ultraspherical gegenbauer polynomials analytic solution for the reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained and analyzed numerically for a number of figures the role of thin ice sheet on wave scattering in marginal ice zone is studied by analyzing the reflection and transmission coefficients for a set of parameters such as flexural rigidity of ice angle of incidence depth and width of the asymmetric trench we observe that wave reflection decreases in an oscillatory manner with the increase in the dimensionless flexural rigidity parameter the correctness of the present method is confirmed by comparing the results available in the literatures the problem here is to understand how the flexural gravity waves propagate over an asymmetric submarine trench in such an ice field keywords wave scattering asymmetric trench thin ice cover galerkin s method reflection and transmission coefficients 1 introduction in the last few decades there is significant studies on wave structure interaction problem in a fluid which is covered by an ice sheet the incident ocean waves are reflected partially depends highly on thickness of the ice cover and the wave period moreover the amount of reflection and transmission also depends on the young s modulus and poisson s ratio of the ice sheet which is being modeled as an elastic plate studies on wave propagation through marginal ice zone miz in the polar regions are crucial since the transmitted wave may cause fracture of large floes and shore fast ice fox and squire 1990 studied the reflection and transmission coefficients at the edge of shore fast sea ice in which the ice sheet is modeled as an thin elastic sheet analysis on reflection and transmission of obliquely incident ocean waves at the edge of an ice sheet of different thickness done by fox and squire 1994 a similar study can be found in the works of squire et al 1995 meylan and squire 1993 1996 meylan and masson 2006 evans and porter 2003 analyzed the oblique wave scattering by a narrow crack in ice sheets floating on water of finite depth using eigenfunction expansion method and green s function approach das and mandal 2006 investigated the effect of an ice cover on the scattering of obliquely incident waves by a long circular cylinder submerged in deep water vaughan and squire 2006 studied the propagation of ice coupled waves under an ice sheet of variable thickness using low order piecewise polynomials the expansion formulas for the velocity potential have been derived by manam et al 2006 using fourier sine transforms technique maiti and mandal 2010 used hypersingular integral equation method to calculate reflection and transmission coefficients associated with wave scattering by thin inclined semi infinite rigid barrier submerged in infinitely deep water covered by a thin uniform ice sheet a class of problems associated with the scattering of water waves by a rectangular trench have been investigated by many researchers an approach to the solution of such type of problems has typically been to construct solutions in each region with uniform constant depth in terms of eigenfunction expansion of the velocity potential moreover by matching the solutions along a common boundary which separate the regions result a set of linear integral equations that can be solved by iteration for suitable geometries examples of such studies can be found in chakraborty and mandal 2014 2015 earlier lassiter 1972 studied the two dimensional diffraction of surface waves by a submarine trench where the depths on two sides of the trench are constant but not necessarily equal using the variational approach in this work a conformal mapping algorithm following kreisel 1949 have been used to calculate the complex reflection coefficients for rectangular trench lee and ayer 1981 analyzed the effect of a symmetric rectangular trench on the propagation of periodic incident waves explicit solutions are obtained by dividing the fluid domain into two regions which are matched numerically along the mouth of the trench miles 1982 obtained results for normally and obliquely incident long waves in symmetric case however for obliquely incident waves reflection coefficients are calculated through a variational formulation kirby and dalrymple 1983 considered oblique wave diffraction by an asymmetric trench using linearized potential theory eigenfunction expansion of the velocity potentials are obtained for each sub region of constant depth which are then matched along vertical boundaries and solved numerically to get the reflection and transmission coefficients kirby et al 1987 extended their previous work by including the effects of currents flowing parallel to the trench boundary the scattering of normally incident waves by trenches and shoals of finite width with sloped transitions between the depth changes have been studied by bender and dean 2003 using three methods the step method the slope method and the numerical method among them the step method is valid in arbitrary water depth while the slope method and numerical method are applicable in the shallow water region jung et al 2008 developed the analytical solutions for the waves propagating over an asymmetric trench using power series technique two type of solutions are obtained first the long wave solution which is valid only for shallow water second the mild slope solution which is valid for both shallow and deep water depths kim et al 2015 studied the effects of scattered wave fields around the breakwater when the dredging trench exists at the offshore seabed by applying green s function based on the boundary integral approach recently roy et al 2017 studied the problem of obliquely incident wave propagation over an asymmetric trench and the reflection as well as transmission coefficients are calculated analogous to the previous problems kar et al 2018 2019 studied the scattering of gravity waves by multiple trenches using boundary element method the role of multiple trenches is assumed to be a novel problem in understanding of the potential excitation of resonant oscillations within the trenches their study indicates the occurrence of bragg resonance for wave propagation over multiple trenches in their second problem scattering of surface gravity wave by a floating dock in the presence of bottom undulation such as multiple trenches breakwaters or a combination of trenches and breakwaters this work shows that amplitude of bragg resonance diminishes for higher water depth in the case of multiple trenches the study of wave ice interaction has two aspects the physical effects of ice cover on the water waves and waves on an ice cover therefore it is worthy to study wave scattering phenomena in an ocean which is covered by a thin sheet of ice instead of a free surface in the present study we have extended the work of kirby and dalrymple 1983 by considering a fluid bounded above by a thin ice sheet the fluid domain is divided into three regions with uniform but unequal depths the eigenfunction expansion of the velocity potential in each region are derived following the method described by kanoria et al 1999 for the problem of water wave scattering by a thick barrier of rectangular cross section a set of integral equations are obtained for the corresponding unknown horizontal velocity components across the vertical line through the corner point of the trench the solutions of the integral equations are approximated using multi term galerkin approximations involving ultraspherical gegenbauer polynomials cf evans and fernyhough 1995 once the integral equations are solved the reflection and transmission coefficients can be obtained easily numerical results associated with wave scattering by an asymmetric trench are analyzed for a set of physical parameters 2 formulation of the problem we take three dimensional coordinate system with y axis is taken vertically downwards and x z plane is taken along the ice covered surface we consider an asymmetric trench of width l in an ocean which is covered by an infinite ice sheet of very small thickness d the fluid domain is divided into three regions r 1 x 0 0 y h 1 r 2 x l 0 y h 2 and r 3 0 x l 0 y h 3 fig 1 the fluid is assumed to be homogeneous inviscid and incompressible the motion in the fluid is assumed to be irrotational let a harmonically time dependent progressive wave be obliquely incident from negative infinity whose direction makes an angle θ with the x axis for an incident wave with wavelength λ we denote the wavenumber by k 0 1 2 π λ so that α 0 1 k 0 1 cos θ the velocity potential is 1 φ x y z t re ϕ x y e i μ z ω t where μ k 0 1 sin θ re denotes the real part of a complex expression and ω being the angular frequency of the wave the complex valued

basis functions to chose the basis functions in eq 36 we consider the ice covered condition at y 0 and the edge condition at 0 h 1 and l h 2 thus g p q y g y satisfies 37 d 2 x 2 μ 2 2 1 δ g y k g y 0

calculate b p q p q 1 2 from 48 b p q n 0 n a n p q x n p p q 1 2 5 analysis in the present section the reflection and transmission coefficients r and t are computed for various non dimensionalized parameters such as flexural rigidity of the ice sheet incidence angle trench depth and trench width in the subsequent calculations we have used e 6 gpa ν 0 3 ρ w 1025 0 kg m 3 ρ i 922 5 kg m 3 and g 9 81 m s 2 as we are dealing with linearized water wave theory we assume d h 1 1 implying δ 1 so that the ice cover boundary condition can be applied on y 0 see evans and porter 2003 in the present paper we have considered an ice sheet with very small thickness i e d 0 and the corresponding value of the parameter δ is characterized by a very small constant value 0 001 to solve the linear system given in eq 44 numerically we choose n 4 in the following subsections several cases for asymmetric trenches i e h 1 h 2 are given 5 1 r 1 is deeper than r 2 i e h 1 h 2 for the fluid region in which the depth of r 1 is greater than the depth of r 2 can be described by taking h 2 h 1 1 in figs 2 5 the absolute values of reflection and transmission coefficients are depicted for various asymmetric trenches with h 2 h 1 0 8 in figs 2 a and 2 b r and t are plotted against k 0 1 h 1 for various values of d h 1 4 0 1 0 2 0 3 with h 3 h 1 3 l h 1 5 and θ π 4 from the figures it is clear that both of reflection and transmission coefficients are periodic in nature unlike the case of symmetric trenches the wave reflection vanishes only at k 0 1 h 1 0 in presence of asymmetric trench the transmission coefficients may assumes the value more than unity for smaller wave numbers it is also observed that transmission coefficient increases with an increase in flexural rigidity of the ice sheet and an opposite pattern is found in the case of r this is quite natural because the increasing rigidity of the ice cover reduces the effect of the rectangular trench one feature is also noticeable that the number of oscillations increases with the value of flexural rigidity of the ice sheet the flow is uniform and a small amount of reflection occurred for wave numbers k 0 1 h 1 1 in figs 3 a and 3 b the reflection and transmission coefficients are depicted against non dimensional wave number k 0 1 h 1 for θ π 6 π 4 π 3 with h 2 h 1 0 8 h 3 h 1 3 l h 1 5 and d h 1 4 0 2 it can be seen that the wave transmission increases with an increase in angle of incidence θ the fig 3 b reveals the fact that for smaller values of k 0 1 h 1 transmission coefficient goes beyond one which gradually decreases and attains a value less than one as k 0 1 h 1 increases this phenomena may not be observed at higher incidence angle the effects of trench depth on the reflection and transmission coefficients are plotted against nondimensional wavenumber k 0 1 h 1 in figs 4 a and 4 b for h 2 h 1 0 8 l h 1 5 d h 1 4 0 2 θ π 4 and h 3 h 1 2 3 4 these figures reveals that the wave reflection increases and the transmission decreases with an increase in the trench depth ratio h 3 h 1 therefore a deep trench beneath ice cover may cause high wave reflection in figs 5 a and 5 b the reflection and transmission coefficients are depicted against non dimensional wave number k 0 1 h 1 for three different values of trench width l h 1 the graphs are plotted for the set of parameters given by h 2 h 1 0 8 h 3 h 1 3 d h 1 4 0 2 and l h 1 3 5 7 it is observed that the trench width exhibits lower t and higher r which indicates that a wider trench allows more incident wave energy to reflect beneath the ice sheet and in turn the transmission becomes less 5 2 r 2 is deeper than r 1 i e h 1 h 2 in this subsection we analyze the absolute values of reflection and transmission coefficients for different set of parameters in figs 6 a and 6 b the reflection and transmission coefficients are plotted against k 0 1 h 1 for h 2 h 1 1 8 h 3 h 1 3 l h 1 5 θ π 4 and d h 1 4 0 1 0 2 0 3 it is clear that the transmission coefficient increases with increasing flexural rigidity of the ice we note that the amplitude of transmission coefficients in this case are higher in comparison to that in fig 2 b figs 7 a and 7 b shows the reflection and transmission coefficients for h 2 h 1 1 8 h 3 h 1 3 l h 1 5 d h 1 4 0 2 and θ π 6 π 4 π 3 it is observed that r increases with an increase in the incident angle while t has an opposite pattern fig 7 b reveals that unlike fig 3 b the amplitude of transmission coefficient is high at θ π 4 for smaller values of k 0 1 h 1 for trench depth ratio h 3 h 1 2 3 4 with h 2 h 1 1 8 l h 1 5 d h 1 4 0 2 θ π 4 the reflection and transmission coefficients are plotted against the wave number k 0 1 h 1 in fig 8 a and 8 b this figure shows that the amplitude of the wave reflection increases with an increase in the trench depth ratio h 3 h 1 it is noticed that depth of the trench has no effect on transmission coefficients when k 0 1 h 1 1 1 in figs 9 a and 9 b the variation of reflection coefficient r and transmission coefficient t versus k 0 1 h 1 is plotted for various values of l h 1 3 5 7 for h 2 h 1 1 8 h 3 h 1 3 d h 1 4 0 2 θ π 4 the general patterns for r and t are similar to the observations in fig 5 the present model is validated through a comparison of the present results with the results available in the literature the problems of water wave scattering by an asymmetric trench are available in the work of kirby and dalrymple 1983 we may note that when the thickness of ice sheet is zero the boundary condition given in eq 3 becomes the free surface condition considered by kirby and dalrymple 1983 taking h 2 h 1 1 h 3 h 1 3 d h 1 4 0 θ π 4 and l h 1 20 the transmission coefficients versus k 0 1 h 1 is plotted in fig 10 and compared with fig 5 of kirby and dalrymple 1983 it is found that the results of the present study for d h 1 0 are in good agreement with the results of kirby and dalrymple 1983 for an asymmetric trench we take h 2 h 1 1 5 h 3 h 1 2 5 d h 1 4 0 θ π 4 and l h 1 7 and the transmission coefficients coefficient versus k 0 1 h 1 is plotted in fig 11 and compared with fig 6 b of roy et al 2017 therefore it is evident from figs 10 and 11 that our present results closely agree with the results of kirby and dalrymple 1983 and roy et al 2017 and hence the correctness of the present method is established 6 conclusion in the present study the interaction of flexural gravity wave with an asymmetric trench in an ice covered ocean is analyzed using linearized potential theory the solution of the problem is obtained in two parts first the velocity potential is formulated using the eigenfunction expansions method and the orthogonality property of eigenfunctions are applied matching the conditions along the boundary of the asymmetric trench a set of integral equations is obtained in the second part we solve the integral equations by using n 1 term galerkin approximations technique involving suitably chosen basis functions the basis functions are obtained in terms of gegenbauer polynomial of order 1 6 with suitable weights the reflection and transmission coefficients are computed numerically for various geometry of the problem under consideration and depicted in a number of figures the numerical results are validated with several known results available in the literature unlike the presence of ice cover the phenomena of non zero reflection is recovered from the results it is observed that the flexural rigidity of the ice cover have significant effects on wave reflection and transmission it is found that the presence of ice cover may reduce the wave reflection this nature may relate directly to the hypothetical requirements of the mathematical model to real world applications this work might be provide the basic idea to the engineers about the wave structure interaction phenomena in the coastal region the problem considered in this work can further be extended to study various hydrodynamic properties related to wave scattering by multiple trenches in the ice covered region which would be more useful for the practical engineering problems acknowledgment this work is

22348,offshore wind farms have developed fast as an environmentally friendly source of energy the submarine power cable of the offshore wind farm used for connecting power generation devices to onshore equipment may have a significant impact on navigation safety and is prone to being damaged e g caused by fishing or emergency anchoring by ships when adopting unfavorable routing this paper proposes a fuzzy evidential reasoning method for submarine power cable routing selection of the offshore wind farm by comprehensively considering the conditions for cable laying and its influence on maritime safety the kernel of this approach is to establish a three layer decision making framework after fuzzification of the input variables to derive the belief rule base and to obtain the optimal routing from the submarine power cable candidates using evidential reasoning and index value the proposed approach is applied to a real routing selection problem of a submarine power cable for an offshore wind farm in zhejiang province of china the resulting choice corresponds to the discussions in a workshop unanimously keywords offshore wind farm submarine power cable routing decision making navigational environment fuzzy evidential reasoning maritime safety 1 introduction the offshore wind farm has developed fast worldwide as a renewable energy source for comparatively good social environmental and climate benefits in recent years chancham et al 2017 firestone et al 2018 higgins and foley 2014 kota et al 2015 by the end of 2017 there was a total of 5387 mw offshore wind capacity in operation in the north and baltic seas fraunhofer 2019a with a large marine space with strong wind potential the european offshore wind capacity is estimated to reach up to 150 gw by 2030 vieira et al 2019 ursavas 2017 compared with denmark and uk which began to develop offshore wind power in the early 2000s higgins and foley 2014 china started later but has developed fast in the last five years especially in the southeast coastal sea as shown in fig 1 upon december 2017 the cumulative installed capacity of offshore wind farms approached 2788 mw in china and some new farms are still under construction zheng et al 2018 the submarine power cable spc is an important part of the offshore wind farm which undertakes the function of power transmission see fig 2 of which the routing selection is more than an economic issue since factors such as safety should be also taken into consideration the spc routing should be laid with caution to reduce intersections with channels in busy waterways this is because ships that are in an emergency may take immediate anchoring wu et al 2017b which may cause damage to the cables for different seafloor sediment and cable types the causation factors of cable damage are quite different of which the damage caused by human factors accounts for the most wang et al 2019 qu and meng 2012 around 70 percent of cable failures are caused by fishing and shipping activities in water depths lower than 200 m kordahi and shapiro 2010 the longer the expected routing of the spc the higher is the probability of facing one or more faults due to human activities thus optimization of spc routing selection could facilitate a better decision process and significantly reduce the risk and costs of spc decision making for spc routing selection mainly considers factors of cost technical feasibility safety and reliability and also the sensitive regions e g fishing area which may threaten the safety of submarine cable fischetti and pisinger 2018 schell et al 2017 han and chen 2013 according to taormina et al 2018 cable routing should be selected according to the bathymetry seabed characteristics and economic activities specifically hazardous areas such as anchorages fishing grounds should be avoided worzyk 2009 moreover similar to the spc routing selection the oil pipeline routing can also be found in the literature balogun et al 2015 dey 2006 the existing studies for spc routing selection are summarized as shown in table 1 multi attribute decision making is also widely used for offshore wind farm selection ayodele et al 2018 chaouachi et al 2017 fetanat and khorasaninejad 2015 höfer et al 2016 ho et al 2018 kim et al 2013 2016 2018 wu et al 2018a zhang et al 2018 the criteria including wind resources technical security environmental economic and social factors are often considered for wind farm selection specifically chaouachi et al 2017 proposed an ahp method for the multi criteria evaluation of offshore wind sites by considering the security of electricity supply and energy efficiency fetanat and khorasaninejad 2015 proposed a hybrid multi criteria decision making tool for offshore wind site selection from water depth environmental technical resources and economic aspects ho et al 2018 developed a comprehensive set of criteria including aspects of economy society environment and security for the selection of offshore wind farm sites höfer et al 2016 provided a mcdm method by considering techno economic social political and environmental criteria to evaluate the suitability of the offshore wind farm candidates kim et al 2018 provided guidance for offshore wind farm development in the south korea southwest coast by taking criteria of economic feasibility and social environment conflict into account wu et al 2018a proposed a fuzzy madm method for site selection of offshore wind farm by comprehensively considering the feasibility and maritime safety and divided the influencing factors into four attributes i e wind resource natural environment traffic environment conditions for wind turbine fuzzy logic is widely used for integrating these criteria to deal with uncertainties caused by the scarcity of data fuzzy logic fuzzy decision trees fuzzy ahp and picture fuzzy set pfss fetanat and khorasaninejad 2015 khakzad et al 2017 xue et al 2019 yang et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2018b wu et al 2019 have been developed to achieve reasonable decisions fuzzy approaches can effectively describe both the qualitative and quantitative factors by using fuzzy sets however this approach may lose some useful information because it uses the traditional if then rules to describe the relationship between input variables and output variables yang et al 2009 specifically the traditional if then rules describe the output with a membership degree of 100 in practice this is unrealistic because uncertainty may exist and a belief degree which can precisely describe the output variables could be much more appropriate for spc routing selection to address this problem the evidential reasoning er which has been widely used to deal with such uncertainty wu et al 2017a 2018b zhou et al 2018a is introduced in this paper moreover this method can also cope with incomplete information which is also common in spc routing selection dymova and sevastjanov 2014 liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 the comparison between the proposed fuzzy er and the existing fuzzy approaches is summarized and shown in table 2 generally the fuzzy reasoning and er are two different categories in terms of their inference process the first category is human knowledge based in the form of traditional fuzzy if then rules yang et al 2009 the second category is to capture the nonlinear relationship between different rules and synthesize all the outputs to generate the final conclusion chen et al 2018 liu et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2018a therefore the motivation of this paper is to propose a fuzzy er based method for spc routing selection of offshore wind farm by comprehensively considering the cable reliability maritime safety and environmental protection from this perspective a three layer decision making approach by treating the routing condition navigational environment cable reliability and special zones as four attributes are developed in order to obtain a convincing result some influencing factors related to are identified and quantified from previous studies the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 develops a fuzzy er model for spc routing selection of offshore wind farms by considering the costs environment and maritime safety section 3 applies the proposed methods to zheneng offshore wind farm as a case study and the results show the practicability and feasibility of this approach for spc routing selection of the offshore wind farm the conclusions are drawn and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed in section 4 2 development of a decision making model for spc routing selection 2 1 establish a generic decision making framework the spc routing selection of offshore wind farms is a common decision making issue affected by multiple factors without loss of generality x x 1 x 2 x t t 2 is defined as a set of candidate spc routings for an offshore wind farm y y 1 y 2 y s s 2 is defined as a set of attributes define n t as the overall assessment on the t th cable routing of the offshore wind farm note that the larger the value n t is the better the t th routing of the cable is in order to derive a comprehensive assessment of the multi attribute spc routings of offshore wind farms the decision making framework is established in the following three steps and graphically illustrated as shown in fig 3 first a three layer decision making framework is established after identifying the attributes and influencing factors moreover the input and output variables are fuzzified second the er based method is introduced for the reasoning process and the extended if then rules are used to construct the belief rule base third utility values are assigned to the corresponding linguistic variables and the index value is used for final decision making henceforth the best spc routing of the offshore wind farm can be selected 2 2 identify influencing factors to establish the hierarchical structure the influencing factors of the spc routing should be identified from previous studies or expert experience in multiple attributes decision making firestone et al 2018 ho et al 2018 höfer et al 2016 kim et al 2013 2018 in terms of the costs of spc schell et al 2017 taormina et al 2018 routing length should be considered as the key factor to assess the routing conditions of an offshore wind farm water depth is a distinguishing factor for cable routing selection which will have an impact on the laying of the cable taormina et al 2018 and finally influence the cost of installation maritime safety is the key issue for an offshore wind farm in the busy waterways as there are many ships navigating anchoring or fishing in the nearby channels the routing of the spc will have an impact on ship navigation and operation especially when the ship is not under control and an immediate anchoring could be taken wu et al 2018a 2018b the seafloor sediment seawater corrosion the distance from existing cables are factors to describe the reliability of the cable routing and these factors will influence the construction and maintenance of the cable woo et al 2015 in addition special zones i e natural reverse and fishery should be kept far from the cable routing for environmental protection the explanation of these factors is summarized and listed in table 3 to facilitate the decision making process the categorization of the influencing factors is introduced four attributes which are routing condition rc navigational environment ne cable reliability cr and special zones sz are defined as the parent criteria of the influencing factors thus the hierarchical decision making framework for spc routing selection of offshore wind farms can be established as shown in fig 4 2 3 fuzzy er based approach in spc routing selection the widely used fuzzy approach balmat et al 2009 celik and akyuz 2018 soner et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 cannot precisely describe the output specifically in the fuzzy reasoning process thus er method is introduced for inference in the spc routing selection the fuzzy er based method can be graphically described as shown in fig 5 input influencing factors using linguistic variables or numerical values output the index value of each candidate spc routings to derive the final decision step 1 fuzzification of the influencing factors qualitative influencing factors are identified by linguistic variables while quantitative influencing factors described using numerical values are fuzzified by linguistic variables step 2 introduce the er based approach to derive the belief rule base using the if then rules step 3 apply the transformation technique to link the influencing factors directly into decision variables which is specifically explained in sec 2 6 step 4 calculate the activation weight of each reasoning rule using the equation θ k n 1 5 α n j n k k 1 125 n 1 5 α n j n k k 1 2 j after derivation of the activation weight for each rule the influencing factors can be integrated to derive the index values 2 4 fuzzification of the input and output variables in order to facilitate the decision making process the input and output variables should be fuzzified to organize information for the input variables quantitative influencing factors and qualitative influencing factors are fuzzified separately with different methods expert judgment and membership functions are two methods widely used in fuzzy logic yang et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 the former method is based on the subjective judgments of multiple experts hence the qualitative influencing factors which are seafloor sediment seawater corrosion and marine nature reserve are defined by fuzzy linguistic variables on the other hand the triangle membership function which is commonly used in the previous studies coşgun et al 2014 wu et al 2018a is introduced to fuzzify the quantitative influencing factors five linguistic variables which are very bad bad moderate good and very good are introduced in this paper the criteria for fuzzification of the input variables are derived on the basis of the existing spc conditions and related rules and regulations the fuzzification of these factors is described in detail as follows cable length cl from the figures of the european offshore wind farms the currently farthest from shore is global tech 1 at a distance of 112 km from the german coast while finland has the shortest average distance to the coast which is 4 km fraunhofer 2019b likewise to investigate the offshore wind farms installed in china dafeng h3 is the farthest from shore at a distance of 43 km spic state power investment corporation 2018 while the average distance is 13 km from the coast of china wikipedia 2018 in this paper 0 4 is assigned to the existing farthest european cable and 0 6 to farthest chinese cable respectively consequently 112 0 4 43 0 6 70 6 to facilitate calculation 70 km is defined as very long for cl similarly 10 km is defined as very short for cl moreover the interval between 70 km and 10 km is divided into five grades as shown in table 4 water depth wd the water depth is a key factor to be considered in the site selection as well as the spc routing selection of the offshore wind farms which is highly related to the technology and foundation cost of the offshore wind farm greater distances from the coast generally go hand in hand with increasing water depths in european countries the offshore wind turbines in the german exclusive economic zone awz are situated in the greatest average water depth at 29 m most of the projects are located in the water depths of up to 40 m fraunhofer 2019b however regarding the technical and economic constraints the water depth of a suitable offshore wind farm site should be less than 60 m chaouachi et al 2017 in china turbines are erected in more shallow water ranging from 5 m to 13 m wikipedia 2018 thus the water depth of 5 m is assumed to be very shallow and 60 m is treated as very deep in this paper according to the triangular membership function 40 50 60 are defined as the fuzzy numbers for the linguistic variable very bad similarly 30 40 50 20 30 40 10 20 30 and 5 10 20 are defined as the fuzzy numbers for the linguistic variable bad moderate good and very good respectively channel crossover cc channel crossover is an indicator of the traffic situation which will influence both the laying and maintenance of the spc in the channels in the crossover area with channels and if the ship navigating in the channel is not under control and have to take an immediate anchoring the cable will be prone to being damaged by the anchor therefore the more times of channel crossover with the spc the higher the risk of the spc to be damaged and the crossover times should be managed to be reduced in practice if there is no channel cross over the spc routing it will be easy to protect the spc and to enhance maritime safety according to the national standard gb t 17502 2009 the pre selection of the submarine cable routing should take the shipping lines into consideration and the spcs should cross the channel vertically if applicable although specific constraints for submarine cable crossing over the channel are not mentioned in the standard fewer crossovers could be better from practical aspects through investigation of the world s top five largest offshore wind farms till 2018 the spc of the london array offshore wind farm wikipedia 2019 crosses channels five times on its way to the landing point while the spc of the race bank offshore wind farm does not cross any main channel thus five times is defined as great many for cc and set as the median for the fuzzy numbers similarly zero is set as the median for fuzzy numbers of very less in most cases the spc of offshore wind farm cross channels three times and seldom reach up to ten times thus 3 is set as the lower boundary and 10 is the upper boundary of the fuzzy numbers for great many and 0 0 2 is defined as very less distance from the fairway and anchorage dw and da these two factors have a similar impact on maritime safety but with a little difference in the construction phase the cable laying vessel may disturb the ship navigating in the channel meanwhile the ship mooring in the anchorage will increase the risk of traffic accidents during the cable laying operation period in the maintenance phase various emergency situations such as ship out of control ship stranded ship sinking emergency anchorage may cause damage to the spcs traditionally the distance is defined by the inertial stopping distance which is the distance that the ship stops by using the full astern engine from the navigation experience the inertial stopping distance of a 200 000 deadweight tonnages ship is around 16 times ship length normally 250 300 m which is approximately 16 300 m 4800 m considering there will be larger sized ships navigating in the channels 5 km is used as a very safe distance from the anchorage and channels from the previous study a 1 km buffer zone from the channel is applied to reduce the risk of collision kim et al 2016 thus 0 5 1 1 5 are defined as the fuzzy numbers for moderate when the spc route is very close to the channel or anchorage it is assumed to be very close thus the fuzzy numbers 0 0 0 5 are defined for the linguistic variable very bad distance from the existing cable dc close to the existing cable will influence the installation of the spcs according to the national rules for submarine cable and pipeline protection in china at least 0 5 km should be kept away from the submarine cables mnr ministry of natural resources 2004 therefore 0 5 1 1 5 is defined as moderate and other four linguistic variables are defined similarly as shown in table 4 seafloor sediment and seawater corrosion ss and sc prior to installation a marine survey should be carried out to test the type and thickness of the sediment to see whether it is suitable for cable laying kraus and carter 2018 from the study of sherwood et al 2016 the routing of the cable should be selected carefully to avoid rocky outcrops including reefs and islands and to maximize the intersection of softer sediments additional according to the provisions of gb17502 2009 the spc routing should be kept far from the sensitive geological areas i e exposed bedrock steep cliff groove shallow gas active sand waves moreover the evaluation of the corrosion of the routing area should also be carried out for these two influencing factors five linguistic variables are introduced to fuzzify the impact on spc safety distance from the marine reserve dm the laying of the spcs may cause environmental pollution to the marine reserve for marine environmental protection the national energy bureau neb and state oceanic administration soa have issued laws and regulations that oceanographic project should not cause pollution to the marine reserve neb national energy bureau 2017 according to gb17502 2009 the spc routing should be kept out of the marine reserves as far as possible in some sensitive marine areas marine engineering such as cable laying is forbidden distance from the fishery df the spc routings should avoid crossing the reef fisheries trawl fishery and scallop fisheries sherwood et al 2016 human activities are leading causes of cable faults and repairs and fishing accounts for around half according to the database of 2162 records of reported faults during 1959 2006 see fig 6 thus a protection zone along the spc should be used to avoid damage from the fishery similarly 0 5 km is defined as very close as shown in table 4 taking the dw and da as a reference 5 km is treated as very far from the fishery in order to make a comprehensive assessment of the spc candidate routings the energy company should compromise the above influencing factors the fuzzified input variables are given in detail in table 4 for the output variables which are routing condition rc navigational environment ne cable reliability cr and special zones sz are all fuzzified by using the standard triangular fuzzy numbers with five linguistic variables shown in fig 7 the triangular fuzzy number is widely used in practice coşgun et al 2014 wu et al 2018a which is expressed as m l m u where m is the median for which the membership of m equals to 1 while l and u are the lower boundary and upper boundary separately if some unknown value locates outside l u it means that the variable never belongs to a member of m note that the boundary value is not the best value 2 5 construct a belief rule base using extended if then rules after identifying the influencing factors and defining the corresponding linguistic variables the fuzzy rules should be established to link the input variables and output variables for reasoning the classical fuzzy rule is the if then rule which is widely used in the domain of marine safety wu et al 2018a yang et al 2009 the influencing factors are treated as input variables and the corresponding attribute is treated as the output variable in an if then rule a traditional if then rule can be expressed as follows liu et al 2004 yang et al 2009 1 r k if a 1 k and a 2 k and and a n k then d k k 1 2 l where a i k means the linguistic variables of the i th influencing factors of the corresponding attribute used in the k th rule r k and d k represent the output of the r k rule expressed by one single linguistic variable with a 100 belief degree take the attribute of cr cable reliability as an example the simple if then reasoning rule is established as follows r 1 if the dc of a routing is very close and the ss is very unsuitable and the sc is very strong then the cr is very bad however this rule cannot reflect slight changes of the influencing factors and hard to describe situations with complexity and uncertainty by introducing a belief degree β into the fuzzy rule system the simple if then scheme is extended to assign all possible consequences with a belief degree and a more realistic and informative scheme can be established the generic if then scheme with a belief structure is defined as follows yang et al 2009 2 r k if a 1 k and a 2 k and and a n k then β 1 k d 1 β 2 k d 2 β m k d m where β j k is the belief degree assigned to d j which is the consequent of output variables for the input of a i k and the summation of the belief degree should satisfy j 1 m β j k 1 the belief rule base can precisely reflect the relationships between the influencing factors and the decision attributes with probabilistic uncertainty hence by using the above mentioned rule the extended if then rule with belief degree can be rewritten as follows r 1 if the dc of a routing is very close and the ss is very unsuitable and the sc is very strong then the cr is 0 98 very bad 0 02 bad 0 normal 0 good 0 very good by introducing the belief structure the classical if then rule can be developed to construct the reasoning rule base using belief degree note that belief degrees of the output linguistic variables can be directly judged by experts or derived from matching functions in this paper the max min operation zimmermann 1991 a classical tool to define matching degree between fuzzy sets is selected to describe the similarity between the real input fuzzy set a r and the corresponding fuzzy linguistic variables a i j i hence the matching degree between a r and a i j i can be defined as follows liu et al 2004 3 α i j i m a r a i j i max min μ a r x μ a i j i x where x represents the fuzzy set of the input a r α i j i express the extent to which a r belongs to the defined linguistic variables of the i th attributes therefore the rule base for spc routing selection can be established with the belief structure take the attribute cr as an example since there are three input variables and each with five linguistic terms 125 53 125 rules could be produced to facilitate the belief reasoning process only some selected rules are given in the cr rule base as shown in table 5 the belief rule base for other attributes i e rc ne and sz can also be constructed in the same way evidential reasoning er approach chen et al 2018 yang et al 2009 is further introduced to derive the values of decision criteria which can be implemented as follows step 1 the belief degrees β j k should be transformed into basic probability masses m d k which could be divided into two parts the first part is caused by the relative importance of the k th rule m d k and the other part is derived from the incompleteness of the belief reasoning β j k m d k this process can be achieved by using equations as follows liu et al 2004 yang et al 2009 4 m j k θ k β j k 5 m d k 1 j 1 n m j k 1 θ k j 1 n β j k 6 m d k 1 θ k 7 m d k θ k 1 j 1 n β j k where m j k are support degrees of each r k belongs to the output decision d θ k represents the relevant importance of r k they should satisfy k 1 n θ k 1 and m d k m d k m d k note that θ k is a reflection of the and operator between different input variables to obtain the weight of the k th rule the product operator is introduced to model the and connector and deal with the dependency of influencing factors for cr as follows liu et al 2004 8 θ k i 1 3 α i j i k l 1 125 i 1 3 α i j i l i 1 2 or 3 j 1 j 2 j 3 and j 4 1 or 5 step 2 generate a combined belief degree β j k of each possible d j from all the outputs of r k k 1 2 l suppose m j i k is the combined belief degree of d j by integrating all the outputs of the k th rule and m d i k is the remaining belief degree unassigned to any d j let m j i 1 m j 1 and m d i 1 m d 1 then the overall combined belief degree β j of d j can be calculated as follows liu et al 2004 yang et al 2009 9 d j m j i k 1 k i k 1 m j i k m j k 1 m j i k m d k 1 m d i k m j k 1 10 m d i k m d i k m d i k k 1 2 l 1 11 d m d i k 1 k i k 1 m d i k m d k 1 m d i k m d k 1 m d i k m d k 1 12 m d i k 1 k i k 1 m d i k m d k 1 13 k i k 1 1 j 1 n t 1 t j n m j i k m t k 1 1 k 1 2 l 1 14 d j β j m j i l 1 m d i l j 1 2 n 15 d j β d m d i l 1 m d i l where β j is the normalized belief degree of d j and β d is the normalized remaining unassigned belief degree to any d j 2 6 obtain the optimal scheme via fuzzy link based transformation multiple attributes decision making normally contains three or more levels of criteria with different grades for decision making it is necessary to transform the grades of influencing factors and attributes into the grades of the decision variable a fuzzy link based transformation yang et al 2009 is a technique developed to convert different grades via equivalent standards for the instance of the attribute rc routing condition it belongs to the upper level criteria of spc routing and has two lower level sub criteria cl and wd in the decision making hierarchy the top level event spc routing can be expressed using five linguistic variables which are slightly preferred moderately preferred average preferred and greatly preferred the attribute rc is described with linguistic variables of very bad bad moderate good and very good the influencing factors cl and wd are assessed with the grades of linguistic variables very long long moderate short very short and very deep deep moderate shallow very shallow consequently a transformation link with belief structure between different levels of criteria expressed by linguistic variables can be used to convert the input to output as shown in fig 8 as demonstrated in fig 8 the arrows with the belief degree β indicate the relationships between linguistic variables of decision criteria on different levels note that the summation of the belief degree for each linguistic variable should be equal to 1 for example the influencing factor cl with an expression of short indicates that the level of the attribute rc can be good with a belief degree of 0 8 and very good with a belief degree of 0 2 for the best spc routing scheme the good rc can be transformed into the spc routing as good with a belief degree of 1 and very good rc can be transformed into very good spc routing with a belief degree of 1 in order to rank the spc routing expressed by linguistic variables an appropriate utility value u v should be assigned to each linguistic variable in this paper the utility value of reference as the set 0 0 35 0 55 0 85 1 is used for each grade wu et al 2018b the index value n t for final ranking of the spc routings can be achieved by using the following equation yang et al 2009 16 n t β 1 t 0 β 2 t 0 35 β 3 t 0 55 β 4 t 0 85 β 5 t 1 where β t is the belief degree of the spc routing belongs to the t th grade note that t 1 5 β j t 1 for the t th spc routing candidate consequently the spc routing selection can be conducted by using the index value obviously the larger n t means that the t th spc routing candidate is better generally the best spc routing scheme with the largest index value will be selected 3 application of the proposed method to spc routing selection 3 1 scenario description of the spc routing the zheneng offshore wind farm see fig 9 with an installed capacity of 300 mw is under planning to meet the renewable energy demand in east china distinguished from another offshore wind farm i e dong hai bridge offshore wind farm in this area zhengneng offshore wind farm intends to be developed in the port waters in addition there are three anchorages namely jinshan anchorage for ships transporting dangerous goods jiadian anchorage and chenshan anchorage scattered along the waterway for ships waiting for tide or entry moreover a ten thousand square nautical miles fishing ground is distributed close to the arranged water area which makes it complex for spc routing selection as graphically displayed in fig 9 there are three spc routing candidates for zheneng offshore wind farm which are determined by a workshop with the attendance of stakeholders including msa maritime safety administration soa state oceanic administration traffic planning committee and the energy company note that these three candidate routings should be proposed beforehand this is because the spc routing is an important part attached to the entire offshore wind farm plan which cannot be determined independently from the offshore wind farm in other words the implementation of spc routing selection without considering the conditions of the offshore wind farm will be irrational and inconvincible and the layout of the wind farm determines the majority of the spc routing attributes the basic information of the influencing factors for the three spc routing candidates is derived as shown in table 6 according to the location of the candidate spc routings the detailed information for each decision attribute is obtained from different sources the nautical chart as an essential tool for ship navigation is a graphic representation of some basic data such as water depth seabed landscape tides and currents navigation aids and special zones provided by international hydrographic organization iho from hydrographic surveys therefore information of the sub factors of attributes cl wd cc dw da dm df and dc can be easily derived from the nautical chart differently the attributes ss and sc are derived from the geological survey including the bathymetric survey shallow layer detection and engineering geological investigation 3 2 fuzzification of the influencing factors for spc routing selection by introducing the criteria for fuzzification in table 4 the numerical values of influencing factors can be fuzzified and the results for the three candidates are shown in table 7 specifically the following calculation process is described in detail by taking cl as an example since the cl of no 1 spc routing is 40 3 km the fuzzified values are shown in table 7 and it can be interpreted as the cl of no 1 spc belongs to long with a belief degree 0 03 which is derived by using equation 40 3 40 50 40 0 03 similarly the cl of the no 1 spc routing belongs to moderate with a belief degree of 0 97 hence the cl of no 1 spc routing can be expressed as long 0 03 moderate 0 97 similarly the fuzzified values of the other influencing factors for different candidates can also be derived and shown in table 7 to compare the advantages and disadvantages of the three spc routings their performances can be graphically demonstrated in fig 10 there are five grades namely g1 g2 g3 g4 and g5 representing the preference degrees of each influencing factor if while g1 indicates the lowest degree with slight preference and g5 is the highest degree which is greatly preferred in this figure the different spc routings are indicated by different colored shapes if the data point of an influencing factor falls below the line g3 it means that this influencing factor is a weak item for the overall performance similarly if the data point is located in the green area it reflects that this influencing factor has a good performance for instance the no 1 routing has better performance for the factors of wd dc sc and df than the other two routings but shows worse performances in cc dw and da no 2 and no 3 routings have good performances in da sc and df note that these three candidate routings have good performances in some factors but bad performances on some other factors therefore it is necessary to make a comprehensive evaluation by accommodating all the influencing factors as developed in sec 2 5 the input variables of the three spc routings can be defined with fuzzy values using the max min operation note that the summation of the fuzzy values should be equal to 1 the outputs of the influencing factors from fuzzy link based transformation are displayed in table 8 it can be seen that the output of each influencing factor is different from the original fuzzified result which demonstrates that the importance degree of each influencing factor should be considered in the spc routing selection 3 3 selection of the best spc routing after the transformation of the influencing factors the er method is introduced to integrate the influencing factors the weights of the influencing factors are set the same since the significance of each influencing factor has been considered in the process of fuzzy link based transformation if weights are set again here it is duplicated and could affect the significance of the upper level decision attributes which may cause bias in the final spc routing selection the integration result of no 1 spc routing scheme is shown in fig 11 the utility values for each grade linguistic variable need to be defined in this paper they are defined as slightly preferred is 0 moderately preferred is 0 35 average is 0 55 preferred is 0 85 greatly preferred is 1 0 which is the same with wu et al 2018b as introduced in sec 2 6 the index value n t can be obtained by multiplying the belief degree of each grade with this defined utility value see eq 16 thus the final ranking result for the three candidate spc routings can be derived as shown in fig 12 from the comparative results of the three candidate spc routings no 2 spc routing is the best and no 1 is the worst one the reason is that the no 2 routing has the best navigational environment ne and conditions for channel crossover cc among all candidates moreover it has better performance in the attributes of cr and sz specifically the no 2 spc crosses over channel two times while no 1 and no 3 routing cross over channels three and four times respectively moreover both no 1 and no 3 routings have a segment alongside the fairway which is more prone to being damaged by ships in an emergency in practice the no 2 spc routing has the minimal interaction with ship navigation and the lowest probability to be damaged by human activities which also suggests a reduction of the maintenance cost of spc during the operation period although no 1 candidate routing has good performance in wd dc sc and df it is the worst scheme according to the comprehensive assessment because of the worst performance in the attributes of dw and da in other words this candidate routing has significant impacts on the fairway and anchorage which may consequently cause damage to the spc the final selection demonstrates that the decision being made from the proposed method is identical with the result discussed in the workshop which shows that the proposed model is beneficial for spc routing selection of the offshore wind farm in fact the spc routing with minimal interaction with ship navigation is selected it is beneficial for both installation and operation for the spc which could consequently enhance the safety of the spc and reduce the operation and maintenance costs 4 concluding remarks the main contribution of this paper is to propose a fuzzy evidential reasoning based method for spc routing selection when using the fuzzy logic based method for selection of the spc routings it is hard to precisely describe the output variables using the traditional if then rules therefore this paper introduces the belief degree to construct the extended if then rules for inference from the results of the spc routing selection the proposed method can well address the above mentioned problem and be applied to actual case studies in the field the paper describes the application of the methods and techniques to zheneng offshore wind farm in the east chinese sea despite the above contributions and findings this study has some limitations firstly the fuzzy criteria for input variables are derived from existing experience and studies of spc when it will be applied to other cases more sources of data should be used to define the fuzzy criteria secondly the influencing factors and attributes used in this paper are suitable for the east china sea when the proposed method will be applied to other territorial waters the influencing factors and decision attributes should be adjusted according to the specific characteristics thirdly this study focuses more on objective attributes and concerns little on social issues social and environmental impact on the spc routing selection should be taken into consideration in the future acknowledgments the research presented in this paper is supported by the national science foundation of china grant no 51809206 and 51909017 the china scholarship council

22348,offshore wind farms have developed fast as an environmentally friendly source of energy the submarine power cable of the offshore wind farm used for connecting power generation devices to onshore equipment may have a significant impact on navigation safety and is prone to being damaged e g caused by fishing or emergency anchoring by ships when adopting unfavorable routing this paper proposes a fuzzy evidential reasoning method for submarine power cable routing selection of the offshore wind farm by comprehensively considering the conditions for cable laying and its influence on maritime safety the kernel of this approach is to establish a three layer decision making framework after fuzzification of the input variables to derive the belief rule base and to obtain the optimal routing from the submarine power cable candidates using evidential reasoning and index value the proposed approach is applied to a real routing selection problem of a submarine power cable for an offshore wind farm in zhejiang province of china the resulting choice corresponds to the discussions in a workshop unanimously keywords offshore wind farm submarine power cable routing decision making navigational environment fuzzy evidential reasoning maritime safety 1 introduction the offshore wind farm has developed fast worldwide as a renewable energy source for comparatively good social environmental and climate benefits in recent years chancham et al 2017 firestone et al 2018 higgins and foley 2014 kota et al 2015 by the end of 2017 there was a total of 5387 mw offshore wind capacity in operation in the north and baltic seas fraunhofer 2019a with a large marine space with strong wind potential the european offshore wind capacity is estimated to reach up to 150 gw by 2030 vieira et al 2019 ursavas 2017 compared with denmark and uk which began to develop offshore wind power in the early 2000s higgins and foley 2014 china started later but has developed fast in the last five years especially in the southeast coastal sea as shown in fig 1 upon december 2017 the cumulative installed capacity of offshore wind farms approached 2788 mw in china and some new farms are still under construction zheng et al 2018 the submarine power cable spc is an important part of the offshore wind farm which undertakes the function of power transmission see fig 2 of which the routing selection is more than an economic issue since factors such as safety should be also taken into consideration the spc routing should be laid with caution to reduce intersections with channels in busy waterways this is because ships that are in an emergency may take immediate anchoring wu et al 2017b which may cause damage to the cables for different seafloor sediment and cable types the causation factors of cable damage are quite different of which the damage caused by human factors accounts for the most wang et al 2019 qu and meng 2012 around 70 percent of cable failures are caused by fishing and shipping activities in water depths lower than 200 m kordahi and shapiro 2010 the longer the expected routing of the spc the higher is the probability of facing one or more faults due to human activities thus optimization of spc routing selection could facilitate a better decision process and significantly reduce the risk and costs of spc decision making for spc routing selection mainly considers factors of cost technical feasibility safety and reliability and also the sensitive regions e g fishing area which may threaten the safety of submarine cable fischetti and pisinger 2018 schell et al 2017 han and chen 2013 according to taormina et al 2018 cable routing should be selected according to the bathymetry seabed characteristics and economic activities specifically hazardous areas such as anchorages fishing grounds should be avoided worzyk 2009 moreover similar to the spc routing selection the oil pipeline routing can also be found in the literature balogun et al 2015 dey 2006 the existing studies for spc routing selection are summarized as shown in table 1 multi attribute decision making is also widely used for offshore wind farm selection ayodele et al 2018 chaouachi et al 2017 fetanat and khorasaninejad 2015 höfer et al 2016 ho et al 2018 kim et al 2013 2016 2018 wu et al 2018a zhang et al 2018 the criteria including wind resources technical security environmental economic and social factors are often considered for wind farm selection specifically chaouachi et al 2017 proposed an ahp method for the multi criteria evaluation of offshore wind sites by considering the security of electricity supply and energy efficiency fetanat and khorasaninejad 2015 proposed a hybrid multi criteria decision making tool for offshore wind site selection from water depth environmental technical resources and economic aspects ho et al 2018 developed a comprehensive set of criteria including aspects of economy society environment and security for the selection of offshore wind farm sites höfer et al 2016 provided a mcdm method by considering techno economic social political and environmental criteria to evaluate the suitability of the offshore wind farm candidates kim et al 2018 provided guidance for offshore wind farm development in the south korea southwest coast by taking criteria of economic feasibility and social environment conflict into account wu et al 2018a proposed a fuzzy madm method for site selection of offshore wind farm by comprehensively considering the feasibility and maritime safety and divided the influencing factors into four attributes i e wind resource natural environment traffic environment conditions for wind turbine fuzzy logic is widely used for integrating these criteria to deal with uncertainties caused by the scarcity of data fuzzy logic fuzzy decision trees fuzzy ahp and picture fuzzy set pfss fetanat and khorasaninejad 2015 khakzad et al 2017 xue et al 2019 yang et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2018b wu et al 2019 have been developed to achieve reasonable decisions fuzzy approaches can effectively describe both the qualitative and quantitative factors by using fuzzy sets however this approach may lose some useful information because it uses the traditional if then rules to describe the relationship between input variables and output variables yang et al 2009 specifically the traditional if then rules describe the output with a membership degree of 100 in practice this is unrealistic because uncertainty may exist and a belief degree which can precisely describe the output variables could be much more appropriate for spc routing selection to address this problem the evidential reasoning er which has been widely used to deal with such uncertainty wu et al 2017a 2018b zhou et al 2018a is introduced in this paper moreover this method can also cope with incomplete information which is also common in spc routing selection dymova and sevastjanov 2014 liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 the comparison between the proposed fuzzy er and the existing fuzzy approaches is summarized and shown in table 2 generally the fuzzy reasoning and er are two different categories in terms of their inference process the first category is human knowledge based in the form of traditional fuzzy if then rules yang et al 2009 the second category is to capture the nonlinear relationship between different rules and synthesize all the outputs to generate the final conclusion chen et al 2018 liu et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2018a therefore the motivation of this paper is to propose a fuzzy er based method for spc routing selection of offshore wind farm by comprehensively considering the cable reliability maritime safety and environmental protection from this perspective a three layer decision making approach by treating the routing condition navigational environment cable reliability and special zones as four attributes are developed in order to obtain a convincing result some influencing factors related to are identified and quantified from previous studies the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 develops a fuzzy er model for spc routing selection of offshore wind farms by considering the costs environment and maritime safety section 3 applies the proposed methods to zheneng offshore wind farm as a case study and the results show the practicability and feasibility of this approach for spc routing selection of the offshore wind farm the conclusions are drawn and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed in section 4 2 development of a decision making model for spc routing selection 2 1 establish a generic decision making framework the spc routing selection of offshore wind farms is a common decision making issue affected by multiple factors without loss of generality x x 1 x 2 x t t 2 is defined as a set of candidate spc routings for an offshore wind farm y y 1 y 2 y s s 2 is defined as a set of attributes define n t as the overall assessment on the t th cable routing of the offshore wind farm note that the larger the value n t is the better the t th routing of the cable is in order to derive a comprehensive assessment of the multi attribute spc routings of offshore wind farms the decision making framework is established in the following three steps and graphically illustrated as shown in fig 3 first a three layer decision making framework is established after identifying the attributes and influencing factors moreover the input and output variables are fuzzified second the er based method is introduced for the reasoning process and the extended if then rules are used to construct the belief rule base third utility values are assigned to the corresponding linguistic variables and the index value is used for final decision making henceforth the best spc routing of the offshore wind farm can be selected 2 2 identify influencing factors to establish the hierarchical structure the influencing factors of the spc routing should be identified from previous studies or expert experience in multiple attributes decision making firestone et al 2018 ho et al 2018 höfer et al 2016 kim et al 2013 2018 in terms of the costs of spc schell et al 2017 taormina et al 2018 routing length should be considered as the key factor to assess the routing conditions of an offshore wind farm water depth is a distinguishing factor for cable routing selection which will have an impact on the laying of the cable taormina et al 2018 and finally influence the cost of installation maritime safety is the key issue for an offshore wind farm in the busy waterways as there are many ships navigating anchoring or fishing in the nearby channels the routing of the spc will have an impact on ship navigation and operation especially when the ship is not under control and an immediate anchoring could be taken wu et al 2018a 2018b the seafloor sediment seawater corrosion the distance from existing cables are factors to describe the reliability of the cable routing and these factors will influence the construction and maintenance of the cable woo et al 2015 in addition special zones i e natural reverse and fishery should be kept far from the cable routing for environmental protection the explanation of these factors is summarized and listed in table 3 to facilitate the decision making process the categorization of the influencing factors is introduced four attributes which are routing condition rc navigational environment ne cable reliability cr and special zones sz are defined as the parent criteria of the influencing factors thus the hierarchical decision making framework for spc routing selection of offshore wind farms can be established as shown in fig 4 2 3 fuzzy er based approach in spc routing selection the widely used fuzzy approach balmat et al 2009 celik and akyuz 2018 soner et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 cannot precisely describe the output specifically in the fuzzy reasoning process thus er method is introduced for inference in the spc routing selection the fuzzy er based method can be graphically described as shown in fig 5 input influencing factors using linguistic variables or numerical values output the index value of each candidate spc routings to derive the final decision step 1 fuzzification of the influencing factors qualitative influencing factors are identified by linguistic variables while quantitative influencing factors described using numerical values are fuzzified by linguistic variables step 2 introduce the er based approach to derive the belief rule base using the if then rules step 3 apply the transformation technique to link the influencing factors directly into decision variables which is specifically explained in sec 2 6 step 4 calculate the activation weight of each reasoning rule using the equation θ k n 1 5 α n j n k k 1 125 n 1 5 α n j n k k 1 2 j after derivation of the activation weight for each rule the influencing factors can be integrated to derive the index values 2 4 fuzzification of the input and output variables in order to facilitate the decision making process the input and output variables should be fuzzified to organize information for the input variables quantitative influencing factors and qualitative influencing factors are fuzzified separately with different methods expert judgment and membership functions are two methods widely used in fuzzy logic yang et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 the former method is based on the subjective judgments of multiple experts hence the qualitative influencing factors which are seafloor sediment seawater corrosion and marine nature reserve are defined by fuzzy linguistic variables on the other hand the triangle membership function which is commonly used in the previous studies coşgun et al 2014 wu et al 2018a is introduced to fuzzify the quantitative influencing factors five linguistic variables which are very bad bad moderate good and very good are introduced in this paper the criteria for fuzzification of the input variables are derived on the basis of the existing spc conditions and related rules and regulations the fuzzification of these factors is described in detail as follows cable length cl from the figures of the european offshore wind farms the currently farthest from shore is global tech 1 at a distance of 112 km from the german coast while finland has the shortest average distance to the coast which is 4 km fraunhofer 2019b likewise to investigate the offshore wind farms installed in china dafeng h3 is the farthest from shore at a distance of 43 km spic state power investment corporation 2018 while the average distance is 13 km from the coast of china wikipedia 2018 in this paper 0 4 is assigned to the existing farthest european cable and 0 6 to farthest chinese cable respectively consequently 112 0 4 43 0 6 70 6 to facilitate calculation 70 km is defined as very long for cl similarly 10 km is defined as very short for cl moreover the interval between 70 km and 10 km is divided into five grades as shown in table 4 water depth wd the water depth is a key factor to be considered in the site selection as well as the spc routing selection of the offshore wind farms which is highly related to the technology and foundation cost of the offshore wind farm greater distances from the coast generally go hand in hand with increasing water depths in european countries the offshore wind turbines in the german exclusive economic zone awz are situated in the greatest average water depth at 29 m most of the projects are located in the water depths of up to 40 m fraunhofer 2019b however regarding the technical and economic constraints the water depth of a suitable offshore wind farm site should be less than 60 m chaouachi et al 2017 in china turbines are erected in more shallow water ranging from 5 m to 13 m wikipedia 2018 thus the water depth of 5 m is assumed to be very shallow and 60 m is treated as very deep in this paper according to the triangular membership function 40 50 60 are defined as the fuzzy numbers for the linguistic variable very bad similarly 30 40 50 20 30 40 10 20 30 and 5 10 20 are defined as the fuzzy numbers for the linguistic variable bad moderate good and very good respectively channel crossover cc channel crossover is an indicator of the traffic situation which will influence both the laying and maintenance of the spc in the channels in the crossover area with channels and if the ship navigating in the channel is not under control and have to take an immediate anchoring the cable will be prone to being damaged by the anchor therefore the more times of channel crossover with the spc the higher the risk of the spc to be damaged and the crossover times should be managed to be reduced in practice if there is no channel cross over the spc routing it will be easy to protect the spc and to enhance maritime safety according to the national standard gb t 17502 2009 the pre selection of the submarine cable routing should take the shipping lines into consideration and the spcs should cross the channel vertically if applicable although specific constraints for submarine cable crossing over the channel are not mentioned in the standard fewer crossovers could be better from practical aspects through investigation of the world s top five largest offshore wind farms till 2018 the spc of the london array offshore wind farm wikipedia 2019 crosses channels five times on its way to the landing point while the spc of the race bank offshore wind farm does not cross any main channel thus five times is defined as great many for cc and set as the median for the fuzzy numbers similarly zero is set as the median for fuzzy numbers of very less in most cases the spc of offshore wind farm cross channels three times and seldom reach up to ten times thus 3 is set as the lower boundary and 10 is the upper boundary of the fuzzy numbers for great many and 0 0 2 is defined as very less distance from the fairway and anchorage dw and da these two factors have a similar impact on maritime safety but with a little difference in the construction phase the cable laying vessel may disturb the ship navigating in the channel meanwhile the ship mooring in the anchorage will increase the risk of traffic accidents during the cable laying operation period in the maintenance phase various emergency situations such as ship out of control ship stranded ship sinking emergency anchorage may cause damage to the spcs traditionally the distance is defined by the inertial stopping distance which is the distance that the ship stops by using the full astern engine from the navigation experience the inertial stopping distance of a 200 000 deadweight tonnages ship is around 16 times ship length normally 250 300 m which is approximately 16 300 m 4800 m considering there will be larger sized ships navigating in the channels 5 km is used as a very safe distance from the anchorage and channels from the previous study a 1 km buffer zone from the channel is applied to reduce the risk of collision kim et al 2016 thus 0 5 1 1 5 are defined as the fuzzy numbers for moderate when the spc route is very close to the channel or anchorage it is assumed to be very close thus the fuzzy numbers 0 0 0 5 are defined for the linguistic variable very bad distance from the existing cable dc close to the existing cable will influence the installation of the spcs according to the national rules for submarine cable and pipeline protection in china at least 0 5 km should be kept away from the submarine cables mnr ministry of natural resources 2004 therefore 0 5 1 1 5 is defined as moderate and other four linguistic variables are defined similarly as shown in table 4 seafloor sediment and seawater corrosion ss and sc prior to installation a marine survey should be carried out to test the type and thickness of the sediment to see whether it is suitable for cable laying kraus and carter 2018 from the study of sherwood et al 2016 the routing of the cable should be selected carefully to avoid rocky outcrops including reefs and islands and to maximize the intersection of softer sediments additional according to the provisions of gb17502 2009 the spc routing should be kept far from the sensitive geological areas i e exposed bedrock steep cliff groove shallow gas active sand waves moreover the evaluation of the corrosion of the routing area should also be carried out for these two influencing factors five linguistic variables are introduced to fuzzify the impact on spc safety distance from the marine reserve dm the laying of the spcs may cause environmental pollution to the marine reserve for marine environmental protection the national energy bureau neb and state oceanic administration soa have issued laws and regulations that oceanographic project should not cause pollution to the marine reserve neb national energy bureau 2017 according to gb17502 2009 the spc routing should be kept out of the marine reserves as far as possible in some sensitive marine areas marine engineering such as cable laying is forbidden distance from the fishery df the spc routings should avoid crossing the reef fisheries trawl fishery and scallop fisheries sherwood et al 2016 human activities are leading causes of cable faults and repairs and fishing accounts for around half according to the database of 2162 records of reported faults during 1959 2006 see fig 6 thus a protection zone along the spc should be used to avoid damage from the fishery similarly 0 5 km is defined as very close as shown in table 4 taking the dw and da as a reference 5 km is treated as very far from the fishery in order to make a comprehensive assessment of the spc candidate routings the energy company should compromise the above influencing factors the fuzzified input variables are given in detail in table 4 for the output variables which are routing condition rc navigational environment ne cable reliability cr and special zones sz are all fuzzified by using the standard triangular fuzzy numbers with five linguistic variables shown in fig 7 the triangular fuzzy number is widely used in practice coşgun et al 2014 wu et al 2018a which is expressed as m l m u where m is the median for which the membership of m equals to 1 while l and u are the lower boundary and upper boundary separately if some unknown value locates outside l u it means that the variable never belongs to a member of m note that the boundary value is not the best value 2 5 construct a belief rule base using extended if then rules after identifying the influencing factors and defining the corresponding linguistic variables the fuzzy rules should be established to link the input variables and output variables for reasoning the classical fuzzy rule is the if then rule which is widely used in the domain of marine safety wu et al 2018a yang et al 2009 the influencing factors are treated as input variables and the corresponding attribute is treated as the output variable in an if then rule a traditional if then rule can be expressed as follows liu et al 2004 yang et al 2009 1 r k if a 1 k and a 2 k and and a n k then d k k 1 2 l where a i k means the linguistic variables of the i th influencing factors of the corresponding attribute used in the k th rule r k and d k represent the output of the r k rule expressed by one single linguistic variable with a 100 belief degree take the attribute of cr cable reliability as an example the simple if then reasoning rule is established as follows r 1 if the dc of a routing is very close and the ss is very unsuitable and the sc is very strong then the cr is very bad however this rule cannot reflect slight changes of the influencing factors and hard to describe situations with complexity and uncertainty by introducing a belief degree β into the fuzzy rule system the simple if then scheme is extended to assign all possible consequences with a belief degree and a more realistic and informative scheme can be established the generic if then scheme with a belief structure is defined as follows yang et al 2009 2 r k if a 1 k and a 2 k and and a n k then β 1 k d 1 β 2 k d 2 β m k d m where β j k is the belief degree assigned to d j which is the consequent of output variables for the input of a i k and the summation of the belief degree should satisfy j 1 m β j k 1 the belief rule base can precisely reflect the relationships between the influencing factors and the decision attributes with probabilistic uncertainty hence by using the above mentioned rule the extended if then rule with belief degree can be rewritten as follows r 1 if the dc of a routing is very close and the ss is very unsuitable and the sc is very strong then the cr is 0 98 very bad 0 02 bad 0 normal 0 good 0 very good by introducing the belief structure the classical if then rule can be developed to construct the reasoning rule base using belief degree note that belief degrees of the output linguistic variables can be directly judged by experts or derived from matching functions in this paper the max min operation zimmermann 1991 a classical tool to define matching degree between fuzzy sets is selected to describe the similarity between the real input fuzzy set a r and the corresponding fuzzy linguistic variables a i j i hence the matching degree between a r and a i j i can be defined as follows liu et al 2004 3 α i j i m a r a i j i max min μ a r x μ a i j i x where x represents the fuzzy set of the input a r α i j i express the extent to which a r belongs to the defined linguistic variables of the i th attributes therefore the rule base for spc routing selection can be established with the belief structure take the attribute cr as an example since there are three input variables and each with five linguistic terms 125 53 125 rules could be produced to facilitate the belief reasoning process only some selected rules are given in the cr rule base as shown in table 5 the belief rule base for other attributes i e rc ne and sz can also be constructed in the same way evidential reasoning er approach chen et al 2018 yang et al 2009 is further introduced to derive the values of decision criteria which can be implemented as follows step 1 the belief degrees β j k should be transformed into basic probability masses m d k which could be divided into two parts the first part is caused by the relative importance of the k th rule m d k and the other part is derived from the incompleteness of the belief reasoning β j k m d k this process can be achieved by using equations as follows liu et al 2004 yang et al 2009 4 m j k θ k β j k 5 m d k 1 j 1 n m j k 1 θ k j 1 n β j k 6 m d k 1 θ k 7 m d k θ k 1 j 1 n β j k where m j k are support degrees of each r k belongs to the output decision d θ k represents the relevant importance of r k they should satisfy k 1 n θ k 1 and m d k m d k m d k note that θ k is a reflection of the and operator between different input variables to obtain the weight of the k th rule the product operator is introduced to model the and connector and deal with the dependency of influencing factors for cr as follows liu et al 2004 8 θ k i 1 3 α i j i k l 1 125 i 1 3 α i j i l i 1 2 or 3 j 1 j 2 j 3 and j 4 1 or 5 step 2 generate a combined belief degree β j k of each possible d j from all the outputs of r k k 1 2 l suppose m j i k is the combined belief degree of d j by integrating all the outputs of the k th rule and m d i k is the remaining belief degree unassigned to any d j let m j i 1 m j 1 and m d i 1 m d 1 then the overall combined belief degree β j of d j can be calculated as follows liu et al 2004 yang et al 2009 9 d j m j i k 1 k i k 1 m j i k m j k 1 m j i k m d k 1 m d i k m j k 1 10 m d i k m d i k m d i k k 1 2 l 1 11 d m d i k 1 k i k 1 m d i k m d k 1 m d i k m d k 1 m d i k m d k 1 12 m d i k 1 k i k 1 m d i k m d k 1 13 k i k 1 1 j 1 n t 1 t j n m j i k m t k 1 1 k 1 2 l 1 14 d j β j m j i l 1 m d i l j 1 2 n 15 d j β d m d i l 1 m d i l where β j is the normalized belief degree of d j and β d is the normalized remaining unassigned belief degree to any d j 2 6 obtain the optimal scheme via fuzzy link based transformation multiple attributes decision making normally contains three or more levels of criteria with different grades for decision making it is necessary to transform the grades of influencing factors and attributes into the grades of the decision variable a fuzzy link based transformation yang et al 2009 is a technique developed to convert different grades via equivalent standards for the instance of the attribute rc routing condition it belongs to the upper level criteria of spc routing and has two lower level sub criteria cl and wd in the decision making hierarchy the top level event spc routing can be expressed using five linguistic variables which are slightly preferred moderately preferred average preferred and greatly preferred the attribute rc is described with linguistic variables of very bad bad moderate good and very good the influencing factors cl and wd are assessed with the grades of linguistic variables very long long moderate short very short and very deep deep moderate shallow very shallow consequently a transformation link with belief structure between different levels of criteria expressed by linguistic variables can be used to convert the input to output as shown in fig 8 as demonstrated in fig 8 the arrows with the belief degree β indicate the relationships between linguistic variables of decision criteria on different levels note that the summation of the belief degree for each linguistic variable should be equal to 1 for example the influencing factor cl with an expression of short indicates that the level of the attribute rc can be good with a belief degree of 0 8 and very good with a belief degree of 0 2 for the best spc routing scheme the good rc can be transformed into the spc routing as good with a belief degree of 1 and very good rc can be transformed into very good spc routing with a belief degree of 1 in order to rank the spc routing expressed by linguistic variables an appropriate utility value u v should be assigned to each linguistic variable in this paper the utility value of reference as the set 0 0 35 0 55 0 85 1 is used for each grade wu et al 2018b the index value n t for final ranking of the spc routings can be achieved by using the following equation yang et al 2009 16 n t β 1 t 0 β 2 t 0 35 β 3 t 0 55 β 4 t 0 85 β 5 t 1 where β t is the belief degree of the spc routing belongs to the t th grade note that t 1 5 β j t 1 for the t th spc routing candidate consequently the spc routing selection can be conducted by using the index value obviously the larger n t means that the t th spc routing candidate is better generally the best spc routing scheme with the largest index value will be selected 3 application of the proposed method to spc routing selection 3 1 scenario description of the spc routing the zheneng offshore wind farm see fig 9 with an installed capacity of 300 mw is under planning to meet the renewable energy demand in east china distinguished from another offshore wind farm i e dong hai bridge offshore wind farm in this area zhengneng offshore wind farm intends to be developed in the port waters in addition there are three anchorages namely jinshan anchorage for ships transporting dangerous goods jiadian anchorage and chenshan anchorage scattered along the waterway for ships waiting for tide or entry moreover a ten thousand square nautical miles fishing ground is distributed close to the arranged water area which makes it complex for spc routing selection as graphically displayed in fig 9 there are three spc routing candidates for zheneng offshore wind farm which are determined by a workshop with the attendance of stakeholders including msa maritime safety administration soa state oceanic administration traffic planning committee and the energy company note that these three candidate routings should be proposed beforehand this is because the spc routing is an important part attached to the entire offshore wind farm plan which cannot be determined independently from the offshore wind farm in other words the implementation of spc routing selection without considering the conditions of the offshore wind farm will be irrational and inconvincible and the layout of the wind farm determines the majority of the spc routing attributes the basic information of the influencing factors for the three spc routing candidates is derived as shown in table 6 according to the location of the candidate spc routings the detailed information for each decision attribute is obtained from different sources the nautical chart as an essential tool for ship navigation is a graphic representation of some basic data such as water depth seabed landscape tides and currents navigation aids and special zones provided by international hydrographic organization iho from hydrographic surveys therefore information of the sub factors of attributes cl wd cc dw da dm df and dc can be easily derived from the nautical chart differently the attributes ss and sc are derived from the geological survey including the bathymetric survey shallow layer detection and engineering geological investigation 3 2 fuzzification of the influencing factors for spc routing selection by introducing the criteria for fuzzification in table 4 the numerical values of influencing factors can be fuzzified and the results for the three candidates are shown in table 7 specifically the following calculation process is described in detail by taking cl as an example since the cl of no 1 spc routing is 40 3 km the fuzzified values are shown in table 7 and it can be interpreted as the cl of no 1 spc belongs to long with a belief degree 0 03 which is derived by using equation 40 3 40 50 40 0 03 similarly the cl of the no 1 spc routing belongs to moderate with a belief degree of 0 97 hence the cl of no 1 spc routing can be expressed as long 0 03 moderate 0 97 similarly the fuzzified values of the other influencing factors for different candidates can also be derived and shown in table 7 to compare the advantages and disadvantages of the three spc routings their performances can be graphically demonstrated in fig 10 there are five grades namely g1 g2 g3 g4 and g5 representing the preference degrees of each influencing factor if while g1 indicates the lowest degree with slight preference and g5 is the highest degree which is greatly preferred in this figure the different spc routings are indicated by different colored shapes if the data point of an influencing factor falls below the line g3 it means that this influencing factor is a weak item for the overall performance similarly if the data point is located in the green area it reflects that this influencing factor has a good performance for instance the no 1 routing has better performance for the factors of wd dc sc and df than the other two routings but shows worse performances in cc dw and da no 2 and no 3 routings have good performances in da sc and df note that these three candidate routings have good performances in some factors but bad performances on some other factors therefore it is necessary to make a comprehensive evaluation by accommodating all the influencing factors as developed in sec 2 5 the input variables of the three spc routings can be defined with fuzzy values using the max min operation note that the summation of the fuzzy values should be equal to 1 the outputs of the influencing factors from fuzzy link based transformation are displayed in table 8 it can be seen that the output of each influencing factor is different from the original fuzzified result which demonstrates that the importance degree of each influencing factor should be considered in the spc routing selection 3 3 selection of the best spc routing after the transformation of the influencing factors the er method is introduced to integrate the influencing factors the weights of the influencing factors are set the same since the significance of each influencing factor has been considered in the process of fuzzy link based transformation if weights are set again here it is duplicated and could affect the significance of the upper level decision attributes which may cause bias in the final spc routing selection the integration result of no 1 spc routing scheme is shown in fig 11 the utility values for each grade linguistic variable need to be defined in this paper they are defined as slightly preferred is 0 moderately preferred is 0 35 average is 0 55 preferred is 0 85 greatly preferred is 1 0 which is the same with wu et al 2018b as introduced in sec 2 6 the index value n t can be obtained by multiplying the belief degree of each grade with this defined utility value see eq 16 thus the final ranking result for the three candidate spc routings can be derived as shown in fig 12 from the comparative results of the three candidate spc routings no 2 spc routing is the best and no 1 is the worst one the reason is that the no 2 routing has the best navigational environment ne and conditions for channel crossover cc among all candidates moreover it has better performance in the attributes of cr and sz specifically the no 2 spc crosses over channel two times while no 1 and no 3 routing cross over channels three and four times respectively moreover both no 1 and no 3 routings have a segment alongside the fairway which is more prone to being damaged by ships in an emergency in practice the no 2 spc routing has the minimal interaction with ship navigation and the lowest probability to be damaged by human activities which also suggests a reduction of the maintenance cost of spc during the operation period although no 1 candidate routing has good performance in wd dc sc and df it is the worst scheme according to the comprehensive assessment because of the worst performance in the attributes of dw and da in other words this candidate routing has significant impacts on the fairway and anchorage which may consequently cause damage to the spc the final selection demonstrates that the decision being made from the proposed method is identical with the result discussed in the workshop which shows that the proposed model is beneficial for spc routing selection of the offshore wind farm in fact the spc routing with minimal interaction with ship navigation is selected it is beneficial for both installation and operation for the spc which could consequently enhance the safety of the spc and reduce the operation and maintenance costs 4 concluding remarks the main contribution of this paper is to propose a fuzzy evidential reasoning based method for spc routing selection when using the fuzzy logic based method for selection of the spc routings it is hard to precisely describe the output variables using the traditional if then rules therefore this paper introduces the belief degree to construct the extended if then rules for inference from the results of the spc routing selection the proposed method can well address the above mentioned problem and be applied to actual case studies in the field the paper describes the application of the methods and techniques to zheneng offshore wind farm in the east chinese sea despite the above contributions and findings this study has some limitations firstly the fuzzy criteria for input variables are derived from existing experience and studies of spc when it will be applied to other cases more sources of data should be used to define the fuzzy criteria secondly the influencing factors and attributes used in this paper are suitable for the east china sea when the proposed method will be applied to other territorial waters the influencing factors and decision attributes should be adjusted according to the specific characteristics thirdly this study focuses more on objective attributes and concerns little on social issues social and environmental impact on the spc routing selection should be taken into consideration in the future acknowledgments the research presented in this paper is supported by the national science foundation of china grant no 51809206 and 51909017 the china scholarship council

22349,when a stern flap is installed on a high speed surface ship its role is often to reduce the ship resistance however the performance of a stern flap determined based on direct conversion of ship model resistance test results often has a large error in this study the ship model and stern flap coupling resistance tests and self propulsion tests with integrated coupling of a ship propeller rudder stern flap were performed based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes method the hull and propeller motions were based on overlapping grid and sliding mesh technology the results show that while a stern flap reduces the ship resistance it also affects the ship model flow field to a certain extent consequently affecting the propulsion performance of the ship the improvement in ship propulsion performance is one of the main factors contributing to the energy savings achieved by installing a stern flap with a contribution between 30 and 50 the integrated ship propeller rudder stern flap calculation method is significantly improved compared with traditional ship model resistance tests as a means of determining the stern flap performances of full scale ships keywords stern flap wake fraction thrust reduction energy saving mechanism numerical simulation 1 introduction rapidity is one of the most important aspects of ship performance choi et al 2009 for civilian ships rapidity affects their usefulness and economy for military ships rapidity is an important index for evaluating their combat capabilities the stern of a high speed ship is generally designed as a transom stern which is beneficial for the sudden break away of stern flow and the formation of rooster flow ghadimi et al 2016 installing appendages at the stern of a high speed ship to optimize the wake flow field is an important means of improving ship speed at present the most widely used medium high speed ship stern appendage is stern flap brizzolara and villa 2009 when a stern flap is installed on a high speed planning boat the ship resistance is reduced and the attitude of the planning boat at high speed is well controlled buzzi 1998 in the 1970s savitsky and brown 1976 and brown 1971 sorted out the results of previous experiments on stern flaps and planning boats including the navigation attitude control efficiencies of planning boats before and after stern flap installation their propulsion efficiencies and their seakeeping performances yaakob et al 2012 installed five forms of stern flap models on a planning craft and performed towing tank tests to determine the optimum stern flap geometry the experimental results showed that the drag reduction effect was the best when the downward reverse angle was 0 the drag reduction rate of the planning boat at 23 knots was 7 2 and the average drag reduction rate across the entire speed range was 4 5 at the end of the 20th century the u s navy conducted numerous model tests and valuable ship sea trials cave 1993 the results showed that a stern flap is a better energy saving attachment than a wedge subsequently stern flaps have been widely used in surface warships such as ffg 7 ddg 963 and cg 47 cusanelli and hundley 1999 cumming et al 2006 applied a stern flap and stern wedge installed on a fast planning boat to large surface ships their results showed that stern flap installation could not only reduce the ship resistance at the optimum speed by 9 but also reduce the ship resistance in the cruise state the canadian institute of marine technology signed an agreement with the u s department of defense to design a stern flap for a halifax class frigate thornhill et al 2008 the stern flap could reduce the fuel cost of the ship by 5 10 and improve the cavitation performance of the ship propeller heo and lee 2004 by performing a towing tank test and computational fluid dynamics analysis the effects of ship navigation attitude and wake waveform on drag reduction were studied by maki et al 2016 the results showed that the main reason for the decrease in ship resistance is the change of the wake waveform caused by stern flap installation at present the hydrodynamic performances of stern flaps are usually investigated by performing model tests or numerical calculations to determine the ship model resistance and then employing extrapolation to predict the full scale ship performance the results obtained using this method often differ from those of ship sea trials due to the scale effect of the transom stern flow field cusanelli 2009 and the fact that the influence of the propeller performance is not considered moreover few studies have analyzed the drag reduction mechanism of stern flaps and there is no clear understanding of the energy saving mechanism of stern flaps therefore in this study based on a numerical method the drag reduction mechanism of stern flaps was elaborated from the perspective of detailed flow field and ship attitude change while studying the macro mechanical properties of stern flaps considering the influence of stern flaps on propeller and ship propulsion performance the energy saving mechanism of stern flaps was analyzed in a detailed manner the main work of this paper is as follows dtmb5415 was taken as the research object based on overlapping grid technology carrica et al 2007 tezdogan et al 2015 and the effects of stern flaps on the attitude and resistance performance of the ship were predicted in addition the drag reduction mechanism of stern flaps was analyzed from the aspects of waveform hull pressure distribution and attitude change then based on the p4508 propeller stern et al 2011 an integrated numerical simulation of a ship propeller rudder stern flap was conducted by analyzing the waveform hull pressure distribution wake field thrust reduction and wake fraction changes between before and after stern flap installation the effects of the stern flap on the ship resistance and propulsion performance were expounded finally a more accurate prediction method of the powering performance of a ship fitted with stern flaps was obtained which can provide guidance for stern flap design and performance prediction for full scale ships the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows section 2 describes the numerical simulation method section 3 presents the model ship performance analysis method section 4

paper included ship stern flap resistance tests propeller open water tests owts and ship propeller rudder stern flap coupling self propulsion tests spts all of which were based on star ccm software provided by cd adapco 2 1 governing equations and turbulence model the governing equations for incompressible turbulent flow are those for the instantaneous conservation of mass continuity equation and momentum reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation which can be expressed respectively as follows 1 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j p x j x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j s j where u i and u j i j 1 2 3 are the time averaged velocity components p is the time averaged pressure ρ is the fluid density μ is the dynamic viscosity coefficient ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress term and s j is the source term in this study the governing equation was solved by employing a pressure based coupling method in which the convection term is discretized using a second order upwind scheme and the dissipation term is discretized using a second order central difference scheme the shear stress transport sst k w turbulence model was selected to simulate the strong adverse pressure gradient flow field and consider the impact of the shear force exerted by the wall of the model as it is superior to the standard k w and standard k ε models and exhibits desirable advantages when calculating the viscous flow field the blended wall function based on the blended wall law baek et al 2015 was used in this study 2 2 free surface modeling in this study the volume of fluid vof model was used to capture the free surface the vof method involves studying the interfaces of two or more incompatible media and is characterized by the ability to track free liquid surfaces occupying less memory and being easy to implement this method uses a parameter called phase volume fraction α that defines the percentage of specific fluid in each cell of the mesh user guide for star ccm 2017 salian 2019 in this study two types of fluids water and air are defined as α 1 and α 0 respectively 3 α 0 a i r 1 w a t e r in cases where the interface passes through the cells α has a value of 0 α 1 such that 4 α

fluid properties of the given phases the density and viscosity of water and air can be expressed as follows 7 ρ ρ w a t e r α ρ a i r 1 α μ μ w a t e r α μ a i r 1 α 2 3 geometry model the ship model used in this study was a dtmb5415 model with a scale ratio of 24 83 and a length of 5 719 m which was built by insean a transom stern and bulbous bow were adopted in the ship design the selected propeller was the stock propeller p4508 used in the marin 7967 dtmb5415 m model maneuverability test stern et al 2011 the assembled ship propeller rudder self propulsion numerical model and marin tank spt model are compared in fig 1 fig 2 shows three views of the p4508 propeller the numerical model described in this paper does not include a fin stabilizer or bilge keel the main parameters of the model geometry are summarized in table 1 the chord length of a stern flap was investigated previously song et al 2018 in this study parameterized modeling was used to change the length chord length and angle of the stern flap to determine the best performance stern flap model from various perspectives the assembly of the stern flap on the ship model see fig 4 and the definitions of some parameters in the resistance test are shown in fig 3 table 2 summarizes the stern flap parameters 2 4 computational domain the computational domain used in the resistance tests and spts was a half side computational domain and the whole computational domain was used to calculate the open water performance of the propeller in the resistance test the hull motion was captured accurately based on overlapping grid technology at this time the computational domain was divided into two parts the background domain was a cuboid with dimensions of 4 5l pp 1 5l pp 3l pp and the rotation domain was a cuboid with dimensions of 1 15l pp 0 1l pp 0 1l pp as shown in fig 5 the boundary conditions of the inlet bottom and top of the background domain were set to the velocity inlet the outlet was set to pressure outlet and the two sides were symmetric planes in the owts and spts propeller rotation was realized using a sliding mesh wang et al 2014 zhu 2015 the computational domain and boundary conditions of the spts were the same as those of the resistance tests in the owts the shape of the computational domain was set as a cylinder with a diameter of 8d and the distances of the propeller from the inlet and outlet were 3d and 8d respectively 2 5 mesh generation to improve the non uniform flow field simulation accuracy it is necessary to refine the grid in the specific area in this study the cut cell method was used for meshing different sizes of encryption bodies were employed to encrypt surfaces with large curvature changes such as the bow attachment propeller as well as the kelvin wave system propeller wake and other focus areas the meshing of the spt computational domain is shown in fig 6 in the owts mesh refinement was conducted for regions such as tip and hub vortices the grid parameters and numbers of grids in the different tests are summarized in table 3 the y values in resistance tests owts and spts are 30 75 25 65 and 25 75 respectively the average y value in each condition was approximately 40 3 model ship performance analysis method 3 1 resistance characteristics the resistance coefficient c t s of a full scale ship can be expressed as follows 8 c t s c t m 1 k c f s c f m δ c f where 9 c t r t ρ s v 2 2 c f 0 075 lg re 2 2 re l v υ δ c f 105 k s l 1 3 0 64 10 3 here c t is the resistance coefficient of the full scale ship ship model r t is the

coefficient k q open water efficiency of the propeller η and advance coefficient j which are defined as follows 10 j v a n d k t t ρ n 2 d 4 k q b q ρ n 2 d 5 η j k t 2 π k q here t is the propeller thrust q is the propeller torque ρ is the fluid density n is the revolution rate of the propeller and d is the propeller diameter 3 3 self propulsion characteristics in an spt a drag force is pre imposed on the ship model which is called skin friction correction sfc the definition of the sfc recommended by international towing tank conference ittc is as follows 11 s f c 1 2 ρ m s m v m 2 c f m 1 k c f s 1 k δ c f the resistance overcome by the propeller model thrust is r m s f c the thrust deduction fraction at the self propelled point of a full scale ship is as follows 12 t m 1 r m s f c t

η r m k q o k q b w m 1 j n d v m η h m 1 t m 1 w m the propulsion efficiency of the ship model η d is given by 14 η d η 0 m η h m η r m for the relative rotative efficiency η r s and thrust deduction fraction t s the model test data can be directly used because of the weak scale effect 15 η r s η r m t s t m the formula for calculating the wake fraction of a full scale ship is as follows 16 w s t 0 04 w m t 0 04 1 k c f s δ c f 1 k c f m the thrust of the full scale propeller needs to be t s r t s 1 t s its advance coefficient is v a 1 w s v s and its load coefficient is k t j 2 t s ρ s v a 2 d s 2 thus the propulsion efficiency of a full scale propeller η o s can be read from its open water characteristic chart finally the propulsion efficiency of the full scale ship η d s can be obtained according to equation 11 the ittc committee amended this method in 1999 as follows 17 w s e s d 1 1 w s 1 w m 1 w m e s d where w s e s d and w m e s d are the wake fractions of the full scale ship and ship model respectively with energy saving devices and w s and w m are the wake fractions of the full scale ship and ship model respectively the 1999 ittc method is widely used to forecast the energy saving effects of energy saving devices especially the energy saving device behind the propeller by modifying the wake fraction kim et al 2015 in this study the 1999 ittc method was employed to predict the energy saving effects of stern flaps 4 results and discussion 4 1 resistance tests 4 1 1 uncertainty assessment for computational results in the resistance tests the basic size of the mesh was adjusted to generate different numbers of meshes with the same topological structure which are denoted as g1 g2 and g3 according to the mesh density based on those three sets of grids the resistance trim and sinkage of dtmb5415 were monitored at fr 0 28 the results are presented in table 4 fig 7 shows the y distribution of the hull surface based on mesh g1 g2 and g3 respectively as can be seen the ranges of the hull y for the above three sets of grids were 25 70 35 100 and 45 140 respectively the running trim was defined as positive when the bow moved downward and the dynamic sinkage was defined as positive when the hull moved upward the method of grid convergence verification was based on the process described by stern et al 2001 and wilson et al 2004 the convergence ratio r g could be expressed as follows 18 r g s f s m s m s c where s f s m and s c represent the computational results corresponding to fine medium and coarse grids respectively the estimated order of accuracy p r e was calculated as follows 19 p r e ln s m s c s f s m ln r the distance metric to the asymmetric range p g could be refined as follows 20 p g p r e p t h where p t h denotes the theoretical order of accuracy the grid uncertainty was calculated as follows 21 u g 2 45 0 85 p g s f s m r p r e 1 0 p g 1 16 4 p g 14 8 s f s m r p r e 1 p g 1 the calculated grid converge ratio r g distance metric to the asymmetric range p g and grid uncertainty u g are given in table 5 as can be seen from table 4 that the difference between the simulated resistances and sinkages of three sets of grids and insean experimental values is less than 2 olivieri et al 2001 since the trim value is small the trim error is slightly larger table 5 shows that the value of r g obtained from the simulated resistance trim and sinkage is less than 1 which indicates that the mesh converges monotonically the grid uncertainty u g is 2 718 d 1 469 d and 5 5 d respectively where d is the corresponding experimental value olivieri et al 2001 overall the results demonstrate good mesh convergence behavior the resistance tests and spts in this study were conducted using grid g1 4 1 2 resistance test results the velocity points of fr in the range of 0 23 0 41 were simulated and trim and sinkage motion of the ship were allowed in the simulation the simulated objects included dtmb5415 and ship models with the seven kinds of stern flaps mentioned above the resistance trim and sinkage results are presented in figs 8 10 respectively define the variable of ship resistance drag reduction rate j t as 22 j t r f h r b h r b h where r fh and r bh are the total resistances of the stern flap hull and bare hull respectively fig 8 shows that when fr 0 23 stern flap installation has little effect on the ship resistance as all of the ship resistances are within 1 when fr 0 23 the drag reduction rate of the ship model with a stern flap installed increases at first then decreases reaching a maximum at fr 0 36 flap 2 shows the best drag reduction effect among the seven stern flaps when fr is in the range of 0 28 0 41 the average drag reduction rate can reach 5 79 at cruising speed fr 0 28 and maximum speed fr 0 41 the drag reduction rate of flap 2 can reach 3 84 and 5 84 respectively it can be seen from fig 9 that installing flaps 1 7 causes the trim value to change and that with increasing speed the change becomes greater for flap 2 which has the best drag reduction effect the maximum trim variable is 0 227 comparison of the results for flaps 1 2 and 3 shows that flap 2 has the greatest effect on the ship trim comparison of the results for flaps 4 2 and 5 shows that with increasing chord length the change of the ship trim increases similarly for flaps 6 2 and 7 the change of the ship trim increases with increasing stern flap angle fig 10 demonstrates that installing flaps 1 7 causes the ship sinkage to change and that with increasing speed the change becomes greater for flap 2 and fr 0 23 the sinkage reduction is 0 4 mm and when fr 0 41 the sinkage reduction reaches the maximum of 1 7 mm equivalent to 6 85 l pp the magnitude of the relationship among the sinkage values with flaps 1 7 is the same as that of relationship among the trim values based on the different stress directions the ship resistance can be divided into friction resistance r f and pressure resistance r p which represent the area integral of the tangential and normal components of force respectively projected in the direction opposing the ship s movement the measurement of frictional and pressure resistance as reported in this paper was accomplished by cfd software star ccm the contribution rates of friction resistance j f and pressure resistance j p to the total drag reduction are defined respectively as follows 23 j f r f f h r f b h r f h r b h j p r p f h r p b h r f h r b h where r f fh and r f bh are the friction resistances of the stern flap hull and bare hull respectively and r p fh and r p bh are the pressure resistances of the stern flap hull and bare hull respectively fig 11 depicts the variations of the pressure and frictional resistances upon installing flap 2 the results show that the frictional resistance of the ship model does not change much after flap 2 is installed within the drag reduction range the drag reduction contribution rate of the frictional resistance j f is less than 3 and even at low speed the frictional resistance increases after the installation of flap 2 the pressure ship resistance changes obviously and the contribution rate of the pressure resistance j p is more than 97 thus the effect of the stern flap on the ship resistance is mainly due to the reduction of the pressure resistance which is consistent with the results of previous research conducted by the authors song et al 2018 fig 12 shows the distribution of the skin friction coefficient brizzolara and salian 2018 on the hull before and after the installation of flap2 as the ship speed increases the wetted surface area of the dtmb5415 ship model increases especially at the bow which is the reflection of the increase in bow wavemaking and ship sinkage the skin friction coefficient of the stern and stern flap location decreases to a certain extent after the installation of flap2 which is caused by the blocking effect of the stern flap on water flow fig 13 shows the pressure distribution on the hull before and after installing the stern flap at different speeds the pressure coefficients observed in this figure were obtained using song et al 2018 24 c p p ρ g h 1 2 ρ v 0 2 where p is the total pressure ρ is the water density h is the water depth and v 0 is the ship speed it can be seen from fig 13 that for the dtmb5415 ship model the pressure in the bow area increases to a certain extent at fr 0 41 compared with that at fr 0 28 however the pressure in most other areas decreases the change in hull pressure explains why the ship sinks deeper and the trim by stern is greater at higher speeds after installing flap2 the pressure at the stern and stern flap locations increases which increases the lift force there and reduces the trim by stern optimizing the ship resistance performance by adjusting the ship trim is a means of achieving energy savings and emission reduction since trim optimization was recognized as an energy saving measure for ships in the 1980s scholars have conducted a series of studies based on towing tank tests and numerical simulations sun et al 2016 lv et al 2013 to determine the effects of the ship attitude trim and sinkage on the ship resistance in this study the attitude of dtmb5415 was adjusted to the attitude of the ship model fitted with flap 2 the ship model attitude was not allowed to change during the calculation process to elucidate the role of attitude changes in the drag reduction of the stern flap table 6 summarizes the corresponding simulation conditions to achieve a clearer understanding of the role of attitude changes in the drag reduction of the stern flap the drag reduction contribution rate of the attitude change a z was defined as 25 a z r 5415 f i x e d r 5415 f r e e r f l a p 2 f r e e r 5415 f r e e where j flap2 free is the resistance of flap 2 j 5415 free is the resistance of dtmb5415 and j 5415 fixed is the resistance of the dtmb5415 fixed model the calculated results and drag reduction contribution rates of attitude changes are presented in fig 14 it can be seen from this figure that the resistance of the dtmb5415 fixed model is smaller than that of the dtmb5415 free model but the resistance reduction is not significant compared with that of the flap 2 free model for four speeds with fr 0 28 0 32 0 36 and 0 41 a z is between 8 and 20 this shows that the change of ship sailing attitude caused by stern flap installation can reduce the ship resistance to a certain extent but the attitude change is not the main reason for this reduction for a high speed surface warship the stern is usually designed as a transom stern the stern flow field of a transom stern ship has typical characteristics such as a hull hollow and rooster tail fig 15 shows the free surface waveforms at different speeds with and without flap 2 installed unless specified otherwise the dtmb5415 and flap2 in figs 11 and 12 are both allowed trim and sinkage motions it can be seen from this figure that when fr 0 28 and 0 32 the wake flow of dtmb5415 does not break away from the hull and the existence of a hollow is not obvious after the installation of flap 2 the wake flow breaks away from the hull and the characteristics of a rooster tail and hull hollow begin to appear and become more obvious with increasing ship speed when fr 0 36 and 0 41 the wake flow of dtmb5415 begins to separate from the hull to form a hollow and when flap 2 is installed the length of the hull hollow increases and the area of the rooster tail decreases the increase in hollow length and the decrease in wave height of the transom stern flow explain the decrease in ship resistance previous analysis shows that the change in ship attitude caused by the installation of the stern flap will reduce ship resistance in order to eliminate the influence of attitude change and better explain the wave suppression effect of the stern flap it is necessary to analyze the wave pattern change between dtmb5415 fixed model and flap2 free model fig 16 shows the waveform comparison of dtmb5415 and flap2 with the same attitude at different speeds it can be seen from fig 16 that the suppression of wave by stern flap is mainly for the stern wave system which shows the decrease in wave amplitude and the increase in hollow length in addition the wave suppression effect is more obvious with the increase in ship speed which is the reason for the greater decrease in ship resistance at high speeds fig 17 shows the nominal wake field of the ship model with and without flap 2 the circles represent the position of the propeller this figure demonstrates that the thickness of the stern boundary layer increases obviously after installing flap 2 i e the axial velocity at the position of the propeller is reduced when fr 0 28 the lowest velocity v x v 0 at the propeller location is reduced from 0 72 to 0 68 by installing flap 2 meanwhile when fr 0 41 the lowest velocity v x v 0 at the propeller location is reduced from 0 78 to 0 74 by installing flap 2 the area change on both sides of v x v 0 0 98 is the most obvious where the thickness of 0 96 v x v 0 0 98 clearly increases whereas the thickness of 0 98 v x v 0 1 clearly decreases the dimensionless axial velocity was integrated over the whole propeller disk and the results are presented in table 7 it can be seen from this table that the average dimensionless axial velocities when fr 0 28 and 0 41 are reduced by 0 78 and 1 21 respectively by installing flap 2 which is consistent with the previous analysis the change of the wake field was the motivation for the follow up spts 4 2 open water tests the owt calculation method is described in section 2 the shaft speed of the propeller was set to 1320 revolutions per minute rpm and the inlet velocity of the propeller was adjusted to change the advance coefficient when the minimum reynolds number of the model propeller is greater than the critical reynolds number 2 105 the propeller performance is almost independent of the reynolds number ittc 1999 the reynolds number of a propeller is defined as follows 26 r e b 0 75 r v a 2 0 75 π n d 2 υ where v a is the inlet speed b 0 75r is the chord length of blade section at 0 75r n is the shaft speed and υ is the viscosity coefficient in this study the minimum reynolds number for the owts was 3 635 105 which meets the requirements of the ittc procedures fig 18 compares the calculated and experimental values stern et al 2011 of the open water characteristics of the p4508 propeller it can be seen that the calculated thrust coefficient is slightly smaller than that obtained experimentally in addition the calculated torque coefficient is smaller than the experimental value at low reynolds numbers while the calculated value is larger at high reynolds numbers when 0 7 j the calculated propeller efficiency is in good agreement with the experimental value and the error is less than 5 when j 0 7 the error tends to increase but remains within an acceptable range fig 19 depicts the vortex in the longitudinal section in the center plane with different advance speeds this figure indicates that the sliding grid technique and grid topology used in this study could capture the evolution of the hub and tip vortices behind the propeller very well with increasing advance speed the vortex intensity decreases that is the energy loss decreases which is consistent with the propeller efficiency increase 4 3 self propulsion tests before performing the spts the sailing attitude of a ship with all appendages before and after stern flap installation was predicted using overlapping grid technology the spts were based on the attitude of the ship model that had all appendages installed ignoring the slight influence of the propeller on the attitude of the ship the previous results showed that flap 2 had the best drag reduction effect in the spts the self propelled characteristics of the dtmb5415 model before and after installation of flap 2 were studied with fr 0 28 0 32 0 36 and 0 413 in order to be consistent with the experimental conditions fig 20 shows the convergence curve of ship resistance and the propeller thrust when fr 0 413 before 110 s the flow field around the ship model when the shaft speed was zero was solved until the ship resistance tended to converge and then the shaft speed and time step were adjusted to determine the self propulsion point spp of the ship table 8 compares the calculated value of spp with that obtained from the marin test when fr 0 413 the difference between the calculated and marin test values is 5 3 which meets the calculation accuracy requirement the reason for the low shaft speed of the spp may be that the keel and fins were not installed in this study which reduced the hull resistance to a certain extent thereby reducing the shaft speed at the spp fig 21 compares the calculated effective power and the test results cusanelli 2009 it can be seen that the effective power of the ship under the four working conditions employed in this study agrees well with the test values and the overall error is less than 3 5 table 9 and fig 22 compare the full scale ship propulsion performance predictions before and after installing flap 2 it can be concluded that the wake fraction w s increases and thrust deduction fraction t s decreases upon stern flap installation thereby increasing the hull efficiency η hs and ultimately causing the propulsion efficiency η ds to increase the increase in propulsion efficiency is between 0 014 and 0 043 i e between 2 2 and 7 3 the increase at maximum speed is significantly better than that at cruising speed in addition the relative rotative efficiency and open water propeller efficiency at several speeds do not obey uniform change laws and the changes of both are relatively small the presence of a stern flap reduces the spp to a certain extent as the speed increases the reduction increases as well the spp values at the cruising speed and the highest speed decrease by 1 22 and 5 56 rpm respectively there are two main reasons why the spp reduction is larger as the ship speed increases 1 stern flap installation reduces the ship resistance and the resistance decreases more at high speed and 2 from the nominal wake velocity distribution results table 7 it can be seen that the decrease in the axial velocity increases with increasing ship speed and that a decrease in the inlet velocity increases the propeller thrust causing the required shaft speed to decrease fig 23 compares the calculated effective power reduction rate delivered power reduction rate and related sea trial data cusanelli 2009 dtmb5415 is the preliminary design model of ddg51 and the profiles of dd968 and ddg51 are very similar so the sea trial data of the two ships are of high reference value this figure demonstrates that the delivered power p d is greatly reduced by stern flap installation and that the reduction rate of p d is greatly improved compared with that of the effective power p e the average reduction rates of p e and p d at the four speed points are 7 17 and 11 76 respectively which indicates that the propulsion efficiency improvement plays an important role in the energy saving contribution of the stern flap and that with increasing ship speed the promotion of the propulsion efficiency plays a greater role when the ship speed is 20 3 knots the calculated reduction rate of p d is quite different from the sea trial values of the two ships that is the scale effect is obvious which is caused by the different speeds at which ships of different scales begin to form hull hollows at the model scale the transom stern flow field begins to form a hollow in the speed range of 20 3 23 2 knots which is the reason for the obvious difference in the reduction rates of p d at 20 3 and 23 2 knots at speeds of 23 2 26 1 and 30 knots the calculated p d reduction rate coincides well with the sea trial value and the energy saving effect decreases slightly at high speed thus the integrated ship propeller rudder stern flap simulation is a more accurate method of predicting the energy saving effects of stern flaps than model resistance tests the resistance test results show that under bare hull conditions the influence of the stern flap on traveling wave of the ship is mainly related to improvement of the near wake flow field such as an increase in hollow length and a decrease in rooster tail height fig 24 presents the free surface wave patterns of the ship propeller rudder and ship propeller rudder stern flaps it can be seen from this figure that the rooster tail height and hollow length decrease to a certain extent in the near wake flow field of the ship after installing flap 2 unlike in the resistance test results when fr 0 28 the hull hollow appears in the wake field of the ship after installing flap 2 due to the acceleration of the water flow by the propeller which accelerates the separation of the water flow from the hull the wave height of the far wake flow field also decreases significantly after stern flap installation this improvement is more obvious at high speed fr 0 413 which is the reason for the greater hull resistance reduction under self propelled conditions the propulsion efficiency calculation results demonstrate that the wake fraction increases to a certain extent after stern flap installation fig 25 presents the axial velocity distributions of the cross section x l pp 0 01432 downstream from the propeller disk the propeller wake exhibits asymmetry and the maximum velocity is reached on the inward side where the induced momentum of the propeller is the largest with increasing speed the acceleration effect of the propeller on the wake becomes more obvious the area of the high speed region on the inward side is obviously reduced after installing flap 2 and this effect is more obvious at high ship speed the reasons can be summarized as follows 1 the shaft speed of the propeller is relatively low when flap 2 is installed which weakens the acceleration of the water flow and 2 the existence of the trailing edge down angle of the stern flap reduces the flow speed fig 26 shows the distribution of the skin friction coefficient on the hull surface under spts we can see that the speed of water flow was accelerated by the suction of the propeller so that both the shafting and rudder surface have a large skin friction coefficient after the installation of the stern flap the skin friction coefficient at the stern area was reduced because of the blocking effect of the stern flap and at a high ship speed the influence area of the stern flap was greater and can be extended to the vicinity of the fulcrum shaft fig 27 shows the distributions of the hull pressure coefficients under ship propeller rudder and ship propeller rudder stern flap conditions it demonstrates that the pressure near the stern flap stern and rudder increases to a certain extent after installing flap 2 at high speed the pressure distribution on the hull surface changes more obviously the increase in pressure in the stern area means that the pressure difference between the stern and bow decreases causing the viscous pressure resistance of the hull and the thrust deduction fraction to decrease as well fig 28 depicts the propeller vortex structure wang et al 2017 where the q criterion was applied for clearer visualization of the vortex structure of the propeller to reconstruct the vorticity isosurface q was defined as follows 27 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where ω and s denote the spin and strain rate tensors respectively to obtain fig 28 q was taken to be 100 and the vorticity isosurface was rendered using the dimensionless axial velocity v x v 0 this figure indicates that in the grid encryption region of the propeller the wake vortex structure of the propeller was well captured in addition the tip vortex hub vortex and rudder meet and reconstruct then transmit and evolve downstream from the rudder in the region with a large grid size downstream from the rudder the dissipation of the vortex structure accelerates and it gradually becomes invisible the transfer distance of the hub vortex is longer downstream from the rudder because the vorticity intensity of the hub vortex is greater than that of the tip vortex which can be seen from open water calculation results fig 29 depicts the vorticity distribution behind the propeller in the horizontal section before and after stern flap installation when fr 0 413 this figure demonstrates that the tip and hub vortices of the propeller after flap 2 installation decrease to a certain extent owing to the lower shaft speed of the propeller and the larger advance coefficient which cause the rear vortices of the propeller to decrease based on the drag reduction mechanism described in our previous work song et al 2018 the energy saving mechanism of a stern flap is summarized in fig 30 5 conclusions and future work the interaction between a ship and stern flap and the interaction mechanism of a ship propeller rudder stern flap were simulated using the rans simulation method in this study the results show that as an energy saving appendage a stern flap not only reduces the ship resistance but also improves the propulsion efficiency of the ship which accounts for a considerable proportion of its energy saving contribution an integrated simulation of a ship propeller rudder stern flap proved to be a more accurate means of predicting the energy saving effects of stern flaps than model resistance tests the conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 stern flap installation reduces the flow velocity below the stern thereby increasing the pressure distribution in the installation area 2 the increase in the stern pressure reduces the pressure difference between the stern and the bow thereby reducing the viscous pressure resistance and thrust deduction fraction 3 the decrease in flow velocity at the ship stern and the change in the ship attitude will result in a reduction in the friction coefficient on the hull surface especially at the stern within the drag reduction range the drag reduction contribution rate of the frictional resistance j f is less than 3 4 the change in the ship attitude will reduce the ship resistance by affecting the waveform and its rate of contribution to the drag reduction is approximately 8 20 5 the retarding effect caused by the installation of the stern flap increases the stern boundary layer thickness and decreases the inflow speed of the propeller thereby increasing the propeller thrust 6 the increase in the wake fraction and decrease in the thrust deduction fraction ultimately resulted in improvements to the ship propulsion efficiency the propulsion efficiency improvement is an important factor contributing to the energy savings achievable by installing a stern flap whose contribution to the energy savings can reach 30 50 7 the main role of a stern flap is also reflected in wave suppression under bare hull conditions the influence of the stern flap on the traveling wave of the ship is mainly related to the improvement of the near wake flow field such as an increase in hollow length and a decrease in rooster tail height during self propulsion stages the stern flap also decreases the wave height of the far wake wave system significantly the improvement of the near wake and far wake flow field reduces the wave making resistance of the ship which is the main reason for the ship resistance reduction 8 the ship resistance reduction resulting from the attitude change and wake flow optimization is the main reason for the energy savings achieved by installing a stern flap which is responsible for 50 70 of the energy savings the conclusions of this paper clearly explain the energy saving mechanism of a stern flap simultaneously they reveal that the flow field changes induced by the stern flap installation can be extended to the position of propeller therefore the integrated ship propeller rudder stern flap calculation method is a significant improvement over traditional ship model resistance tests as a means of determining the stern flap performances of full scale ships the authors suggest that researchers consider the changes in propeller performance when evaluating the energy saving effects of mid high speed ship stern appendages such as the stern flap so as to predict its performance more accurately this research demonstrates that a stern flap changes the wake field of the ship and the corresponding shaft speed of the propeller to a certain extent these factors may affect the exciting force characteristics of the ship and change the stealth performance of the ship and the propeller strength therefore it is of critical importance to further explore the influence of stern flaps on ship exciting force characteristics and propeller cavitation performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this

22349,when a stern flap is installed on a high speed surface ship its role is often to reduce the ship resistance however the performance of a stern flap determined based on direct conversion of ship model resistance test results often has a large error in this study the ship model and stern flap coupling resistance tests and self propulsion tests with integrated coupling of a ship propeller rudder stern flap were performed based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes method the hull and propeller motions were based on overlapping grid and sliding mesh technology the results show that while a stern flap reduces the ship resistance it also affects the ship model flow field to a certain extent consequently affecting the propulsion performance of the ship the improvement in ship propulsion performance is one of the main factors contributing to the energy savings achieved by installing a stern flap with a contribution between 30 and 50 the integrated ship propeller rudder stern flap calculation method is significantly improved compared with traditional ship model resistance tests as a means of determining the stern flap performances of full scale ships keywords stern flap wake fraction thrust reduction energy saving mechanism numerical simulation 1 introduction rapidity is one of the most important aspects of ship performance choi et al 2009 for civilian ships rapidity affects their usefulness and economy for military ships rapidity is an important index for evaluating their combat capabilities the stern of a high speed ship is generally designed as a transom stern which is beneficial for the sudden break away of stern flow and the formation of rooster flow ghadimi et al 2016 installing appendages at the stern of a high speed ship to optimize the wake flow field is an important means of improving ship speed at present the most widely used medium high speed ship stern appendage is stern flap brizzolara and villa 2009 when a stern flap is installed on a high speed planning boat the ship resistance is reduced and the attitude of the planning boat at high speed is well controlled buzzi 1998 in the 1970s savitsky and brown 1976 and brown 1971 sorted out the results of previous experiments on stern flaps and planning boats including the navigation attitude control efficiencies of planning boats before and after stern flap installation their propulsion efficiencies and their seakeeping performances yaakob et al 2012 installed five forms of stern flap models on a planning craft and performed towing tank tests to determine the optimum stern flap geometry the experimental results showed that the drag reduction effect was the best when the downward reverse angle was 0 the drag reduction rate of the planning boat at 23 knots was 7 2 and the average drag reduction rate across the entire speed range was 4 5 at the end of the 20th century the u s navy conducted numerous model tests and valuable ship sea trials cave 1993 the results showed that a stern flap is a better energy saving attachment than a wedge subsequently stern flaps have been widely used in surface warships such as ffg 7 ddg 963 and cg 47 cusanelli and hundley 1999 cumming et al 2006 applied a stern flap and stern wedge installed on a fast planning boat to large surface ships their results showed that stern flap installation could not only reduce the ship resistance at the optimum speed by 9 but also reduce the ship resistance in the cruise state the canadian institute of marine technology signed an agreement with the u s department of defense to design a stern flap for a halifax class frigate thornhill et al 2008 the stern flap could reduce the fuel cost of the ship by 5 10 and improve the cavitation performance of the ship propeller heo and lee 2004 by performing a towing tank test and computational fluid dynamics analysis the effects of ship navigation attitude and wake waveform on drag reduction were studied by maki et al 2016 the results showed that the main reason for the decrease in ship resistance is the change of the wake waveform caused by stern flap installation at present the hydrodynamic performances of stern flaps are usually investigated by performing model tests or numerical calculations to determine the ship model resistance and then employing extrapolation to predict the full scale ship performance the results obtained using this method often differ from those of ship sea trials due to the scale effect of the transom stern flow field cusanelli 2009 and the fact that the influence of the propeller performance is not considered moreover few studies have analyzed the drag reduction mechanism of stern flaps and there is no clear understanding of the energy saving mechanism of stern flaps therefore in this study based on a numerical method the drag reduction mechanism of stern flaps was elaborated from the perspective of detailed flow field and ship attitude change while studying the macro mechanical properties of stern flaps considering the influence of stern flaps on propeller and ship propulsion performance the energy saving mechanism of stern flaps was analyzed in a detailed manner the main work of this paper is as follows dtmb5415 was taken as the research object based on overlapping grid technology carrica et al 2007 tezdogan et al 2015 and the effects of stern flaps on the attitude and resistance performance of the ship were predicted in addition the drag reduction mechanism of stern flaps was analyzed from the aspects of waveform hull pressure distribution and attitude change then based on the p4508 propeller stern et al 2011 an integrated numerical simulation of a ship propeller rudder stern flap was conducted by analyzing the waveform hull pressure distribution wake field thrust reduction and wake fraction changes between before and after stern flap installation the effects of the stern flap on the ship resistance and propulsion performance were expounded finally a more accurate prediction method of the powering performance of a ship fitted with stern flaps was obtained which can provide guidance for stern flap design and performance prediction for full scale ships the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows section 2 describes the numerical simulation method section 3 presents the model ship performance analysis method section 4

provided by cd adapco 2 1 governing equations and turbulence model the governing equations for incompressible turbulent flow are those for the instantaneous conservation of mass continuity equation and momentum reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation which can be expressed respectively as follows 1 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j p x j x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j s j where u i and u j i j 1 2 3 are the time averaged velocity components p is the time averaged pressure ρ is the fluid density μ is the dynamic viscosity coefficient ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress term and s j is the source term in this study the governing equation was solved by employing a pressure based coupling method in which the convection term is discretized using a second order upwind scheme and the dissipation term is discretized using a second order central difference scheme the shear stress transport sst k w turbulence model was selected to simulate the strong adverse pressure gradient flow field and consider the impact of the shear force exerted by the wall of the model as it is superior to the standard k w and standard k ε models and exhibits desirable advantages when calculating the viscous flow field the blended wall function based on the blended wall law baek et al 2015 was used in this study 2 2 free surface modeling in this study the volume of fluid vof model was used to capture the free surface the vof method involves studying the interfaces of two or more incompatible media and is characterized by the ability to track free liquid surfaces occupying less memory and being easy to implement this method uses a parameter called phase volume fraction α that defines the percentage of specific fluid in each cell of the mesh user guide for star ccm 2017 salian 2019 in this study two types of fluids water and air are defined as α 1 and α 0 respectively 3 α 0 a i r 1 w a t e r in cases where the interface passes through the cells α has a value of 0 α 1 such that 4 α

fluid properties of the given phases the density and viscosity of water and air can be expressed as follows 7 ρ ρ w a t e r α ρ a i r 1 α μ μ w a t e r α μ a i r 1 α 2 3 geometry model the ship model used in this study was a dtmb5415 model with a scale ratio of 24 83 and a length of 5 719 m which was built by insean a transom stern and bulbous bow were adopted in the ship design the selected propeller was the stock propeller p4508 used in the marin 7967 dtmb5415 m model maneuverability test stern et al 2011 the assembled ship propeller rudder self propulsion numerical model and marin tank spt model are compared in fig 1 fig 2 shows three views of the p4508 propeller the numerical model described in this paper does not include a fin stabilizer or bilge keel the main parameters of the model geometry are summarized in table 1 the chord length of a stern flap was investigated previously song et al 2018 in this study parameterized modeling was used to change the length chord length and angle of the stern flap to determine the best performance stern flap model from various perspectives the assembly of the stern flap on the ship model see fig 4 and the definitions of some parameters in the resistance test are shown in fig 3 table 2 summarizes the stern flap parameters 2 4 computational domain the computational domain used in the resistance tests and spts was a half side computational domain and the whole computational domain was used to calculate the open water performance of the propeller in the resistance test the hull motion was captured accurately based on overlapping grid technology at this time the computational domain was divided into two parts the background domain was a cuboid with dimensions of 4 5l pp 1 5l pp 3l pp and the rotation domain was a cuboid with dimensions of 1 15l pp 0 1l pp 0 1l pp as shown in fig 5 the boundary conditions of the inlet bottom and top of the background domain were set to the velocity inlet the outlet was set to pressure outlet and the two sides were symmetric planes in the owts and spts propeller rotation was realized using a sliding mesh wang et al 2014 zhu 2015 the computational domain and boundary conditions of the spts were the same as those of the resistance tests in the owts the shape of the computational domain was set as a cylinder with a diameter of 8d and the distances of the propeller from the inlet and outlet were 3d and 8d respectively 2 5 mesh generation to improve the non uniform flow field simulation accuracy it is necessary to refine the grid in the specific area in this study the cut cell method was used for meshing different sizes of encryption bodies were employed to encrypt surfaces with large curvature changes such as the bow attachment propeller as well as the kelvin wave system propeller wake and other focus areas the meshing of the spt computational domain is shown in fig 6 in the owts mesh refinement was conducted for regions such as tip and hub vortices the grid parameters and numbers of grids in the different tests are summarized in table 3 the y values in resistance tests owts and spts are 30 75 25 65 and 25 75 respectively the average y value in each condition was approximately 40 3 model ship performance analysis method 3 1 resistance characteristics the resistance coefficient c t s of a full scale ship can be expressed as follows 8 c t s c t m 1 k c f s c f m δ c f where 9 c t r t ρ s v 2 2 c f 0 075 lg re 2 2 re l v υ δ c f 105 k s l 1 3 0 64 10 3 here c t is the resistance coefficient of the full scale ship ship model r t is the resistance of the full scale ship ship model ρ is the fluid density s is the wetted surface of the full scale ship ship model v is the speed of the full scale ship ship model 1 k is the form factor c f is the friction resistance coefficient r e is the reynolds number l is the length at the water level of the full scale ship ship model υ is the viscosity coefficient δ c f is the roughness coefficient and k s is the surface roughness 3 2 open water characteristics the owt results are expressed in terms of the following dimensionless quantities the thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q open water efficiency of the propeller η and advance coefficient j which are defined as follows 10 j v a n d k t t ρ n 2 d 4 k q b q ρ n 2 d 5 η j k t 2 π k q here t is the propeller thrust q is the propeller torque ρ is the fluid density n is the revolution rate of the propeller and d is the propeller diameter 3 3 self propulsion characteristics in an spt a drag force is pre imposed on the ship model which is called skin friction correction sfc the definition of the sfc recommended by international towing tank conference ittc is as follows 11 s f c 1 2 ρ m s m v m 2 c f m 1 k c f s 1 k δ c f the resistance overcome by the propeller model thrust is r m s f c the thrust deduction fraction at the self propelled point of a full scale ship is as follows 12 t m 1 r m s f c t

η r m k q o k q b w m 1 j n d v m η h m 1 t m 1 w m the propulsion efficiency of the ship model η d is given by 14 η d η 0 m η h m η r m for the relative rotative efficiency η r s and thrust deduction fraction t s the model test data can be directly used because of the weak scale effect 15 η r s η r m t s t m the formula for calculating the wake fraction of a full scale ship is as follows 16 w s t 0 04 w m t 0 04 1 k c f s δ c f 1 k c f m the thrust of the full scale propeller needs to be t s r t s 1 t s its advance coefficient is v a 1 w s v s and its load coefficient is k t j 2 t s ρ s v a 2 d s 2 thus the propulsion efficiency of a full scale propeller η o s can be read from its open water characteristic chart finally the propulsion efficiency of the full scale ship η d s can be obtained according to equation 11 the ittc committee amended this method in 1999 as follows 17 w s e s d 1 1 w s 1 w m 1 w m e s d where w s e s d and w m e s d are the wake fractions of the full scale ship and ship model respectively with energy saving devices and w s and w m are the wake fractions of the full scale ship and ship model respectively the 1999 ittc method is widely used to forecast the energy saving effects of energy saving devices especially the energy saving device behind the propeller by modifying the wake fraction kim et al 2015 in this study the 1999 ittc method was employed to predict the energy saving effects of stern flaps 4 results and discussion 4 1 resistance tests 4 1 1 uncertainty assessment for computational results in the resistance tests the basic size of the mesh was adjusted to generate different numbers of meshes with the same topological structure which are denoted as g1 g2 and g3 according to the mesh density based on those three sets of grids the resistance trim and sinkage of dtmb5415 were monitored at fr 0 28 the results are presented in table 4 fig 7 shows the y distribution of the hull surface based on mesh g1 g2 and g3 respectively as can be seen the ranges of the hull y for the above three sets of grids were 25 70 35 100 and 45 140 respectively the running trim was defined as positive when the bow moved downward and the dynamic sinkage was defined as positive when the hull moved upward the method of grid convergence verification was based on the process described by stern et al 2001 and wilson et al 2004 the convergence ratio r g could be expressed as follows 18 r g s f s m s m s c where s f s m and s c represent the computational results corresponding to fine medium and coarse grids respectively the estimated order of accuracy p r e was calculated as follows 19 p r e ln s m s c s f s m ln r the distance metric to the asymmetric range p g could be refined as follows 20 p g p r e p t h where p t h denotes the theoretical order of accuracy the grid uncertainty was calculated as follows 21 u g 2 45 0 85 p g s f s m r p r e 1 0 p g 1 16 4 p g 14 8 s f s m r p r e 1 p g 1 the calculated grid converge ratio r g distance metric to the asymmetric range p g and grid uncertainty u g are given in table 5 as can be seen from table 4 that the difference between the simulated resistances and sinkages of three sets of grids and insean experimental values is less than 2 olivieri et al 2001 since the trim value is small the trim error is slightly larger table 5 shows that the value of r g obtained from the simulated resistance trim and sinkage is less than 1 which indicates that the mesh converges monotonically the grid uncertainty u g is 2 718 d 1 469 d and 5 5 d respectively where d is the corresponding experimental value olivieri et al 2001 overall the results demonstrate good mesh convergence behavior the resistance tests and spts in this study were conducted using grid g1 4 1 2 resistance test results the velocity points of fr in the range of 0 23 0 41 were simulated and trim and sinkage motion of the ship were allowed in the simulation the simulated objects included dtmb5415 and ship models with the seven kinds of stern flaps mentioned above the resistance trim and sinkage results are presented in figs 8 10 respectively define the variable of ship resistance drag reduction rate j t as 22 j t r f h r b h r b h where r fh and r bh are the total resistances of the stern flap hull and bare hull respectively fig 8 shows that when fr 0 23 stern flap installation has little effect on the ship resistance as all of the ship resistances are within 1 when fr 0 23 the drag reduction rate of the ship model with a stern flap installed increases at first then decreases reaching a maximum at fr 0 36 flap 2 shows the best drag reduction effect among the seven stern flaps when fr is in the range of 0 28 0 41 the average drag reduction rate can reach 5 79 at cruising speed fr 0 28 and maximum speed fr 0 41 the drag reduction rate of flap 2 can reach 3 84 and 5 84 respectively it can be seen from fig 9 that installing flaps 1 7 causes the trim value to change and that with increasing speed the change becomes greater for flap 2 which has the best drag reduction effect the maximum trim variable is 0 227 comparison of the results for flaps 1 2 and 3 shows that flap 2 has the greatest effect on the ship trim comparison of the results for flaps 4 2 and 5 shows that with increasing chord length the change of the ship trim increases similarly for flaps 6 2 and 7 the change of the ship trim increases with increasing stern flap angle fig 10 demonstrates that installing flaps 1 7 causes the ship sinkage to change and that with increasing speed the change becomes greater for flap 2 and fr 0 23 the sinkage reduction is 0 4 mm and when fr 0 41 the sinkage reduction reaches the maximum of 1 7 mm equivalent to 6 85 l pp the magnitude of the relationship among the sinkage values with flaps 1 7 is the same as that of relationship among the trim values based on the different stress directions the ship resistance can be divided into friction resistance r f and pressure resistance r p which represent the area integral of the tangential and normal components of force respectively projected in the direction opposing the ship s movement the measurement of frictional and pressure resistance as reported in this paper was accomplished by cfd software star ccm the contribution rates of friction resistance j f and pressure resistance j p to the total drag reduction are defined respectively as follows 23 j f r f f h r f b h r f h r b h j p r p f h r p b h r f h r b h where r f fh and r f bh are the friction resistances of the stern flap hull and bare hull respectively and r p fh and r p bh are the pressure resistances of the stern flap hull and bare hull respectively fig 11 depicts the variations of the pressure and frictional resistances upon installing flap 2 the results show that the frictional resistance of the ship model does not change much after flap 2 is installed within the drag reduction range the drag reduction contribution rate of the frictional resistance j f is less than 3 and even at low speed the frictional resistance increases after the installation of flap 2 the pressure ship resistance changes obviously and the contribution rate of the pressure resistance j p is more than 97 thus the effect of the stern flap on the ship resistance is mainly due to the reduction of the pressure resistance which is consistent with the results of previous research conducted by the authors song et al 2018 fig 12 shows the distribution of the skin friction coefficient brizzolara and salian 2018 on the hull before and after the installation of flap2 as the ship speed increases the wetted surface area of the dtmb5415 ship model increases especially at the bow which is the reflection of the increase in bow wavemaking and ship sinkage the skin friction coefficient of the stern and stern flap location decreases to a certain extent after the installation of flap2 which is caused by the blocking effect of the stern flap on water flow fig 13 shows the pressure distribution on the hull before and after installing the stern flap at different speeds the pressure coefficients observed in this figure were obtained using song et al 2018 24 c p p ρ g h 1 2 ρ v 0 2 where p is the total pressure ρ is the water density h is the water depth and v 0 is the ship speed it can be seen from fig 13 that for the dtmb5415 ship model the pressure in the bow area increases to a certain extent at fr 0 41 compared with that at fr 0 28 however the pressure in most other areas decreases the change in hull pressure explains why the ship sinks deeper and the trim by stern is greater at higher speeds after installing flap2 the pressure at the stern and stern flap locations increases which increases the lift force there and reduces the trim by stern optimizing the ship resistance performance by adjusting the ship trim is a means of achieving energy savings and emission reduction since trim optimization was recognized as an energy saving measure for ships in the 1980s scholars have conducted a series of studies based on towing tank tests and numerical simulations sun et al 2016 lv et al 2013 to determine the effects of the ship attitude trim and sinkage on the ship resistance in this study the attitude of dtmb5415 was adjusted to the attitude of the ship model fitted with flap 2 the ship model attitude was not allowed to change during the calculation process to elucidate the role of attitude changes in the drag reduction of the stern flap table 6 summarizes the corresponding simulation conditions to achieve a clearer understanding of the role of attitude changes in the drag reduction of the stern flap the drag reduction contribution rate of the attitude change a z was defined as 25 a z r 5415 f i x e d r 5415 f r e e r f l a p 2 f r e e r 5415 f r e e where j flap2 free is the resistance of flap 2 j 5415 free is the resistance of dtmb5415 and j 5415 fixed is the resistance of the dtmb5415 fixed model the calculated results and drag reduction contribution rates of attitude changes are presented in fig 14 it can be seen from this figure that the resistance of the dtmb5415 fixed model is smaller than that of the dtmb5415 free model but the resistance reduction is not significant compared with that of the flap 2 free model for four speeds with fr 0 28 0 32 0 36 and 0 41 a z is between 8 and 20 this shows that the change of ship sailing attitude caused by stern flap installation can reduce the ship resistance to a certain extent but the attitude change is not the main reason for this reduction for a high speed surface warship the stern is usually designed as a transom stern the stern flow field of a transom stern ship has typical characteristics such as a hull hollow and rooster tail fig 15 shows the free surface waveforms at different speeds with and without flap 2 installed unless specified otherwise the dtmb5415 and flap2 in figs 11 and 12 are both allowed trim and sinkage motions it can be seen from this figure that when fr 0 28 and 0 32 the wake flow of dtmb5415 does not break away from the hull and the existence of a hollow is not obvious after the installation of flap 2 the wake flow breaks away from the hull and the characteristics of a rooster tail and hull hollow begin to appear and become more obvious with increasing ship speed when fr 0 36 and 0 41 the wake flow of dtmb5415 begins to separate from the hull to form a hollow and when flap 2 is installed the length of the hull hollow increases and the area of the rooster tail decreases the increase in hollow length and the decrease in wave height of the transom stern flow explain the decrease in ship resistance previous analysis shows that the change in ship attitude caused by the installation of the stern flap will reduce ship resistance in order to eliminate the influence of attitude change and better explain the wave suppression effect of the stern flap it is necessary to analyze the wave pattern change between dtmb5415 fixed model and flap2 free model fig 16 shows the waveform comparison of dtmb5415 and flap2 with the same attitude at different speeds it can be seen from fig 16 that the suppression of wave by stern flap is mainly for the stern wave system which shows the decrease in wave amplitude and the increase in hollow length in addition the wave suppression effect is more obvious with the increase in ship speed which is the reason for the greater decrease in ship resistance at high speeds fig 17 shows the nominal wake field of the ship model with and without flap 2 the circles represent the position of the propeller this figure demonstrates that the thickness of the stern boundary layer increases obviously after installing flap 2 i e the axial velocity at the position of the propeller is reduced when fr 0 28 the lowest velocity v x v 0 at the propeller location is reduced from 0 72 to 0 68 by installing flap 2 meanwhile when fr 0 41 the lowest velocity v x v 0 at the propeller location is reduced from 0 78 to 0 74 by installing flap 2 the area change on both sides of v x v 0 0 98 is the most obvious where the thickness of 0 96 v x v 0 0 98 clearly increases whereas the thickness of 0 98 v x v 0 1 clearly decreases the dimensionless axial velocity was integrated over the whole propeller disk and the results are presented in table 7 it can be seen from this table that the average dimensionless axial velocities when fr 0 28 and 0 41 are reduced by 0 78 and 1 21 respectively by installing flap 2 which is consistent with the previous analysis the change of the wake field was the motivation for the follow up spts 4 2 open water tests the owt calculation method is described in section 2 the shaft speed of the propeller was set to 1320 revolutions per minute rpm and the inlet velocity of the propeller was adjusted to change the advance coefficient when the minimum reynolds number of the model propeller is greater than the critical reynolds number 2 105 the propeller performance is almost independent of the reynolds number ittc 1999 the reynolds number of a propeller is defined as follows 26 r e b 0 75 r v a 2 0 75 π n d 2 υ where v a is the inlet speed b 0 75r is the chord length of blade section at 0 75r n is the shaft speed and υ is the viscosity coefficient in this study the minimum reynolds number for the owts was 3 635 105 which meets the requirements of the ittc procedures fig 18 compares the calculated and experimental values stern et al 2011 of the open water characteristics of the p4508 propeller it can be seen that the calculated thrust coefficient is slightly smaller than that obtained experimentally in addition the calculated torque coefficient is smaller than the experimental value at low reynolds numbers while the calculated value is larger at high reynolds numbers when 0 7 j the calculated propeller efficiency is in good agreement with the experimental value and the error is less than 5 when j 0 7 the error tends to increase but remains within an acceptable range fig 19 depicts the vortex in the longitudinal section in the center plane with different advance speeds this figure indicates that the sliding grid technique and grid topology used in this study could capture the evolution of the hub and tip vortices behind the propeller very well with increasing advance speed the vortex intensity decreases that is the energy loss decreases which is consistent with the propeller efficiency increase 4 3 self propulsion tests before performing the spts the sailing attitude of a ship with all appendages before and after stern flap installation was predicted using overlapping grid technology the spts were based on the attitude of the ship model that had all appendages installed ignoring the slight influence of the propeller on the attitude of the ship the previous results showed that flap 2 had the best drag reduction effect in the spts the self propelled characteristics of the dtmb5415 model before and after installation of flap 2 were studied with fr 0 28 0 32 0 36 and 0 413 in order to be consistent with the experimental conditions fig 20 shows the convergence curve of ship resistance and the propeller thrust when fr 0 413 before 110 s the flow field around the ship model when the shaft speed was zero was solved until the ship resistance tended to converge and then the shaft speed and time step were adjusted to determine the self propulsion point spp of the ship table 8 compares the calculated value of spp with that obtained from the marin test when fr 0 413 the difference between the calculated and marin test values is 5 3 which meets the calculation accuracy requirement the reason for the low shaft speed of the spp may be that the keel and fins were not installed in this study which reduced the hull resistance to a certain extent thereby reducing the shaft speed at the spp fig 21 compares the calculated effective power and the test results cusanelli 2009 it can be seen that the effective power of the ship under the four working conditions employed in this study agrees well with the test values and the overall error is less than 3 5 table 9 and fig 22 compare the full scale ship propulsion performance predictions before and after installing flap 2 it can be concluded that the wake fraction w s increases and thrust deduction fraction t s decreases upon stern flap installation thereby increasing the hull efficiency η hs and ultimately causing the propulsion efficiency η ds to increase the increase in propulsion efficiency is between 0 014 and 0 043 i e between 2 2 and 7 3 the increase at maximum speed is significantly better than that at cruising speed in addition the relative rotative efficiency and open water propeller efficiency at several speeds do not obey uniform change laws and the changes of both are relatively small the presence of a stern flap reduces the spp to a certain extent as the speed increases the reduction increases as well the spp values at the cruising speed and the highest speed decrease by 1 22 and 5 56 rpm respectively there are two main reasons why the spp reduction is larger as the ship speed increases 1 stern flap installation reduces the ship resistance and the resistance decreases more at high speed and 2 from the nominal wake velocity distribution results table 7 it can be seen that the decrease in the axial velocity increases with increasing ship speed and that a decrease in the inlet velocity increases the propeller thrust causing the required shaft speed to decrease fig 23 compares the calculated effective power reduction rate delivered power reduction rate and related sea trial data cusanelli 2009 dtmb5415 is the preliminary design model of ddg51 and the profiles of dd968 and ddg51 are very similar so the sea trial data of the two ships are of high reference value this figure demonstrates that the delivered power p d is greatly reduced by stern flap installation and that the reduction rate of p d is greatly improved compared with that of the effective power p e the average reduction rates of p e and p d at the four speed points are 7 17 and 11 76 respectively which indicates that the propulsion efficiency improvement plays an important role in the energy saving contribution of the stern flap and that with increasing ship speed the promotion of the propulsion efficiency plays a greater role when the ship speed is 20 3 knots the calculated reduction rate of p d is quite different from the sea trial values of the two ships that is the scale effect is obvious which is caused by the different speeds at which ships of different scales begin to form hull hollows at the model scale the transom stern flow field begins to form a hollow in the speed range of 20 3 23 2 knots which is the reason for the obvious difference in the reduction rates of p d at 20 3 and 23 2 knots at speeds of 23 2 26 1 and 30 knots the calculated p d reduction rate coincides well with the sea trial value and the energy saving effect decreases slightly at high speed thus the integrated ship propeller rudder stern flap simulation is a more accurate method of predicting the energy saving effects of stern flaps than model resistance tests the resistance test results show that under bare hull conditions the influence of the stern flap on traveling wave of the ship is mainly related to improvement of the near wake flow field such as an increase in hollow length and a decrease in rooster tail height fig 24 presents the free surface wave patterns of the ship propeller rudder and ship propeller rudder stern flaps it can be seen from this figure that the rooster tail height and hollow length decrease to a certain extent in the near wake flow field of the ship after installing flap 2 unlike in the resistance test results when fr 0 28 the hull hollow appears in the wake field of the ship after installing flap 2 due to the acceleration of the water flow by the propeller which accelerates the separation of the water flow from the hull the wave height of the far wake flow field also decreases significantly after stern flap installation this improvement is more obvious at high speed fr 0 413 which is the reason for the greater hull resistance reduction under self propelled conditions the propulsion efficiency calculation results demonstrate that the wake fraction increases to a certain extent after stern flap installation fig 25 presents the axial velocity distributions of the cross section x l pp 0 01432 downstream from the propeller disk the propeller wake exhibits asymmetry and the maximum velocity is reached on the inward side where the induced momentum of the propeller is the largest with increasing speed the acceleration effect of the propeller on the wake becomes more obvious the area of the high speed region on the inward side is obviously reduced after installing flap 2 and this effect is more obvious at high ship speed the reasons can be summarized as follows 1 the shaft speed of the propeller is relatively low when flap 2 is installed which weakens the acceleration of the water flow and 2 the existence of the trailing edge down angle of the stern flap reduces the flow speed fig 26 shows the distribution of the skin friction coefficient on the hull surface under spts we can see that the speed of water flow was accelerated by the suction of the propeller so that both the shafting and rudder surface have a large skin friction coefficient after the installation of the stern flap the skin friction coefficient at the stern area was reduced because of the blocking effect of the stern flap and at a high ship speed the influence area of the stern flap was greater and can be extended to the vicinity of the fulcrum shaft fig 27 shows the distributions of the hull pressure coefficients under ship propeller rudder and ship propeller rudder stern flap conditions it demonstrates that the pressure near the stern flap stern and rudder increases to a certain extent after installing flap 2 at high speed the pressure distribution on the hull surface changes more obviously the increase in pressure in the stern area means that the pressure difference between the stern and bow decreases causing the viscous pressure resistance of the hull and the thrust deduction fraction to decrease as well fig 28 depicts the propeller vortex structure wang et al 2017 where the q criterion was applied for clearer visualization of the vortex structure of the propeller to reconstruct the vorticity isosurface q was defined as follows 27 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where ω and s denote the spin and strain rate tensors respectively to obtain fig 28 q was taken to be 100 and the vorticity isosurface was rendered using the dimensionless axial velocity v x v 0 this figure indicates that in the grid encryption region of the propeller the wake vortex structure of the propeller was well captured in addition the tip vortex hub vortex and rudder meet and reconstruct then transmit and evolve downstream from the rudder in the region with a large grid size downstream from the rudder the dissipation of the vortex structure accelerates and it gradually becomes invisible the transfer distance of the hub vortex is longer downstream from the rudder because the vorticity intensity of the hub vortex is greater than that of the tip vortex which can be seen from open water calculation results fig 29 depicts the vorticity distribution behind the propeller in the horizontal section before and after stern flap installation when fr 0 413 this figure demonstrates that the tip and hub vortices of the propeller after flap 2 installation decrease to a certain extent owing to the lower shaft speed of the propeller and the larger advance coefficient which cause the rear vortices of the propeller to decrease based on the drag reduction mechanism described in our previous work song et al 2018 the energy saving mechanism of a stern flap is summarized in fig 30 5 conclusions and future work the interaction between a ship and stern flap and the interaction mechanism of a ship propeller rudder stern flap were simulated using the rans simulation method in this study the results show that as an energy saving appendage a stern flap not only reduces the ship resistance but also improves the propulsion efficiency of the ship which accounts for a considerable proportion of its energy saving contribution an integrated simulation of a ship propeller rudder stern flap proved to be a more accurate means of predicting the energy saving effects of stern flaps than model resistance tests the conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 stern flap installation reduces the flow velocity below the stern thereby increasing the pressure distribution in the installation area 2 the increase in the stern pressure reduces the pressure difference between the stern and the bow thereby reducing the viscous pressure resistance and thrust deduction fraction 3 the decrease in flow velocity at the ship stern and the change in the ship attitude will result in a reduction in the friction coefficient on the hull surface especially at the stern within the drag reduction range the drag reduction contribution rate of the frictional resistance j f is less than 3 4 the change in the ship attitude will reduce the ship resistance by affecting the waveform and its rate of contribution to the drag reduction is approximately 8 20 5 the retarding effect caused by the installation of the stern flap increases the stern boundary layer thickness and decreases the inflow speed of the propeller thereby increasing the propeller thrust 6 the increase in the wake fraction and decrease in the thrust deduction fraction ultimately resulted in improvements to the ship propulsion efficiency the propulsion efficiency improvement is an important factor contributing to the energy savings achievable by installing a stern flap whose contribution to the energy savings can reach 30 50 7 the main role of a stern flap is also reflected in wave suppression under bare hull conditions the influence of the stern flap on the traveling wave of the ship is mainly related to the improvement of the near wake flow field such as an increase in hollow length and a decrease in rooster tail height during self propulsion stages the stern flap also decreases the wave height of the far wake wave system significantly the improvement of the near wake and far wake flow field reduces the wave making resistance of the ship which is the main reason for the ship resistance reduction 8 the ship resistance reduction resulting from the attitude change and wake flow optimization is the main reason for the energy savings achieved by installing a stern flap which is responsible for 50 70 of the energy savings the conclusions of this paper clearly explain the energy saving mechanism of a stern flap simultaneously they reveal that the flow field changes induced by the stern flap installation can be extended to the position of propeller therefore the integrated ship propeller rudder stern flap calculation method is a significant improvement over traditional ship model resistance tests as a means of determining the stern flap performances of full scale ships the authors suggest that researchers consider the changes in propeller performance when evaluating the energy saving effects of mid high speed ship stern appendages such as the stern flap so as to predict its performance more accurately this research demonstrates that a stern flap changes the wake field of the ship and the corresponding shaft speed of the propeller to a certain extent these factors may affect the exciting force characteristics of the ship and change the stealth performance of the ship and the propeller strength therefore it is of critical importance to further explore the influence of stern flaps on ship exciting force characteristics and propeller cavitation performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this
