4015,the paraná river is ranked among the top ten major rivers of the world during the last century the expansion of agriculture and the construction of large dams strongly modified the upper basin but the middle and lower sections are still among the few free flowing river reaches of this magnitude in the world however the great anthropic pressure in the upper basin coupled with the climate variability of the past fifty years affected the hydrology of the lower reaches in this study we analyzed the hydrological characteristics of the flow regime from 1905 to 2019 based on 10 m resolution satellite images we performed a cartography of the surface waters covering 15 of the middle paraná river floodplain and we analyzed the processes of connectivity for each 50 cm of the river height we related the hydrological changes with the landscape analyses and discussed their potential implication on the ecosystem functioning in other words we highlighted how a regional disturbance in a large river basin affects some hydro geomorphological processes several hundreds of kilometers downstream which potentially involves long term alterations of the structural and functional components of the biota keywords large river floodplain minimum water levels connectivity patterns landscape analysis ecosystem functioning spatiotemporal scale 1 introduction the paraná river basin has suffered great and increasing anthropogenic pressures particularly in its upper part in brazil the construction of many large hydropower plants in the main channel and its tributaries during the 1960s and 1970s ranked the upper paraná river basin upr among the most regulated worldwide fig 1 agostinho et al 2016 this considerable flow regulation was assumed to change the patterns of flow variations downstream in the middle mpr and lower lpr reaches of the paraná river removing principally the extreme low water levels quirós 1990 puig et al 2016 hydroelectricity allowed a rapid development of transportation networks human settlements and industry as a result an intensive form of agriculture has been invading the upr since the 1970s deforestation has increased and sugarcane and coffee trees have been replaced by soybean doyle and barros 2011 quirós 2004 tucci and clarke 1998 for example between 1970 and 2008 agricultural lands increased from 17 to 75 of the upr brazilian area lee et al 2018 this change in land use may have reduced evapotranspiration increased soil erosion and runoff and conduced a larger fraction of rainfall to be transported away from the watersheds as streamflow increasing discharge and baseflow this phenomenon was observed in other river basins of south america as for example in amazon watersheds chaves et al 2008 germer et al 2010 hayhoe et al 2011 another change appearing in the early 1970s and lasting until the late 1990s was increasing precipitations in most part of the paraná basin which were associated to the river growth of the paraná river during this period doyle and barros 2011 as a whole the paraná basin has been affected by several environmental perturbations that are direct or indirect consequences of human activities since the 1970s the consequence has been the alteration of its flow regime the mpr and lpr have a large floodplain free of dams where most of the ecological processes are driven by flood drought cycles iriondo et al 2007 neiff 1990 floodplains are characterized by a high habitat heterogeneity and a diversified biota adapted to the high spatiotemporal heterogeneity ward et al 2002 consequently small changes in the fluvial dynamic may drastically alter biological components and processes since it modifies the hydrologic connectivity tockner and stanford 2002 thus hydrological connectivity becomes a critical factor by influencing landscape diversity i e structural complexity ward and tockner 2001 current velocities and processes affected by flow e g productivity and nutrient spiraling thorp et al 2006 despite its importance no studies have evaluated how the changes in the flow regime of the past fifty years affected the floodplain connectivity patterns in the mpr and lpr there is a need to make an exhaustive analysis of the flow regime and the hydrological connectivity in order to evaluate to what extent flow variation patterns affect the floodplain landscape in the paraná river this would allow to link the ecological and hydrological components of the floodplain ecosystem and should help to better understand possible changes in composition and diversity of the aquatic and riparian communities of the mpr in this study i we calculated the areas of surface waters at different river heights in a section of the mpr floodplain and we analyzed the main patterns of surface water connectivity ii we made a detailed analysis of the flow regime from 1905 to 2019 at the santa fe paraná section focusing on the changes in water levels and flood and drought attributes frequency timing duration and intensity iii we analyzed how these changes affected the patterns of surface water connectivity in the floodplain and iv we discussed the possible effects on the biotic communities of the long term and large scale alterations of the patterns of surface water connectivity in the mpr floodplain 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the paraná river basin covers about 2 600 000 km2 expanding over four countries argentina brazil bolivia and paraguay because of its extension the basin is usually divided in several sub basins here we used a delimitation based on the hydrology of each reach paoli et al 2000 the upper paraná river basin upr as the area from its sources to the confluence with the paraguay river the paraguay basin from its sources to the confluence with the paraná river the middle paraná river basin mpr from the confluence to the tip of the delta located at the south of rosario city and the lower paraná river basin lpr from the tip of the delta to the la plata delta fig 1 the upr presents brazil s major density of population high industrial development and important agricultural activities this region is intensively exploited for energy supply procuring nearly 70 of the electric energy produced in brazil agostinho et al 2007 the hydroelectric potential installed in the 59 largest power plants 56 in the upr whose reservoirs cover more than 20 000 km2 of the water courses upstream of the confluence paraná paraguay represents around 45 gw most of the largest dams were constructed from the 1970s to the beginning of the 1980s in the main channel and the main tributaries such as the paranaíba grande tietê paranapanema and iguazu fig 1 transforming their water courses in a cascade of large reservoirs and increasing significantly the accumulated areas of lentic waters in the upr downstream of the paraguay paraná confluence the mpr constitutes a typical undammed low land river characterized by an anabranching main channel latrubesse 2008 the floodplain is large dissected by large secondary channels numerous minor channels and covered by lakes swamps and residual floodplain channels with a complex dynamic driven by the inputs of discharges and sediments from the main channel sediments are mainly supplied by the andean tributaries of the paraguay river especially by the bermejo river fig 1 which brings close to 90 of the total wash load of the system amsler and drago 2009 the wash load in the mpr was estimated at 1 2 108 t year 1 most of the mpr discharge is given by tropical subtropical rainfalls from the upr in brazil i e when the paraguay river provides a mean annual discharge of 3 800 m3 s 1 to the mpr the upr provides 12 400 m3 s 1 giacosa et al 2000 the floodplain area considered in this study is located between santa fe and rosario cities in the mpr fig 1 this area was preferred because of the field experience of the research team making easier the interpretation of the geospatial analyses the limits of the floodplain area were defined according to iriondo 2007 it covers 3 050 km2 and represents approximately 15 of the total area of the mpr floodplain the width varies between 13 and 40 km and the downstream length of the main channel extends over 120 km according to iriondo and scotta 1979 and iriondo 2007 we differentiated three main geomorphic units see fig 2 the bar plain is the unit influenced by the hydro sedimentological dynamic of the main channel of the paraná river typically braided and composed of a sequence of wide segments and short and well defined contractions the wide segments have several branches with lateral erosion and sedimentation activity forming unstable islands the geomorphic unit on the right bank of the main channel called the tributary deltas is a large area whose landscape is the result of former sediment deposits originated by the tributaries during a recent dry climate probably from 3500 to 1000 1400 years b p iriondo 2007 water discharges were lower than contemporary discharge patterns in all the system and the tributaries did not reach the main channels deposing the sediment loads in lateral positions over the floodplain because the current larger discharges allow permanent connections with the main channels these deltas are inactive as sedimentation systems but undergo several fluvial processes that result in a complex mosaic of minor channels and fluvial lakes covering a large part of the geomorphic unit iriondo 2007 the last geomorphic unit called pre delta in this study located on the left bank of the paraná main channel covers the northern part of the paraná delta even if it is commonly associated with the delta the rising tide does not reach this area and the landscape is essentially dominated by fluvial processes milana and kröhling 2015 this unit is the result of a superimposition of two main geomorphic patterns iriondo and scotta 1979 the area is a long ago hindered drainage plain characterized by a morphology of flat areas with numerous shallow ponds swamps and small accidental channels with the passing of time several minor channels which originated from the left bank of the main channel spread across the unit and formed an intricate network of active meander channels human activities in the study area are essentially fishing and cattle breeding the vegetation cover type is largely determined by the water level fluctuations and by the erosive and sedimentary processes of the channels sandy river banks of the main channels characterized by high erosion sedimentation rates are generally colonized by the pioneer tree species tessaria integrifolia and salix humboldtiana forming the typical willow forests of the paraná river channels with more stable river banks allow the colonization of other tree species such as albizia inundata inga verna erythrina cristagalli and nectandra angustifolia which characterize the gallery forests of the mpr floodplain lower topographic land areas are colonized by herbaceous and bushy vegetation and their composition mainly depends on the tolerance of each species to the intensity duration and frequency of flooding the floodplain lakes i e the areas covered by water most of the time are colonized by rooted and floating aquatic vegetation their composition and density depend on several factors such as lake morphometry depth wind exposure or type of connection with other water bodies more details about the vegetation cover of the study area are available in marchetti et al 2013 2 2 methodology of analysis 2 2 1 relation between river heights and floodplain landscape water level variations were related to the landscape changes in the study area by analyzing at different river heights the cover of emerged and submerged land areas and the patterns of surface water connectivity among floodplain water bodies connectivity patterns were analyzed for the whole study area and also separately for each of the three geomorphic units to do this we used the sentinel 2a and 2b satellite images a single sentinel 2 image of 110 110 km covers the whole study area we considered the four spectral bands of 10 m spatial resolution b2 b3 b4 and b8 corresponding to blue green red and near infrared spectra respectively which allowed the landscape analyses at a fine spatial scale fig 1 we used seven images obtained between the years 2017 and 2020 free of clouds corresponding to river heights spaced about 50 cm from each other river heights from 1 4 to 4 5 m at the santa fe gauging station data supplied by the national directorate of waterways of argentina zero on the gauge corresponds to 8 4 masl winter satellite images were preferred because aquatic vegetation cover is lower than in spring summer and autumn months making it easier to distinguish between land and water see more information about the satellite images in table s1 images were geometrically rectified and in the first step we performed supervised classifications using the four spectral bands as input for each one in the qgis software qgis development team 2019 to differentiate computationally two classes land areas i e any land cover not covered by water e g forests sandbars grasslands and water areas supervised classifications were based on the maximum likelihood algorithm we used small training sites multi pixel circles between 154 and 10735 m2 to avoid covering the two classes in a single class sample and we performed a large number of training sites to encompass the full range of variability within each class from 300 to 800 training sites by class according to the complexity of each image the selection of the training sites based on a visual inspection of original sentinel 2 images was supported by the field experience of the laboratory of hydro ecology s research team the team continually researched flow regime dynamics and its influence on fish and invertebrate assemblages in the area of study from 2009 to 2018 and the comparison of sentinel 2 images with higher spatial resolution images obtained from the historical data set of google earth pro around 2 m spatial resolution more details about google earth images are available in table s1 a confusion matrix was performed to evaluate the accuracy of each supervised classification for this 50 points by class were randomly placed in each of the classifications i e 100 points per image a minimum number of samples recommended to evaluate this type of classifications congalton and green 2019 as for the training site selection the same methodology was implemented to evaluate whether the classes assigned to each of these points in the classifications i e land and water were accurate or not at each river height this methodology made it possible to determine for example that floating aquatic vegetation shallow waters on bars and beaches and some reaches of small channels were classified as land instead of water and parts of gallery forests as floating vegetation instead of land indices derived from the confusion matrix indicated a relatively inaccurate classification of land areas at high water levels e g kappa indices 58 in classifications of images with water heights of 4 1 and 4 5 m versus kappa indices greater than 0 74 in all other classifications table s2 therefore a manual correction was performed to improve the results of the supervised classifications to do this we converted the supervised classifications to vector and modified each of the polygons that presented errors errors were identified according to the same methodology described above for the training site selection manual correction was implemented in all images to standardize the classification methodology however accuracy was only significantly increased for the 4 1 and 4 55 m classifications see the accuracy of each classification before after manual correction in table s2 and the percentage of correction in table s3 then another detailed manual analysis was performed to separate the floodplain water bodies connected or isolated from the main channel at each river height isolated water bodies were those that did not present any visible connections with the surrounding channel network connected to the main channel this distinction was defined according to the connectivity of surface waters i e the connection is true for water through direct connection with the river channels or by lateral overflow of the channels whereas it is not necessarily true for aquatic organisms sediments or other particles finally the areas of land and water bodies connected or isolated from the main channel were determined automatically by the qgis program at each river height 2 2 2 comparative analysis of daily water levels among hydroclimatic periods the complete data base of the daily water levels i e daily water surface elevation recorded at the santa fe gauging station was analyzed from 1905 to 2019 and comparative analyses of the flow variations were performed among hydroclimatic periods we defined four sub periods 1905 1932 1933 1971 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 based on hydroclimatic studies performed on the mpr see below during the 1930s the flow regime of the paraná river started to show negative discharge anomalies resulting in higher intensity of drought and lower frequency of floods antico et al 2014 garcía and vargas 1998 puig et al 2016 rabuffetti et al 2019 this climatic transition was not so marked and no consensus was established among specialists to determine the beginning of this dry period in this study we considered the beginning of this transition to be 1933 which corresponds to the beginning of a succession of significant droughts this second sub period lasted until 1971 a year that marked the transition from a dry to a humid period antico et al 2014 and the end of the significant droughts of the 20th century quirós 1990 2004 after 1971 we considered two different sub periods 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 whose separation marks the end of the last flood of the humid period 1972 1998 and the year 1999 as the beginning of a long period marked by a lower frequency of floods as mentioned by puig et al 2016 and rabuffetti et al 2019 a set of hydrological variables that may have primarily affected the connectivity patterns were defined to characterize the variations of daily water levels floods and droughts among the four sub periods floods were considered when water levels stayed above 4 5 m for more than seven days droughts were considered when water levels stayed under 2 m for more than seven days if during a drought water levels exceeded 2 m but the duration did not exceed two months and water levels did not exceed 3 m high or the duration did not exceed one month and water levels did not exceed 3 5 m high this period was considered within the same drought the flood and drought thresholds were determined according to previous studies performed by the research team which analyzed the connectivity patterns in a sector of the study area abrial et al 2019 espínola et al 2020 and according to the landscape analyses made in the present study variables selected to characterize each of these three hydrologic attributes i e daily water levels droughts and floods were mean maximum minimum amplitude and coefficient of variation by year of water levels frequency of occurrence by year maximum water level and duration by flood and frequency of occurrence by year minimum water level and duration by drought these variables were compared among the four sub periods we analyzed this time series of hydrologic data with data not independent of each other in a descriptive way and not inferential to assess whether the observed patterns within the period covered by the data set could be expected or not by chance consistently we used permutation and bootstrap based statistical analyses because they allow assessing whether the patterns observed in the data are likely or not to have arisen by chance legendre legendre 2012 first to identify hydrologically similar sub periods we performed a cluster analysis of the sub periods based on the mean values of each water level flood and drought variables i e on a matrix of 4 rows 11 columns to represent the sub periods and the hydrological variables respectively the cluster analysis was performed using euclidian distances and the average agglomeration method although alternative measures of distances to continues variables e g manhattan canberra minkowski and agglomeration methods e g ward single complete could also be adequate these measures produced the same results indicating a great dissimilarity between the four sub periods queen and keough 2002 second to assess whether hydrological variables differed among sub periods we compared the independent variables among the four sub periods sub periods as a categorical explanatory variable with four levels the independent variables are numerical mean maximum minimum amplitude and coefficient of variation by year of water levels and binary occurrence of floods and droughts by year coded as 1 if at least one flood drought occurred in a given year and 0 if no flood drought occurred n 114 years for each of these two variables numerical variables were compared using one way analysis of variance with permutation test paovs n 999 permutations this analysis was performed using the function anova 1way legendre 2007 in r r core team 2020 note that all the following analyses were performed in r pairwise permutation tests across sub periods performed through the rcompanion package function pairwisepermutationtest mangiafico 2020 and using the method of bh to adjust p values during multiple comparisons benjamini and hochberg 1995 were performed when paovs indicated general significant differences among sub periods binary variables were compared among sub periods using binomial based generalized models glms significance p 0 05 of explanatory variables i e hydrologic subgroups in glms was assessed by bootstrap based likelihood ratio tests bootlrt number of bootstrap samples 999 for nested models i e by comparison of the glms with and without the presence of the explanatory variable of interest performed using the package pbkrtest function pbmodcomp halekoh and højsgaard 2014 bootstrap based pairwise comparisons bootpw number of bootstrap samples 999 across sub periods implemented through the posthoc package function posthoc labouriau 2020 were performed when bootlrts indicated general significant differences among sub periods third statistical analyses were performed to assess whether the temporal variations of water level and occurrence of floods and droughts among months varied among sub periods for this in three models where water levels numerical variable and occurrence by day of floods and droughts binary variables coded with 1 and 0 for occurrence and non occurrence respectively were the response variables we assessed whether the explanatory variables months categorical variable with twelve levels and sub periods categorical variable with four levels showed a significant interaction a significant interaction between these explanatory variables indicates that the variations of the hydrological variables i e response variables between months depend on the sub period considered the water level model was performed using a two way analysis of variance with permutation test paov n 999 permutations implemented through the function anova 2way unbalanced legendre 2007 mean monthly water levels were preferred as response variable in this paov in order to highlight the main intra annual patterns when the interaction between the explanatory variables month and sub period was significant separated analyses for each sub period were performed considering only the months as explanatory variable and using the function anova 1way legendre 2007 pairwise permutation tests among months were performed through the rcompanion package function pairwisepermutationtest mangiafico 2020 and using the method of bh to adjust p values during multiple comparisons benjamini and hochberg 1995 when paovs indicated general significant differences among months the flood and droughts occurrence models were performed through two binomial based glms significance p 0 05 of explanatory variables i e months and sub periods and their interaction in glms was assessed by bootstrap based likelihood ratio tests bootlrt number of bootstrap samples 999 for nested models i e by comparison of the glms with and without the presence of the explanatory variable of interest performed using the package pbkrtest function pbmodcomp halekoh and højsgaard 2014 bootstrap based 95 confidence intervals number of bootstrap samples 999 of probability of occurrence of floods and droughts by month and for each sub period implemented through the posthoc package function extractci labouriau 2020 were performed when bootlrts indicated general significant differences among sub periods finally an additional analysis to compare the monthly variation of water levels i e intra annual variation among sub periods was performed by calculating pairwise pearson correlation indices these indices were calculated as the correlation of water levels by month i e monthly average between each possible combination of two years of a sub period i e pairwise correlations higher pairwise correlations indicated a higher similarity in the variation of the water levels among months i e intra annual variation between two given years thus by comparing these pairwise correlation indices among sub periods we compared whether the similitude of intra annual water level variation differed among sub periods pairwise correlation indices were compared among sub periods using the function anova 1way paov legendre 2007 when paovs indicated general significant differences among sub periods pairwise permutation tests among sub periods were performed through the rcompanion package function pairwisepermutationtest mangiafico 2020 2 2 3 estimation of landscape changes according to the hydroclimatic periods the first median and third quartiles q1 q2 and q3 respectively of the daily water levels were calculated for the four sub periods 1905 1932 1933 1971 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 these metrics were also calculated for the periods 1905 1971 and 1972 2019 in order to focus on the main hydrological distinction defined by the cluster analysis in the result section comparative analyses of the areas of lands and connected isolated water bodies at q1 q2 and q3 were performed among hydroclimatic periods and among geomorphic units showing the spatiotemporal changes occurred in the surface water connectivity patterns of the study area because landscape analyses were based on satellite images of 2017 2020 the previous comparisons must be considered as an estimation of how hydrological changes may affect the patterns of surface water connectivity but it does not provide an exact representation of how the landscape was in the past at a fine spatial scale some local morphological features e g morphometry of a lake longitudinal profile of a floodplain channel probably changed in the past 100 years however when comparing landscape changes at a coarse spatial scale by geomorphic units in our case landscape comparisons are expected to be representative because the current main features of each geomorphic unit respond to hydrogeomorphic processes that developed a long time ago for example in the bar plain the contractions determined by transverse fractures are planimetrically stable sections where the channel has not shifted over the past 80 years and the current landscape of the tributary deltas originated during the recent dry climate several thousand years ago therefore it can be considered that the current landscape pattern of each geomorphic unit remained similar during the period studied 3 results 3 1 surface water connectivity according to river heights 3 1 1 patterns of surface waters in the study area surface waters within the area studied present important variations according to river heights table 1 at 2 m considered as the level under which drought conditions begin connected and isolated water bodies represent 21 9 and 9 6 of the floodplain area respectively table 1 connected water bodies occupy the well defined channel network whose hydraulic processes make the river bed deeper than the other areas of the floodplain under this river stage most of the connected water bodies have a marked lotic behavior except some large depression areas such as the coronda fluvial lake fig 2 part of the floodplain lakes immediately dry with the falling waters and other remain isolated from the channel network undergoing relatively fast drying processes for example isolated lakes lost 64 of their area during an isolation period of approximately eight months corresponding to the loss of area from the river height of 2 05 to 1 39 m table 1 at an intermediate river height 3 5 m surface waters cover 59 4 of the floodplain area table 1 and 65 of the area of isolated water bodies become connected from 2 to 3 5 m table 1 extensive low land areas are overflowed fig 2 and thus a large portion of the floodplain is represented by lentic water bodies when the river height reaches 4 5 m 85 of the area studied is inundated and the connection among the floodplain water bodies is quasi total isolated lakes represent only 0 04 of the floodplain area this river stage is considered as the beginning of flood conditions 4 connectivity patterns by geomorphic unit three main patterns of surface water connectivity were identified in the study area fig 3 in the geomorphic units of tributary deltas and pre delta at 1 39 m of river height the floodplain is mainly represented by emerged lands 81 3 and 91 3 of the area of each unit respectively table 1 when the river height overpasses 2 05 m connectivity increases rapidly in the low land areas of the tributary deltas and pre delta and inundates a large part of these areas this increase is mainly originated by overflowing of the large shallow areas characterized by homogeneous elevations e g fig 3 shows the flooding process of a low land area of the tributary deltas which occurred mainly from 2 05 to 3 m in the areas of tributary deltas and pre delta characterized by higher lands the morphometry of the floodplain lakes is more constant with water level fluctuations due to a higher elevation of the lake borders the borders present some depressions generally associated with the movement of waters in and out of the lakes in these areas the connectivity processes are not originated by overflowing as mentioned for the low land areas they are mainly due to the connection of the channel network during the rising water levels when the floodplain lakes connect by the input of water where the depressions are located these processes occur at higher water levels mainly at a river height higher than 3 m and most lakes are connected when the river height reaches 4 m see these processes in a high land area of pre delta in fig 3 in the bar plain the main channel and its main branches represent a considerable portion of the area of the geomorphic unit and maintain significant water areas at very low water levels 36 4 of the area at 1 39 m table 1 consequently during the rising waters the increase of surface waters in this unit is not as marked as in the two other units table 1 in general the first input of water occurs from the downstream part of the island whose elevation is usually lower small channels then connect the lakes located within the islands these connections are evident at water levels up to 3 5 m fig 3 4 1 comparison of water level variations among hydroclimatic periods except for the maximum water level and the duration of floods all variables that characterized water levels floods and droughts by year varied among the four sub periods table 2 according to the similitude of mean values of these variables sub periods were clustered in two groups 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 first main period vs 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 second main period fig 4 a this grouping was related to the increase of the minimum water levels from 1972 onward the mean of the lowest daily water levels registered each year increased 1 5 m from 1905 1971 to 1972 2019 fig 4b reflecting the high number of droughts from 1905 to 1971 during this period droughts occurred more frequently their duration was variable but many of them extended over several months and reached very low water levels table 2 such an increase in minimum water levels produced an increase of the mean of the daily water levels of 0 84 m from 1905 1971 to 1972 2019 fig 4b and table 2 because the significant increase in minimum levels starting in 1972 was not accompanied by such an increase in maximum levels the mean of the highest daily water levels registered each year only increased 0 44 m from 1905 1971 to 1972 2019 table 2 a reduction in the amplitude and degree of the water level variation also occurred from this date onward the comparison of the sub periods reflected these changes since the sub periods 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 had lower minimum water levels higher amplitude and coefficient of variation of water levels and higher frequency and lower minimum water levels of droughts than the sub periods 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 table 2 none of the variables that characterized the water levels floods and droughts varied among the sub periods 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 in contrast although the sub periods 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 were grouped together the period 1972 1998 had higher mean minimum and maximum water levels and frequency of occurrence of floods than the sub period 1999 2019 table 2 however the sub periods 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 did not differ in amplitude of water levels coefficient of variation of water levels frequency of occurrence of droughts minimum water levels of droughts and drought duration table 2 the difference of the daily water level patterns between main periods and sub periods is also evident when analyzing their frequency along a hydrometric scale fig 5 more than 25 of the daily water levels were lower than 2 m from 1905 to 1971 while they only reached 2 from 1972 to 2019 see the different shades of brown in fig 5 comparing the sub periods 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 they showed similar patterns characterized by daily water levels proportionally well distributed over the ten ranges but with a tendency of higher percentages up to 4 5 m and lower percentages below 1 5 m during the first sub period then the percentage of high water levels increased radically during the sub period 1972 1998 with 30 of the daily water levels between 2 and 3 5 m and 70 higher than 3 5 m see the different shades of green and blue respectively fig 5 during the sub period 1999 2019 around 60 of the daily water levels oscillated between 2 and 3 5 m and 40 were higher than 3 5 m this latest percentage is comparable with the sub periods 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 see the different blue shades of fig 5 monthly averages of the daily water levels showed high averages from january to july and low ones from august to december fig 6 a however the water level variation throughout the months of the year i e intra annual variation differed among sub periods i e the interaction between the explanatory variables month and sub period was significant paov p 0 005 considering pairwise comparisons among sub periods intra annual variation of water levels did not vary between 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 i e interaction between month and sub period was not significant considering only these sub periods paov p 0 997 and between 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 paov p 0 986 while they were different for all the remaining pairwise comparisons paov p 0 05 in all cases thus the intra annual variation of water levels throughout the months of the year showed two different patterns one common to the sub periods 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 and another to the sub periods 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 however although the periods 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 showed a similar pattern of intra annual variations the first presented monthly averages about 0 5 to 1 m higher than the second fig 6a from 1905 to 1971 marked peaks of high waters occurred during march april during these two months water levels were higher than in any of the other months pairwise permutation based test p 0 05 in all cases and peaks of low waters occurred during september during september water levels were lower than in any of the other months pairwise permutation based test p 0 01 in all cases showing a difference of 2 4 m between the two extreme values of the monthly averages since 1972 the higher average values have extended over several months e g water levels of february march april and may did not differ from each other pairwise permutation based test p greater than 0 1 in all cases and water levels of september have not been as low as those of the remaining months e g water levels of september did not vary with respect to the levels of august and october pairwise permutation based test p greater than 0 5 in both cases reducing the difference between the high and low mean values recorded throughout the months of the year difference of 1 2 m approximately fig 6a however the general pattern observed in fig 6a hides the interannual flow variability which occurred in each sub period for example the mean of the pairwise correlation indices between years were lower than 0 5 in all sub periods indicating relatively high differences among years in the intra annual variability of the water levels fig 6b these differences were higher i e the pairwise correlation indices among years of water levels per month were lower during the sub periods 1972 1998 0 19 0 4 and 1999 2019 0 13 0 4 than during the sub periods 1905 1932 0 45 0 3 and 1933 1971 0 45 0 4 pairwise permutation based tests p 0 01 in all cases and the remaining comparisons among sub periods were not significant p greater than 0 1 in all cases fig 6b thus smaller inter annual variations occurred from 1905 to 1971 the monthly variation of the frequency of droughts differed among all sub periods bootlrt p 0 05 in all cases nonetheless a well defined seasonal pattern of drought frequency was similar during the sub periods 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 fig 7 a b from 1905 to 1971 droughts occurred almost each year most of them from the end of winter to mid spring i e august september and october months fig 7a b but their onset and duration were variable fig 8 a after 1971 droughts were few very short and occurred at any season of the year fig 7c d and fig 8a floods events were generally more frequent during summer autumn and winter months occurring with a higher frequency in the months of march and or april according to the sub periods fig 7a d but nonetheless shorter floods less than three months occurred in any season fig 8b yet some differences should be noted among sub periods from 1905 to 1971 large floods began mostly during summer months principally during february fig 8b after 1971 most of the larger floods started sooner during spring months principally november and december fig 8b also the sub period 1972 1998 presented the higher probability of floods compared to the other sub periods whatever the month considered fig 7a d on the other hand the probability of occurrence of floods during the sub period 1999 2019 was low and relatively homogeneous from december to august probability mainly between 0 1 and 0 2 fig 7d showing a decrease of the flood predictability during this sub period 4 2 comparison of the patterns of surface water connectivity among hydroclimatic periods from 1905 to 1971 connected water bodies covered 20 of the floodplain area at q1 45 at q2 and 67 at q3 fig 9 from 1972 to 2019 about 40 of the floodplain was covered by connected water bodies at q1 60 at q2 and 80 at q3 showing a significant increase of the surface water connectivity during the second main period though the sub periods 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 showed a pattern similar to the main period 1905 1971 the difference is evident when comparing the sub periods 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 from 1972 to 1998 connected water bodies covered 50 of the area studied at q1 65 at q2 and more than 85 at q3 whereas from 1999 to 2019 they covered 35 at q1 45 at q2 and 65 at q3 note that isolated lakes represent a significant portion of water areas in the floodplain at 2 m 30 but decrease rapidly with the rising water levels 21 5 at 2 5 m 15 at 3 m 5 5 at 3 5 m comparing connectivity patterns and taking into account the geomorphic features of the study area the main changes between periods were observed in the pre delta and the tributary deltas from 1905 to 1971 the connected water bodies covered few areas at q1 in these two geomorphic units 10 and 20 of the area of the pre delta and tributary deltas respectively fig 10 these results were similar during the sub periods 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 on the other hand the area of connected water bodies was much higher at q1 in the pre delta and the tributary deltas from 1972 to 1998 45 and 55 respectively and at an intermediary level from 1999 to 2019 25 and 35 respectively when comparing the patterns of surface waters between the two periods 1905 1971 and 1972 2019 differences are obvious fig 11 in the low land areas of the floodplain the difference between the two periods was especially marked at low water levels see the difference of surface waters at q1 between both periods in fig 11b in the other areas of the floodplain the difference between the two periods was smaller than in the low land areas but was still evident at q1 q2 and q3 showing surface waters considerably higher in 1972 2019 compared to 1905 1971 fig 11a c 5 discussion 5 1 a lentification trend in the floodplain from 1972 to 2019 water levels below 2 m at the santa fe gauging station considered as drought conditions in the study represented near 30 of the period 1905 1971 during this period droughts occurred almost every year in the mpr floodplain and many of them lasted several months fig 8 during droughts surface waters represented a low percentage of the floodplain especially in the geomorphic units pre delta and tributary deltas where most of the floodplain lakes were dried or isolated from the channel network under 2 m during the following period 1972 2019 drought periods almost disappeared fig 8a and minimum water levels were higher and essentially comprised between 2 and 3 m representing approximately 25 of the period between these two water levels from 30 to 50 of the area studied is covered by water in the low land areas of the pre delta and the tributary deltas rapid processes of expansion of surface waters occurred from 2 m upward and these areas remained almost totally flooded at 3 m see an example of these processes in the tributary deltas in fig 3 in short these areas periodically dried and flooded before the 1970s remained with significant water areas in the period 1972 2019 fig 11b these changes in the surface water patterns led to a significant increase of lentic environments all year round and a reduction of the dynamic of contraction and expansion processes of surface waters in the area for example the amplitude of water level variations in the study area was 4 2 m from 1905 to 1971 and 3 m from 1972 to 2019 table 2 it was thus reduced by more than one meter from 1972 onward representing a reduction of approximately 30 of its whole amplitude these new conditions in the floodplain can be associated to a process of lentification according to schiesari et al 2019 i e the increase in the availability of lentic freshwater habitats in the landscape directly or indirectly caused by human activities the overall consequence has been a lower ecotone availability for aquatic and terrestrial organisms but larger inundated areas for aquatic organisms this lentification trend was assumed to be the result of dam management upstream in the basin quirós 2004 puig et al 2016 puig et al 2016 analyzed the cumulated regulation effect of dams on the river flow downstream of the cascade of reservoirs in the upper part of the paraná basin they observed that the reconstructed low pulses are eliminated and the magnitude of the high pulses is frequently reduced or even eliminated on occasions these alterations reflect the effect of dam operation and eventual filling periods of large reservoirs and provide support for the reduction in the amplitude of the water level variations and for the loss of the natural conditions of very low water levels in the floodplain from 1972 onward from 1972 to 1998 the streamflow of the paraná river and all major rivers of south america experienced an increased trend garcía and mechoso 2005 the simultaneity of events across the continent suggests a mechanism of generation at a large spatial scale accordingly several studies proposed an association between the increasing trend in streamflows and the warming experienced by the pacific ocean genta et al 1998 antico et al 2014 therefore the cumulative effect of climate and dam management increased the lentification process even more during this period for example surface waters occupied from 60 to the whole study area fig 9 during 70 of this period fig 5 5 2 reduced flow seasonality from 1972 to 2019 the mpr floodplain is located on a subtropical temperate north south axis until the 1970s this river had a marked seasonal flow regime with predictive low flow periods late winter to mid spring 70 90 of probability of occurrence during september fig 7a b and relatively predictive high flow periods mid summer and autumn the common pattern during 1905 1971 displayed large areas of the floodplain recently dried during the springtime warming especially in the pre delta and tributary deltas it can be hypothesized that these areas where organic material and nutrients deposit during water logging and falling waters experienced a rapid growth of vegetation drought periods are generally identified as ecologically vulnerable periods in the mpr since they conduce to significant fish losses by increasing depredation and reducing water quality and quantity in isolated lakes bonetto et al 1969 demonte 2018 but considering that species have the opportunity to evolve adaptations to exploit relatively predictable habitats and resources in a seasonal flow regime southwood 1977 the natural cycle of droughts during spring followed by the increase of water levels during summer was likely to be used by aquatic organisms to take advantage of the greater resource availability of the recently flooded areas from 1972 onward the flow seasonality showed several changes the difference between the periods of high and low waters was reduced fig 6a due to the increase of minimum water levels this led to an increase in similarity of the water levels from year to year in addition the inter annual flow variability increased fig 6b principally due to a change in the seasonal patterns of high flows this is reflected in the large floods that tended to start earlier during the warm season from 1972 onward mid spring while they usually started at mid summer february before 1972 fig 8b and during the recent decades the probability of occurrence of flood events decreased and showed similar values almost year round fig 7d reflecting a decrease in the predictability of floods since 1999 in other river of south america change in flow seasonality and increasing interannual flow variability were assumed to be the result of land use change for example the forest clearing in the ji paraná river basin produced a short term response on hydrological data probably because of the reduction in interception infiltration and evapotranspiration after forest removal linhares et al 2007 and deforestation in the tapajós river basin was expected to cause an increase in flow magnitude and variability farinosi et al 2019 in the upper part of the paraná river deforestation and land use change have increased since the 1970s as commented in the introduction they might have participated at least partially to the alteration of the river flow commented above 5 3 effects on community assemblages from the 1970s the higher interannual flow variability and the lentification trend of the floodplain due the reduced expansion contraction events and the loss of drought conditions participated to an overall reduction of the seasonality of the flow regime species with adaptive responses to seasonal environmental periodicity are likely to be challenged under these new conditions and some changes in composition and diversity patterns of aquatic and riparian organisms may have appeared some further studies in the mpr could illustrate the above mentioned phenomena terrestrial birds find in the temporarily terrestrial environments of the floodplain alternative and complementary habitats to the upland zones in the mpr the occurrence of these habitats decreases with increasing water levels lorenzón et al 2019a similarly non flooded and wet areas such as muddy beaches are used as stopover sites in the mpr by long distance migratory shorebirds e g tringa spp and calidris spp lorenzón et al 2017 as muddy beaches are more abundant at low water levels the higher predictability of spring droughts before 1972 probably provided accessible and adequate stopover sites during the spring migrations of these species in contrast the lentification process later to this date reduced the availability of muddy beaches and probably limited their use by shorebirds waterbirds in contrast should be favored by the floodplain lentification at least in terms of surface of available habitat however kinsgford et al 2004 observed that wetlands with prolonged droughts or floods contained less diversity of waterbirds than wetlands with alternate periods of drought and flood this shows that waterbird diversity is closely related to the amplitude of the water level fluctuations i e the expansion and contraction events within the floodplain this hydrological variability also increases the total bird diversity in the floodplain through the increase of the cyclical temporal turnover of species or temporal beta diversity as a function of hydrological fluctuations kingsford et al 2004 lorenzón et al 2019b this process still maintains a high bird diversity in the paraná river floodplain lorenzón et al 2019b even if the bird species turnover has possibly decreased since the 1970s due to the reduction of expansion contraction events and the disappearance of certain environmental situations such as pronounced droughts in the case of commercial fish species higher frequency of large spring summer floods has been generally associated with higher recruitments in the mpr quirós and cuch 1989 rabuffetti et al 2019 as most of them are periodic strategists and it was observed that they find in the floods the best conditions for reproduction and recruitment during the warm period abrial et al 2018 while the higher frequency of large spring summer floods during the period 1972 1999 should have favored these species e g floods of 1972 73 1979 80 and 1982 84 fig 8 the abundance of specialist species decreased such as the large predators salminus brasiliensis and pseudoplatystoma spp and the seed and fruit eaters brycon orbignyanus and piaractus mesopotamicus fuentes and quirós 1988 quirós 2004 as no evidence in increasing fishing effort and number of fishermen was found from 1930 to 1980 sverlij and espinach ros 1986 flood attributes and fishing pressure are not likely to be sufficient to explain commercial fish recruitment in the mpr as fish species develop ecomorphological traits that accomplish a specific function in the environment winemiller 1991 the historical changes in the patterns of surface water connectivity that occurred in the mpr are relevant in assuming that habitat changes may have participated to the change in commercial catches an illustration of the above remarks can be the rapid decrease of the pacu p mesopotamicus in the study area from the 1970s onward as this species is accustomed to use recently flooded areas to feed on fruits and seeds lovshin 1995 the reduction of contraction and expansion of surface waters may be related to this decrease e g more than 20 of the area of the tributary deltas and pre delta has lost this dynamic and remained almost always inundated fig 10 some other species probably benefited from the large depositional areas of these two geomorphic units using them as feeding areas the main example was the detritivorous prochilodus lineatus with the protractile mouth adapted to feed on mud sverlij et al 1993 which has dominated the commercial catches from the 1970s onward quirós et al 2007 5 4 considerations on the sustainability of the mpr the success of the management policies of the mpr floodplain will depend on a global comprehension of its hydro geomorphological characteristics coupled with climate variations hydrology and geomorphology drive most of the ecological processes in fluvial ecosystems thorp et al 2006 two main processes erosive flooding and flow pulses acting at different time scales control connectivity in a riverine landscape tockner et al 2000 in the mpr great floods occur around two to three times per decade rabuffetti et al 2019 and they can be considered as the modulators of the diversity of successional stages that determine the complexity of the landscape matrix tockner et al 2000 at days to months timescales surface water connectivity among existing landscape elements varies in response to water level fluctuations below bankfull the flow pulses these expansion and contraction processes resulting in repeated changes in landscape heterogeneity are critical to understanding biodiversity patterns tockner et al 2000 espínola et al 2020 as we mentioned above several characteristics of both flood and flow pulses have shown significant changes since the seventies producing considerable alterations in the patterns of surface water connectivity in this sense an interesting point would be to relate the above mentioned alterations to long time biological series this would provide relevant data about how organisms adapt to the modification of the environmental conditions in the mpr on the other hand it is assumed that most river discharges in south america are expected to reduce in the future breda et al 2020 and dry periods to increase in duration and frequency valverde and marengo 2014 a river flow decrease might therefore be envisaged in the coming decades actually the year 2020 has shown exceptionally low water levels in the paraná basin the only drought of such magnitude since 1972 a feedback on how patterns in community assemblages were before the 1970s will help to understand the current biodiversity patterns under conditions of low water levels in the light of climate change and because climatic events tend to be less predictable and more extreme ipcc 2014 it is decisive to understand the ecological responses to a broad range of geomorphic and hydroclimatic conditions in the anthropogenic era where human alterations on aquatic ecosystems are cumulative and degenerative this ecohydrological approach would allow to implement management policies that better conciliate anthropogenic pressure with

4015,the paraná river is ranked among the top ten major rivers of the world during the last century the expansion of agriculture and the construction of large dams strongly modified the upper basin but the middle and lower sections are still among the few free flowing river reaches of this magnitude in the world however the great anthropic pressure in the upper basin coupled with the climate variability of the past fifty years affected the hydrology of the lower reaches in this study we analyzed the hydrological characteristics of the flow regime from 1905 to 2019 based on 10 m resolution satellite images we performed a cartography of the surface waters covering 15 of the middle paraná river floodplain and we analyzed the processes of connectivity for each 50 cm of the river height we related the hydrological changes with the landscape analyses and discussed their potential implication on the ecosystem functioning in other words we highlighted how a regional disturbance in a large river basin affects some hydro geomorphological processes several hundreds of kilometers downstream which potentially involves long term alterations of the structural and functional components of the biota keywords large river floodplain minimum water levels connectivity patterns landscape analysis ecosystem functioning spatiotemporal scale 1 introduction the paraná river basin has suffered great and increasing anthropogenic pressures particularly in its upper part in brazil the construction of many large hydropower plants in the main channel and its tributaries during the 1960s and 1970s ranked the upper paraná river basin upr among the most regulated worldwide fig 1 agostinho et al 2016 this considerable flow regulation was assumed to change the patterns of flow variations downstream in the middle mpr and lower lpr reaches of the paraná river removing principally the extreme low water levels quirós 1990 puig et al 2016 hydroelectricity allowed a rapid development of transportation networks human settlements and industry as a result an intensive form of agriculture has been invading the upr since the 1970s deforestation has increased and sugarcane and coffee trees have been replaced by soybean doyle and barros 2011 quirós 2004 tucci and clarke 1998 for example between 1970 and 2008 agricultural lands increased from 17 to 75 of the upr brazilian area lee et al 2018 this change in land use may have reduced evapotranspiration increased soil erosion and runoff and conduced a larger fraction of rainfall to be transported away from the watersheds as streamflow increasing discharge and baseflow this phenomenon was observed in other river basins of south america as for example in amazon watersheds chaves et al 2008 germer et al 2010 hayhoe et al 2011 another change appearing in the early 1970s and lasting until the late 1990s was increasing precipitations in most part of the paraná basin which were associated to the river growth of the paraná river during this period doyle and barros 2011 as a whole the paraná basin has been affected by several environmental perturbations that are direct or indirect consequences of human activities since the 1970s the consequence has been the alteration of its flow regime the mpr and lpr have a large floodplain free of dams where most of the ecological processes are driven by flood drought cycles iriondo et al 2007 neiff 1990 floodplains are characterized by a high habitat heterogeneity and a diversified biota adapted to the high spatiotemporal heterogeneity ward et al 2002 consequently small changes in the fluvial dynamic may drastically alter biological components and processes since it modifies the hydrologic connectivity tockner and stanford 2002 thus hydrological connectivity becomes a critical factor by influencing landscape diversity i e structural complexity ward and tockner 2001 current velocities and processes affected by flow e g productivity and nutrient spiraling thorp et al 2006 despite its importance no studies have evaluated how the changes in the flow regime of the past fifty years affected the floodplain connectivity patterns in the mpr and lpr there is a need to make an exhaustive analysis of the flow regime and the hydrological connectivity in order to evaluate to what extent flow variation patterns affect the floodplain landscape in the paraná river this would allow to link the ecological and hydrological components of the floodplain ecosystem and should help to better understand possible changes in composition and diversity of the aquatic and riparian communities of the mpr in this study i we calculated the areas of surface waters at different river heights in a section of the mpr floodplain and we analyzed the main patterns of surface water connectivity ii we made a detailed analysis of the flow regime from 1905 to 2019 at the santa fe paraná section focusing on the changes in water levels and flood and drought attributes frequency timing duration and intensity iii we analyzed how these changes affected the patterns of surface water connectivity in the floodplain and iv we discussed the possible effects on the biotic communities of the long term and large scale alterations of the patterns of surface water connectivity in the mpr floodplain 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the paraná river basin covers about 2 600 000 km2 expanding over four countries argentina brazil bolivia and paraguay because of its extension the basin is usually divided in several sub basins here we used a delimitation based on the hydrology of each reach paoli et al 2000 the upper paraná river basin upr as the area from its sources to the confluence with the paraguay river the paraguay basin from its sources to the confluence with the paraná river the middle paraná river basin mpr from the confluence to the tip of the delta located at the south of rosario city and the lower paraná river basin lpr from the tip of the delta to the la plata delta fig 1 the upr presents brazil s major density of population high industrial development and important agricultural activities this region is intensively exploited for energy supply procuring nearly 70 of the electric energy produced in brazil agostinho et al 2007 the hydroelectric potential installed in the 59 largest power plants 56 in the upr whose reservoirs cover more than 20 000 km2 of the water courses upstream of the confluence paraná paraguay represents around 45 gw most of the largest dams were constructed from the 1970s to the beginning of the 1980s in the main channel and the main tributaries such as the paranaíba grande tietê paranapanema and iguazu fig 1 transforming their water courses in a cascade of large reservoirs and increasing significantly the accumulated areas of lentic waters in the upr downstream of the paraguay paraná confluence the mpr constitutes a typical undammed low land river characterized by an anabranching main channel latrubesse 2008 the floodplain is large dissected by large secondary channels numerous minor channels and covered by lakes swamps and residual floodplain channels with a complex dynamic driven by the inputs of discharges and sediments from the main channel sediments are mainly supplied by the andean tributaries of the paraguay river especially by the bermejo river fig 1 which brings close to 90 of the total wash load of the system amsler and drago 2009 the wash load in the mpr was estimated at 1 2 108 t year 1 most of the mpr discharge is given by tropical subtropical rainfalls from the upr in brazil i e when the paraguay river provides a mean annual discharge of 3 800 m3 s 1 to the mpr the upr provides 12 400 m3 s 1 giacosa et al 2000 the floodplain area considered in this study is located between santa fe and rosario cities in the mpr fig 1 this area was preferred because of the field experience of the research team making easier the interpretation of the geospatial analyses the limits of the floodplain area were defined according to iriondo 2007 it covers 3 050 km2 and represents approximately 15 of the total area of the mpr floodplain the width varies between 13 and 40 km and the downstream length of the main channel extends over 120 km according to iriondo and scotta 1979 and iriondo 2007 we differentiated three main geomorphic units see fig 2 the bar plain is the unit influenced by the hydro sedimentological dynamic of the main channel of the paraná river typically braided and composed of a sequence of wide segments and short and well defined contractions the wide segments have several branches with lateral erosion and sedimentation activity forming unstable islands the geomorphic unit on the right bank of the main channel called the tributary deltas is a large area whose landscape is the result of former sediment deposits originated by the tributaries during a recent dry climate probably from 3500 to 1000 1400 years b p iriondo 2007 water discharges were lower than contemporary discharge patterns in all the system and the tributaries did not reach the main channels deposing the sediment loads in lateral positions over the floodplain because the current larger discharges allow permanent connections with the main channels these deltas are inactive as sedimentation systems but undergo several fluvial processes that result in a complex mosaic of minor channels and fluvial lakes covering a large part of the geomorphic unit iriondo 2007 the last geomorphic unit called pre delta in this study located on the left bank of the paraná main channel covers the northern part of the paraná delta even if it is commonly associated with the delta the rising tide does not reach this area and the landscape is essentially dominated by fluvial processes milana and kröhling 2015 this unit is the result of a superimposition of two main geomorphic patterns iriondo and scotta 1979 the area is a long ago hindered drainage plain characterized by a morphology of flat areas with numerous shallow ponds swamps and small accidental channels with the passing of time several minor channels which originated from the left bank of the main channel spread across the unit and formed an intricate network of active meander channels human activities in the study area are essentially fishing and cattle breeding the vegetation cover type is largely determined by the water level fluctuations and by the erosive and sedimentary processes of the channels sandy river banks of the main channels characterized by high erosion sedimentation rates are generally colonized by the pioneer tree species tessaria integrifolia and salix humboldtiana forming the typical willow forests of the paraná river channels with more stable river banks allow the colonization of other tree species such as albizia inundata inga verna erythrina cristagalli and nectandra angustifolia which characterize the gallery forests of the mpr floodplain lower topographic land areas are colonized by herbaceous and bushy vegetation and their composition mainly depends on the tolerance of each species to the intensity duration and frequency of flooding the floodplain lakes i e the areas covered by water most of the time are colonized by rooted and floating aquatic vegetation their composition and density depend on several factors such as lake morphometry depth wind exposure or type of connection with other water bodies more details about the vegetation cover of the study area are available in marchetti et al 2013 2 2 methodology of analysis 2 2 1 relation between river heights and floodplain landscape water level variations were related to the landscape changes in the study area by analyzing at different river heights the cover of emerged and submerged land areas and the patterns of surface water connectivity among floodplain water bodies connectivity patterns were analyzed for the whole study area and also separately for each of the three geomorphic units to do this we used the sentinel 2a and 2b satellite images a single sentinel 2 image of 110 110 km covers the whole study area we considered the four spectral bands of 10 m spatial resolution b2 b3 b4 and b8 corresponding to blue green red and near infrared spectra respectively which allowed the landscape analyses at a fine spatial scale fig 1 we used seven images obtained between the years 2017 and 2020 free of clouds corresponding to river heights spaced about 50 cm from each other river heights from 1 4 to 4 5 m at the santa fe gauging station data supplied by the national directorate of waterways of argentina zero on the gauge corresponds to 8 4 masl winter satellite images were preferred because aquatic vegetation cover is lower than in spring summer and autumn months making it easier to distinguish between land and water see more information about the satellite images in table s1 images were geometrically rectified and in the first step we performed supervised classifications using the four spectral bands as input for each one in the qgis software qgis development team 2019 to differentiate computationally two classes land areas i e any land cover not covered by water e g forests sandbars grasslands and water areas supervised classifications were based on the maximum likelihood algorithm we used small training sites multi pixel circles between 154 and 10735 m2 to avoid covering the two classes in a single class sample and we performed a large number of training sites to encompass the full range of variability within each class from 300 to 800 training sites by class according to the complexity of each image the selection of the training sites based on a visual inspection of original sentinel 2 images was supported by the field experience of the laboratory of hydro ecology s research team the team continually researched flow regime dynamics and its influence on fish and invertebrate assemblages in the area of study from 2009 to 2018 and the comparison of sentinel 2 images with higher spatial resolution images obtained from the historical data set of google earth pro around 2 m spatial resolution more details about google earth images are available in table s1 a confusion matrix was performed to evaluate the accuracy of each supervised classification for this 50 points by class were randomly placed in each of the classifications i e 100 points per image a minimum number of samples recommended to evaluate this type of classifications congalton and green 2019 as for the training site selection the same methodology was implemented to evaluate whether the classes assigned to each of these points in the classifications i e land and water were accurate or not at each river height this methodology made it possible to determine for example that floating aquatic vegetation shallow waters on bars and beaches and some reaches of small channels were classified as land instead of water and parts of gallery forests as floating vegetation instead of land indices derived from the confusion matrix indicated a relatively inaccurate classification of land areas at high water levels e g kappa indices 58 in classifications of images with water heights of 4 1 and 4 5 m versus kappa indices greater than 0 74 in all other classifications table s2 therefore a manual correction was performed to improve the results of the supervised classifications to do this we converted the supervised classifications to vector and modified each of the polygons that presented errors errors were identified according to the same methodology described above for the training site selection manual correction was implemented in all images to standardize the classification methodology however accuracy was only significantly increased for the 4 1 and 4 55 m classifications see the accuracy of each classification before after manual correction in table s2 and the percentage of correction in table s3 then another detailed manual analysis was performed to separate the floodplain water bodies connected or isolated from the main channel at each river height isolated water bodies were those that did not present any visible connections with the surrounding channel network connected to the main channel this distinction was defined according to the connectivity of surface waters i e the connection is true for water through direct connection with the river channels or by lateral overflow of the channels whereas it is not necessarily true for aquatic organisms sediments or other particles finally the areas of land and water bodies connected or isolated from the main channel were determined automatically by the qgis program at each river height 2 2 2 comparative analysis of daily water levels among hydroclimatic periods the complete data base of the daily water levels i e daily water surface elevation recorded at the santa fe gauging station was analyzed from 1905 to 2019 and comparative analyses of the flow variations were performed among hydroclimatic periods we defined four sub periods 1905 1932 1933 1971 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 based on hydroclimatic studies performed on the mpr see below during the 1930s the flow regime of the paraná river started to show negative discharge anomalies resulting in higher intensity of drought and lower frequency of floods antico et al 2014 garcía and vargas 1998 puig et al 2016 rabuffetti et al 2019 this climatic transition was not so marked and no consensus was established among specialists to determine the beginning of this dry period in this study we considered the beginning of this transition to be 1933 which corresponds to the beginning of a succession of significant droughts this second sub period lasted until 1971 a year that marked the transition from a dry to a humid period antico et al 2014 and the end of the significant droughts of the 20th century quirós 1990 2004 after 1971 we considered two different sub periods 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 whose separation marks the end of the last flood of the humid period 1972 1998 and the year 1999 as the beginning of a long period marked by a lower frequency of floods as mentioned by puig et al 2016 and rabuffetti et al 2019 a set of hydrological variables that may have primarily affected the connectivity patterns were defined to characterize the variations of daily water levels floods and droughts among the four sub periods floods were considered when water levels stayed above 4 5 m for more than seven days droughts were considered when water levels stayed under 2 m for more than seven days if during a drought water levels exceeded 2 m but the duration did not exceed two months and water levels did not exceed 3 m high or the duration did not exceed one month and water levels did not exceed 3 5 m high this period was considered within the same drought the flood and drought thresholds were determined according to previous studies performed by the research team which analyzed the connectivity patterns in a sector of the study area abrial et al 2019 espínola et al 2020 and according to the landscape analyses made in the present study variables selected to characterize each of these three hydrologic attributes i e daily water levels droughts and floods were mean maximum minimum amplitude and coefficient of variation by year of water levels frequency of occurrence by year maximum water level and duration by flood and frequency of occurrence by year minimum water level and duration by drought these variables were compared among the four sub periods we analyzed this time series of hydrologic data with data not independent of each other in a descriptive way and not inferential to assess whether the observed patterns within the period covered by the data set could be expected or not by chance consistently we used permutation and bootstrap based statistical analyses because they allow assessing whether the patterns observed in the data are likely or not to have arisen by chance legendre legendre 2012 first to identify hydrologically similar sub periods we performed a cluster analysis of the sub periods based on the mean values of each water level flood and drought variables i e on a matrix of 4 rows 11 columns to represent the sub periods and the hydrological variables respectively the cluster analysis was performed using euclidian distances and the average agglomeration method although alternative measures of distances to continues variables e g manhattan canberra minkowski and agglomeration methods e g ward single complete could also be adequate these measures produced the same results indicating a great dissimilarity between the four sub periods queen and keough 2002 second to assess whether hydrological variables differed among sub periods we compared the independent variables among the four sub periods sub periods as a categorical explanatory variable with four levels the independent variables are numerical mean maximum minimum amplitude and coefficient of variation by year of water levels and binary occurrence of floods and droughts by year coded as 1 if at least one flood drought occurred in a given year and 0 if no flood drought occurred n 114 years for each of these two variables numerical variables were compared using one way analysis of variance with permutation test paovs n 999 permutations this analysis was performed using the function anova 1way legendre 2007 in r r core team 2020 note that all the following analyses were performed in r pairwise permutation tests across sub periods performed through the rcompanion package function pairwisepermutationtest mangiafico 2020 and using the method of bh to adjust p values during multiple comparisons benjamini and hochberg 1995 were performed when paovs indicated general significant differences among sub periods binary variables were compared among sub periods using binomial based generalized models glms significance p 0 05 of

number of bootstrap samples 999 across sub periods implemented through the posthoc package function posthoc labouriau 2020 were performed when bootlrts indicated general significant differences among sub periods third statistical analyses were performed to assess whether the temporal variations of water level and occurrence of floods and droughts among months varied among sub periods for this in three models where water levels numerical variable and occurrence by day of floods and droughts binary variables coded with 1 and 0 for occurrence and non occurrence respectively were the response variables we assessed whether the explanatory variables months categorical variable with twelve levels and sub periods categorical variable with four levels showed a significant interaction a significant interaction between these explanatory variables indicates that the variations of the hydrological variables i e response variables between months depend on the sub period considered the water level model was performed using a two way analysis of variance with permutation test paov n 999 permutations implemented through the function anova 2way unbalanced legendre 2007 mean monthly water levels were preferred as response variable in this paov in order to highlight the main intra annual patterns when the interaction between the explanatory variables month and sub period was significant separated analyses for each sub period were performed considering only the months as explanatory variable and using the function anova 1way legendre 2007 pairwise permutation tests among months were performed through the rcompanion package function pairwisepermutationtest mangiafico 2020 and using the method of bh to adjust p values during multiple comparisons benjamini and hochberg 1995 when paovs indicated general significant differences among months the flood and droughts occurrence models were performed through two binomial based glms significance p 0 05 of explanatory variables i e months and sub periods and their interaction in glms was assessed by bootstrap based likelihood ratio tests bootlrt number of bootstrap samples 999 for nested models i e by comparison of

intervals number of bootstrap samples 999 of probability of occurrence of floods and droughts by month and for each sub period implemented through the posthoc package function extractci labouriau 2020 were performed when bootlrts indicated general significant differences among sub periods finally an additional analysis to compare the monthly variation of water levels i e intra annual variation among sub periods was performed by calculating pairwise pearson correlation indices these indices were calculated as the correlation of water levels by month i e monthly average between each possible combination of two years of a sub period i e pairwise correlations higher pairwise correlations indicated a higher similarity in the variation of the water levels among months i e intra annual variation between two given years thus by comparing these pairwise correlation indices among sub periods we compared whether the similitude of intra annual water level variation differed among sub periods pairwise correlation indices were compared among sub periods using the function anova 1way paov legendre 2007 when paovs indicated general significant differences among sub periods pairwise permutation tests among sub periods were performed through the rcompanion package function pairwisepermutationtest mangiafico 2020 2 2 3 estimation of landscape changes according to the hydroclimatic periods the first median and third quartiles q1 q2 and q3 respectively of the daily water levels were calculated for the four sub periods 1905 1932 1933 1971 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 these metrics were also calculated for the periods 1905 1971 and 1972 2019 in order to focus on the main hydrological distinction defined by the cluster analysis in the result section comparative analyses of the areas of lands and connected isolated water bodies at q1 q2 and q3 were performed among hydroclimatic periods and among geomorphic units showing the spatiotemporal changes occurred in the surface water connectivity patterns of the study area because landscape analyses were based on satellite images of 2017 2020 the previous comparisons must be considered as an estimation of how hydrological changes may affect the patterns of surface water connectivity but it does not provide an exact representation of how the landscape was in the past at a fine spatial scale some local morphological features e g morphometry of a lake longitudinal profile of a floodplain channel probably changed in the past 100 years however when comparing landscape changes at a coarse spatial scale by geomorphic units in our case landscape comparisons are expected to be representative because the current main features of each geomorphic unit respond to hydrogeomorphic processes that developed a long time ago for example in the bar plain the contractions determined by transverse fractures are planimetrically stable sections where the channel has not shifted over the past 80 years and the current landscape of the tributary deltas originated during the recent dry climate several thousand years ago therefore it can be considered that the current landscape pattern of each geomorphic unit remained similar during the period studied 3 results 3 1 surface water connectivity according to river heights 3 1 1 patterns of surface waters in the study area surface waters within the area studied present important variations according to river heights table 1 at 2 m considered as the level under which drought conditions begin connected and isolated water bodies represent 21 9 and 9 6 of the floodplain area respectively table 1 connected water bodies occupy the well defined channel network whose hydraulic processes make the river bed deeper than the other areas of the floodplain under this river stage most of the connected water bodies have a marked lotic behavior except some large depression areas such as the coronda fluvial lake fig 2 part of the floodplain lakes immediately dry with the falling waters and other remain isolated from the channel network undergoing relatively fast drying processes for example isolated lakes lost 64 of their area during an isolation period of approximately eight months corresponding to the loss of area from the river height of 2 05 to 1 39 m table 1 at an intermediate river height 3 5 m surface waters cover 59 4 of the floodplain area table 1 and 65 of the area of isolated water bodies become connected from 2 to 3 5 m table 1 extensive low land areas are overflowed fig 2 and thus a large portion of the floodplain is represented by lentic water bodies when the river height reaches 4 5 m 85 of the area studied is inundated and the connection among the floodplain water bodies is quasi total isolated lakes represent only 0 04 of the floodplain area this river stage is considered as the beginning of flood conditions 4 connectivity patterns by geomorphic unit three main patterns of surface water connectivity were identified in the study area fig 3 in the geomorphic units of tributary deltas and pre delta at 1 39 m of river height the floodplain is mainly represented by emerged lands 81 3 and 91 3 of the area of each unit respectively table 1 when the river height overpasses 2 05 m connectivity increases rapidly in the low land areas of the tributary deltas and pre delta and inundates a large part of these areas this increase is mainly originated by overflowing of the large shallow areas characterized by homogeneous elevations e g fig 3 shows the flooding process of a low land area of the tributary deltas which occurred mainly from 2 05 to 3 m in the areas of tributary deltas and pre delta characterized by higher lands the morphometry of the floodplain lakes is more constant with water level fluctuations due to a higher elevation of the lake borders the borders present some depressions generally associated with the movement of waters in and out of the lakes in these areas the connectivity processes are not originated by overflowing as mentioned for the low land areas they are mainly due to the connection of the channel network during the rising water levels when the floodplain lakes connect by the input of water where the depressions are located these processes occur at higher water levels mainly at a river height higher than 3 m and most lakes are connected when the river height reaches 4 m see these processes in a high land area of pre delta in fig 3 in the bar plain the main channel and its main branches represent a considerable portion of the area of the geomorphic unit and maintain significant water areas at very low water levels 36 4 of the area at 1 39 m table 1 consequently during the rising waters the increase of surface waters in this unit is not as marked as in the two other units table 1 in general the first input of water occurs from the downstream part of the island whose elevation is usually lower small channels then connect the lakes located within the islands these connections are evident at water levels up to 3 5 m fig 3 4 1 comparison of water level variations among hydroclimatic periods except for the maximum water level and the duration of floods all variables that characterized water levels floods and droughts by year varied among the four sub periods table 2 according to the similitude of mean values of these variables sub periods were clustered in two groups 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 first main period vs 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 second main period fig 4 a this grouping was related to the increase of the minimum water levels from 1972 onward the mean of the lowest daily water levels registered each year increased 1 5 m from 1905 1971 to 1972 2019 fig 4b reflecting the high number of droughts from 1905 to 1971 during this period droughts occurred more frequently their duration was variable but many of them extended over several months and reached very low water levels table 2 such an increase in minimum water levels produced an increase of the mean of the daily water levels of 0 84 m from 1905 1971 to 1972 2019 fig 4b and table 2 because the significant increase in minimum levels starting in 1972 was not accompanied by such an increase in maximum levels the mean of the highest daily water levels registered each year only increased 0 44 m from 1905 1971 to 1972 2019 table 2 a reduction in the amplitude and degree of the water level variation also occurred from this date onward the comparison of the sub periods reflected these changes since the sub periods 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 had lower minimum water levels higher amplitude and coefficient of variation of water levels and higher frequency and lower minimum water levels of droughts than the sub periods 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 table 2 none of the variables that characterized the water levels floods and droughts varied among the sub periods 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 in contrast although the sub periods 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 were grouped together the period 1972 1998 had higher mean minimum and maximum water levels and frequency of occurrence of floods than the sub period 1999 2019 table 2 however the sub periods 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 did not differ in amplitude of water levels coefficient of variation of water levels frequency of occurrence of droughts minimum water levels of droughts and drought duration table 2 the difference of the daily water level patterns between main periods and sub periods is also evident when analyzing their frequency along a hydrometric scale fig 5 more than 25 of the daily water levels were lower than 2 m from 1905 to 1971 while they only reached 2 from 1972 to 2019 see the different shades of brown in fig 5 comparing the sub periods 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 they showed similar patterns characterized by daily water levels proportionally well distributed over the ten ranges but with a tendency of higher percentages up to 4 5 m and lower percentages below 1 5 m during the first sub period then the percentage of high water levels increased radically during the sub period 1972 1998 with 30 of the daily water levels between 2 and 3 5 m and 70 higher than 3 5 m see the different shades of green and blue respectively fig 5 during the sub period 1999 2019 around 60 of the daily water levels oscillated between 2 and 3 5 m and 40 were higher than 3 5 m this latest percentage is comparable with the sub periods 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 see the different blue shades of fig 5 monthly averages of the daily water levels showed high averages from january to july and low ones from august to december fig 6 a however the water level variation throughout the months of the year i e intra annual variation differed among sub periods i e the interaction between the explanatory variables month and sub period was significant paov p 0 005 considering pairwise comparisons among sub periods intra annual variation of water levels did not vary between 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 i e interaction between month and sub period was not significant considering only these sub periods paov p 0 997 and between 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 paov p 0 986 while they were different for all the remaining pairwise comparisons paov p 0 05 in all cases thus the intra annual variation of water levels throughout the months of the year showed two different patterns one common to the sub periods 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 and another to the sub periods 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 however although the periods 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 showed a similar pattern of intra annual variations the first presented monthly averages about 0 5 to 1 m higher than the second fig 6a from 1905 to 1971 marked peaks of high waters occurred during march april during these two months water levels were higher than in any of the other months pairwise permutation based test p 0 05 in all cases and peaks of low waters occurred during september during september water levels were lower than in any of the other months pairwise permutation based test p 0 01 in all cases showing a difference of 2 4 m between the two extreme values of the monthly averages since 1972 the higher average values have extended over several months e g water levels of february march april and may did not differ from each other pairwise permutation based test p greater than 0 1 in all cases and water levels of september have not been as low as those of the remaining months e g water levels of september did not vary with respect to the levels of august and october pairwise permutation based test p greater than 0 5 in both cases reducing the difference between the high and low mean values recorded throughout the months of the year difference of 1 2 m approximately fig 6a however the general pattern observed in fig 6a hides the interannual flow variability which occurred in each sub period for example the mean of the pairwise correlation indices between years were lower than 0 5 in all sub periods indicating relatively high differences among years in the intra annual variability of the water levels fig 6b these differences were higher i e the pairwise correlation indices among years of water levels per month were lower during the sub periods 1972 1998 0 19 0 4 and 1999 2019 0 13 0 4 than during the sub periods 1905 1932 0 45 0 3 and 1933 1971 0 45 0 4 pairwise permutation based tests p 0 01 in all cases and the remaining comparisons among sub periods were not significant p greater than 0 1 in all cases fig 6b thus smaller inter annual variations occurred from 1905 to 1971 the monthly variation of the frequency of droughts differed among all sub periods bootlrt p 0 05 in all cases nonetheless a well defined seasonal pattern of drought frequency was similar during the sub periods 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 fig 7 a b from 1905 to 1971 droughts occurred almost each year most of them from the end of winter to mid spring i e august september and october months fig 7a b but their onset and duration were variable fig 8 a after 1971 droughts were few very short and occurred at any season of the year fig 7c d and fig 8a floods events were generally more frequent during summer autumn and winter months occurring with a higher frequency in the months of march and or april according to the sub periods fig 7a d but nonetheless shorter floods less than three months occurred in any season fig 8b yet some differences should be noted among sub periods from 1905 to 1971 large floods began mostly during summer months principally during february fig 8b after 1971 most of the larger floods started sooner during spring months principally november and december fig 8b also the sub period 1972 1998 presented the higher probability of floods compared to the other sub periods whatever the month considered fig 7a d on the other hand the probability of occurrence of floods during the sub period 1999 2019 was low and relatively homogeneous from december to august probability mainly between 0 1 and 0 2 fig 7d showing a decrease of the flood predictability during this sub period 4 2 comparison of the patterns of surface water connectivity among hydroclimatic periods from 1905 to 1971 connected water bodies covered 20 of the floodplain area at q1 45 at q2 and 67 at q3 fig 9 from 1972 to 2019 about 40 of the floodplain was covered by connected water bodies at q1 60 at q2 and 80 at q3 showing a significant increase of the surface water connectivity during the second main period though the sub periods 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 showed a pattern similar to the main period 1905 1971 the difference is evident when comparing the sub periods 1972 1998 and 1999 2019 from 1972 to 1998 connected water bodies covered 50 of the area studied at q1 65 at q2 and more than 85 at q3 whereas from 1999 to 2019 they covered 35 at q1 45 at q2 and 65 at q3 note that isolated lakes represent a significant portion of water areas in the floodplain at 2 m 30 but decrease rapidly with the rising water levels 21 5 at 2 5 m 15 at 3 m 5 5 at 3 5 m comparing connectivity patterns and taking into account the geomorphic features of the study area the main changes between periods were observed in the pre delta and the tributary deltas from 1905 to 1971 the connected water bodies covered few areas at q1 in these two geomorphic units 10 and 20 of the area of the pre delta and tributary deltas respectively fig 10 these results were similar during the sub periods 1905 1932 and 1933 1971 on the other hand the area of connected water bodies was much higher at q1 in the pre delta and the tributary deltas from 1972 to 1998 45 and 55 respectively and at an intermediary level from 1999 to 2019 25 and 35 respectively when comparing the patterns of surface waters between the two periods 1905 1971 and 1972 2019 differences are obvious fig 11 in the low land areas of the floodplain the difference between the two periods was especially marked at low water levels see the difference of surface waters at q1 between both periods in fig 11b in the other areas of the floodplain the difference between the two periods was smaller than in the low land areas but was still evident at q1 q2 and q3 showing surface waters considerably higher in 1972 2019 compared to 1905 1971 fig 11a c 5 discussion 5 1 a lentification trend in the floodplain from 1972 to 2019 water levels below 2 m at the santa fe gauging station considered as drought conditions in the study represented near 30 of the period 1905 1971 during this period droughts occurred almost every year in the mpr floodplain and many of them lasted several months fig 8 during droughts surface waters represented a low percentage of the floodplain especially in the geomorphic units pre delta and tributary deltas where most of the floodplain lakes were dried or isolated from the channel network under 2 m during the following period 1972 2019 drought periods almost disappeared fig 8a and minimum water levels were higher and essentially comprised between 2 and 3 m representing approximately 25 of the period between these two water levels from 30 to 50 of the area studied is covered by water in the low land areas of the pre delta and the tributary deltas rapid processes of expansion of surface waters occurred from 2 m upward and these areas remained almost totally flooded at 3 m see an example of these processes in the tributary deltas in fig 3 in short these areas periodically dried and flooded before the 1970s remained with significant water areas in the period 1972 2019 fig 11b these changes in the surface water patterns led to a significant increase of lentic environments all year round and a reduction of the dynamic of contraction and expansion processes of surface waters in the area for example the amplitude of water level variations in the study area was 4 2 m from 1905 to 1971 and 3 m from 1972 to 2019 table 2 it was thus reduced by more than one meter from 1972 onward representing a reduction of approximately 30 of its whole amplitude these new conditions in the floodplain can be associated to a process of lentification according to schiesari et al 2019 i e the increase in the availability of lentic freshwater habitats in the landscape directly or indirectly caused by human activities the overall consequence has been a lower ecotone availability for aquatic and terrestrial organisms but larger inundated areas for aquatic organisms this lentification trend was assumed to be the result of dam management upstream in the basin quirós 2004 puig et al 2016 puig et al 2016 analyzed the cumulated regulation effect of dams on the river flow downstream of the cascade of reservoirs in the upper part of the paraná basin they observed that the reconstructed low pulses are eliminated and the magnitude of the high pulses is frequently reduced or even eliminated on occasions these alterations reflect the effect of dam operation and eventual filling periods of large reservoirs and provide support for the reduction in the amplitude of the water level variations and for the loss of the natural conditions of very low water levels in the floodplain from 1972 onward from 1972 to 1998 the streamflow of the paraná river and all major rivers of south america experienced an increased trend garcía and mechoso 2005 the simultaneity of events across the continent suggests a mechanism of generation at a large spatial scale accordingly several studies proposed an association between the increasing trend in streamflows and the warming experienced by the pacific ocean genta et al 1998 antico et al 2014 therefore the cumulative effect of climate and dam management increased the lentification process even more during this period for example surface waters occupied from 60 to the whole study area fig 9 during 70 of this period fig 5 5 2 reduced flow seasonality from 1972 to 2019 the mpr floodplain is located on a subtropical temperate north south axis until the 1970s this river had a marked seasonal flow regime with predictive low flow periods late winter to mid spring 70 90 of probability of occurrence during september fig 7a b and relatively predictive high flow periods mid summer and autumn the common pattern during 1905 1971 displayed large areas of the floodplain recently dried during the springtime warming especially in the pre delta and tributary deltas it can be hypothesized that these areas where organic material and nutrients deposit during water logging and falling waters experienced a rapid growth of vegetation drought periods are generally identified as ecologically vulnerable periods in the mpr since they conduce to significant fish losses by increasing depredation and reducing water quality and quantity in isolated lakes bonetto et al 1969 demonte 2018 but considering that species have the opportunity to evolve adaptations to exploit relatively predictable habitats and resources in a seasonal flow regime southwood 1977 the natural cycle of droughts during spring followed by the increase of water levels during summer was likely to be used by aquatic organisms to take advantage of the greater resource availability of the recently flooded areas from 1972 onward the flow seasonality showed several changes the difference between the periods of high and low waters was reduced fig 6a due to the increase of minimum water levels this led to an increase in similarity of the water levels from year to year in addition the inter annual flow variability increased fig 6b principally due to a change in the seasonal patterns of high flows this is reflected in the large floods that tended to start earlier during the warm season from 1972 onward mid spring while they usually started at mid summer february before 1972 fig 8b and during the recent decades the probability of occurrence of flood events decreased and showed similar values almost year round fig 7d reflecting a decrease in the predictability of floods since 1999 in other river of south america change in flow seasonality and increasing interannual flow variability were assumed to be the result of land use change for example the forest clearing in the ji paraná river basin produced a short term response on hydrological data probably because of the reduction in interception infiltration and evapotranspiration after forest removal linhares et al 2007 and deforestation in the tapajós river basin was expected to cause an increase in flow magnitude and variability farinosi et al 2019 in the upper part of the paraná river deforestation and land use change have increased since the 1970s as commented in the introduction they might have participated at least partially to the alteration of the river flow commented above 5 3 effects on community assemblages from the 1970s the higher interannual flow variability and the lentification trend of the floodplain due the reduced expansion contraction events and the loss of drought conditions participated to an overall reduction of the seasonality of the flow regime species with adaptive responses to seasonal environmental periodicity are likely to be challenged under these new conditions and some changes in composition and diversity patterns of aquatic and riparian organisms may have appeared some further studies in the mpr could illustrate the above mentioned phenomena terrestrial birds find in the temporarily terrestrial environments of the floodplain alternative and complementary habitats to the upland zones in the mpr the occurrence of these habitats decreases with increasing water levels lorenzón et al 2019a similarly non flooded and wet areas such as muddy beaches are used as stopover sites in the mpr by long distance migratory shorebirds e g tringa spp and calidris spp lorenzón et al 2017 as muddy beaches are more abundant at low water levels the higher predictability of spring droughts before 1972 probably provided accessible and adequate stopover sites during the spring migrations of these species in contrast the lentification process later to this date reduced the availability of muddy beaches and probably limited their use by shorebirds waterbirds in contrast should be favored by the floodplain lentification at least in terms of surface of available habitat however kinsgford et al 2004 observed that wetlands with prolonged droughts or floods contained less diversity of waterbirds than wetlands with alternate periods of drought and flood this shows that waterbird diversity is closely related to the amplitude of the water level fluctuations i e the expansion and contraction events within the floodplain this hydrological variability also increases the total bird diversity in the floodplain through the increase of the cyclical temporal turnover of species or temporal beta diversity as a function of hydrological fluctuations kingsford et al 2004 lorenzón et al 2019b this process still maintains a high bird diversity in the paraná river floodplain lorenzón et al 2019b even if the bird species turnover has possibly decreased since the 1970s due to the reduction of expansion contraction events and the disappearance of certain environmental situations such as pronounced droughts in the case of commercial fish species higher frequency of large spring summer floods has been generally associated with higher recruitments in the mpr quirós and cuch 1989 rabuffetti et al 2019 as most of them are periodic strategists and it was observed that they find in the floods the best conditions for reproduction and recruitment during the warm period abrial et al 2018 while the higher frequency of large spring summer floods during the period 1972 1999 should have favored these species e g floods of 1972 73 1979 80 and 1982 84 fig 8 the abundance of specialist species decreased such as the large predators salminus brasiliensis and pseudoplatystoma spp and the seed and fruit eaters brycon orbignyanus and piaractus mesopotamicus fuentes and quirós 1988 quirós 2004 as no evidence in increasing fishing effort and number of fishermen was found from 1930 to 1980 sverlij and espinach ros 1986 flood attributes and fishing pressure are not likely to be sufficient to explain commercial fish recruitment in the mpr as fish species develop ecomorphological traits that accomplish a specific function in the environment winemiller 1991 the historical changes in the patterns of surface water connectivity that occurred in the mpr are relevant in assuming that habitat changes may have participated to the change in commercial catches an illustration of the above remarks can be the rapid decrease of the pacu p mesopotamicus in the study area from the 1970s onward as this species is accustomed to use recently flooded areas to feed on fruits and seeds lovshin 1995 the reduction of contraction and expansion of surface waters may be related to this decrease e g more than 20 of the area of the tributary deltas and pre delta has lost this dynamic and remained almost always inundated fig 10 some other species probably benefited from the large depositional areas of these two geomorphic units using them as feeding areas the main example was the detritivorous prochilodus lineatus with the protractile mouth adapted to feed on mud sverlij et al 1993 which has dominated the commercial catches from the 1970s onward quirós et al 2007 5 4 considerations on the sustainability of the mpr the success of the management policies of the mpr floodplain will depend on a global comprehension of its hydro geomorphological characteristics coupled with climate variations hydrology and geomorphology drive most of the ecological processes in fluvial ecosystems thorp et al 2006 two main processes erosive flooding and flow pulses acting at different time scales control connectivity in a riverine landscape tockner et al 2000 in the mpr great floods occur around two to three times per decade rabuffetti et al 2019 and they can be considered as the modulators of the diversity of successional stages that determine the complexity of the landscape matrix tockner et al 2000 at days to months timescales surface water connectivity among existing landscape elements varies in response to water level fluctuations below bankfull the flow pulses these expansion and contraction processes resulting in repeated changes in landscape heterogeneity are critical to understanding biodiversity patterns tockner et al 2000 espínola et al 2020 as we mentioned above several characteristics of both flood and flow pulses have shown significant changes since the seventies producing considerable alterations in the patterns of surface water connectivity in this sense an interesting point would be to relate the above mentioned alterations to long time biological series this would provide relevant data about how organisms adapt to the modification of the environmental conditions in the mpr on the other hand it is assumed that most river discharges in south america are expected to reduce in the future breda et al 2020 and dry periods to increase in duration and frequency valverde and marengo 2014 a river flow decrease might therefore be envisaged in the coming decades actually the year 2020 has shown exceptionally low water levels in the paraná basin the only drought of such magnitude since 1972 a feedback on how patterns in community assemblages were before the 1970s will help to understand the current biodiversity patterns under conditions of low water levels in the light of climate change and because climatic events tend to be less predictable and more extreme ipcc 2014 it is decisive to understand the ecological responses to a broad range of geomorphic and hydroclimatic conditions in the anthropogenic era where human

4016,parameter optimization is an essential step in hydrological simulations especially for solving practical problems however parameter optimization is usually intractable for complex models with a large number of parameters in this study a parameter optimization system based on sensitive parameter combinations spcs was developed which comprised four parameter sensitivity analysis sa methods and a sensitive parameter optimization method in particular parameter sa was used to screen out the relatively sensitive parameters with significant impacts on the model output and instead of using all parameter combinations apcs the spcs were optimized with a global optimization method this system was applied to the soil and water assessment tool swat model for daily streamflow simulation and monthly evaluation in four watersheds of china the results showed that no more than 10 sensitive parameters were identified from 27 adjustable parameters for each watershed in particular four parameters cn2 sol k alpha bnk and slsubbsn were relatively sensitive in all watersheds compared with optimizing apcs despite the number of parameters was reduced by almost 2 3 in the optimization of spcs the accuracy was still very close the maximum nash sutcliffe coefficient nse difference was 0 024 and the minimum difference was 0 002 and the optimization speed was doubled in the comparison of monthly streamflow optimization the spcs were in good agreement with the apcs and had an obvious improvement for the default simulation the nse values of the spcs optimization were greater than 0 88 during the calibration period in all watersheds and greater than 0 83 during the validation period in three watersheds these findings indicate that optimizing the sensitivity parameters can greatly reduce the computational costs of swat streamflow simulations while ensuring their accuracy keywords sensitivity analysis parameter optimization streamflow simulation swat model 1 introduction hydrological models have attracted much interest and have become important for solving many practical problems sorooshian and chu 2013 liu et al 2020 especially under climate change and anthropogenic impacts which may cause significant changes in the hydrological processes lu et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2021 pokhrel et al 2021 hydrological models often contain many parameters to better describe the hydrological processes and to account for spatial heterogeneities caused by climate land use etc abbaspour et al 2004 shi et al 2013 fatichi et al 2016 however the existence of spatial heterogeneities may make the parameter values vary greatly in different regions so parameter optimization become an essential step to improve the regional applicability and practicality of the hydrological models sun et al 2001 muleta and nicklow 2005 doherty and hunt 2009 various parameter optimization methods were used to identify the optimal values based on the differences between the simulated and observed variables duan et al 2004 the earliest optimization method is the trial and error method where the parameter values are manually adjusted one at a time but this is a subjective method and only the model developers or experts may find the optimal parameter values gupta et al 1999 muleta and nicklow 2005 objective parameter optimization methods with automatic search facilities were produced with the development of the computer where representative methods include the quasi newton method liu and nocedal 1989 and the downhill simplex method nelder and mead 1965 however these methods tend to become readily trapped in the domain of locally optimal solutions to obtain the global optimal solution algorithms such as simulated annealing kirkpatrick et al 1983 and genetic algorithms michielssen et al 1992 generate global initial samples before optimization and then search for them in different sample groups to find the comprehensive global optimal solution in particular the shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm duan et al 1992 exploits the advantages of simulated annealing genetic algorithms and the downhill simplex algorithm in a highly efficient parameter optimization method it is worth noting that if a large number of tunable parameters are calibrated together the computational burden will be high and the calibration process becomes complex muleta and nicklow 2005 van griensven et al 2006 gou et al 2020 therefore parameter sensitivity analysis sa has been employed to reduce the number of tunable parameters saltelli et al 2004 kannan et al 2007 cibin et al 2010 di et al 2015 by using various sa methods to screen out the sensitive parameters with large impacts on the model outputs as well as excluding insensitive parameters with small impacts however most previous parameter optimization and sa studies did not combine these two processes thereby resulting in the following problems 1 in some studies sa was not performed but instead a small number of parameters were selected for optimization based on the researchers experience confesor and whittaker 2007 khoi and thom 2015 krpec et al 2020 which could lead to the omission of important parameters 2 in other studies sa was performed but these studies only ranked the sa results of all selected parameters and then these parameters were directly optimized rather than those parameters that showed relatively high sensitivity in the sa results mulungu and munishi 2007 zhai et al 2014 odusanya et al 2019 pang et al 2020 this approach does not take advantage of sa in optimization and it may have included parameters with little effect on the outputs thereby wasting time labor and computational costs 3 some researchers performed both sa and optimization of the sensitive parameters gan et al 2018 sreedevi and eldho 2019 but they did not systematically evaluate the representatives of sensitive parameters relative to all the tunable parameters and the effects of sensitive parameters on optimization based on these studies it is not clear whether parameter sa can help to speed up the parameter optimization process and it is unclear what the difference is between optimizing all the tunable parameters and optimizing only the sensitive ones in addition most previous studies only considered the parameter sensitivity results obtained by a single sa method which is less credible compared to multiple sa methods in the present study to evaluate the effects of sensitive parameters on the optimization process a parameter optimization system based on sensitive parameter combinations spcs was developed for a representative distributed hydrological model the soil and water assessment tool swat model arnold et al 1998 in this system sa is first performed using three qualitative methods and one quantitative method to screen out the spcs before the shuffled complex evolution sce optimization method is applied to optimize the spcs the following two critical questions need to be addressed for this system 1 can parameter sa help to speed up the parameter optimization process 2 are the spcs screened by the sa methods representative of all the tunable parameters the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the methods and materials are described in section 2 including the parameter sa methods the parameter optimization method and a case study based on swat streamflow simulation the parameter sa and optimization calibration results are presented in section 3 and the suitability of the optimal parameters in the validation period is also presented discussion and conclusions are given in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 methods and materials this section is an introduction to the methodology that is used in the spc based optimization system consisting of parameter sa and optimization as well as the application of this optimization system to practical cases among it parameter sa experiment involves three main steps including generating samples simulations of samples and sa analysis of the two and the parameter optimization is performed by a global optimal algorithm 2 1 sampling methods uniform sampling methods are usually recommended for sa sampling as they can generate a set of spatially representative sample points using a small number of samples they have the advantage of a relatively efficient sampling process and representative results fang et al 2002 gan et al 2014 gong et al 2015 di et al 2021 in this study the quasi monte carlo sampling a uniform sampling method was used and for the sobol sa method the specialized sobol sampling was used 2 1 1 quasi monte carlo qmc sampling qmc sampling generates a set of low discrepancy sequences different from the random sequences produced by the usual monte carlo mc sampling if the proportion of points in a sequence falling into an arbitrary set is close to the proportion of the set measure it is defined that the discrepancy of the sequence is low obviously the low discrepancy sequence of qmc sampling has better spatial representation compared with the random sequence of mc sampling the point locations of the low discrepancy sequence are determined by the base number construction method and specified sample size caflisch et al 1997 according to the different algorithms there are many low discrepancy sequences built such as the halton sequence halton 1960 faure sequence faure 1982 and niederreiter sequence niederreiter 1988 the widely acknowledged halton sequence was used as the result of qmc sampling in this study 2 1 2 sobol sampling the sobol sampling method is designed to approximately solve the components of the total variance in sobol sa method sobol 1993 it starts with two random r n matrices m 1 and m 2 where r is the number of samples and n is the dimensionality of the input parameters then the rest samples are generated based on the two matrices for each of the r samples in m 1 its i th i from 1 to n dimensionality of the parameter value is retained and the rest of the parameters are replaced with the same dimensionality of values in m 2 finally there are n 2 r parameter samples originated from n new r n matrices and two original m 1 and m 2 2 2 sa methods sa methods can be classified as qualitative and quantitative methods qualitative methods provide heuristic sensitivity scores based on the relative sensitivity of intuitive response parameters quantitative methods evaluate the sensitivity of the parameters by calculating the contribution of the variance due to the perturbation of each parameter relative to the total variance of the model output 2 2 1 qualitative methods 2 2 1 1 delta test dt the dt method was originally devised by pi and peterson 1994 for residual noise variance estimation before eirola et al 2008 extended this method to parameter screening for a subset of parameters the residual noise variance represents the difference in the constructed model compared with the real model which can be approximately estimated by finding the nearest neighbor of the input point 1 v a r ε 1 2 m i 1 m y i y n i 2 where ε is the noise term the right hand term is defined as the dt value m is the sample size and y i and y n i represent the simulation errors of the model corresponding to the i th sampling point i e xi and its nearest neighbor n i respectively n i is defined as the unique point that minimizes a distance metric to that point in the input space as follows 2 n i arg min i j x i x j 2 for n parameters mathematically there are 2 n 1 non empty parameter subsets and each subset has a dt value based on equation 1 i e the projection errors of all sample outputs in the subset space the dt value is positively related to the sensitivity of its parameters the normalized sensitivity score of the i th parameter is defined as 3 scor e i d t d t i max d t 1 d t 2 d t n where dt i the sum of the dt values for all subsets including the i th parameter and n is the number of tunable parameters 2 2 1 2 sum of trees sot sot was originally developed as a classification and regression tree cart model before it was then used as a useful qualitative method for parameter screening chipman et al 2010 sot divides the data space into different partitions by recursion and fits a prediction model to each partition breiman et al 2017 the parameter variable is split continuously during recursion to minimize the residual sum of squares rss however the termination condition for recursion should be set to prevent overfitting of the model which usually depends on whether rss is lower than the specified threshold after constructing a reasonable sot regression model sa is then performed based on the regression model the number of splits ns in each parameter variable space represents its sensitivity a parameter is more sensitive when ns is higher finally the normalized sensitivity score of the i th parameter is defined as 4 scor e i s o t n s i max n s 1 n s 2 n s n where n s i is the ns for the i th parameter and n is the number of tunable parameters 2 2 1 3 multivariate adaptive regression splines mars similar to sot mars is another cart model sot and mars differ in terms of the regression function in each partition with a uniform function for sot and a low order function for mars the low order function for mars is constructed as a linear combination of three types of basis functions a constant hinge function and product of several hinge functions all these functions form the overall mars regression model f x in the dimension space of all of the parameters which can be expressed as 5 f x β 0 m 1 m β m h m x where β 0 is a constant term β m represents the coefficient of basis function m is the number of parameter samples and h m x is a hinge function or the product of multiple hinge functions the mars sensitivity score is defined based on the evaluation of equation 5 the deletion of a parameter from this equation that results in the largest loss indicates that this is the most sensitive parameter the normalized sensitivity score for the i th parameter is defined as 6 scor e i m a r s δ g c v i max δ g c v 1 δ g c v 2 δ g c v n where δ g c v i is the increase in the generalized cross validation gcv error between the mars regression function excluding the i th parameter and the original function at all sample points and n represents the number of tunable parameters the gcv can be expressed as follows 7 g c v m 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 1 1 c m d n 2 where n is the number of parameter samples yi is the real output of the i th sample y i is the corresponding mars regression output d is the number of degrees of sample freedom and c m is a penalty factor for adding a low order function 2 2 2 quantitative method the sobol method is an algorithm that quantifies the parameter sensitivity by calculating the contribution of each parameter to the total variance of the model outputs sobol 1993 the total variance of model outputs using the sobol method can be decomposed as follows 8 v i 1 n v i 1 i j n n v ij v 1 2 n where n is the total number of parameters and v i and v ij represent the portions of the output variance explained only by the i th variable and the interaction between the i th and j th variables respectively equation 8 can be divided by v to obtain a standardized expression 9 i 1 n s i 1 i j n n s ij s 1 2 n 1 where s i refers to the main effect first order effect s ij is a two way interaction effect and the others are multi way interaction effects the total effect of the i th parameter includes its main effect and all of its related interactions and the total effect represents its sensitivity 2 3 parameter optimization method the sce method is one of the most popular global optimization algorithms for hydrological models at the watershed scale the sce method absorbs the concepts of competitive complex evolution complex shuffling and downhill simplex algorithm and thus it is effective for solving nonlinear constrained optimization problems in the sce method the complex is the main search unit the sce parameter optimization algorithm can be briefly described as follows 1 a random sampling method is first used to generate some random parameter samples in tunable parameter ranges and these samples are then divided into several complexes each complex usually includes 2n 1 samples where n is the tunable parameter number 2 next the samples of each complex are independently evolved to search for the local optimal solution using the downhill simplex method 3 after several evolutions the original complexes are destroyed to generate the new ones where the samples from all of the original complexes are combined as a whole and then redistributed to the different complexes the aim is to avoid becoming trapped by a locally optimal solution 4 the evolution and combination steps i e steps 2 3 are repeated until the convergence criteria are met finally the global optimal solution is found in this study the convergence criterion requires that the optimal value is unchanged after 20 rounds of parameter dimensionality searches 2 4 case study in this study we will analyze the effect of parameter sa in parameter optimization by using the distributed hydrological model the swat model for streamflow simulations in four watersheds in china 2 4 1 study areas four watersheds in china with different moisture conditions were selected for swat streamflow simulation the jiao river jr watershed in a humid region the luan river lr watershed in a semi humid region the upstream of the hei river hr watershed in a semiarid region and the urumqi river ur watershed in an arid region fig 1 shows the locations of the watersheds and meteorological and hydrological stations and table s1 provides the information for these stations the jr watershed is located on the southeast coast of china and the annual rainfall is close to 2000 mm with typical humid conditions in the study period considered the land use type in the jr watershed is mainly forest land and the soil types are mainly calcic luvisols and humic acrisols the lr watershed on the north china plain has diverse soil types and the main land use types are forest land and grassland the hr watershed is in the upper mountainous area of the heihe river with a semiarid climate the main land use type distributed in this watershed is grassland the ur watershed is located in an inland area of northwestern china and it has relatively low rainfall but high evaporation the land use types comprise grassland and a small amount of forest land and there is a large area of bare land details of the land use for the year 1980 and soil types in all the watersheds are presented in table s2 2 4 2 swat model the swat model is one of the most commonly used hydrological models gassman et al 2014 bhatta et al 2019 ghaith and li 2020 which was developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service based on the simulator water resources in rural watersheds model this model has been employed frequently since its development and is now one of the most widely used hydrological models in recent decades studies based on the swat model for streamflow simulation have been conducted all over the world douglas mankin et al 2010 and parameter optimization of streamflow simulation has been conducted widely using this model jayakrishnan et al 2005 wu and liu 2012 shadmehri toosi et al 2019 in addition to streamflow simulation the swat model can also be applied to studies of climate change ficklin et al 2009 bhatta et al 2019 land use change ghaffari et al 2010 chen et al 2019 non point source pollution yang et al 2011 and sediment simulation qiu et al 2012 pinto et al 2013 therefore the main reasons for choosing the swat model in the present study are its applicability and functionality swat is implemented in arcmap software the swat model firstly extracts the river networks based on digital elevation model dem information and divides the basin into sub basins next the model loads the soil type land use and terrain slope information before further partitioning the sub basins into hydrological response units hrus according to the thresholds for these three information types swat uses a series of conceptual models to calculate the daily month or year flow at every sub basin outlet finally the sub basins flows are summarized to obtain the basin flow the simulation flow depends on the topography soil land use and climate information and the underlying surface properties and meteorological conditions in different regions are heterogeneous thus large regional differences may potentially exist the parameters in the swat model need to be calibrated to improve the regional applicability of the model 2 4 3 model parameters according to swat input output documentation arnold et al 2013 and previous studies yang et al 2007 khorashadi zadeh et al 2017 liu et al 2017 27 commonly used parameters and their adjustable ranges were selected for parameter sa and optimization of the swat model details of these parameters are shown in table 1 according to their spatial scales and distribution the 27 parameters were divided into six categories basin bsn sub basin sub hru main channel rte groundwater gw and soil sol in addition the management mgt category was included to assess the impacts of human activities the mgt process mainly refers to parameters related to planting harvesting irrigation tillage operations and tile drains it should be noted that the values of some parameters varied greatly in the sub basins even hrus due to their physical properties so a multiplier was applied to these parameters in order to be consistent with the physical space 2 4 4 available data similar to most hydrological models the data required by the swat model are mainly divided into input data for running the model and data used for calibration the input data include dem soil land use and climate information in the present study the calibration data comprised flow data from hydrological stations climate data were simulated using daily data and monthly data were used for streamflow evaluation the period was determined as 1971 to 1982 and the first two years were set as the warm up period the five years from 1973 to 1977 were used for calibration and the remaining five years 1978 1982 were employed for validation descriptions of the data are given in table s3 2 4 5 model performance evaluation the streamflow simulation is a major part of a hydrological model and its performance is evaluated by comparing the simulated flow with the observed flow the streamflow simulations at the daily scale are accumulated monthly for comparison with monthly observations the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was employed as the objective function for optimization this is an objective function commonly used in hydrologic model streamflow simulations krause et al 2005 her and chaubey 2015 and it is sensitive to high values therefore simulations of peak flows have a greater impact on this coefficient rather than baseflow and recession components of hydrographs wang et al 2009 ritter and munoz carpena 2013 moriasi et al 2015 besides as a complementary indicator the coefficient of determination r2 was used to evaluate the model nse and r2 are calculated as follows 10 nse 1 i 1 n q o q s i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 11 r 2 i 1 n q o i q o q s i q s 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 i 1 n q s i q s 2 where o denotes the observed results s denotes the simulated results q is the flow and q is the average flow the ranges of nse and r2 are 1 and 0 1 respectively 2 5 experimental procedure the experimental procedure consists of initial sampling qualitative and quantitative parameter sa and parameter optimization these three parts were applied sequentially to the streamflow simulation of the swat model parameter sa is first required to sample the adjustable parameter range to obtain random parameter samples and then these samples respectively replace the default parameter values of the swat model for obtaining the corresponding simulation errors as an input the perturbed parameter values and their simulation errors are put into the sa methods to obtain parameter sa scores in this study to obtain more accurate sa results 100 times parameter samplings were first generated randomly from 27 tunable parameters ranges for qualitative sa methods dt sot and mars the total samples were 2700 and for sobol quantitative sa 2900 samples were generated according to the sobol sampling criterion refer to 2 1 2 then these samples were entered into the swat model to simulate the streamflow for each of the four watersheds the simulation period was from 1971 to 1977 and the later five year streamflow simulations were compared without the first two years as a warm up period based on these samples and their corresponding streamflow simulation errors the sa scores of 27 parameters were calculated for each watershed based on the various sa results the combinations of sensitive parameters were determined as the final sensitive parameters of the swat model for each of the four watersheds next the sce optimization method was used for the optimization of the sensitive parameter combinations or other parameter combinations according to the needs of the analysis 3 results 3 1 sa results the qualitative and quantitative sa results based on 27 parameters for the four watersheds are shown in figs 2 and 3 the sensitivity results based on qualitative methods were classified into three classes low sensitivity middle sensitivity and high sensitivity in order not to miss sensitive parameters a parameter was considered sensitive provided that it was not a low sensitivity parameter with all qualitative methods the threshold was set as 0 1 for the sobol method similarly parameters were considered to be sensitive if they were evaluated accordingly by the qualitative or the sobol methods according to the results in fig 2 and fig 3 the sensitive parameters for each watershed are listed in table 2 table 2 shows that the qualitative methods could screen out more sensitive parameters whereas the sobol method identified relatively fewer sensitive parameters and they were all included in the qualitative results the two method categories were combined to yield the final sensitive parameters where the total number was no more than 10 of the 27 tunable parameters in all watersheds and the final sensitive parameters for each watershed comprised the spcs for further optimization in addition although the sensitive parameters and the degree of sensitivity varied among the watersheds the sensitive parameters in the different watersheds also shared some common characteristics in particular four parameters were sensitive in all watersheds p1 p10 p14 and p16 and five were sensitive in three p4 p7 p8 p17 and p20 in addition 13 of the 27 parameters were insensitive and they were separated from the sensitive parameters p3 p5 p6 p11 p12 p15 p18 p21 p22 p24 p25 p26 and p27 the sa results show that the soil conservation service curve number ii cn2 saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k baseflow alpha factor for bank storage alpha bnk and average slope length slsubbsn were sensitive for all watersheds cn2 is a comprehensive parameter that reflects the characteristics of the watershed before rainfall in general cn2 is recognized as the most important parameter in swat streamflow simulations eckhardt and arnold 2001 shen et al 2012 mainly because swat uses the soil conservation service streamflow curve method and the green and ampt method to calculate the surface streamflow in addition the surface streamflow in most watersheds plays a dominant role in the total annual streamflow therefore cn2 exhibited relatively high sensitivity in each watershed sol k is a key parameter for characterizing the soil infiltration capacity which affects the hydrological cycle by participating in infiltration processes chapuis 2012 araya and ghezzehei 2019 a higher sol k value indicates that the soil has a greater infiltration capacity and the recharge to groundwater from surface and soil water is higher the sensitivity of sol k has also been confirmed in watersheds with different climates terrain forms and vegetation types kushwaha and jain 2013 thavhana et al 2018 mulungu and munishi 2007 suggested that cn2 and sol k were the most sensitive and physically meaningful parameters for swat streamflow simulations compared with cn2 and sol k alpha bnk and slsubbsn have been used less frequently in previous streamflow simulation studies zhang et al 2009 kushwaha and jain 2013 dhami et al 2018 and thus their sensitivity is relatively unclear alpha bnk is used to characterize the bank storage recession curve where a large value approaching 1 indicates a smooth recession and a low value approaching 0 indicates a steep recession the sensitivity of this parameter has been confirmed in previous studies of the daning river and chao river in china shen et al 2011 pang et al 2020 slsubbsn is the average distance at which the flow begins to concentrate and it is an important factor in runoff and erosion bryan and poesen 1989 govers 1991 the general sensitivities of slsubbsn and hru slp p17 that was sensitive in three watersheds suggest that the slope characteristics may be extremely important factors that affect the streamflow especially in the asian monsoon climate region where the frequency of sudden heavy rainfall is high eckhardt and arnold 2001 shen et al 2012 xin et al 2019 pang et al 2020 in addition to co sensitive parameters some parameters exhibited high sensitivity to specific watersheds such as p23 smtmp for ur p23 represents the minimum temperature at which snow begins to melt and snow melts more readily when the parameter is lower the snowmelt recharges the surface runoff groundwater and soil water as part of precipitation neitsch et al 2011 the relatively high elevation of the ur watershed and its arid climate with low rainfall make snowmelt recharge one of the main types of recharge in this region therefore this parameter may have a large impact on streamflow in the region abudu et al 2016 in addition compared with hr and ur we found that p19 canmx maximum canopy storage was sensitive in jr and lr we inferred that canmx was a sensitive parameter for humid and semi humid regions but insensitive for arid and semiarid regions the canmx parameter is closely related to canopy interception which mainly affects forest ecosystems miralles et al 2010 vegetation canopies with high canmx values retain more precipitation and exhibit higher vegetation evapotranspiration putuhena and cordery 2000 in general rainfall is more abundant in humid and semi humid regions and forestlands are more widespread compared with arid and semiarid regions so canmx plays a more important role in the hydrological cycle in these regions therefore it is recommended to consider this parameter in the simulation of swat streamflow in humid and semi humid regions 3 2 evaluation of spc based optimization system to evaluate the spc based optimization system we conducted comparative optimization experiments with spcs versus the sensitive and insensitive parameter combinations sipcs and all parameter combinations apcs in each watershed for the simulation periods from 1973 to 1977 using the sce method first the spcs obtained from the sa methods were optimized in comparison with the sipcs the sipcs were composed of different combinations of sensitive and insensitive parameters and for better comparison with spcs the number of parameters of both was the same in the respective watersheds due to limited calculations 20 different sets of sipcs were combined in each watershed then they were optimized and the one with the highest objective function value was selected for comparison with spcs the optimal combinations of sipcs were sensitive parameters 1 insensitive parameter in jr 7 sensitive parameters 1 insensitive parameter in lr 7 sensitive parameters 2 insensitive parameters in hr and 9 sensitive parameters 1 insensitive parameter in ur basically the optimal sipcs appeared in the combinations with more sensitive parameters a detailed description of the sipcs is available in the supplementary material the comparison results with spcs are shown in fig 4 it can be seen from it that the nse of the optimal sipcs in each watershed is lower than that of the spcs while the differences are relatively small maximum δnse 0 04 in lr minimum δnse greater than 0 01 in jr in lr and hr the optimization process of the spcs is almost always better than that of the sipcs while in jr and ur the spcs surpass the sipcs during the search process and finally arrive at better optimization results these results indicate that under the same number of parameters the sipcs with some insensitive parameters are less effective in optimization compared to the spcs while the spcs with all sensitive parameters perform well and they are reasonable and can be further performed in comparison with the apcs next we compared the spcs with the apcs and the results are shown in fig 5 in general the spcs in the four watersheds reach the convergence point rapidly and thus they can identify the optimal values quickly the optimization runs for the apcs are above 1300 reaching more than 2000 runs in some watersheds on the contrary the maximum value of optimization convergence for the spcs is around 1000 runs in the early stage of optimization the nses of the spcs are generally higher than that of the apcs in the later stage the spcs reach their optimal values whereas the apcs continue to be optimized and eventually the apcs exceed the spcs the times and nses for spcs and apcs optimization in the four watersheds are quantitatively compared in table 3 in terms of accuracy the nses are close for the two optimal solutions maximum difference of 0 024 in lr and minimum difference of 0 002 in jr thereby demonstrating that the spcs could capture most of the information for the apcs in terms of the optimization time compared with apcs the number of runs almost halve with the spcs in the four watersheds the faster optimization speed indicates a shorter time and lower computational costs compared with apcs the optimal nses are slightly reduced for the simulations with spcs but the optimal nses are relatively high for all watersheds greater than0 88 and sufficiently credible for practical applications overall even though the number of parameters is reduced by nearly 2 3 the maximum number of parameters is 10 in spcs and 27 in apcs the optimization accuracy of the spcs is still close to apcs and optimization speed is faster 3 3 evaluation of optimal sensitive parameters 3 3 1 calibration results the streamflow simulations conducted with the spcs and apcs after finding their optimal sensitive parameter values in each case are compared in fig 6 the final values for the parameters after the optimization of the spcs are shown in table s4 where the relatively insensitive parameters were not optimized and used their default simulation values fig 6 shows that the simulations for the spcs capture most of the hydrograph information for the apcs and especially in jr fig 6 a where the streamflow curves for the spcs and apcs overlap almost exactly thereby implying that the spcs are highly representative of the apcs however there are still some inevitable differences between the simulations of the spcs and apcs in the other watersheds particularly flow overestimations at low values in lr which may have been caused by the pursuit of better calibration peaks fig 6 b in general these deviations are within a relatively small range and the hydrographs for spcs and apcs optimization roughly coincide with no major differences between the two streamflow results to evaluate the performance of spcs optimization in improving the model streamflow simulations we compared the optimized simulations for the spcs with the default simulations and the results are presented in fig 7 clearly the hydrographs in fig 7 show that compared with the default simulations the simulations obtained using the spcs are closer to the observations in particular the spcs significantly reduce the differences in magnitude caused by the default simulations including i large differences from the observation in the peak simulations in all watersheds ii overestimations of the low flows in jr lr and hr and iii a larger average trend in the simulations than the observations in humid and sub humid areas jr and lr but a smaller trend in the arid and semiarid areas hr and ur apart from matching the magnitude of the observed flows the spcs capture the observed flow variations better which is particularly evident in jr fig 7 a in addition to the hydrograph comparisons of streamflow simulations obtained with the spcs apcs and default parameters we present quantitative comparisons in table 4 the nse and r2 values are close for the spcs and apcs maximum nse difference of 0 024 in lr and minimum nse difference of 0 002 in jr maximum r2 difference of 0 015 in hr and minimum r2 difference of 0 000 in jr and the final quantitative results for the optimized spcs are satisfactory nse values all above 0 88 and r2 above 0 91 compared with the default simulations the optimizations of the spcs in different watersheds all quantitatively improve the model performance where the optimized nse and r2 values range from 0 887 to 0 915 and 0 911 to 0 916 respectively while the nse and r2 values in the default simulations range from 0 618 to 0 803 and 0 643 to 0 910 respectively similarly the quantitative improvements are most evident in jr with nse improved from 0 618 to 0 903 δnse 0 285 and r2 improved from 0 643 to 0 916 δr2 0 273 the hydrographs in figs 6 and 7 show strong yearly cycles which often make it easier to obtain high nse values in these watersheds knoben et al 2020 to reduce the impact of this phenomenon on the evaluation of the optimal sensitive parameters new hydrographs fig 8 were obtained using 5 years 1973 1977 of interannual monthly average streamflow data garrick et al 1978 schaefli and gupta 2007 in the average hydrographs the streamflow curves optimized by the spcs and apcs are very similar to the observed in terms of both their variations and magnitude although the apcs simulations are closer to the observations by contrast the default simulations deviate more from the observations table 5 presents the quantitative results obtained from the interannual monthly average streamflow simulations which show that the spcs simulations still achieve substantial improvements in the model performance but there are small differences compared with the apcs simulations maximum nse difference of 0 024 and minimum difference of 0 003 in the spcs simulations nse is above 0 93 and r2 is above 0 96 the simulations of the spcs and apcs all closely match the characteristics of the intra annual streamflow in each watershed jr is located on the southeastern coast of china where rainfall is concentrated in may and june and typhoons are common in autumn thereby resulting in higher streamflow during these periods in lr the observed and simulated results show that the maximum precipitation occurs in july while the peak flow occurs in august which is consistent with a previous study in this region fu et al 2013 ur and hr are located in the arid and semiarid regions of china which are recharged by rainfall and glacial meltwater during the summer thereby leading to summer peaks these illustrate that the simulations with only optimized spcs can also better simulate the streamflow characteristics of the watershed 3 3 2 validation results the remaining five years i e 1978 1982 in the study period were selected as the validation period to test the suitability of the optimal spcs obtained in the previous experiments the simulated streamflows obtained with the default parameters and spcs and the observed streamflow during this phase are shown in fig 9 during the validation period the spcs still significantly improve the streamflow simulations by relatively correctly capturing the peak and valley flows and by reducing the overestimates for jr and the underestimates for hr and ur most of the optimized streamflow curves are still quite close to the observed curves especially in jr the good performance of streamflow simulation optimization in jr is consistent with previous studies in humid southeastern china qian et al 2016 jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 probably due to the more developed economy and larger population in this region a relatively high density of meteorological stations and relatively more accurate data are available xu et al 2013 however the streamflow simulation in lr is relatively poor during this period regardless of the simulations were conducted using the spcs or default parameters in this period the observed precipitation as well as streamflow characteristics of this watershed varied greatly between the first two and last three years with high precipitation and streamflow in the early period but precipitation and streamflow significantly decreased in the later years the significant changes in precipitation and streamflow differ greatly from the calibration period which may indicate the inadequacy of the response to the simulation of changing watershed conditions overall the streamflow simulation is improved in lr table 6 table 6 shows the nse and r2 values for the streamflow simulations conducted using the spcs and default parameters in the validation period the r2 and nse values increase in each watershed to varying degrees using the optimal spcs the ranges of nse and r2 in the four watersheds are 0 725 0 923 and 0 841 0 915 respectively whereas the corresponding ranges for the default simulations are 0 614 0 775 and 0 637 0 796 the results obtained in the validation period also indicate that it is reasonable to use the spcs to improve the streamflow simulations 4 discussion 4 1 swat calibration and uncertainty programs currently most of the parameter sa and optimization of the swat model are performed with the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup shen et al 2012 bhatta et al 2019 hosseini and khaleghi 2020 which is a software dedicated to the swat model calibration and uncertainty analysis abbaspour 2014 it integrates several automatic optimization procedures including the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour et al 2007 particle swarm optimization eberhart and kennedy 1995 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation beven and binley 1992 parameter solution van griensven and bauwens 2003 and markov chain monte carlo kuczera and parent 1998 vrugt et al 2003 marshall et al 2004 yang et al 2007 swat cup is a popular parameter sa and optimization method for the swat model because of its friendly interface simple operation and powerful functions abbaspour et al 2015 grusson et al 2015 ayele et al 2017 bhattacharya et al 2020 however in swat cup parameter optimization is first performed to find the optimal parameter values and then the sa results can be obtained based on regressions of the samples and outputs from the previous optimization search process hosseini and khaleghi 2020 clearly the effect of sa is not considered during parameter optimization moreover the sa results may be inaccurate because of the non uniformly distributed samples produced by the optimization process in fact the optimization process aims to find the optimal values and thus more samples are generated around the optimal values thereby resulting in non uniform samples during search tracking in the optimization process the importance of uniform sampling for obtaining accurate sa results has been demonstrated in previous studies fang et al 2002 gan et al 2014 gong et al 2015 different from the parameter sa and optimization processes of swat cup the spc based optimization system firstly uses the quasi monte carlo method for uniform sampling and then uses quantitative and qualitative sa methods to obtain more robust sa results and finally uses the efficient global optimization sce method for optimization this makes sa detachable from the optimization process and ensures that the sa results are generated by uniform sampling the spc based optimization system provides a new way for parameter sa and optimization of the swat model 4 2 efficiency issue about the spc based optimization system sa and sensitive parameter optimization are included in the spc based optimization system in this system although sa takes time it can provide sensitive information for reference of other studies in these watersheds and based on other sa studies the sensitive parameters can be optimized directly if the watershed sensitive parameters are available and in our study the speed of the sa was not considered instead relatively large samples 100 times of the parameter number i e 2700 samples or 2900 samples for the sobol method were used to expect more accurate sa results it has been shown that samples of 10 times can give reasonable sensitivity parameters li et al 2013 therefore in order to explore the efficiency issue of sa we used the mars method with high reliability in sa shahsavani et al 2010 di et al 2019 as an example to compare the sa results with 10 times 20 times and 100 times of the parameter number samples 270 samples 540 samples and 2700 samples and the results are shown in the fig s1 from fig s1 we can find that although there are inevitably some differences in the sensitivity results of the three samples the sensitive parameters that can be screened out by 10 times samples are already close to the results by 100 times samples and the results of 20 times samples are basically the same as those of 100 times samples the close sensitivity results make it reasonable to assume that using combinations of sensitive parameters at 10 or 20 times samples can also achieve relatively good optimization performance and save optimization time however the purpose of using a larger number of sensitivity samples is to expect a reliable comparison of optimizations between the real sensitivity parameters and all adjustable parameters nevertheless the efficiency of the initial sa may vary under different models drivers surface characteristics and scales the influences of initial sampling on the efficiency of the spc based optimization system can be future investigated to facilitate the application of the spc based optimization framework 4 3 uncertainty of model parameters this study is mainly concerned with the effect of the spc based optimization system in saving optimization efficiency however this optimization system also has the potential to reduce parameter uncertainty in parameter calibration first parameter uncertainty is a common problem in the application of hydrological models which can be attributed to spatial heterogeneity of the surface the scale effect and the lack of sufficient observational data etc wu and liu 2014 fan et al 2016 liu et al 2017 in the process of parameter calibration the interaction between parameters may lead to equifinal parameter sets especially for complex multi parameter models beven and binley 1992 duan et al 1992 gharari et al 2020 while in the spc based optimization system only those relatively sensitive parameters that have a large impact on the output are optimized which reduces the dimensionality of the parameters involved in optimization and thus has the potential to reduce the degree of parameter interactions besides the calibrated results may be fitted with errors or noise in the calibration data resulting in the over parameterization problem also known as overfitting jakeman and hornberger 1993 brun et al 2001 knoben et al 2020 sheikholeslami et al 2021 suggested that the uncertainty caused by over parameterization is mainly due to the negligible influence of most of the parameters on the evaluation results of the model parameters with low sensitivity in our study thus to investigate the role of these relatively insensitive parameters play in the optimization to help understand this issue we calibrated and validated the remaining parameter among all parameters except the relatively sensitive ones i e all insensitive parameter combinations aipcs and the comparison results of spcs apcs and aipcs are shown in fig 10 from fig 10 we can observe that the results of aipcs are not simply obtained by subtracting the results of spcs from apcs like the composition of parameters the optimization of aipcs can also achieve an accuracy which is greater than 0 75 in the calibration period and greater than 0 6 in the validation period for all watersheds besides it can also be observed that although aipcs are worse than spcs in all watersheds during the calibration period these differences are not significant in individual watersheds especially in hr however it is important to note that the accuracy of the aipcs obviously decreases in some watersheds in the validation compared to the calibration including in hr whose accuracy is close to the spcs in the early period without considering lr where the watershed characteristics vary significantly between calibration and validation as mentioned earlier additionally the accuracy of the apcs also declines in this period and it is even slightly lower than the spcs in most watersheds except ur in contrast the spcs have the lowest decrease in accuracy from the calibration period to the validation period these results indicate that the role of those insensitive parameters in the optimization may be more to fit the calibration data rather than evaluation data thus they are more likely to fit the error in the calibration data therefore including those relatively sensitive parameters and excluding those relatively insensitive parameters in the optimization can potentially reduce the degree of over parameterization further research into the effect of spc based optimization systems in reducing uncertainty in parameter calibration is meaningful besides uncertainty also exists in the sa of the parameters the results of the sa are obtained by considering the study phase and watershed as a whole however the sensitivities of the parameters are likely to vary with temporal and spatial scales some parameters are always sensitive whereas others are only sensitive at a specific temporal or spatial scale spatial and temporal variations in parameter sensitivity have been studied previously for example chen et al 2019 investigated the spatial and temporal scaling effects of the parameter sensitivity in non point source pollution simulations in the swat model they identified the soil properties as key parameters under smaller spatial and temporal scales whereas channel related parameters exhibited greater sensitivity at larger scales gharari et al 2020 found that outflow was much less sensitive to changes in the upstream than downstream in an application of the variable infiltration capacity model fan et al 2016 also found that the sensitivity of the parameters in the hymod model would show different characteristics in different seasons for our study the different effects on optimization of spcs that vary with the periods and sub basins or even hrus compared with the spcs that consider space time as a whole can be further analyzed 5 study limitations this study has some limitations due to the lack of sufficient observational data and the model itself on the one hand daily scale streamflow simulations were performed but monthly scale streamflow evaluations were performed since the observations were at a monthly scale the temporal scale of the evaluation is larger than the scale of the simulation is a general phenomenon in hydrological models in areas where data are lacking jayakrishnan et al 2005 li et al 2009 meng et al 2019 gou et al 2020 it has been suggested that the calibration performance under different scales can be different and larger scales may lead to information loss e g information related to quick flow processes sudheer et al 2007 kavetski et al 2011 lerat et al 2020 on the other hand the comparisons between the simulation results and the observations of other variables lacked as a complementary verification we compared the dynamics of optimized soil water content swc to help to verify the calibration results fig s2 the variations in swc are basically consistent with the variations in the precipitation and streamflow in particular in the season with high precipitation the soil water received more recharge from precipitation which increased swc and the opposite results are obtained in the season with low precipitation the results for jr and ur are also found to be similar to the simulation results for swc in previous studies xuchun et al 2009 bao et al 2020 further explanations of these results are provided in the supplementary material when sufficient data are available these issues can be fully discussed and effectively addressed in addition operating watershed delineation step in the swat model for large scale watersheds is time consuming so the areas selected for this study were relatively small the effect of sa on parameter optimization is also expected to be more pronounced in larger areas future attempts can be devoted to optimizing multi variable simulations and extend the spc based optimization system to larger spatial and temporal scales for other models although there are some limitations this study used an spc based optimization system to make significant improvements to the streamflow simulation of the swat model this method can not only provide parameter sensitivity information but also greatly improve the default simulation and increase the optimization efficiency by almost reproducing the multi parameter optimization results using only about 1 3 of the parameters furthermore this method has the potential to reduce the uncertainty of multi parameter optimization the spc based optimization system is a feasible strategy for handling multi parameter optimization problems 6 conclusions in this study we developed an spc based optimization system involving parameter sa and relatively sensitive parameter optimization to improve the streamflow simulations obtained with the swat model in four watersheds jr lr hr and ur in china three qualitative methods dt sot and mars and one quantitative the sobol method sa method were used to obtain comprehensive sensitivity parameters the relatively sensitive parameters were combined into spcs which were calibrated using an efficient sce optimization method the sa results showed that four parameters cn2 sol k alpha bnk and slsubbsn were sensitive for all four watersheds in particular alpha bnk and slsubbsn have been relatively neglected in previous studies in addition gwqmn rchrg dp sol z hru slp and esco were sensitive for three watersheds the number of relatively sensitive parameters in each watershed was no more than 10 which is far lower than the total of 27 tunable parameters besides some parameters exhibited high sensitivity to specific watersheds such as smtmp for ur and it was also found that nearly half of the parameters 13 27 were insensitive in all four watersheds the optimization of the parameters greatly improved the performance of the model but the degree of improvement varied with watersheds in the case of spcs compared to the default simulations relying only on sensitive parameters optimization in the calibration period the maximum nse and r2 improvements of the monthly streamflow simulations were 0 285 and 0 273 in jr in all watersheds the final maximum nse and r2 were 0 915 in hr and 0 916 in jr the maximum nse and r2 improvements of the interannual monthly average streamflow simulations were 0 290 and 0 281 in jr the final maximum nse and r2 were 0 980 in hr and 0 982 in hr and in the validation period the maximum nse and r2 improvements of the monthly streamflow simulations were 0 288 and 0 278 in jr the final maximum nse and r2 were 0 923 and 0 915 in jr in general the nse values were greater than 0 88 during the calibration period in all watersheds and greater than 0 83 during the validation period in three watersheds at the same time in the hydrographs the spcs optimization could more accurately capture the magnitude and trend changes of the observed streamflows compared with the default the degree of agreement with the observed streamflows was significantly improved under spcs optimization however there was an individual watershed lr where the simulation and improvement were not so significant there are 2 issues related to the spc based optimization system mentioned in the introduction for question 1 can parameter sa help to speed up the parameter optimization process overall the optimization runs for the apcs was above 1300 reaching more than 2000 runs in some watersheds on the contrary the maximum value of optimization convergence for the spcs was around 1000 runs from the viewpoint of each watershed compared with apcs the numbers of runs were reduced by more than half in the four watersheds which means that sa can help to speed up the parameter optimization more than twice for question 2 are the spcs screened by the sa methods representative of all the tunable parameters first various qualitative and quantitative methods were combined to avoid missing important parameters and in the optimization process the spcs were compared with different combinations of sensitive and insensitive parameters i e sipcs and all the tunable parameters i e apcs optimization with the spcs obtained higher nse values than the sipcs and the differences were small compared with the apcs maximum δnse 0 024 in lr and minimum δnse 0 002 in jr the selected spcs are considered to be reasonable in the optimization process second in the streamflow process the spcs with no more than 10 parameters were in fairly good agreement with the streamflow processes of the apcs with all 27 tunable parameters except for some inevitable gaps in the peak values and low values in some watersheds although there were some differences between the hydrographs of apcs and spcs they were within a relatively small range the simulations with spcs could capture the streamflow characteristics of the simulations with apcs these results suggest that the spcs screened by the sa methods are representative of all the tunable parameters overall despite the number of parameters is largely reduced nearly 2 3 in this study the optimization accuracy of the sensitivity parameters is still close to all adjustable parameters and optimization speed is quicker the spc based optimization system is effective and applicable optimizing with sensitivity parameters can greatly reduce the computational costs of streamflow simulations

4016,parameter optimization is an essential step in hydrological simulations especially for solving practical problems however parameter optimization is usually intractable for complex models with a large number of parameters in this study a parameter optimization system based on sensitive parameter combinations spcs was developed which comprised four parameter sensitivity analysis sa methods and a sensitive parameter optimization method in particular parameter sa was used to screen out the relatively sensitive parameters with significant impacts on the model output and instead of using all parameter combinations apcs the spcs were optimized with a global optimization method this system was applied to the soil and water assessment tool swat model for daily streamflow simulation and monthly evaluation in four watersheds of china the results showed that no more than 10 sensitive parameters were identified from 27 adjustable parameters for each watershed in particular four parameters cn2 sol k alpha bnk and slsubbsn were relatively sensitive in all watersheds compared with optimizing apcs despite the number of parameters was reduced by almost 2 3 in the optimization of spcs the accuracy was still very close the maximum nash sutcliffe coefficient nse difference was 0 024 and the minimum difference was 0 002 and the optimization speed was doubled in the comparison of monthly streamflow optimization the spcs were in good agreement with the apcs and had an obvious improvement for the default simulation the nse values of the spcs optimization were greater than 0 88 during the calibration period in all watersheds and greater than 0 83 during the validation period in three watersheds these findings indicate that optimizing the sensitivity parameters can greatly reduce the computational costs of swat streamflow simulations while ensuring their accuracy keywords sensitivity analysis parameter optimization streamflow simulation swat model 1 introduction hydrological models have attracted much interest and have become important for solving many practical problems sorooshian and chu 2013 liu et al 2020 especially under climate change and anthropogenic impacts which may cause significant changes in the hydrological processes lu et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2021 pokhrel et al 2021 hydrological models often contain many parameters to better describe the hydrological processes and to account for spatial heterogeneities caused by climate land use etc abbaspour et al 2004 shi et al 2013 fatichi et al 2016 however the existence of spatial heterogeneities may make the parameter values vary greatly in different regions so parameter optimization become an essential step to improve the regional applicability and practicality of the hydrological models sun et al 2001 muleta and nicklow 2005 doherty and hunt 2009 various parameter optimization methods were used to identify the optimal values based on the differences between the simulated and observed variables duan et al 2004 the earliest optimization method is the trial and error method where the parameter values are manually adjusted one at a time but this is a subjective method and only the model developers or experts may find the optimal parameter values gupta et al 1999 muleta and nicklow 2005 objective parameter optimization methods with automatic search facilities were produced with the development of the computer where representative methods include the quasi newton method liu and nocedal 1989 and the downhill simplex method nelder and mead 1965 however these methods tend to become readily trapped in the domain of locally optimal solutions to obtain the global optimal solution algorithms such as simulated annealing kirkpatrick et al 1983 and genetic algorithms michielssen et al 1992 generate global initial samples before optimization and then search for them in different sample groups to find the comprehensive global optimal solution in particular the shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm duan et al 1992 exploits the advantages of simulated annealing genetic algorithms and the downhill simplex algorithm in a highly efficient parameter optimization method it is worth noting that if a large number of tunable parameters are calibrated together the computational burden will be high and the calibration process becomes complex muleta and nicklow 2005 van griensven et al 2006 gou et al 2020 therefore parameter sensitivity analysis sa has been employed to reduce the number of tunable parameters saltelli et al 2004 kannan et al 2007 cibin et al 2010 di et al 2015 by using various sa methods to screen out the sensitive parameters with large impacts on the model outputs as well as excluding insensitive parameters with small impacts however most previous parameter optimization and sa studies did not combine these two processes thereby resulting in the following problems 1 in some studies sa was not performed but instead a small number of parameters were selected for optimization based on the researchers experience confesor and whittaker 2007 khoi and thom 2015 krpec et al 2020 which could lead to the omission of important parameters 2 in other studies sa was performed but these studies only ranked the sa results of all selected parameters and then these parameters were directly optimized rather than those parameters that showed relatively high sensitivity in the sa results mulungu and munishi 2007 zhai et al 2014 odusanya et al 2019 pang et al 2020 this approach does not take advantage of sa in optimization and it may have included parameters with little effect on the outputs thereby wasting time labor and computational costs 3 some researchers performed both sa and optimization of the sensitive parameters gan et al 2018 sreedevi and eldho 2019 but they did not systematically evaluate the representatives of sensitive parameters relative to all the tunable parameters and the effects of sensitive parameters on optimization based on these studies it is not clear whether parameter sa can help to speed up the parameter optimization process and it is unclear what the difference is between optimizing all the tunable parameters and optimizing only the sensitive ones in addition most previous studies only considered the parameter sensitivity results obtained by a single sa method which is less credible compared to multiple sa methods in the present study to evaluate the effects of sensitive parameters on the optimization process a parameter optimization system based on sensitive parameter combinations spcs was developed for a representative distributed hydrological model the soil and water assessment tool swat model arnold et al 1998 in this system sa is first performed using three qualitative methods and one quantitative method to screen out the spcs before the shuffled complex evolution sce optimization method is applied to optimize the spcs the following two critical questions need to be addressed for this system 1 can parameter sa help to speed up the parameter optimization process 2 are the spcs screened by the sa methods representative of all the tunable parameters the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the methods and materials are described in section 2 including the parameter sa methods the parameter optimization method and a case study based on swat streamflow simulation the parameter sa and optimization calibration results are presented in section 3 and the suitability of the optimal parameters in the validation period is also presented discussion and conclusions are given in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 methods and materials this section is an introduction to the methodology that is used in the spc based optimization system consisting of parameter sa and optimization as well as the application of this optimization system to practical cases among it parameter sa experiment involves three main steps including generating samples simulations of samples and sa analysis of the two and the parameter optimization is performed by a global optimal algorithm 2 1 sampling methods uniform sampling methods are usually recommended for sa sampling as they can generate a set of spatially representative sample points using a small number of samples they have the advantage of a relatively efficient sampling process and representative results fang et al 2002 gan et al 2014 gong et al 2015 di et al 2021 in this study the quasi monte carlo sampling a uniform sampling method was used and for the sobol sa method the specialized sobol sampling was used 2 1 1 quasi monte carlo qmc sampling qmc sampling generates a set of low discrepancy sequences different from the random sequences produced by the usual monte carlo mc sampling if the proportion of points in a sequence falling into an arbitrary set is close to the proportion of the set measure it is defined that the discrepancy of the sequence is low obviously the low discrepancy sequence of qmc sampling has better spatial representation compared with the random sequence of mc sampling the point locations of the low discrepancy sequence are determined by the base number construction method and specified sample size caflisch et al 1997 according to the different algorithms there are many low discrepancy sequences built such as the halton sequence halton 1960 faure sequence faure 1982 and niederreiter sequence niederreiter 1988 the widely acknowledged halton sequence was used as the result of qmc sampling in this study 2 1 2 sobol sampling the sobol sampling method is designed to approximately solve the components of the total variance in sobol sa method sobol 1993 it starts with two random r n matrices m 1 and m 2 where r is the number of samples and n is the dimensionality of the input parameters then the rest samples are generated based on the two matrices for each of the r samples in m 1 its i th i from 1 to n dimensionality of the parameter value is retained and the rest of the parameters are replaced with the same dimensionality of values in m 2 finally there are n 2 r parameter samples originated from n new r n matrices and two original m 1 and m 2 2 2 sa methods sa methods can be classified as qualitative and quantitative methods qualitative methods provide heuristic sensitivity scores based on the relative sensitivity of intuitive response parameters quantitative methods evaluate the sensitivity of the parameters by calculating the contribution of the variance due to the perturbation of each parameter relative to the total variance of the model output 2 2 1 qualitative methods 2 2 1 1 delta test dt the dt method was originally devised by pi and peterson 1994 for residual noise variance estimation before eirola et al 2008 extended this method to parameter screening for a subset of parameters the residual noise variance represents the difference in the constructed model compared with the real model which can be approximately estimated by finding the nearest neighbor of the input point 1 v a r ε 1 2 m i 1 m y i y n i 2 where ε is the noise term the right hand term is defined as the dt value m is the sample size and y i and y n i represent the simulation errors of the model corresponding to the i th sampling point i e xi and its nearest neighbor n i respectively n i is defined as the unique point that minimizes a distance metric to that point in the input space as follows 2 n i arg min i j x i x j 2 for n parameters mathematically there are 2 n 1 non empty parameter subsets and each subset has a dt value based on equation 1 i e the projection errors of all sample outputs in the subset space the dt value is positively related to the sensitivity of its parameters the normalized sensitivity score of the i th parameter is defined as 3 scor e i d t d t i max d t 1 d t 2 d t n where dt i the sum of the dt values for all subsets including the i th parameter and n is the number of tunable parameters 2 2 1 2 sum of trees sot sot was originally developed as a classification and regression tree cart model before it was then used as a useful qualitative method for parameter screening chipman et al 2010 sot divides the data space into different partitions by recursion and fits a prediction model to each partition breiman et al 2017 the parameter variable is split continuously during recursion to minimize the residual sum of squares rss however the termination condition for recursion should be set to prevent overfitting of the model which usually depends on whether rss is lower than the specified threshold after constructing a reasonable sot regression model sa is then performed based on the regression model the number of splits ns in each parameter variable space represents its sensitivity a parameter is more sensitive when ns is higher finally the normalized sensitivity score of the i th parameter is defined as 4 scor e i s o t n s i max n s 1 n s 2 n s n where n s i is the ns for the i th parameter and n is the number of tunable parameters 2 2 1 3 multivariate adaptive regression splines mars similar to sot mars is another cart model sot and mars differ in terms of the regression function in each partition with a uniform function for sot and a low order function for mars the low order function for mars is constructed as a linear combination of three types of basis functions a constant hinge function and product of several hinge functions all these functions form the overall mars regression model f x in the dimension space of all of the parameters which can be expressed as 5 f x β 0 m 1 m β m h m x where β 0 is a constant term β m represents the coefficient of basis function m is the number of parameter samples and h m x is a hinge function or the product of multiple hinge functions the mars sensitivity score is defined based on the evaluation of equation 5 the deletion of a parameter from this equation that results in the largest loss indicates that this is the most sensitive parameter the normalized sensitivity score for the i th parameter is defined as 6 scor e i m a r s δ g c v i max δ g c v 1 δ g c v 2 δ g c v n where δ g c v i is the increase in the generalized cross validation gcv error between the mars regression function excluding the i th parameter and the original function at all sample points and n represents the number of tunable parameters the gcv can be expressed as follows 7 g c v m 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 1 1 c m d n 2 where n is the number of parameter samples yi is the real output of the i th sample y i is the corresponding mars regression output d is the number of degrees of sample freedom and c m is a penalty factor for adding a low order function 2 2 2 quantitative method the sobol method is an algorithm that quantifies the parameter sensitivity by calculating the contribution of each parameter to the total variance of the model outputs sobol 1993 the total variance of model outputs using the sobol method can be decomposed as follows 8 v i 1 n v i 1 i j n n v ij v 1 2 n where n is the total number of parameters and v i and v ij represent the portions of the output variance explained only by the i th variable and the interaction between the i th and j th variables respectively equation 8 can be divided by v to obtain a standardized expression 9 i 1 n s i 1 i j n n s ij s 1 2 n 1 where s i refers to the main effect first order effect s ij is a two way interaction effect and the others are multi way interaction effects the total effect of the i th parameter includes its main effect and all of its related interactions and the total effect represents its sensitivity 2 3 parameter optimization method the sce method is one of the most popular global optimization algorithms for hydrological models at the watershed scale the sce method absorbs the concepts of competitive complex evolution complex shuffling and downhill simplex algorithm and thus it is effective for solving nonlinear constrained optimization problems in the sce method the complex is the main search unit the sce parameter optimization algorithm can be briefly described as follows 1 a random sampling method is first used to generate some random parameter samples in tunable parameter ranges and these samples are then divided into several complexes each complex usually includes 2n 1 samples where n is the tunable parameter number 2 next the samples of each complex are independently evolved to search for the local optimal solution using the downhill simplex method 3 after several evolutions the original complexes are destroyed to generate the new ones where the samples from all of the original complexes are combined as a whole and then redistributed to the different complexes the aim is to avoid becoming trapped by a locally optimal solution 4 the evolution and combination steps i e steps 2 3 are repeated until the convergence criteria are met finally the global optimal solution is found in this study the convergence criterion requires that the optimal value is unchanged after 20 rounds of parameter dimensionality searches 2 4 case study in this study we will analyze the effect of parameter sa in parameter optimization by using the distributed hydrological model the swat model for streamflow simulations in four watersheds in china 2 4 1 study areas four watersheds in china with different moisture conditions were selected for swat streamflow simulation the jiao river jr watershed in a humid region the luan river lr watershed in a semi humid region the upstream of the hei river hr watershed in a semiarid region and the urumqi river ur watershed in an arid region fig 1 shows the locations of the watersheds and meteorological and hydrological stations and table s1 provides the information for these stations the jr watershed is located on the southeast coast of china and the annual rainfall is close to 2000 mm with typical humid conditions in the study period considered the land use type in the jr watershed is mainly forest land and the soil types are mainly calcic luvisols and humic acrisols the lr watershed on the north china plain has diverse soil types and the main land use types are forest land and grassland the hr watershed is in the upper mountainous area of the heihe river with a semiarid climate the main land use type distributed in this watershed is grassland the ur watershed is located in an inland area of northwestern china and it has relatively low rainfall but high evaporation the land use types comprise grassland and a small amount of forest land and there is a large area of bare land details of the land use for the year 1980 and soil types in all the watersheds are presented in table s2 2 4 2 swat model the swat model is one of the most commonly used hydrological models gassman et al 2014 bhatta et al 2019 ghaith and li 2020 which was developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service based on the simulator water resources in rural watersheds model this model has been employed frequently since its development and is now one of the most widely used hydrological models in recent decades studies based on the swat model for streamflow simulation have been conducted all over the world douglas mankin et al 2010 and parameter optimization of streamflow simulation has been conducted widely using this model jayakrishnan et al 2005 wu and liu 2012 shadmehri toosi et al 2019 in addition to streamflow simulation the swat model can also be applied to studies of climate change ficklin et al 2009 bhatta et al 2019 land use change ghaffari et al 2010 chen et al 2019 non point source pollution yang et al 2011 and sediment simulation qiu et al 2012 pinto et al 2013 therefore the main reasons for choosing the swat model in the present study are its applicability and functionality swat is implemented in arcmap software the swat model firstly extracts the river networks based on digital elevation model dem information and divides the basin into sub basins next the model loads the soil type land use and terrain slope information before further partitioning the sub basins into hydrological response units hrus according to the thresholds for these three information types swat uses a series of conceptual models to calculate the daily month or year flow at every sub basin outlet finally the sub basins flows are summarized to obtain the basin flow the simulation flow depends on the topography soil land use and climate information and the underlying surface properties and meteorological conditions in different regions are heterogeneous thus large regional differences may potentially exist the parameters in the swat model need to be calibrated to improve the regional applicability of the model 2 4 3 model parameters according to swat input output documentation arnold et al 2013 and previous studies yang et al 2007 khorashadi zadeh et al 2017 liu et al 2017 27 commonly used parameters and their adjustable ranges were selected for parameter sa and optimization of the swat model details of these parameters are shown in table 1 according to their spatial scales and distribution the 27 parameters were divided into six categories basin bsn sub basin sub hru main channel rte groundwater gw and soil sol in addition the management mgt category was included to assess the impacts of human activities the mgt process mainly refers to parameters related to planting harvesting irrigation tillage operations and tile drains it should be noted that the values of some parameters varied greatly in the sub basins even hrus due to their physical properties so a multiplier was applied to these parameters in order to be consistent with the physical space 2 4 4 available data similar to most hydrological models the data required by the swat model are mainly divided into input data for running the model and data used for calibration the input data include dem soil land use and climate information in the present study the calibration data comprised flow data from hydrological stations climate data were simulated using daily data and monthly data were used for streamflow evaluation the period was determined as 1971 to 1982 and the first two years were set as the warm up period the five years from 1973 to 1977 were used for calibration and the remaining five years 1978 1982 were employed for validation descriptions of the data are given in table s3 2 4 5 model performance evaluation the streamflow simulation is a major part of a hydrological model and its performance is evaluated by comparing the simulated flow with the observed flow the streamflow simulations at the daily scale are accumulated monthly for comparison with monthly observations the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was employed as the objective function for optimization this is an objective function commonly used in hydrologic model streamflow simulations krause et al 2005 her and chaubey 2015 and it is sensitive to high values therefore simulations of peak flows have a greater impact on this coefficient rather than baseflow and recession components of hydrographs wang et al 2009 ritter and munoz carpena 2013 moriasi et al 2015 besides as a complementary indicator the coefficient of determination r2 was used to evaluate the model nse and r2 are calculated as follows 10 nse 1 i 1 n q o q s i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 11 r 2 i 1 n q o i q o q s i q s 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 i 1 n q s i q s 2 where o denotes the observed results s denotes the simulated results q is the flow and q is the average flow the ranges of nse and r2 are 1 and 0 1 respectively 2 5 experimental procedure the experimental procedure consists of initial sampling qualitative and quantitative parameter sa and parameter optimization these three parts were applied sequentially to the streamflow simulation of the swat model parameter sa is first required to sample the adjustable parameter range to obtain random parameter samples and then these samples respectively replace the default parameter values of the swat model for obtaining the corresponding simulation errors as an input the perturbed parameter values and their simulation errors are put into the sa methods to obtain parameter sa scores in this study to obtain more accurate sa results 100 times parameter samplings were first generated randomly from 27 tunable parameters ranges for qualitative sa methods dt sot and mars the total samples were 2700 and for sobol quantitative sa 2900 samples were generated according to the sobol sampling criterion refer to 2 1 2 then these samples were entered into the swat model to simulate the streamflow for each of the four watersheds the simulation period was from 1971 to 1977 and the later five year streamflow simulations were compared without the first two years as a warm up period based on these samples and their corresponding streamflow simulation errors the sa scores of 27 parameters were calculated for each watershed based on the various sa results the combinations of sensitive parameters were determined as the final sensitive parameters of the swat model for each of the four watersheds next the sce optimization method was used for the optimization of the sensitive parameter combinations or other parameter combinations according to the needs of the analysis 3 results 3 1 sa results the qualitative and quantitative sa results based on 27 parameters for the four watersheds are shown in figs 2 and 3 the sensitivity results based on qualitative methods were classified into three classes low sensitivity middle sensitivity and high sensitivity in order not to miss sensitive parameters a parameter was considered sensitive provided that it was not a low sensitivity parameter with all qualitative methods the threshold was set as 0 1 for the sobol method similarly parameters were considered to be sensitive if they were evaluated accordingly by the qualitative or the sobol methods according to the results in fig 2 and fig 3 the sensitive parameters for each watershed are listed in table 2 table 2 shows that the qualitative methods could screen out more sensitive parameters whereas the sobol method identified relatively fewer sensitive parameters and they were all included in the qualitative results the two method categories were combined to yield the final sensitive parameters where the total number was no more than 10 of the 27 tunable parameters in all watersheds and the final sensitive parameters for each watershed comprised the spcs for further optimization in addition although the sensitive parameters and the degree of sensitivity varied among the watersheds the sensitive parameters in the different watersheds also shared some common characteristics in particular four parameters were sensitive in all watersheds p1 p10 p14 and p16 and five were sensitive in three p4 p7 p8 p17 and p20 in addition 13 of the 27 parameters were insensitive and they were separated from the sensitive parameters p3 p5 p6 p11 p12 p15 p18 p21 p22 p24 p25 p26 and p27 the sa results show that the soil conservation service curve number ii cn2 saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k baseflow alpha factor for bank storage alpha bnk and average slope length slsubbsn were sensitive for all watersheds cn2 is a comprehensive parameter that reflects the characteristics of the watershed before rainfall in general cn2 is recognized as the most important parameter in swat streamflow simulations eckhardt and arnold 2001 shen et al 2012 mainly because swat uses the soil conservation service streamflow curve method and the green and ampt method to calculate the surface streamflow in addition the surface streamflow in most watersheds plays a dominant role in the total annual streamflow therefore cn2 exhibited relatively high sensitivity in each watershed sol k is a key parameter for characterizing the soil infiltration capacity which affects the hydrological cycle by participating in infiltration processes chapuis 2012 araya and ghezzehei 2019 a higher sol k value indicates that the soil has a greater infiltration capacity and the recharge to groundwater from surface and soil water is higher the sensitivity of sol k has also been confirmed in watersheds with different climates terrain forms and vegetation types kushwaha and jain 2013 thavhana et al 2018 mulungu and munishi 2007 suggested that cn2 and sol k were the most sensitive and physically meaningful parameters for swat streamflow simulations compared with cn2 and sol k alpha bnk and slsubbsn have been used less frequently in previous streamflow simulation studies zhang et al 2009 kushwaha and jain 2013 dhami et al 2018 and thus their sensitivity is relatively unclear alpha bnk is used to characterize the bank storage recession curve where a large value approaching 1 indicates a smooth recession and a low value approaching 0 indicates a steep recession the sensitivity of this parameter has been confirmed in previous studies of the daning river and chao river in china shen et al 2011 pang et al 2020 slsubbsn is the average distance at which the flow begins to concentrate and it is an important factor in runoff and erosion bryan and poesen 1989 govers 1991 the general sensitivities of slsubbsn and hru slp p17 that was sensitive in three watersheds suggest that the slope characteristics may be extremely important factors that affect the streamflow especially in the asian monsoon climate region where the frequency of sudden heavy rainfall is high eckhardt and arnold 2001 shen et al 2012 xin et al 2019 pang et al 2020 in addition to co sensitive parameters some parameters exhibited high sensitivity to specific watersheds such as p23 smtmp for ur p23 represents the minimum temperature at which snow begins to melt and snow melts more readily when the parameter is lower the snowmelt recharges the surface runoff groundwater and soil water as part of precipitation neitsch et al 2011 the relatively high elevation of the ur watershed and its arid climate with low rainfall make snowmelt recharge one of the main types of recharge in this region therefore this parameter may have a large impact on streamflow in the region abudu et al 2016 in addition compared with hr and ur we found that p19 canmx maximum canopy storage was sensitive in jr and lr we inferred that canmx was a sensitive parameter for humid and semi humid regions but insensitive for arid and semiarid regions the canmx parameter is closely related to canopy interception which mainly affects forest ecosystems miralles et al 2010 vegetation canopies with high canmx values retain more precipitation and exhibit higher vegetation evapotranspiration putuhena and cordery 2000 in general rainfall is more abundant in humid and semi humid regions and forestlands are more widespread compared with arid and semiarid regions so canmx plays a more important role in the hydrological cycle in these regions therefore it is recommended to consider this parameter in the simulation of swat streamflow in humid and semi humid regions 3 2 evaluation of spc based optimization system to evaluate the spc based optimization system we conducted comparative optimization experiments with spcs versus the sensitive and insensitive parameter combinations sipcs and all parameter combinations apcs in each watershed for the simulation periods from 1973 to 1977 using the sce method first the spcs obtained from the sa methods were optimized in comparison with the sipcs the sipcs were composed of different combinations of sensitive and insensitive parameters and for better comparison with spcs the number of parameters of both was the same in the respective watersheds due to limited calculations 20 different sets of sipcs were combined in each watershed then they were optimized and the one with the highest objective function value was selected for comparison with spcs the optimal combinations of sipcs were sensitive parameters 1 insensitive parameter in jr 7 sensitive parameters 1 insensitive parameter in lr 7 sensitive parameters 2 insensitive parameters in hr and 9 sensitive parameters 1 insensitive parameter in ur basically the optimal sipcs appeared in the combinations with more sensitive parameters a detailed description of the sipcs is available in the supplementary material the comparison results with spcs are shown in fig 4 it can be seen from it that the nse of the optimal sipcs in each watershed is lower than that of the spcs while the differences are relatively small maximum δnse 0 04 in lr minimum δnse greater than 0 01 in jr in lr and hr the optimization process of the spcs is almost always better than that of the sipcs while in jr and ur the spcs surpass the sipcs during the search process and finally arrive at better optimization results these results indicate that under the same number of parameters the sipcs with some insensitive parameters are less effective in optimization compared to the spcs while the spcs with all sensitive parameters perform well and they are reasonable and can be further performed in comparison with the apcs next we compared the spcs with the apcs and the results are shown in fig 5 in general the spcs in the four watersheds reach the convergence point rapidly and thus they can identify the optimal values quickly the optimization runs for the apcs are above 1300 reaching more than 2000 runs in some watersheds on the contrary the maximum value of optimization convergence for the spcs is around 1000 runs in the early stage of optimization the nses of the spcs are generally higher than that of the apcs in the later stage the spcs reach their optimal values whereas the apcs continue to be optimized and eventually the apcs exceed the spcs the times and nses for spcs and apcs optimization in the four watersheds are quantitatively compared in table 3 in terms of accuracy the nses are close for the two optimal solutions maximum difference of 0 024 in lr and minimum difference of 0 002 in jr thereby demonstrating that the spcs could capture most of the information for the apcs in terms of the optimization time compared with apcs the number of runs almost halve with the spcs in the four watersheds the faster optimization speed indicates a shorter time and lower computational costs compared with apcs the optimal nses are slightly reduced for the simulations with spcs but the optimal nses are relatively high for all watersheds greater than0 88 and sufficiently credible for practical applications overall even though the number of parameters is reduced by nearly 2 3 the maximum number of parameters is 10 in spcs and 27 in apcs the optimization accuracy of the spcs is still close to apcs and optimization speed is faster 3 3 evaluation of optimal sensitive parameters 3 3 1 calibration results the streamflow simulations conducted with the spcs and apcs after finding their optimal sensitive parameter values in each case are compared in fig 6 the final values for the parameters after the optimization of the spcs are shown in table s4 where the relatively insensitive parameters were not optimized and used their default simulation values fig 6 shows that the simulations for the spcs capture most of the hydrograph information for the apcs and especially in jr fig 6 a where the streamflow curves for the spcs and apcs overlap almost exactly thereby implying that the spcs are highly representative of the apcs however there are still some inevitable differences between the simulations of the spcs and apcs in the other watersheds particularly flow overestimations at low values in lr which may have been caused by the pursuit of better calibration peaks fig 6 b in general these deviations are within a relatively small range and the hydrographs for spcs and apcs optimization roughly coincide with no major differences between the two streamflow results to evaluate the performance of spcs optimization in improving the model streamflow simulations we compared the optimized simulations for the spcs with the default simulations and the results are presented in fig 7 clearly the hydrographs in fig 7 show that compared with the default simulations the simulations obtained using the spcs are closer to the observations in particular the spcs significantly reduce the differences in magnitude caused by the default simulations including i large differences from the observation in the peak simulations in all watersheds ii overestimations of the low flows in jr lr and hr and iii a larger average trend in the simulations than the observations in humid and sub humid areas jr and lr but a smaller trend in the arid and semiarid areas hr and ur apart from matching the magnitude of the observed flows the spcs capture the observed flow variations better which is particularly evident in jr fig 7 a in addition to the hydrograph comparisons of streamflow simulations obtained with the spcs apcs and default parameters we present quantitative comparisons in table 4 the nse and r2 values are close for the spcs and apcs maximum nse difference of 0 024 in lr and minimum nse difference of 0 002 in jr maximum r2 difference of 0 015 in hr and minimum r2 difference of 0 000 in jr and the final quantitative results for the optimized spcs are satisfactory nse values all above 0 88 and r2 above 0 91 compared with the default simulations the optimizations of the spcs in different watersheds all quantitatively improve the model performance where the optimized nse and r2 values range from 0 887 to 0 915 and 0 911 to 0 916 respectively while the nse and r2 values in the default simulations range from 0 618 to 0 803 and 0 643 to 0 910 respectively similarly the quantitative improvements are most evident in jr with nse improved from 0 618 to 0 903 δnse 0 285 and r2 improved from 0 643 to 0 916 δr2 0 273 the hydrographs in figs 6 and 7 show strong yearly cycles which often make it easier to obtain high nse values in these watersheds knoben et al 2020 to reduce the impact of this phenomenon on the evaluation of the optimal sensitive parameters new hydrographs fig 8 were obtained using 5 years 1973 1977 of interannual monthly average streamflow data garrick et al 1978 schaefli and gupta 2007 in the average hydrographs the streamflow curves optimized by the spcs and apcs are very similar to the observed in terms of both their variations and magnitude although the apcs simulations are closer to the observations by contrast the default simulations deviate more from the observations table 5 presents the quantitative results obtained from the interannual monthly average streamflow simulations which show that the spcs simulations still achieve substantial improvements in the model performance but there are small differences compared with the apcs simulations maximum nse difference of 0 024 and minimum difference of 0 003 in the spcs simulations nse is above 0 93 and r2 is above 0 96 the simulations of the spcs and apcs all closely match the characteristics of the intra annual streamflow in each watershed jr is located on the southeastern coast of china where rainfall is concentrated in may and june and typhoons are common in autumn thereby resulting in higher streamflow during these periods in lr the observed and simulated results show that the maximum precipitation occurs in july while the peak flow occurs in august which is consistent with a previous study in this region fu et al 2013 ur and hr are located in the arid and semiarid regions of china which are recharged by rainfall and glacial meltwater during the summer thereby leading to summer peaks these illustrate that the simulations with only optimized spcs can also better simulate the streamflow characteristics of the watershed 3 3 2 validation results the remaining five years i e 1978 1982 in the study period were selected as the validation period to test the suitability of the optimal spcs obtained in the previous experiments the simulated streamflows obtained with the default parameters and spcs and the observed streamflow during this phase are shown in fig 9 during the validation period the spcs still significantly improve the streamflow simulations by relatively correctly capturing the peak and valley flows and by reducing the overestimates for jr and the underestimates for hr and ur most of the optimized streamflow curves are still quite close to the observed curves especially in jr the good performance of streamflow simulation optimization in jr is consistent with previous studies in humid southeastern china qian et al 2016 jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 probably due to the more developed economy and larger population in this region a relatively high density of meteorological stations and relatively more accurate data are available xu et al 2013 however the streamflow simulation in lr is relatively poor during this period regardless of the simulations were conducted using the spcs or default parameters in this period the observed precipitation as well as streamflow characteristics of this watershed varied greatly between the first two and last three years with high precipitation and streamflow in the early period but precipitation and streamflow significantly decreased in the later years the significant changes in precipitation and streamflow differ greatly from the calibration period which may indicate the inadequacy of the response to the simulation of changing watershed conditions overall the streamflow simulation is improved in lr table 6 table 6 shows the nse and r2 values for the streamflow simulations conducted using the spcs and default parameters in the validation period the r2 and nse values increase in each watershed to varying degrees using the optimal spcs the ranges of nse and r2 in the four watersheds are 0 725 0 923 and 0 841 0 915 respectively whereas the corresponding ranges for the default simulations are 0 614 0 775 and 0 637 0 796 the results obtained in the validation period also indicate that it is reasonable to use the spcs to improve the streamflow simulations 4 discussion 4 1 swat calibration and uncertainty programs currently most of the parameter sa and optimization of the swat model are performed with the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup shen et al 2012 bhatta et al 2019 hosseini and khaleghi 2020 which is a software dedicated to the swat model calibration and uncertainty analysis abbaspour 2014 it integrates several automatic optimization procedures including the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour et al 2007 particle swarm optimization eberhart and kennedy 1995 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation beven and binley 1992 parameter solution van griensven and bauwens 2003 and markov chain monte carlo kuczera and parent 1998 vrugt et al 2003 marshall et al 2004 yang et al 2007 swat cup is a popular parameter sa and optimization method for the swat model because of its friendly interface simple operation and powerful functions abbaspour et al 2015 grusson et al 2015 ayele et al 2017 bhattacharya et al 2020 however in swat cup parameter optimization is first performed to find the optimal parameter values and then the sa results can be obtained based on regressions of the samples and outputs from the previous optimization search process hosseini and khaleghi 2020 clearly the effect of sa is not considered during parameter optimization moreover the sa results may be inaccurate because of the non uniformly distributed samples produced by the optimization process in fact the optimization process aims to find the optimal values and thus more samples are generated around the optimal values thereby resulting in non uniform samples during search tracking in the optimization process the importance of uniform sampling for obtaining accurate sa results has been demonstrated in previous studies fang et al 2002 gan et al 2014 gong et al 2015 different from the parameter sa and optimization processes of swat cup the spc based optimization system firstly uses the quasi monte carlo method for uniform sampling and then uses quantitative and qualitative sa methods to obtain more robust sa results and finally uses the efficient global optimization sce method for optimization this makes sa detachable from the optimization process and ensures that the sa results are generated by uniform sampling the spc based optimization system provides a new way for parameter sa and optimization of the swat model 4 2 efficiency issue about the spc based optimization system sa and sensitive parameter optimization are included in the spc based optimization system in this system although sa takes time it can provide sensitive information for reference of other studies in these watersheds and based on other sa studies the sensitive parameters can be optimized directly if the watershed sensitive parameters are available and in our study the speed of the sa was not considered instead relatively large samples 100 times of the parameter number i e 2700 samples or 2900 samples for the sobol method were used to expect more accurate sa results it has been shown that samples of 10 times can give reasonable sensitivity parameters li et al 2013 therefore in order to explore the efficiency issue of sa we used the mars method with high reliability in sa shahsavani et al 2010 di et al 2019 as an example to compare the sa results with 10 times 20 times and 100 times of the parameter number samples 270 samples 540 samples and 2700 samples and the results are shown in the fig s1 from fig s1 we can find that although there are inevitably some differences in the sensitivity results of the three samples the sensitive parameters that can be screened out by 10 times samples are already close to the results by 100 times samples and the results of 20 times samples are basically the same as those of 100 times samples the close sensitivity results make it reasonable to assume that using combinations of sensitive parameters at 10 or 20 times samples can also achieve relatively good optimization performance and save optimization time however the purpose of using a larger number of sensitivity samples is to expect a reliable comparison of optimizations between the real sensitivity parameters and all adjustable parameters nevertheless the efficiency of the initial sa may vary under different models drivers surface characteristics and scales the influences of initial sampling on the efficiency of the spc based optimization system can be future investigated to facilitate the application of the spc based optimization framework 4 3 uncertainty of model parameters this study is mainly concerned with the effect of the spc based optimization system in saving optimization efficiency however this optimization system also has the potential to reduce parameter uncertainty in parameter calibration first parameter uncertainty is a common problem in the application of hydrological models which can be attributed to spatial heterogeneity of the surface the scale effect and the lack of sufficient observational data etc wu and liu 2014 fan et al 2016 liu et al 2017 in the process of parameter calibration the interaction between parameters may lead to equifinal parameter sets especially for complex multi parameter models beven and binley 1992 duan et al 1992 gharari et al 2020 while in the spc based optimization system only those relatively sensitive parameters that have a large impact on the output are optimized which reduces the dimensionality of the parameters involved in optimization and thus has the potential to reduce the degree of parameter interactions besides the calibrated results may be fitted with errors or noise in the calibration data resulting in the over parameterization problem also known as overfitting jakeman and hornberger 1993 brun et al 2001 knoben et al 2020 sheikholeslami et al 2021 suggested that the uncertainty caused by over parameterization is mainly due to the negligible influence of most of the parameters on the evaluation results of the model parameters with low sensitivity in our study thus to investigate the role of these relatively insensitive parameters play in the optimization to help understand this issue we calibrated and validated the remaining parameter among all parameters except the relatively sensitive ones i e all insensitive parameter combinations aipcs and the comparison results of spcs apcs and aipcs are shown in fig 10 from fig 10 we can observe that the results of aipcs are not simply obtained by subtracting the results of spcs from apcs like the composition of parameters the optimization of aipcs can also achieve an accuracy which is greater than 0 75 in the calibration period and greater than 0 6 in the validation period for all watersheds besides it can also be observed that although aipcs are worse than spcs in all watersheds during the calibration period these differences are not significant in individual watersheds especially in hr however it is important to note that the accuracy of the aipcs obviously decreases in some watersheds in the validation compared to the calibration including in hr whose accuracy is close to the spcs in the early period without considering lr where the watershed characteristics vary significantly between calibration and validation as mentioned earlier additionally the accuracy of the apcs also declines in this period and it is even slightly lower than the spcs in most watersheds except ur in contrast the spcs have the lowest decrease in accuracy from the calibration period to the validation period these results indicate that the role of those insensitive parameters in the optimization may be more to fit the calibration data rather than evaluation data thus they are more likely to fit the error in the calibration data therefore including those relatively sensitive parameters and excluding those relatively insensitive parameters in the optimization can potentially reduce the degree of over parameterization further research into the effect of spc based optimization systems in reducing uncertainty in parameter calibration is meaningful besides uncertainty also exists in the sa of the parameters the results of the sa are obtained by considering the study phase and watershed as a whole however the sensitivities of the parameters are likely to vary with temporal and spatial scales some parameters are always sensitive whereas others are only sensitive at a specific temporal or spatial scale spatial and temporal variations in parameter sensitivity have been studied previously for example chen et al 2019 investigated the spatial and temporal scaling effects of the parameter sensitivity in non point source pollution simulations in the swat model they identified the soil properties as key parameters under smaller spatial and temporal scales whereas channel related parameters exhibited greater sensitivity at larger scales gharari et al 2020 found that outflow was much less sensitive to changes in the upstream than downstream in an application of the variable infiltration capacity model fan et al 2016 also found that the sensitivity of the parameters in the hymod model would show different characteristics in different seasons for our study the different effects on optimization of spcs that vary with the periods and sub basins or even hrus compared with the spcs that consider space time as a whole can be further analyzed 5 study limitations this study has some limitations due to the lack of sufficient observational data and the model itself on the one hand daily scale streamflow simulations were performed but monthly scale streamflow evaluations were performed since the observations were at a monthly scale the temporal scale of the evaluation is larger than the scale of the simulation is a general phenomenon in hydrological models in areas where data are lacking jayakrishnan et al 2005 li et al 2009 meng et al 2019 gou et al 2020 it has been suggested that the calibration performance under different scales can be different and larger scales may lead to information loss e g information related to quick flow processes sudheer et al 2007 kavetski et al 2011 lerat et al 2020 on the other hand the comparisons between the simulation results and the observations of other variables lacked as a complementary verification we compared the dynamics of optimized soil water content swc to help to verify the calibration results fig s2 the variations in swc are basically consistent with the variations in the precipitation and streamflow in particular in the season with high precipitation the soil water received more recharge from precipitation which increased swc and the opposite results are obtained in the season with low precipitation the results for jr and ur are also found to be similar to the simulation results for swc in previous studies xuchun et al 2009 bao et al 2020 further explanations of these results are provided in the supplementary material when sufficient data are available these issues can be fully discussed and effectively addressed in addition operating watershed delineation step in the swat model for large scale watersheds is time consuming so the areas selected for this study were relatively small the effect of sa on parameter optimization is also expected to be more pronounced in larger areas future attempts can be devoted to optimizing multi variable simulations and extend the spc based optimization system to larger spatial and temporal scales for other models although there are some limitations this study used an spc based optimization system to make significant improvements to the streamflow simulation of the swat model this method can not only provide parameter sensitivity information but also greatly improve the default simulation and increase the optimization efficiency by almost reproducing the multi parameter optimization results using only about 1 3 of the parameters furthermore this method has the potential to reduce the uncertainty of multi parameter optimization the spc based optimization system is a feasible strategy for handling multi parameter optimization problems 6 conclusions in this study we developed an spc based optimization system involving parameter sa and relatively sensitive parameter optimization to improve the streamflow simulations obtained with the swat model in four watersheds jr lr hr and ur in china three qualitative methods dt sot and mars and one quantitative the sobol method sa method were used to obtain comprehensive sensitivity parameters the relatively sensitive parameters were combined into spcs which were calibrated using an efficient sce optimization method the sa results showed that four parameters cn2 sol k alpha bnk and slsubbsn were sensitive for all four watersheds in particular alpha bnk and slsubbsn have been relatively neglected in previous studies in addition gwqmn rchrg dp sol z hru slp and esco were sensitive for three watersheds the number of relatively sensitive parameters in each watershed was no more than 10 which is far lower than the total of 27 tunable parameters besides some parameters exhibited high sensitivity to specific watersheds such as smtmp for ur and it was also found that nearly half of the parameters 13 27 were insensitive in all four watersheds the optimization of the parameters greatly improved the performance of the model but the degree of improvement varied with watersheds in the case of spcs compared to the default simulations relying only on sensitive parameters optimization in the calibration period the maximum nse and r2 improvements of the monthly streamflow simulations were 0 285 and 0 273 in jr in all watersheds the final maximum nse and r2 were 0 915 in hr and 0 916 in jr the maximum nse and r2 improvements of the interannual monthly average streamflow simulations were 0 290 and 0 281 in jr the final maximum nse and r2 were 0 980 in hr and 0 982 in hr and in the validation period the maximum nse and r2 improvements of the monthly streamflow simulations were 0 288 and 0 278 in jr the final maximum nse and r2 were 0 923 and 0 915 in jr in general the nse values were greater than 0 88 during the calibration period in all watersheds and greater than 0 83 during the validation period in three watersheds at the same time in the hydrographs the spcs optimization could more accurately capture the magnitude and trend changes of the observed streamflows compared with the default the degree of agreement with the observed streamflows was significantly improved under spcs optimization however there was an individual watershed lr where the simulation and improvement were not so significant there are 2 issues related to the spc based optimization system mentioned in the introduction for question 1 can parameter sa help to speed up the parameter optimization process overall the optimization runs for the apcs was above 1300 reaching more than 2000 runs in some watersheds on the contrary the maximum value of optimization convergence for the spcs was around 1000 runs from the viewpoint of each watershed compared with apcs the numbers of runs were reduced by more than half in the four watersheds which means that sa can help to speed up the parameter optimization more than twice for question 2 are the spcs screened by the sa methods representative of all the tunable parameters first various qualitative and quantitative methods were combined to avoid missing important parameters and in the optimization process the spcs were compared with different combinations of sensitive and insensitive parameters i e sipcs and all the tunable parameters i e apcs optimization with the spcs obtained higher nse values than the sipcs and the differences were small compared with the apcs maximum δnse 0 024 in lr and minimum δnse 0 002 in jr the selected spcs are considered to be reasonable in the optimization process second in the streamflow process the spcs with no more than 10 parameters were in fairly good agreement with the streamflow processes of the apcs with all 27 tunable parameters except for some inevitable gaps in the peak values and low values in some watersheds although there were some differences between the hydrographs of apcs and spcs they were within a relatively small range the simulations with spcs could capture the streamflow characteristics of the simulations with apcs these results suggest that the spcs screened by the sa methods are representative of all the tunable parameters overall despite the number of parameters is largely reduced nearly 2 3 in this study the optimization accuracy of the sensitivity parameters is still close to all adjustable parameters and optimization speed is quicker the spc based optimization system is effective and applicable optimizing with sensitivity parameters can greatly reduce the computational costs of streamflow simulations

4017,weirs are commonly used for controlling measuring and regulating water flow in conveyance structures such as canals or dams in this study hydraulic properties of flow over broad crested weirs including the effects of different sloping crests and upstream and downstream ramps were characterized by using the finite volume method numerical simulations were validated by experimental results the numerical simulations are very similar to the experimental results the discharge coefficient cd for the broad crested weir with upstream and downstream ramps and positive slope of crest bcw udr psc and the broad crested weir with upstream and downstream ramps and negative slope of crest bcw udr nsc are higher than the broad crested weir with upstream and downstream ramps and horizontal crest bcw udr hc it was found that for both the bcw udr nsc and the bcw udr psc the cd increases with steeper weir crest slope this shows that the cd is affected by the slope of the crest such that the negative sloped crest more significantly increases the cd than a positive slope the average increase in value of the cd for the bcw udr nsc with respect the bcw udr psc is approximately 8 keywords

the speed of water flow is called a weir weirs of different cross section shapes have been widely used as flow measuring devices kabiri samani and bagheri 2014 they are usually categorized as being either sharp or broad crested and as normal or side weirs zahiri et al 2013 broad crested weirs are simple flow control structures and are commonly used in open channels weirs are also used to measure flow rate according to ratio of the water head above the weir to the length of the weir crest h l r weirs of finite crest length are categorized into 4 groups govinda rao and muralidhar 1963 hager and schwalt 1994 and azimi and rajaratnam 2013 these groups are long crested weirs 0 0 h l r 0 1 broad crested weirs 0 1 h l r 0 4 short crested weirs 0 4 h l r 2 and sharp crested weirs h l r 2 the geometry of these type weirs can influence the flow conditions and capacity broad crested weirs have attracted the attention of many investigators some authors found that the trapezoidal weirs are advantageous over standard broad crested weirs because of the upstream face slope they have a higher discharge coefficient sargison and percy 2009 and the deposition of upstream sediments and debris is low furthermore a sloping downstream face eliminates cavitation at high flow rates inozemtsev 1969 and improves the sensitivity to the downstream submergence ratio farhoudi and shokri 2007 goodarzi et al 2012 investigated the characteristics of flow over a broad crested weir with different upstream slopes the results showed that reducing the upstream slope increases the discharge coefficient and reduces the flow separation zone fritz and hager 1998 conducted a series of experiments on trapezoidal shaped weirs with different crest lengths and with upstream and downstream slopes of 1 v 2h vertical horizontal they revealed that the discharge coefficient for a broad crested weir is nearly 10 less than its corresponding value over an embankment shaped weir sargison and percy 2009 investigated the flow of water over an embankment weir with changing upstream and downstream slopes results revealed that decreasing the upstream ramp slope increases the height of the water surface profile and the static pressure over the weir crest it was also found that varying the downstream ramp slope has little effect on the discharge coefficients hydraulic properties of flow through trapezoidal broad crested weirs were investigated experimentally by madadi et al 2014 the results revealed that decreasing the slope of the upstream face reduced the size of the flow separation zone and increased the discharge coefficients azimi et al 2013 performed laboratory investigations on different broad crested weir geometries the results showed that the discharge coefficient for broad crested weirs with upstream and downstream ramps is greater than the discharge coefficient of weirs without ramps the discharge coefficients for combined broad crested weir box culvert structures were studied by guven et al 2013 the results indicated that combination of a broad crested weir and a box type culvert structure improved the discharge capacity compared to single structures culvert and weir daneshfaraz et al 2019 investigated the flow over a broad crest weir with and without an opening in the body of the weir with different slopes using flow 3d software the results indicated that the opening in the body of the weir leads into an increase in discharge coefficient and a decrease in the upstream water surface level shaymaa et al 2017a investigated the adequacy of the turbulence models to simulate water surface profiles for rectangular and stepped broad crested weirs they found that the k ε turbulence model gives highest accuracy among all of the tested turbulence models the k ε turbulence model is one of the two equation turbulence models that accounts for turbulent motion through transport equations for turbulent kinetic energy k and dissipation of kinetic energy of turbulence ε shaymaa et al 2017b compared the use of 2d and 3d numerical simulations for determining water surface elevation over broad crested weirs the results revealed that these two procedures provide similar accuracy tanase et al 2015 confirmed the capability of the k ε rng or re normalization group turbulence model to simulate free surface flow over a rectangular broad crested weir maghsoodi et al 2012 used the volume of fluid vof method and k ε turbulence model to simulate free surface flow over rectangular and broad crested submerged weirs with variable crest widths and upstream downstream facing slopes the results of that study indicated that good agreement exists with the experimental data a finding that has also been confirmed by joongcheol and nam 2015 reviewing the literature indicates that up to now the effect of crest slope on hydraulic performance of broad crested weirs has not been widely investigated this subject will be answered in the present study additionally hydraulic properties of flow over weirs with sloped crests positive and negative slopes and without sloped crests horizontal are investigated different configurations of positive and negative sloped weir crests are considered with upstream and downstream ramps this study was performed using ansys fluent software that uses the finite volume method fvm for solving the governing equations numerical simulations were validated by comparing experimental results and then hydraulic characteristics of this type of weir such as the water surface profile discharge coefficients and stage discharge equation investigated after validation the performances of these weirs compared with each other 2 material and methods 2 1 stage discharge equation the stage discharge equation is based on the upstream water depth over the crest for a broad crested weir it can be expressed by the following equation eq 1 1 q c d 2 g h 3 in which q is flow discharge per unit width m2 s c d is the discharge coefficient g is gravitational acceleration m s2 and h is the water depth over the crest m 2 2 dimensional analysis schematic diagrams of broad crested weirs with different configurations of upstream and or downstream ramps and crest slopes are shown in fig 1 for these weirs the stage discharge equation can be expressed by the following functional equation eq 2 2 f 1 q h l r p β 1 β 2 θ g ρ μ σ 0 here lr is the length of the weir crest m p is the height of the weir m β 1 a r c t a n p l u and β 2 a r c t a n p l d are upstream and downstream slope angles degrees respectively lu is the upstream ramp length of the weir in the horizontal direction m lm is the weir crest length in the flow direction m ld is the downstream ramp length of the weir in the horizontal direction m l l lu lm ld is the weir length in the flow direction at the flume bottom m θ a r c c o s l m l r is the slope of the weir crest degrees σ is the fluid surface tension n m ρ is the fluid density kg m3 and μ is the dynamic viscosity n s m2 three parameters q h and g in the aforementioned functional equation were introduced in the previous section based on buckingham s π theorem dimensionless parameters can be expressed as shown in eq 3 3 q 2 g h 3 f 2 σ ρ g h 2 μ ρ h 3 2 g h l r h p β 1 β 2 θ the first two non dimensional parameters define the weber number we and reynolds number re respectively consequently eq 3 can be rewritten as 4 c d q 2 g h 3 2 f 3 w e r e h l r h p β 1 β 2 θ if the effect two dimensionless parameters i e we and re is considered negligible the functional equation in eq 4 can be altered to form eq 5 sargison 1972 ranga raju and asawa 1977 de martino and ragone 1984 5 c d q 2 g h 3 2 f 4 h l r h p β 1 β 2 θ 2 3 numerical simulation using the finite volume method fvm a common method for investigating flow from weirs is to construct a small scale physical model an alternative approach is to utilize numerical simulation the use of computer models for flow investigation in hydraulic structures has become widespread with the development of numerical methods and the relentless increase of computational power the governing equations and details of the boundary conditions and computational mesh will be provided in the following sections 2 3 1 governing equations flow over hydraulic structures such as spillways and weirs can be described using the incompressible continuity equation eq 6 along with the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations expressed in tensor form eq 7 6 x i u i 0 7 ρ u i t u j u i x j f i p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j in these equations u i and u j are average velocity components in the tensor directions i and j xi and xj are cartesian coordinate axes f i is the body force p is the pressure ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress term which is evaluated with a turbulence model jiang et al 2018 in this study the two equation turbulence models k ε k ε standard k ε rng or re normalization group and k ε realizable and k ω k ω standard and k ω sst or shear stress transport are used 2 3 2 free surface determination the present study uses a powerful computational tool the vof technique to simulate the free surface in this method a volume fraction α is used it takes on values that range from zero to one 0 α 1 when α 1 it represents a cell that is water filled while α 0 indicates the cell that is air filled the water free surface can be identified by cells with α 1 hirt and nichols 1981 referring to toro et al 2017 and bayon et al 2016 α 0 5 is normally considered to be the free surface and the same approach is used in the present study the value of volume fraction α can be calculated using eq 8 8 t α u i x i α u j x j α 0 representative results from the vof method are displayed in fig 2 2 3 3 numerical schemes and time step size in this study the body force weighted bfw method is used to solve the pressure equations and the second order upwind sou interpolation method is used for the other transported variables momentum volume fraction turbulence kinetic energy k and turbulence dissipation rate ε in addition pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso was used for pressure velocity coupling in order to improve numerical solution stability the time step was set to be 0 001 s and the simulation continued until a steady state was achieved 2 3 4 boundary conditions to achieve accurate results the boundary conditions bcs must be carefully set to reflect the physical situation being modeled fig 3 illustrates the location of the bcs in the present study their locations are boundary bottom and weir body boundary top boundary inlet and outlet the settings at these locations are no slip wall symmetry pressure inlet and pressure outlet it should be noted that the pressure inlet boundary condition was used to apply the fluid level at the input boundary the pressure outlet boundary condition enforce a pressure datum at the outlet with weak conditions zero second derivative on all other transported variables the outlet is also located sufficiently far away to ensure its position does not affect the results no slip wall conditions and symmetry were used at solid wall interfaces and the upper boundary respectively 2 3 5 mesh generation and turbulence model layout mesh generation was accomplished with quadrilateral and triangular shaped elements next mesh independence tests and turbulence model verification were implemented the mesh independence study was performed with increasingly refined meshes to demonstrate that the results were independent of the mesh during the mesh independence test a comparison of the numerically simulated water surface profile and the experimental observations were made the favorable agreement between the numerical and experimental outcomes gives further credibility to the calculations as already mentioned a number of turbulence models were considered k ε standard k ε rng k ε realizable k ω standard and k ω sst these turbulence models utilize reynolds averaging of the navier stokes equations rans to close the turbulence equations in fig 4 results from various turbulence models are displayed there is very little difference amongst the model results the results revealed that the differences between the water surface profiles obtained from the numerical simulation and experimental results of azimi et al 2014 is almost constant when the k ε rng turbulence model was used and the number of elements were 28600 the elements were of size 1 cm 2 therefore in this study the k ε rng turbulence model and element dimensions of 1 cm 1 cm were used the results that will be presented correspond to the k ε rng turbulence model and these aforementioned element sizes fig 5 illustrates the mesh for the bcw and bcw udr hc weirs 1v 2h and 1v 0 5h for upstream and downstream ramps respectively and vice versa the total number of elements and nodes are 23 678 and 24058 respectively simulation process are revealed in fig 6 the simulation process comprises of the following steps construction of the geometric model mesh generation selection of turbulence model designation of boundary conditions and initialization of the solution selection of solver type definition of multiphase model and material properties selection of the solution algorithm and visualization and interpretation of the results if there is good accordance between numerical simulations with experimental or observed results then the results of the numerical simulation are generally accepted 2 3 6 numerical simulation the solution domain has a length height and width of 5 0 m 0 5 m and 1 m respectively the weir crest was placed about 2 5 m from the entry of the flume for all simulations in table 1 the types and schemes of numerical simulation are listed it should be noted that the weir height p was constant in all models and equal to 20 cm to investigate the effect of both upstream and downstream ramp slopes and the crest slope for broad crested weirs 164 models were constructed table 1 2 3 7 criteria performance assessment in order to compare estimated values with their corresponding simulated values the following metrics are used determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and the percent of relative error re these metrics are defined in eqs 9 11 9 r 2 i 1 n o i o e i e 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i

observed values e is the average of estimated values and n is represents the size of the data set 3 results and discussion 3 1 broad crested weirs with upstream or downstream ramps fig 7 illustrates the results from the numerical simulations the water surface profile the velocity contour and the velocity vectors surrounding the bcw ur hc and the bcw dr hc for h lr 0 375 and h p 0 750 with β 1 β 2 45 90 and β 1 β 2 90 45 are shown in figs 7 a and b as can be seen in fig 7 a for the bcw ur hc flow downstream of the edge of the crest forms a jet that reaches the bottom and the canal this promotes a two phase flow of an air water mixture this flow situation is more noticeable for large head values the bcw dr hc jet moves past the crest and the downstream ramp until it reaches the bottom of the canal the downstream ramp reduces much of the two phase flow and water surface fluctuations in the canal fig 7b in addition it can be seen that the velocity gradually increases as the flow passes from the upstream to the downstream and reaches a maximum value at the end of the canal a comparison of velocity contours for the bcw ur hc and the bcw dr hc cases indicates that the velocity magnitude is 0 to 2 5 m sec and the maximum velocities occur at the canal bottom downstream of the weir there is also an apparent flow separation zone at the entry of the bcw dr hc similar to the bcw the flow separation zone influences the cd in the bcw ur hc as β 1 decreases the magnitudes of the flow separation zone decreases it should be noted that with the aforementioned conditions the flow discharge rate per unit width q critical depth yc and the location of the critical control section xc for the bcw ur hc are 0 0983 m2 s 0 099 m and 0 19 m respectively the corresponding values for the bcw dr hc are 0 0890 m2 s 0 093 m and 0 133 m respectively fig 8 a and b shows the variations of cd for the bcw ur hc and the bcw dr hc with respect to h lr with 0 30 h p 0 75 the results show that for β 1 75 96 the bcw ur hc behaves similar to the bcw in addition the cd values for the bcw dr hc are very close to values of cd for the bcw in another words the downstream ramp has less effect on the discharge coefficient in addition as fig 8 a shows for a flow discharge the cd increases as β 1 decreases therefore a sloping upstream side of broad crested weirs bcw has a positive and important effect on flow discharge capacity the comparison of flow discharge and head for both the bcw ur hc and the bcr dr hc with the bcw are revealed in fig 9 a and b respectively as seen there with increasing flow depth the discharge rate increases by comparison the results for these weirs show that the flow discharge rates for the bcw dr hc and the bcw are very similar to one another that is varying the downstream ramp slope does not have an important influence on the flow discharge rate over the weir the increase of cd for the bcw ur hc and the bcw dr hc with respect to the bcw are presented in table 2 as shown with the bcw ur hc for 45 β 1 90 the increase in cd is less than that for β 1 45 this means that β 1 45 has less influence on the cd because the flow separation zone is still extant at the entry of the bcw ur hc which has a negative effect on the cd another reason is that the streamlines for β 1 45 are less parallel than for β 1 45 the parallel streamline trajectories reflect a lesser energy loss within the fluid as shown in table 2 it was found that the cd for the bcw dr hc is approximately 0 1 to 4 larger than for the bcw depending on parameters values of h lr and β 2 based on data obtained from the numerical simulations for the bcw ur hc and the bcw dr hc a cd equation is suggested by eq 5 with negligible parameters β 2 and θ for the bcw ur hc and β 1 and θ for the bcw dr hc the proposed equations for estimating the cd are described in eqs 12 and 13 table 3 these equations are consistent for broad crested weirs within the range 0 1 h lr 0 4 the results were evaluated using statistical criteria r2 rmse and re the values of r2 rmse and re for the bcw ur hc are 0 931 0 005 and 1 23 respectively for the bcw dr hc the metrics are 0 935 0 004 and 0 93 respectively in addition to statistical criteria scatter plots of proposed equations versus data obtained from numerical simulations are shown in fig 10 a and b the results show that the data is distributed near the bisector line y x therefore these equations have high accuracy for estimating values the cd in table 4 the cd values for the bcw ur hc that were obtained using eq 12 are compared with values from previous studies such as sargison and percy 2009 azimi et al 2013 and aysegul and mustafa 2016 all values of the cd are in the range 0 3 to 0 4 in the current study which is consistent with the range reported by sargison and percy 2009 as it can be seen both the proposed equations by azimi et al 2013 and aysegul and mustafa 2016 estimate the cd values higher than from the eq 12 obtained from the results of fvm and from sargison and percy s 2009 study 3 2 broad crested weirs with both upstream and downstream ramps and a horizontal crest the water surface profiles for the bcw udr hc were simulated for all configurations of upstream and downstream ramps and for all head levels illustrations of the water surface profiles and discharge coefficients for three states β 1 β 2 β 1 β 2 and β 1 β 2 for h lr 0 375 and 0 15 are shown in fig 11 the results indicate that for the bcw udr hc reduction of the upstream ramp slope causes a decrease in the curvature of water surface at the inlet of the weir crest and the water streamlines are horizontal over the weir crest the bcw udr hc with β 1 26 56 has a flatter curvature of the water surface compared to the bcw udr hc with β 1 45 as shown in fig 12 for the bcw udr hc the cd increases as h lr increases in addition for the cases β 1 75 96 63 43 45 a n d 26 56 a sloping downstream side of a broad crested weir does not have a noticeable effect on the cd based on the numerical simulations for the bcw udr hc a discharge coefficient equation is proposed for the bcw udr hc as eq 14 table 5 equation 14 is reliable for the range of 0 1 h lr 0 4 the values of the r2 rmse and re were 0 903 0 006 and 2 respectively these results are satisfactory and indicate the reliability of the proposed equations the scatter plot of the data related to the proposed equation is also shown in fig 13 3 3 broad crested weirs with upstream or downstream ramps and positive and negative crest slopes illustrations of the water surface profiles and discharge coefficients for the bcw udr psc and the bcw udr nsc with β 1 β 2 26 56 1 v 2h and θ 9 46 1 v 6h and θ 4 76 1 v 12h are shown in fig 14 that for bcw udr nsc the change to the water surface level on the crest is negligible on the other hand for the bcw udr psc variation of water surface level is considerable as shown in fig 14 for β 1 β 2 26 56 1 v 2h the cd for the bcw udr nsc is approximately 4 and 7 5 larger than the bcw udr psc for θ 9 46 1 v 6h and θ 4 76 1 v 12h cases respectively overall it can be seen that a negative crest slope increases the cd the reason for this increase is related to the flow convergence at the crest of weir fig 15 illustrates the variation of cd with h lr for the bcw udr psc and the bcw udr nsc for 0 1 h lr 0 4 respectively it can be seen from fig 15 for the bcw udr psc the value of the cd is between 0 35 and 0 47 while for the bcw udr nsc value of the cd is between 0 42 and 0 48 the relationship between flow discharge and head for the bcw udr psc is shown in fig 16 according to the figure by increasing the flow depth the flow discharge rate increases and this increase is greater for crests with a steeper slope 3 4 comparison of all of weirs in the current study a comparison of results for the broad crested weirs is shown in fig 17 the cd for the bcw ur hc and bcw udr hc weirs are very similar and the bcw udr hc has a slightly higher value of the cd this shows that the downstream ramp has less of an effect on the cd in fact unlike the bcw ur hc and bcw udr hc the bcw dr hc has a lower cd because a flow separation zone still exists at the entry of this weir in addition variation of the cd with h lr for the three broad crested weirs bcw udr hc bcw udr psc and bcw udr nsc are shown in fig 18 as shown from fig 18 the cd for the bcw ur psc and bcw udr nsc is higher than for the bcw udr hc this shows that the cd is affected by the slope of the crest in such a way that negative slopes have more influence than positive slopes the scatter plot of the cd for the bcw udr nsc and the bcw udr psc is shown in fig 19 all of the data are under the line 45 indicating that the cd for the bcw udr nsc is greater than that of the cd for the bcw udr psc this is probably related to the flow convergence caused by the rising crest and the reduction of hydrostatic pressure in the crest of these type weirs the minimum maximum and average increase of the cd for the bcw udr nsc with respect to the bcw udr psc are 2 15 and 8 also the average increase of cd for the bcw udr nsc compared to the bcw udr hc with θ 4 76 a n d 9 46 is 18 and 25 while the average increase of cd for the bcw udr psc with respect to the bcw udr hc under the same conditions θ 4 76 a n d 9 46 is 10 and 18 comparison of the results of these weirs are displayed in table 6 4 conclusions in this study hydraulic characteristics for flow over six types of broad crested weirs with upstream or and downstream ramps and with without positive and negative crest slopes were investigated several turbulence models were employed for handling turbulence and the vof method was used to track the liquid gas interface the results can be summarized as follows 1 numerical simulations were validated by existing experimental results the k ε rng turbulence model was most accurate amongst the various turbulent models 2 the most obvious finding to emerge from this study is that the discharge coefficient cd is increased by a sloping of the crest and a negative slope has a more significant impact than a positive slope 3 applying positive and negative slopes for the weir crest changed cd in such a way that for bcw udr psc value of the cd is in range 0 35 c d 0 47 and for the bcw udr nsc value of the cd is in range 0 42 c d 0 48 4 for both the bcw udr nsc and bcw udr psc the cd increases with an increasing slope of crest or increasing θ 5 the cd for bcw udr psc and bcw udr nsc are greater than for bcw udr hc 6 the average increase of the cd in the bcw udr nsc with respect to the bcw udr psc is about 8 this study considers unsubmerged or free flows and broad crested weirs with 0 1 h lr 0 4 hydraulic characteristics of flow with other weir types such as long crested weirs and short crested weirs can be the subject of future students declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
4017,weirs are commonly used for controlling measuring and regulating water flow in conveyance structures such as canals or dams in this study hydraulic properties of flow over broad crested weirs

the numerical simulations are very similar to the experimental results the discharge coefficient cd for the broad crested weir with upstream and downstream ramps and positive slope of crest bcw udr psc and the broad crested weir with upstream and downstream ramps and negative slope of crest bcw udr nsc are higher than the broad crested weir with upstream and downstream ramps and horizontal crest bcw udr hc it was found that for both the bcw udr nsc and the bcw udr psc the cd increases with steeper weir crest slope this shows that the cd is affected by the slope of the crest such that the negative sloped crest more significantly increases the cd than a positive slope the average increase in value of the cd for the bcw udr nsc with respect the bcw udr psc is approximately 8 keywords

the speed of water flow is called a weir weirs of different cross section shapes have been widely used as flow measuring devices kabiri samani and bagheri 2014 they are usually categorized as being either sharp or broad crested and as normal or side weirs zahiri et al 2013 broad crested weirs are simple flow control structures and are commonly used in open channels weirs are also used to measure flow rate according to ratio of the water head above the weir to the length of the weir crest h l r weirs of finite crest length are categorized into 4 groups govinda rao and muralidhar 1963 hager and schwalt 1994 and azimi and rajaratnam 2013 these groups are long crested weirs 0 0 h l r 0 1 broad crested weirs 0 1 h l r 0 4 short crested weirs 0 4 h l r 2 and sharp crested weirs h l r 2 the geometry of these type weirs can influence the flow conditions and capacity broad crested weirs have attracted the attention of many investigators some authors found that the trapezoidal weirs are advantageous over standard broad crested weirs because of the upstream face slope they have a higher discharge coefficient sargison and percy 2009 and the deposition of upstream sediments and debris is low furthermore a sloping downstream face eliminates cavitation at high flow rates inozemtsev 1969 and improves the sensitivity to the downstream submergence ratio farhoudi and shokri 2007 goodarzi et al 2012 investigated the characteristics of flow over a broad crested weir with different upstream slopes the results showed that reducing the upstream slope increases the discharge coefficient and reduces the flow separation zone fritz and hager 1998 conducted a series of experiments on trapezoidal shaped weirs with different crest lengths and with upstream and downstream slopes of 1 v 2h vertical horizontal they revealed that the discharge coefficient for a broad crested weir is nearly 10 less than its corresponding value over an embankment shaped weir sargison and percy 2009 investigated the flow of water over an embankment weir with changing upstream and downstream slopes results revealed that decreasing the upstream ramp slope increases the height of the water surface profile and the static pressure over the weir crest it was also found that varying the downstream ramp slope has little effect on the discharge coefficients hydraulic properties of flow through trapezoidal broad crested weirs were investigated experimentally by madadi et al 2014 the results revealed that decreasing the slope of the upstream face reduced the size of the flow separation zone and increased the discharge coefficients azimi et al 2013 performed laboratory investigations on different broad crested weir geometries the results showed that the discharge coefficient for broad crested weirs with upstream and downstream ramps is greater than the discharge coefficient of weirs without ramps the discharge coefficients for combined broad crested weir box culvert structures were studied by guven et al 2013 the results indicated that combination of a broad crested weir and a box type culvert structure improved the discharge capacity compared to single structures culvert and weir daneshfaraz et al 2019 investigated the flow over a broad crest weir with and without an opening in the body of the weir with different slopes using flow 3d software the results indicated that the opening in the body of the weir leads into an increase in discharge coefficient and a decrease in the upstream water surface level shaymaa et al 2017a investigated the adequacy of the turbulence models to simulate water surface profiles for rectangular and stepped broad crested weirs they found that the k ε turbulence model gives highest accuracy among all of the tested turbulence models the k ε turbulence model is one of the two equation turbulence models that accounts for turbulent motion through transport equations for turbulent kinetic energy k and dissipation of kinetic energy of turbulence ε shaymaa et al 2017b compared the use of 2d and 3d numerical simulations for determining water surface elevation over broad crested weirs the results revealed that these two procedures provide similar accuracy tanase et al 2015 confirmed the capability of the k ε rng or re normalization group turbulence model to simulate free surface flow over a rectangular broad crested weir maghsoodi et al 2012 used the volume of fluid vof method and k ε turbulence model to simulate free surface flow over rectangular and broad crested submerged weirs with variable crest widths and upstream downstream facing slopes the results of that study indicated that good agreement exists with the experimental data a finding that has also been confirmed by joongcheol and nam 2015 reviewing the literature indicates that up to now the effect of crest slope on hydraulic performance of broad crested weirs has not been widely investigated this subject will be answered in the present study additionally hydraulic properties of flow over weirs with sloped crests positive and negative slopes and without sloped crests horizontal are investigated different configurations of positive and negative sloped weir crests are considered with upstream and downstream ramps this study was performed using ansys fluent software that uses the finite volume method fvm for solving the governing equations numerical simulations were validated by comparing experimental results and then hydraulic characteristics of this type of weir such as the water surface profile discharge coefficients and stage discharge equation investigated after validation the performances of these weirs compared with each other 2 material and methods 2 1 stage discharge equation the stage discharge equation is based on the upstream water depth over the crest for a broad crested weir it can be expressed by the following equation eq 1 1 q c d 2 g h 3 in which q is flow discharge per unit width m2 s c d is the discharge coefficient g is gravitational acceleration m s2 and h is the water depth over the crest m 2 2 dimensional analysis schematic diagrams of broad crested weirs with different configurations of upstream and or downstream ramps and crest slopes are shown in fig 1 for these weirs the stage discharge equation can be expressed by the following functional equation eq 2 2 f 1 q h l r p β 1 β 2 θ g ρ μ σ 0 here lr is the length of the weir crest m p is the height of the weir m β 1 a r c t a n p l u and β 2 a r c t a n p l d are upstream and downstream slope angles degrees respectively lu is the upstream ramp length of the weir in the horizontal direction m lm is the weir crest length in the flow direction m ld is the downstream ramp length of the weir in the horizontal direction m l l lu lm ld is the weir length in the flow direction at the flume bottom m θ a r c c o s l m l r is the slope of the weir crest degrees σ is the fluid surface tension n m ρ is the fluid density kg m3 and μ is the dynamic viscosity n s m2 three parameters q h and g in the aforementioned functional equation were introduced in the previous section based on buckingham s π theorem dimensionless parameters can be expressed as shown in eq 3 3 q 2 g h 3 f 2 σ ρ g h 2 μ ρ h 3 2 g h l r h p β 1 β 2 θ the first two non dimensional parameters define the weber number we and reynolds number re respectively consequently eq 3 can be rewritten as 4 c d q 2 g h 3 2 f 3 w e r e h l r h p β 1 β 2 θ if the effect two dimensionless parameters i e we and re is considered negligible the functional equation in eq 4 can be altered to form eq 5 sargison 1972 ranga raju and asawa 1977 de martino and ragone 1984 5 c d q 2 g h 3 2 f 4 h l r h p β 1 β 2 θ 2 3 numerical simulation using the finite volume method fvm a common method for investigating flow from weirs is to construct a small scale physical model an alternative approach is to utilize numerical simulation the use of computer models for flow investigation in hydraulic structures has become widespread with the development of numerical methods and the relentless increase of computational power the governing equations and details of the boundary conditions and computational mesh will be provided in the following sections 2 3 1 governing equations flow over hydraulic structures such as spillways and weirs can be described using the incompressible continuity equation eq 6 along with the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations expressed in tensor form eq 7 6 x i u i 0 7 ρ u i t u j u i x j f i p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j in these equations u i and u j are average velocity components in the tensor directions i and j xi and xj are cartesian coordinate axes f i is the body force p is the pressure ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress term which is evaluated with a turbulence model jiang et al 2018 in this study the two equation turbulence models k ε k ε standard k ε rng or re normalization group and k ε realizable and k ω k ω standard and k ω sst or shear stress transport are used 2 3 2 free surface determination the present study uses a powerful computational tool the vof technique to simulate the free surface in this method a volume fraction α is used it takes on values that range from zero to one 0 α 1 when α 1 it represents a cell that is water filled while α 0 indicates the cell that is air filled the water free surface can be identified by cells with α 1 hirt and nichols 1981 referring to toro et al 2017 and bayon et al 2016 α 0 5 is normally considered to be the free surface and the same approach is used in the present study the value of volume fraction α can be calculated using eq 8 8 t α u i x i α u j x j α 0 representative results from the vof method are displayed in fig 2 2 3 3 numerical schemes and time step size in this study the body force weighted bfw method is used to solve the pressure equations and the second order upwind sou interpolation method is used for the other transported variables momentum volume fraction turbulence kinetic energy k and turbulence dissipation rate ε in addition pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso was used for pressure velocity coupling in order to improve numerical solution stability the time step was set to be 0 001 s and the simulation continued until a steady state was achieved 2 3 4 boundary conditions to achieve accurate results the boundary conditions bcs must be carefully set to reflect the physical situation being modeled fig 3 illustrates the location of the bcs in the present study their locations are boundary bottom and weir body boundary top boundary inlet and outlet the settings at these locations are no slip wall symmetry pressure inlet and pressure outlet it should be noted that the pressure inlet boundary condition was used to apply the fluid level at the input boundary the pressure outlet boundary condition enforce a pressure datum at the outlet with weak conditions zero second derivative on all other transported variables the outlet is also located sufficiently far away to ensure its position does not affect the results no slip wall conditions and symmetry were used at solid wall interfaces and the upper boundary respectively 2 3 5 mesh generation and turbulence model layout mesh generation was accomplished with quadrilateral and triangular shaped elements next mesh independence tests and turbulence model verification were implemented the mesh independence study was performed with increasingly refined meshes to demonstrate that the results were independent of the mesh during the mesh independence test a comparison of the numerically simulated water surface profile and the experimental observations were made the favorable agreement between the numerical and experimental outcomes gives further credibility to the calculations as already mentioned a number of turbulence models were considered k ε standard k ε rng k ε realizable k ω standard and k ω sst these turbulence models utilize reynolds averaging of the navier stokes equations rans to close the turbulence equations in fig 4 results from various turbulence models are displayed there is very little difference amongst the model results the results revealed that the differences between the water surface profiles obtained from the numerical simulation and experimental results of azimi et al 2014 is almost constant when the k ε rng turbulence model was used and the number of elements were 28600 the elements were of size 1 cm 2 therefore in this study the k ε rng turbulence model and element dimensions of 1 cm 1 cm were used the results that will be presented correspond to the k ε rng turbulence model and these aforementioned element sizes fig 5 illustrates the mesh for the bcw and bcw udr hc weirs 1v 2h and 1v 0 5h for upstream and downstream ramps respectively and vice versa the total number of elements and nodes are 23 678 and 24058 respectively simulation process are revealed in fig 6 the simulation process comprises of the following steps construction of the geometric model mesh generation selection of turbulence model designation of boundary conditions and initialization of the solution selection of solver type definition of multiphase model and material properties selection of the solution algorithm and visualization and interpretation of the results if there is good accordance between numerical simulations with experimental or observed results then the results of the numerical simulation are generally accepted 2 3 6 numerical simulation the solution domain has a length height and width of 5 0 m 0 5 m and 1 m respectively the weir crest was placed about 2 5 m from the entry of the flume for all simulations in table 1 the types and schemes of numerical simulation are listed it should be noted that the weir height p was constant in all models and equal to 20 cm to investigate the effect of both upstream and downstream ramp slopes and the crest slope for broad crested weirs 164 models were constructed table 1 2 3 7 criteria performance assessment in order to compare estimated values with their corresponding simulated values the following metrics are used determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and the percent of relative error re these metrics are defined in eqs 9 11 9 r 2 i 1 n o i o e i e 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i

the results from the numerical simulations the water surface profile the velocity contour and the velocity vectors surrounding the bcw ur hc and the bcw dr hc for h lr 0 375 and h p 0 750 with β 1 β 2 45 90 and β 1 β 2 90 45 are shown in figs 7 a and b as can be seen in fig 7 a for the bcw ur hc flow downstream of the edge of the crest forms a jet that reaches the bottom and the canal this promotes a two phase flow of an air water mixture this flow situation is more noticeable for large head values the bcw dr hc jet moves past the crest and the downstream ramp until it reaches the bottom of the canal the downstream ramp reduces much of the two phase flow and water surface fluctuations in the canal fig 7b in addition it can be seen that the velocity gradually increases as the flow passes from the upstream to the downstream and reaches a maximum value at the end of the canal a comparison of velocity contours for the bcw ur hc and the bcw dr hc cases indicates that the velocity magnitude is 0 to 2 5 m sec and the maximum velocities occur at the canal bottom downstream of the weir there is also an apparent flow separation zone at the entry of the bcw dr hc similar to the bcw the flow separation zone influences the cd in the bcw ur hc as β 1 decreases the magnitudes of the flow separation zone decreases it should be noted that with the aforementioned conditions the flow discharge rate per unit width q critical depth yc and the location of the critical control section xc for the bcw ur hc are 0 0983 m2 s 0 099 m and 0 19 m respectively the corresponding values for the bcw dr hc are 0 0890 m2 s 0 093 m and 0 133 m respectively fig 8 a and b shows the variations of cd for the bcw ur hc and the bcw dr hc with respect to h lr with 0 30 h p 0 75 the results show that for β 1 75 96 the bcw ur hc behaves similar to the bcw in addition the cd values for the bcw dr hc are very close to values of cd for the bcw in another words the downstream ramp has less effect on the discharge coefficient in addition as fig 8 a shows for a flow discharge the cd increases as β 1 decreases therefore a sloping upstream side of broad crested weirs bcw has a positive and important effect on flow discharge capacity the comparison of flow discharge and head for both the bcw ur hc and the bcr dr hc with the bcw are revealed in fig 9 a and b respectively as seen there with increasing flow depth the discharge rate increases by comparison the results for these weirs show that the flow discharge rates for the bcw dr hc and the bcw are very similar to one another that is varying the downstream ramp slope does not have an important influence on the flow discharge rate over the weir the increase of cd for the bcw ur hc and the bcw dr hc with respect to the bcw are presented in table 2 as shown with the bcw ur hc for 45 β 1 90 the increase in cd is less than that for β 1 45 this means that β 1 45 has less influence on the cd because the flow separation zone is still extant at the entry of the bcw ur hc which has a negative effect on the cd another reason is that the streamlines for β 1 45 are less parallel than for β 1 45 the parallel streamline trajectories reflect a lesser energy loss within the fluid as shown in table 2 it was found that the cd for the bcw dr hc is approximately 0 1 to 4 larger than for the bcw depending on parameters values of h lr and β 2 based on data obtained from the numerical simulations for the bcw ur hc and the bcw dr hc a cd equation is suggested by eq 5 with negligible parameters β 2 and θ for the bcw ur hc and β 1 and θ for the bcw dr hc the proposed equations for estimating the cd are described in eqs 12 and 13 table 3 these equations are consistent for broad crested weirs within the range 0 1 h lr 0 4 the results were evaluated using statistical criteria r2 rmse and re the values of r2 rmse and re for the bcw ur hc are 0 931 0 005 and 1 23 respectively for the bcw dr hc the metrics are 0 935 0 004 and 0 93 respectively in addition to statistical criteria scatter plots of proposed equations versus data obtained from numerical simulations are shown in fig 10 a and b the results show that the data is distributed near the bisector line y x therefore these equations have high accuracy for estimating values the cd in table 4 the cd values for the bcw ur hc that were obtained using eq 12 are compared with values from previous studies such as sargison and percy 2009 azimi et al 2013 and aysegul and mustafa 2016 all values of the cd are in the range 0 3 to 0 4 in the current study which is consistent with the range reported by sargison and percy 2009 as it can be seen both the proposed equations by azimi et al 2013 and aysegul and mustafa 2016 estimate the cd values higher than from the eq 12 obtained from the results of fvm and from sargison and percy s 2009 study 3 2 broad crested weirs with both upstream and downstream ramps and a horizontal crest the water surface profiles for the bcw udr hc were simulated for all configurations of upstream and downstream ramps and for all head levels illustrations of the water surface profiles and discharge coefficients for three states β 1 β 2 β 1 β 2 and β 1 β 2 for h lr 0 375 and 0 15 are shown in fig 11 the results indicate that for the bcw udr hc reduction of the upstream ramp slope causes a decrease in the curvature of water surface at the inlet of the weir crest and the water streamlines are horizontal over the weir crest the bcw udr hc with β 1 26 56 has a flatter curvature of the water surface compared to the bcw udr hc with β 1 45 as shown in fig 12 for the bcw udr hc the cd increases as h lr increases in addition for the cases β 1 75 96 63 43 45 a n d 26 56 a sloping downstream side of a broad crested weir does not have a noticeable effect on the cd based on the numerical simulations for the bcw udr hc a discharge coefficient equation is proposed for the bcw udr hc as eq 14 table 5 equation 14 is reliable for the range of 0 1 h lr 0 4 the values of the r2 rmse and re were 0 903 0 006 and 2 respectively these results are satisfactory and indicate the reliability of the proposed equations the scatter plot of the data related to the proposed equation is also shown in fig 13 3 3 broad crested weirs with upstream or downstream ramps and positive and negative crest slopes illustrations of the water surface profiles and discharge coefficients for the bcw udr psc and the bcw udr nsc with β 1 β 2 26 56 1 v 2h and θ 9 46 1 v 6h and θ 4 76 1 v 12h are shown in fig 14 that for bcw udr nsc the change to the water surface level on the crest is negligible on the other hand for the bcw udr psc variation of water surface level is considerable as shown in fig 14 for β 1 β 2 26 56 1 v 2h the cd for the bcw udr nsc is approximately 4 and 7 5 larger than the bcw udr psc for θ 9 46 1 v 6h and θ 4 76 1 v 12h cases respectively overall it can be seen that a negative crest slope increases the cd the reason for this increase is related to the flow convergence at the crest of weir fig 15 illustrates the variation of cd with h lr for the bcw udr psc and the bcw udr nsc for 0 1 h lr 0 4 respectively it can be seen from fig 15 for the bcw udr psc the value of the cd is between 0 35 and 0 47 while for the bcw udr nsc value of the cd is between 0 42 and 0 48 the relationship between flow discharge and head for the bcw udr psc is shown in fig 16 according to the figure by increasing the flow depth the flow discharge rate increases and this increase is greater for crests with a steeper slope 3 4 comparison of all of weirs in the current study a comparison of results for the broad crested weirs is shown in fig 17 the cd for the bcw ur hc and bcw udr hc weirs are very similar and the bcw udr hc has a slightly higher value of the cd this shows that the downstream ramp has less of an effect on the cd in fact unlike the bcw ur hc and bcw udr hc the bcw dr hc has a lower cd because a flow separation zone still exists at the entry of this weir in addition variation of the cd with h lr for the three broad crested weirs bcw udr hc bcw udr psc and bcw udr nsc are shown in fig 18 as shown from fig 18 the cd for the bcw ur psc and bcw udr nsc is higher than for the bcw udr hc this shows that the cd is affected by the slope of the crest in such a way that negative slopes have more influence than positive slopes the scatter plot of the cd for the bcw udr nsc and the bcw udr psc is shown in fig 19 all of the data are under the line 45 indicating that the cd for the bcw udr nsc is greater than that of the cd for the bcw udr psc this is probably related to the flow convergence caused by the rising crest and the reduction of hydrostatic pressure in the crest of these type weirs the minimum maximum and average increase of the cd for the bcw udr nsc with respect to the bcw udr psc are 2 15 and 8 also the average increase of cd for the bcw udr nsc compared to the bcw udr hc with θ 4 76 a n d 9 46 is 18 and 25 while the average increase of cd for the bcw udr psc with respect to the bcw udr hc under the same conditions θ 4 76 a n d 9 46 is 10 and 18 comparison of the results of these weirs are displayed in table 6 4 conclusions in this study hydraulic characteristics for flow over six types of broad crested weirs with upstream or and downstream ramps and with without positive and negative crest slopes were investigated several turbulence models were employed for handling turbulence and the vof method was used to track the liquid gas interface the results can be summarized as follows 1 numerical simulations were validated by existing experimental results the k ε rng turbulence model was most accurate amongst the various turbulent models 2 the most obvious finding to emerge from this study is that the discharge coefficient cd is increased by a sloping of the crest and a negative slope has a more significant impact than a positive slope 3 applying positive and negative slopes for the weir crest changed cd in such a way that for bcw udr psc value of the cd is in range 0 35 c d 0 47 and for the bcw udr nsc value of the cd is in range 0 42 c d 0 48 4 for both the bcw udr nsc and bcw udr psc the cd increases with an increasing slope of crest or increasing θ 5 the cd for bcw udr psc and bcw udr nsc are greater than for bcw udr hc 6 the average increase of the cd in the bcw udr nsc with respect to the bcw udr psc is about 8 this study considers unsubmerged or free flows and broad crested weirs with 0 1 h lr 0 4 hydraulic characteristics of flow with other weir types such as long crested weirs and short crested weirs can be the subject of future students declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
4018,the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation are widely used to track processes occurring within the hydrological cycle and understand regional atmospheric patterns that influence a specific area moreover the oxygen isotopic composition of continental carbonates is extensively used for palaeohydrological reconstruction nevertheless few comprehensive investigations have been performed in the western mediterranean to analyze the statistical relationships between oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes in precipitation and meteorological variables for understanding the factors that regulate the rainfall stable isotopic signature at present day in this area of mediterranean region we selected the tuscany region central italy due to its considerable climatic seasonality complex morphology and orography tuscany is affected by both atlantic atmospheric disturbances from nw and moist air masses originated in the mediterranean and also by the secondary cyclogenesis center of the gulf of genoa the most active in the entire mediterranean the ideal position of the tuscany region thus offers the opportunity to investigate the complex influence of moisture sources on the rainfall isotopic composition moreover in this region many hydrogeological and palaeohydrological studies were performed and require a more precise and quantitative interpretation in this work 644 isotope monthly data δ18o δ2h and deuterium excess of precipitation collected in 12 sites through tuscany from 1971 to 2018 were gathered in a database then only sites whose monthly data covered almost one year were considered for processing resulting in 553 precipitation samples archived along with monthly mean temperature and rainfall amount in this framework the lmwl for tuscany was determined by applying different regression techniques and statistical analyses were performed to define the influence of meteorological and geographical variables on the rainfall isotopic composition the outcomes point out the variations of rainfall isotopic signature as result of several climate and geographical variables than a univocal proxy for both local temperature and precipitation amount the atlantic and mediterranean moisture sources differently contribute for generating the observed isotopic variability and their influence may seasonally change overall the temperature and amount effect allow to explain the 50 of the isotopic variability but temperature appears to be more important these local effects are more pronounced during the periods with low rainfall spring and summer whereas the large scale processes moisture origin trajectories and rainout are prevailing in winter and autumn the altitude effect is the main driver of isotopic spatial variability the deuterium excess parameter is revealed to be a very complex but useful signal for disentangling the different contribution of atlantic and mediterranean sources in tuscan precipitation even if it is sometime misused keywords precipitation stable isotopes deuterium excess amount effect moisture origin 1 introduction the stable isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation is considered a powerful tool to trace the hydrological cycle clark and fritz 1997 characterize the regional atmospheric patterns baldini et al 2008 comas bru et al 2016 understand the aquifer recharge mechanisms and groundwater dynamics and carry out hydrological balances gat et al 1996 jasechko 2019 the application of stable isotopes in the water molecule has recently increased also in ecohydrology to investigate water uptake and transpiration in both natural and agricultural vegetated systems penna et al 2020 sprenger et al 2016 likewise the oxygen isotope signature recorded in paleoclimatic archives for example in speleothems which derive their isotopic imprinting from rainwater is a well known proxy for reconstructing climatic variations in the recent past e g isola et al 2019 lachniet 2009 zanchetta et al 2007 the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are therefore able to trace hydrological processes on a different spatial and time scale roberts et al 2010 and can provide important information for investigations related to the future water cycle yoshimura 2015 hence understanding and quantifiying the factors governing isotopic variability in modern precipitation is necessary for many hydrological ecohydrological and paleohydrological investigations the isotopic rainfall composition basically depends on fractionation processes occurring during the phase transitions within the hydrological cycle which induce fractionation of hydrogen in relation to oxygen isotopes craig 1961a dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 sharp 2007 equilibrium or kinetic non equilibrium isotopic fractionation typically occurs during the evaporation and condensation processes gat 2010 responsible for the wide range of isotopic signatures recorded in precipitation the condensation process of water vapor into rain drops in the clouds is a typical example of equilibrium fractionation which implies that the isotopic ratios in each phase are constant for a specific temperature the heavier isotopologues h2 18o and h2h16o have a greater tendency to enter the liquid solid phase than the lighter one h2 16o which preferentially remains in the vapor phase conversely evaporation from the ocean surface and from the continental water basins under relative humidity rh conditions lower than 100 is an example of kinetic fractionation it depends on the different masses and diffusivity of isotopologues due to the different strength of molecular bonds pfahl and sodemann 2014 during evaporation the lighter isotopologues enter the vapor phase more easily than the heavier ones leading to a depletion in heavy isotopes 2h and 18o in the vapor that develops over the water bodies equilibrium evaporation and kinetic condensation may also occur deshpande et al 2013 jouzel and merlivat 1984 stewart 1975 as a result of isotopic fractionation the rainfall isotopic signature is affected by geographical factors e g latitude altitude distance from the coast related to the location of monitoring sites dansgaard 1964 gonfiantini et al 2001 whose effects are stable for a particular area and it is also affected by meteorological variables such as precipitation amount and surface air temperature araguás araguás et al 2000 dansgaard 1964 lechler and niemi 2011 rozanski et al 1993 zhang et al 2020 or by cloud base temperature rindsberger et al 1983 the last two factors are closely linked to climate and their effects depend on seasonal fluctuations moreover the moisture source and rainout history of air masses also have important effects on rainfall isotopic composition araguás araguás et al 2000 krklec and domínguez villar 2014 such effects are due to the different isotopic composition of the source regions to the distinct pathways and trajectories followed by atmospheric water vapor and to the differentiated moisture uptake along the trajectories over the source regions e g baldini et al 2010 bershaw et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 the deuterium excess d excess parameter first introduced by dansgaard 1964 has been widely used to characterize the origin of moisture gat and carmi 1970 jouzel et al 2013 juhlke et al 2019 d excess values are mainly governed by the non equilibrium formation process of water vapor at the air sea interface gat and carmi 1970 gat et al 2003 which is in turn controlled by the meteorological conditions at the source region such as near surface rh and sea surface temperature sst bonne et al 2019 merlivat and jouzel 1979 pfahl and sodemann 2014 however d excess of precipitation may also change in response to processes occurring during moisture transport bershaw 2018 pfahl and sodemann 2014 it decreases when secondary evaporation occurs in air masses or rainfall wang et al 2016 conversely it increases with the rise of moisture recycling aemisegger et al 2014 froehlich et al 2008 2001 a specific case is the mediterranean region where precipitation mostly derives from the vapor forming over the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean bard et al 2002 batibeniz et al 2020 it is usually reported that the mediterranean sources tend to be isotopically enriched in heavy isotopes compared to the atlantic ones legrande and schmidt 2006 therefore it follows that even the isotopic composition of precipitation generated within the mediterranean is more positive than that of atlantic origin celle jeanton et al 2001 moreover compared to the atlantic sources in the semi closed mediterranean basin especially in the eastern sectors the source vapor undergoes greater kinetic fractionation effects caused by lower rh and higher sst which lead to a higher d excess in the evaporating moisture gat et al 1996 pfahl and sodemann 2014 as a result air masses originated in the eastern mediterranean show d excess values up to 25 cruz san et al 1992 gat and carmi 1970 higher than those coming from the atlantic ocean 10 rozanski et al 1993 d excess values around 14 are typical of precipitation over the western mediterranean casellas et al 2019 celle jeanton et al 2001 however the mechanisms regulating d excess variability at ground have not yet been fully understood thus questioning the reliability of this parameter as a proxy of moisture source regions krklec et al 2018 in the mediterranean region continental carbonate δ18o is generally used as a proxy of paleo precipitation and paleo hydrological reconstruction roberts et al 2008 zanchetta et al 2007 nevertheless few comprehensive investigations have been performed in the western mediterranean to analyze the statistical relationships between stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation and meteorological and geographical variables casellas et al 2019 cruz san et al 1992 giustini et al 2016 longinelli and selmo 2003 rindsberger et al 1983 understanding the prevailing factors that drive the seasonal cycle in δ18o δ2h and d excess of precipitation is a challenging task in the mediterranean where the different contribution of distal atlantic or local mediterranean moisture sources has not yet been disentangled a key region for understanding the complexity of the different processes acting on the isotopic composition of precipitation in the western mediterranean is tuscany located in central western italy owing to its geographic location it is affected by both atlantic atmospheric disturbances from nw and moist air masses originated in the mediterranean and also affected by the secondary cyclogenesis center of the gulf of genoa the most active in the entire mediterranean reale and lionello 2013 the ideal position of the tuscany region thus offers the opportunity to investigate the complex influence of moisture sources on the rainfall isotopic composition considerable climatic seasonality as well as complex morphology and orography of the region which imply strong climatic and meteorological gradients allow to investigate all possible controls on isotopic variability in a relatively small area so far only a few isotopic data in precipitation have been produced in tuscany namely those of the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip by the international atomic energy agency iaea and those resulting from local hydrological and hydrogeological studies baneschi et al 2015 doveri et al 2019 magi et al 2019 nevertheless to the best of our knowledge no comprehensive investigations have been performed in tuscany to analyze the relationship between stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation and geographical and meteorological variables this type of research is required by hydrogeological and ecohydrological surveys useful to better define the recharge mechanisms of regional aquifer systems and to understand the water uptake and transpiration processes in plants and crops and also by palaeohydrological studies that need a more accurate and quantitative interpretation in this work we present the isotopic data of 644 precipitation samples collected at 12 sites across tuscany from 1971 to 2018 statistical approaches were applied to investigate the relationships with geographical and meteorological variables the main objectives of this work were 1 to gather all the precipitation isotopic data available in tuscany in a structured database 2 to define for the first time the local meteoric water line lmwl of tuscany by applying different regression techniques useful for regional atmospheric and local hydrological studies 3 to investigate the meteorological control on the rainfall isotopic composition on an annual seasonal and monthly basis 4 to analyze the spatial variability of the isotopic signature and the influence of local geographical factors 5 to test the reliability of d excess in discerning different sources of humidity in this area of the mediterranean basin underlying risks and potentiality resulting from its use for this purpose this work focuses on the discussion of isotopic data as a whole giving less emphasis to temporal and spatial variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation over the study area spatial heterogeneity is however only partly taken into account 2 location and climate tuscany is a heterogeneous region for both its morphological and climatic features its topography varies from seaside and plains near the coastline to the hilly areas and flat valleys around the rivers to the mountains with altitudes varying from mean sea level up to the more than 2000 m a s l of the main apennine reliefs fig 1 the region is surrounded on the western side by the ligurian sea to the north and the tyrrhenian sea to the south and is bordered by the northern apennines both to the north and the east the main climatic features of the region are those typical of a mediterranean climatic regime especially for the low altitude sites with hot dry summers and mild wet winters lionello et al 2006b the mediterranean region lies in a transition zone between the arid climate of north africa and the temperate and rainy climate of central europe where mid latitude and tropical conditions compete with each other bolle 2003 lionello et al 2006b these characteristics result in a winter climate that is mostly characterized by disturbances originating over the atlantic ocean and moving eastwards to reach the western european coasts in addition to storms coming from the scandinavian and siberian regions lionello et al 2006b in summer high pressure centers dominate over the region leading to prevailing dry conditions storms coming from north africa and subtropical areas may occur in spring and summer several studies have demonstrated that the winter climate of the western mediterranean and especially its precipitation patterns is influenced by midlatitude teleconnections trigo et al 2006 like the north atlantic oscillation nao hurrell et al 2003 hurrell and van loon 1997 trigo et al 2002 the nao index which represents the dominant mode of north atlantic atmospheric variability driving storm track changes over europe hurrell 1995 is anti correlated with winter precipitation over most of the western mediterranean region lópez moreno et al 2007 trigo et al 2008 2004 including italy caloiero et al 2011 ferrari et al 2013 luppichini et al 2021 romano and preziosi 2013 vergni et al 2016 however storm events may originate from mediterranean disturbances produced internally to the region in correspondence of cyclogenetic areas such as the lee of the alps the gulf of lyon and the gulf of genoa lionello et al 2006a in this general context tuscany is characterized by a strong spatial variability of climatic parameters deriving from local factors such as orography and distance from the sea and the main reliefs the temperature is largely variable at different sites rapetti and vittorini 2012 with differences of about 6 c in winter and summer temperatures between mountainous and coastal sites bartolini et al 2008 rapetti and vittorini 2012 yearly mean precipitation can range from about 500 mm in the islands of the tuscan archipelago and in the coastal areas to over 2500 mm in the apuan alps bartolini et al 2018 fatichi and caporali 2009 rapetti and vittorini 2012 the average rainfall regime is characterized by two peaks of precipitation the main one in autumn and the secondary one in late winter spring whereas summer is the driest period of the year bartolini et al 2018 rapetti and vittorini 1994 the maximum number of wet days p 1 mm day occurs in winter and autumn in the northern apennines and in the apuan alps with a decreasing trend towards the coast from north to south and a minimum on the islands rapetti and vittorini 2012 the temporal distribution of yearly precipitation is most uniform in the eastern inner part of the region and in the central southern hills whereas the greatest seasonality of precipitation is typical of the central southern coast and the islands where 70 of the total annual rainfall is concentrated from october to march bartolini et al 2018 the northwestern areas of the region are quite frequently exposed to intense meteoric events especially in autumn when the sea surface temperature sst is at its highest bartolini et al 2014 d amato avanzi et al 2004 giannecchini and d amato avanzi 2012 most of these thunderstorms derive from the arrival of atlantic frontal systems in the western mediterranean or from secondary cyclogenesis over the gulf of genoa associated with the passage of major cyclones to the north of the mediterranean basin reale and lionello 2013 in this area the presence of the apennines and of the apuan alps prevents disturbances from northern and eastern europe on the other hand the inner sites more distant from the sea show a more continental precipitation regime so that the precipitation fraction caused by other synoptic conditions is not negligible bartolini et al 2014 3 data and methods 3 1 isotope pluviometric stations the isotopic data presented and discussed in this work derive from rainfall samples collected at 12 isotopic pluviometric stations across tuscany fig 1 during the 1971 2018 period the latitude longitude and altitude of each sampling site are presented in table 1 six stations are situated in northwestern tuscany p1 p2 p4 p5 p6 p7 two in the northeastern part of the region p3 p8 three in the southern part p9 p10 p11 and one p12 on pianosa island tuscan archipelago located between tuscany and corsica p3 actually falls within the territory of the emilia romagna region but it was included to better represent the isotopic signature of the precipitations over the apennine the northwestern sites represent peculiar meteorological patterns since they are the first to be intercepted by the frontal disturbances coming from the north atlantic on the other hand the inner sites p3 p8 p9 p10 show a more continental climate with a likely influence of storm tracks coming from north and north east the pianosa island station is mainly representative of the rainfall generated or significantly affected by the mediterranean basin the stations some of them still operating are placed at different altitudes from the seaside towards the inner areas of the region altitudes range from 0 m a s l at p6 to 1685 m a s l at p10 five stations are situated in mountain environments at altitudes higher than 500 m a s l two in the apuan alps p4 p5 two in the northern apennines p2 p3 and one on the mt amiata summit p10 these sites are characterized by cold winters and higher precipitations compared with the low altitude stations nearest to the coast p6 p7 p11 which show a more typical mediterranean climate similar conditions can be observed on pianosa island p12 where precipitations tend to be less frequent and intense all the rain samplers were of the oil collector type except for the one placed at p5 which was a tube dip in water collector doveri et al 2019 both types are recommended by iaea iaea gnip 2014 and their reliability has been proven by previous works gröning et al 2012 michelsen et al 2018 3 2 literature review and isotopic dataset a database has been created of 644 precipitation samples collected from 12 pluviometric stations over tuscany during the 1971 2018 period the samples are not equally distributed among the various stations p7 and p2 are the most represented sites 21 1 and 15 8 respectively followed by p6 11 5 p1 and p10 had the lowest number of samples 2 6 and 2 5 respectively table 1 the database includes both published data baneschi et al 2015 doveri et al 2019 iaea wmo 2020 longinelli and selmo 2003 magi et al 2019 and unpublished measurements performed within three different projects the first project was carried out between 2007 and 2015 in north western tuscany by the institute of geosciences and earth resources igg cnr of pisa as complementary project of the palaeoclimatological researches performed by the university of pisa and the university of melbourne several precipitation samples were collected at the two sites the first one is located in the apuan alps near the village of levigliani and downstream the corchia cave p4 discontinuous isotope monitoring of precipitation at this site was conducted from october 2009 to october 2015 and part of the dataset has not yet been published the second site is located along the shores of lake massaciuccoli p6 where precipitations were monitored from 2007 to 2014 rainfalls were also collected on pianosa island p12 where hydrogeological and climatic studies by the igg cnr and earth sciences department of university of pisa have been going on for several years a continuous isotope series of precipitation at this site is available for the period between november 2014 and december 2018 data from the p2 p3 and p7 stations were extracted from the database of the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip iaea wmo 2020 and integrated with new data covering the 1996 1999 period at p2 and the 1996 1999 and 2003 2004 periods at p7 the isotope records from p1 p8 p9 and p11 were published by longinelli and selmo 2003 only as mean annual weighted isotopic values raw data were analyzed as monthly mean finally data from p5 and p10 were produced within local hydrogeological studies doveri et al 2019 magi et al 2019 the database table s1 supplementary includes data of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of precipitation d excess and total amount of precipitation monthly recorded at the sampling sites d excess was calculated by dansgaard s equation dansgaard 1964 using the relationship d δ2h 8 δ18o isotope series cover different time spans in particular from 1971 to 2018 most of the collected data are based on monthly measurements whereas other samples were collected every two months some samples were taken over a 30 day period but they do not correspond to exactly one month from the 1st to the last day of the month for the purposes of this study only monthly precipitation isotope data δ2h and δ18o produced from stations that had been active for at least one year were selected for processing for this reason we excluded data from p1 p8 and p10 and just a few samples of p4 and p6 whose precipitations had been collected bi monthly or randomly furthermore we decided to discard samples whose d excess values were 0 due to probable interferences from post precipitation evaporation harvey 2005 harvey and welker 2000 welker 2000 the resulting dataset includes 553 samples subdivided into 9 stations as shown in fig 2 p7 is the most represented site and together with p2 it represents 40 of the dataset whereas p11 shows the shortest series overall the tyrrhenian side of the region is quite well represented as well as the mountain areas of the apuan alps and those behind the northern apennines on the contrary the central eastern and southern sectors were poorly represented however the data from three discarded sites were used for comparison with the results obtained from the main dataset in order to investigate the relationship between the isotopic composition of precipitation and the meteorological variables monthly air temperature t records were included in the database unfortunately the t at the sampling site was only available for 45 new samples collected on pianosa island a diver baro probe schlumberger water services with an accuracy of 0 1 c still operating recorded the hourly air temperature in the other sites t records were derived from stations of the regional hydrologic service of tuscany sir https www sir toscana it that were as close as possible to the rain collectors the monthly mean t were calculated by daily minimum and maximum temperatures recorded at these sites t records for brasimone derived from the regional agency for environmental protection and prevention arpae in the emilia romagna region https simc arpae it dext3r more details on the t series are provided in table s2 supplementary 3 3 stable isotope analysis and regression all the samples collected at p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7 p10 and p12 were analyzed at the laboratories of the institute of geosciences and earth resources of the national research council igg cnr in pisa the samples collected at p1 p8 p9 and p11 were analyzed at the laboratory of isotope geochemistry of the university of parma the same analytical techniques were used at both laboratories oxygen isotope composition was measured by the water co2 equilibration technique epstein and mayeda 1953 followed by the analysis of co2 using finnigan mat 252 and finnigan delta s mass spectrometers at the igg cnr in pisa and at the university of parma respectively hydrogen isotope composition was determined by the zinc reduction method coleman et al 1982 and the same mass spectrometers used for δ18o a los gatos research liquid water isotope analyzer based on the off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy technique lis et al 2008 was used at igg cnr for samples collected after 2013 the data are expressed as δ compared to the international reference standard v smow analytical precision was 0 1 for δ18o and 2 or 1 for δ2h for samples collected and analyzed before 2013 at igg cnr and for all the other samples respectively error propagation for d excess resulted in a precision ranging approximately from 2 5 to 1 8 respectively for samples collected and analyzed at igg cnr before 2013 and for all the other samples in this work different regression techniques have been tested to derive the lmwl reduced major axis rma major axis ma least squares and precipitation weighted regressions pwlsr pwrma pwma in addition to ordinary least squares regression olsr were applied crawford et al 2014 hughes and crawford 2012 theoretically the rma and ma regressions are more suitable than olsr because they consider errors in both correlated variables δ18o and δ2h precipitation weighted regressions are useful to minimize the impact of possible evaporation processes when dealing with small precipitation amounts hughes and crawford 2012 the root mean of sum of squared errors rmsseav crawford et al 2014 was used to determine the goodness of fit which is better when rmsseav equals 1 00 statistical analyses were performed using r 3 6 1 r core team 2019 all the standard deviations calculated were given at 1σ shapiro wilk s method was used for the normality test on the data spearman s rank correlation analysis was performed to summarize the strength and direction negative or positive of the relationships between the stable isotope signatures of precipitation and the meteorological variables the classification proposed in fowler et al 2009 was used to describe the strength of the correlation the kruskal wallisrank sum test is a rank based nonparametric test kruskal and wallis 1952 alternative to one way anova which can be used when anova assumptions are not met since these assumptions were not fulfilled for all the investigated variables we applied the kruskal wallis test to determine whether there were statistically significant differences in isotopic and meteorological variables in different seasons and in different sampling sites 4 results 4 1 δ18o δ2h and d excess signatures of precipitation in tuscany the monthly isotopic values for precipitation in 9 sites across tuscany the calculated d excess values the monthly precipitation amount and the monthly mean air temperature are reported in table s3 supplementary summary statistics of raw monthly data are provided in table 2 whereas the distribution of the data is shown in fig 3 through histograms and boxplots as a whole the isotopic parameters showed a large variability which is typical of rainwater the δ18o values ranged between 0 61 and 12 0 with a median value of 6 17 the δ2h values ranged between 5 36 and 87 1 with a median value of 37 3 d excess ranged between 0 32 and 24 1 with a median value of 12 1 n 553 means were similar to median isotopic values the isotopic parameters followed a normal distribution as shown by the shapiro wilk normality test p 0 05 skewness was nearly zero indicating a symmetrical dataset with frequency values lower and higher than the medium the kurtosis coefficient was around zero which is typical of mesokurtic distribution the probability of extreme or outlier data is close to zero normality cannot be assumed for air temperature values at the sampling sites p 0 05 which ranged from 4 2 c to 27 9 c with a mean value of 13 6 c the monthly precipitation amount was better described by a log normal distribution with the lower values 160 mm that were more frequent than the higher ones the positive skewness and high kurtosis coefficient indicate a large influence of months with a high precipitation amount as also evidenced by the wide difference between the median 83 mm and the mean value 113 mm in the sampling sites the monthly rainfall amount ranged from 1 to 854 mm with samples higher than 320 mm identified as outliers n 35 the outliers were distributed among the apuan alps and the apennine sites p2 p4 and p5 and only one sample belonged to p7 this distribution of outliers probably evidences that they are not real extreme values but rather the result of putting together the sites characterized by plentiful precipitation e g apuan alps with drier locations accordingly very high amounts of precipitation that would be usual for high altitude sites appear as outliers when considering the data as a whole precipitation data in the δ space fig 4 show a strong correlation as evidenced by spearman s correlation coefficient r of 0 97 p 0 001 the calculated values of rmsseav for different regressions table s4 indicated that pwlsr and rma were the most suitable models when fitting precipitation data for the study area rmsseav of 1 00 thus we obtained two very similar lmwls labelled as lmwlrma and lmwlpwlsr 1 2 1 lmwlpwlsr δ2h 7 22 0 08 δ18o 7 53 0 54 r2 0 95 n 553 2 lmwlrma δ2h 7 28 0 07 δ18o 7 30 0 46 r2 0 95 n 553 the isotope precipitation values recorded at p1 p6 and p10 sampled over periods not exactly corresponding to the duration of a month were also plotted above the derived lmwls for comparison fig s1 the lmwls recalculated by including data from these stations 3 4 had slopes and intercepts that were very similar to previous ones both for rma and pwlsr regression table s4 thus confirming their reliability in describing the isotopic composition of precipitation in the study area 3 lmwlpwlsr δ2h 7 22 0 07 δ18o 7 58 0 50 r2 0 95 n 612 4 lmwlrma δ2h 7 26 0 07 δ18o 7 23 0 44 r2 0 95 n 612 a weighted local meteoric water line wlmwl was also derived by using volume weighted annual isotopic means computing for years the data covering almost ten months at each site table s5 the wlmwl fig s2 calculated by applying the rma regression best fitting model along with pwrma table s4 was quite similar to lmwl with a slightly lower slope and intercept 5 5 wlmwlrma δ2h 6 99 0 24 δ18o 5 86 1 55 r2 0 96 n 42 the relationship between δ18o and δ2h of precipitation in the study area can also be distinguished seasonally fig s3 only unweighted regression models were tested of which rma was the most suitable in fitting precipitation data table s4 the slope and intercept of the seasonal local meteoric water lines mwls were between 7 08 and 7 90 and 5 32 and 12 1 respectively the values were higher in winter 7 90 0 15 and 12 1 1 10 and autumn 7 52 0 13 and 10 3 0 89 and lower in spring 7 08 0 14 and 5 34 0 91 and summer 7 15 0 16 and 5 32 0 82 4 2 seasonality of rainfall isotopic signature the stable isotopic precipitation signature in the study area exhibited a clear intra annual variability with higher values of δ18o and δ2h in summer and lower in winter figs 5 6 the differences among seasons were statistically significant p 0 05 except for δ2h between spring and autumn table s6 considering the mean values for the ensemble of pluviometer sites in each season the minimum δ18o and δ2h was recorded in winter 7 15 2 13 and 44 3 16 8 respectively the maximum in summer 4 72 2 16 and 28 4 15 4 respectively intermediate δ18o values of 6 00 1 90 and 6 60 1 83 and 37 1 13 4 and 39 3 13 8 for δ2h were calculated for spring and autumn respectively isotopic variability was generally wider in winter and summer while a narrower range of isotopic values was found in spring and autumn as also evidenced by the relative standard deviation the intra annual trend roughly follows the mean monthly air temperature trend figs 5 6 which shows higher values in summer 21 5 c 3 7 c and lower in winter 7 0 c 3 5 c the temperature differences among seasons were always statistically significant table s6 august was the warmest january the coldest month an opposite trend was shown by the monthly precipitation amount with the dry season occurring in summer in keeping with the climatic conditions of this sector of the mediterranean basin the most abundant precipitation was recorded in autumn and secondarily in winter the differences were statistically significant except for those between winter and spring the maximum rainfall amount was in november when precipitation showed slightly lower isotopic values and higher d excess than in the winter months fig 6 the minimum rain amount was in july d excess in precipitation follows an opposite trend with respect to the water isotope signatures and the differences among the four groups were always statistically significant the higher values were recorded in autumn and winter with a mean value of 13 5 3 2 and 12 9 3 8 respectively in spring and summer d excess was lower ranging from 10 9 3 9 and 9 3 4 4 respectively with a wider variability in the dry and hot summer season 4 3 spatial variability of rainfall isotopic composition the mean annual air temperature ranged from a minimum of 3 8 c in the p2 apennine site to a maximum of 18 0 c at p7 p11 p12 and p6 showed the lowest mean annual precipitation 529 mm 625 mm and 632 mm respectively whereas the p4 apuan alps site presented the highest mean annual precipitation 2302 mm followed by p2 p5 and p3 as expected rainfall was generally more abundant in the apuan alps and in the apennine sites compared with the low altitude stations overall the monthly mean precipitations were statistically different between the mountain and plain sites but not between nearby sites or at similar altitudes table s6 the monthly isotope values recorded at each sampling site are summarized in fig 7 in order to compare the monthly isotopic composition recorded at 9 selected sites with the isotopic values measured at p1 p8 and p10 all the data grouped for 12 stations were plotted in fig s4 overall the lowest isotope values were measured at the higher altitude stations p2 and p3 monthly mean δ18o of 7 52 1 80 and 8 01 2 23 respectively with p3 being slightly more negative although its altitude was 650 m lower than p2 however the δ18o and δ2h differences between p2 and p3 were not statistically significant table s6 p10 also showed low values with a mean δ18o of 7 52 1 48 which is equal to the mean value recorded at p2 placed at a similar altitude 1500 m a s l the isotope values at p2 p3 and p10 were statistically different from the other sites table s6 considering all the stations p1 showed the highest values mean of 5 17 1 32 followed by p7 which had the longest isotope series mean of 5 21 1 77 it is worth noting that the isotope signature of the apuan alps site p5 was very similar to that of the coastal site p11 mean of 5 70 and 5 67 respectively and p6 mean of 5 78 despite the higher altitude the isotopic differences among sites were not statistically significant in most cases except for p2 p3 and p10 which always differed from the other stations d excess had an opposite trend with respect to the stable isotopes the higher values were recorded at high altitude sites with p10 showing the highest mean value 16 0 3 8 followed by p2 and p3 monthly mean of 13 7 2 8 and 14 9 4 7 respectively whereas p7 p8 and p6 exhibited the lowest values 9 95 3 5 10 1 2 6 and 10 3 3 8 respectively the differences between these two groups of sites were statistically significant the other sites recorded very similar values means from 11 6 to 12 0 despite the different geographical location and altitude 5 discussion 5 1 isotopic rainfall composition in the western mediterranean and lmwls the yearly isotopic variability of tuscany rainfall was consistent with the mixed influence between atlantic and mediterranean moisture sources consistently with other results from the western mediterranean casellas et al 2019 celle jeanton et al 2001 cruz san et al 1992 dumitru et al 2017 stable isotopes exhibited a clear seasonal variability figs 5 and 6 which can be attributed at least partly to changes in temperature and in precipitation amount this variability can be explained by the two well known isotopic effects the temperature effect dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 which results in isotopically enriched rains during the warm season and isotopically depleted ones in the colder months the amount effect clark and fritz 1997 which implies depleted precipitation in heavy isotopes as the rainfall amount increases mean winter δ18o of 7 15 was consistent both with measured data at gnip mediterranean stations and with modelled echam5 wiso ones langebroek et al 2011 however a greater frequency variability is superimposed on the seasonal variability unlikely to be ascribable only to seasonal climatic variations this variability may be attributed to different moisture origins trajectories and rainout or to geographical factors such as latitude altitude and distance from the coast i e continentality effect dansgaard 1964 moreover input of continental moisture recycling can further alter the isotopic signature recorded in precipitation the wide variability of d excess recorded in tuscany is congruent with the one found for the entire italian peninsula from 1 to 22 giustini et al 2016 distribution of d excess values was quite symmetrical indicating a similar probability of obtaining higher or lower values than the mean value of 11 8 this suggested the influence of vapor coming from the moisture sources of both the atlantic and the mediterranean in generating the precipitations over tuscany it is worth mentioning that the secondary cyclogenesis over the gulf of genoa associated with the passage of major atlantic cyclones is often responsible for intense precipitation in this mediterranean area hence isotope and d excess values in precipitation may result from mixing the different air masses with local origin and advected from the atlantic however d excess variability should also be interpreted as the result of different processes occurring from the vapor source to the site of the rain event indeed the seasonal changes in d excess figs 5 and 6 could be controlled by three different factors acting individually or jointly i inter annual changes in sst and rh over the ocean surface which modify the evaporative conditions ii differentiated contribution of various moisture sources acting with variable intensity in different seasons iii more or less frequent secondary processes according to the season drier conditions are also responsible for high d excess in winter precipitation whereas lower values are recorded in the summer interestingly d excess values were generally higher in autumn october and november even when compared to winter ones when rh and sst at the moisture source should be lower similar patterns are reported in nearby areas facing the northern adriatic sea bronić et al 2020 masiol et al 2021 vreča et al 2006 2007 d excess 14 typical of the rainfall originated in the mediterranean casellas et al 2019 celle jeanton et al 2001 was frequently recorded in autumn 41 and secondarily in winter 30 and this could indicate the mediterranean sea as the major source of moisture in autumn precipitation over the study area this pattern is consistent with findings from mariotti et al 2002 of higher mediterranean evaporation rates from october to january and maximum evaporation rates in november this stronger evaporation could be linked to a larger thermal gradient between sea surface and atmosphere in this season as the sst of mediterranean sea is still high compared with air temperature pastor et al 2018 this gradient is lower in the north atlantic yielding a lower moisture uptake over this region than in the mediterranean one in addition to an nao regime not yet predominant luppichini et al 2021 these evidences are consistent with the results from gómez hernández et al 2013 who identified the western mediterranean sea as the main moisture source region for mediterranean areas during the wet season from october to march on the contrary batibeniz et al 2020 indicated a lower influence of the mediterranean than the atlantic sources 10 in all seasons whereas drumond et al 2011 found a predominant contribution from the mediterranean sea in the warm season high d excess values are less frequent in spring and summer whereas d excess 10 in summer precipitation can be attributed to more humid conditions at the moisture source which reduce the kinetic fractionation effects this could also evidence a lesser mediterranean contribution to total moisture in this season liotta et al 2008 however secondary evaporation of raindrops below the clouds in a warmer atmosphere can explain very low d excess values the mixed origin of moisture reaching the study area reflects the inadequacy of the gmwl to describe precipitation in the mediterranean basin two local meteoric water lines were calculated on 553 monthly isotope data using the rma unweighted method and the pwlsr weighted method fig 4 crawford et al 2014 although the lmwls differ only slightly they are suitable for different applications the lmwlpwlsr is more appropriate to represent hydrologically significant precipitation which is important for local hydrological applications especially when investigating the stable isotope signature of groundwater in relation to meteoric recharge on the contrary the unweighted lmwlrma is advisable when facing the atmospheric and hydrometeorological processes that govern the isotopic composition of precipitation considering the uncertainties given as standard error of the slope and intercept the obtained lmwls overlap with the central italy meteoric water line cimwl by longinelli and selmo 2003 δ2h 7 05 δ18o 5 61 and giustini et al 2016 δ2h 7 46 0 33 δ18o 8 29 2 33 the lmwls are also very close to the western mediterranean meteoric water line wmmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 13 7 calculated by celle jeanton 2000 who show a higher intercept than the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961b rozanski et al 1993 it is worth noting that these lines were obtained by using the olsr method which generally produces a lower slope and intercept than the other techniques crawford et al 2014 marchina et al 2020 however values of 7 09 0 07 and 6 13 0 46 for slope and intercept respectively achieved by applying the olsr method to our dataset agree with those found by these authors the lower slope and intercept compared to the gmwl suggest warmer and less humid climatic conditions and the possible partial evaporation of falling droplets gonfiantini 1986 congruently with the climatic conditions over the mediterranean basin the differences among seasonal mwls fig s3 may be attributed to several factors including the evaporative conditions and the sst at the moisture source but also the secondary processes along the trajectories affected by local variables such as surface air temperature rh and precipitation rate the changes in slope and intercept over the year are congruent with the general trend of air temperature and precipitation amount with smaller slope and intercept when local air temperature is higher and precipitation is lower thus the effects of sub cloud secondary evaporation leading to an isotope enrichment of raindrops appear to be more probable in the warm season as evidenced by lower summer d excess on the contrary winter and autumn intercept values over 10 indicate primary evaporation controlled by the near surface rh at the source whereas secondary processes associated with local effects and non equilibrium fractionation seem to be negligible 5 2 meteorological control on rainfall isotopic signatures and mediterranean influence in order to evaluate the influence of temperature and amount effects on the rainfall isotope signature δ18o δ2h and d excess values were plotted against monthly mean temperature and total monthly precipitation fig 8 spearman s rank correlation coefficients are provided in table 3 a moderate positive correlation was found between air temperature and δ18o precipitation signature in tuscany which were significant at 99 9 confidence level r 0 56 p 0 001 a similar correlation was identified between t and δ2h r 0 52 p 0 001 pearson s correlation coefficients were slightly higher than spearman s coefficients which indicated a linear relationship between isotope values and temperature as shown by r2 values of 0 34 and 0 29 for δ18o and δ2h respectively this suggests a moderate influence of the temperature effect on the rainfall isotope composition with a slope of 0 19 c and an intercept of 8 60 for δ18o slope is consistent with the value of ca 0 2 c calculated for iaea stations at pisa genoa and palermo bard et al 2002 both for observations and for modelled data similar values were also found in sw france zhang et al 2020 greece argiriou and lykoudis 2006 slovenia and croatia vreča et al 2006 casellas et al 2019 observed a moderate temperature effect r2 0 44 in ne spain by using weekly data although with a higher slope 0 4 c a moderate negative correlation significant at 99 9 was found between monthly precipitation amount and isotopic composition of precipitation r 0 51 p 0 001 for δ18o r 0 46 p 0 001 for δ2h indicating a monotonic relationship however the r2 values of 0 15 and 0 12 for δ18o and δ2h respectively fig 8 showed that the association with the precipitation amount can be better described as non linear pearson s correlation coefficients were lower than spearman s the logarithmic function represented a better fit on the data r2 of 0 41 and 0 40 for δ18o and δ2h respectively however a linear gradient of about 0 8 per 100 mm month was calculated for δ18o which was similar to that found in sw france 0 7 0 8 per 100 mm month zhang et al 2020 some previous works zanchetta et al 2014 2007 cited the value of about 2 per 100 mm month found by bard et al 2002 as a reference for the amount effect in the western mediterranean bard et al 2002 excluded some very rare months with rainfall amount 300 mm and included data from the palermo iaea station in addition to those of genoa and pisa we found a δ18o rainfall amount gradient of about 1 5 per 100 mm month when the samples with monthly precipitation 300 mm were excluded however by using the data made available by the pisa genoa and palermo stations we recalculated a gradient of 0 7 per 100 mm month including all the data and of 1 per 100 mm month excluding the months with precipitation 300 mm the slope values were also very similar when pisa and genoa were considered alone whereas we found a value of 4 4 per 100 mm month in palermo this evidences a possible overestimation of the gradient by bard et al 2002 on account of the large weight exerted by palermo therefore the value of 2 per 100 mm month should be used carefully very weak linear relationships between stable isotopes and precipitation amount were also evidenced in the eastern mediterranean argiriou and lykoudis 2006 with particular regard to winter precipitation correlations using volume weighted annual means were better for precipitation in tuscany table 3 with r2 up to 0 38 that indicated a weak linear relationship with a gradient of 0 09 per 100 mm year for δ18o fig 9 the linear relationship with air temperature was also stronger with r2 up to 0 49 fig 9 and slope of 0 18 c congruently with the value derived by using monthly data it is worth noting that weighted annual means were calculated only where the data covered an almost ten month period the dry months included these evidences indicate a moderate influence of the amount effect on precipitation which was more linear over yearly time than monthly time scales across the study area d excess showed a weak negative correlation with monthly air temperature r 0 36 p 0 001 and a weak positive correlation with monthly precipitation amount r 0 37 p 0 001 fig 8 the low r2 values suggested a weak linearity of the relationships correlations with rainfall amount were moderate when weighted volume annual means were used whereas no significant correlation was found with air temperature table 3 fig 9 this suggests a scarce influence of local meteorological conditions on rainfall d excess the results are consistent with the climatological significance of this parameter mostly depending on the meteorological conditions at the moisture source which means that precipitating air masses originated in different areas have well distinct d excess values overall temperature and amount effects contribute to generating only a part of the isotopic variability observed in our dataset especially over time scales longer than the monthly one e g yearly and temperature appears to be the prevailing meteorological factor however these two factors can explain only ca 50 of monthly isotopic variability therefore other processes must be taken into account such as the different origin of the air masses and trajectories as well as the continental latitude and altitude effects the weak linear relationship between monthly isotopic composition of precipitation and total monthly rainfall amount fig 8 is mainly attributable to the presence of a consistent group of monthly rains characterized by little depletion in heavy isotopes despite the large amounts of precipitation 300 mm month as mentioned above the slope of the δ18o rainfall amount relationship changed from 0 8 to 1 5 per 100 mm month when these samples were excluded and r2 also slightly increased from 0 15 to 0 21 argiriou and lykoudis 2006 also observed that precipitations over greece were depleted for rainfall amounts increasing up to 100 mm month while this effect did not appear for higher amounts a similar pattern was evidenced for single meteoric events sampled at avignon celle jeanton et al 2001 where the authors classified as mediterranean events large amounts of precipitation with less negative isotope signature indeed proximity to the mediterranean sea limits fractionation due to weak rainout and negligible continental effect conversely samples showing a more evident amount effect were classified as atlantic rains corresponding to longer travel distance and higher degree of rainout our data can suggest similar processes even if no quantitative evaluation of influence of two different moisture sources can be performed because of monthly sampling frequency data grouped on the d excess parameter fig 10 a indicate that 46 of samples higher than 300 mm month showed d excess 14 and the percentage increased to 73 when d excess 12 was considered these values were more frequently recorded in autumn about 50 than in other seasons high amounts of precipitation with d excess close to 15 were also observed at the gibraltar tunis and genoa stations cruz san et al 1992 supporting the hypothesis of a mediterranean origin for more abundant precipitations in the western mediterranean celle jeanton et al 2001 especially in autumn however some samples with high d excess were more depleted than would be expected from mediterranean vapor fig 10a in these cases more frequent in autumn and in winter fig s3 the high d excess could be associated with other processes such as continental moisture recycling or solid precipitation snow or hail jouzel and merlivat 1984 as a matter of fact the data grouped on different sampling sites fig 10b indicated that the most depleted isotope values which also had high d excess were mostly recorded at the high altitude stations p3 and p2 where snowfall can occur in late autumn and in winter the formation of orographic clouds in mountain sites can further increase the d excess in precipitation liotta et al 2006 see section 5 3 the binary diagram of fig 10b also highlighted that samples with precipitation amounts 300 mm were in northwestern tuscany p2 p4 p5 and just two samples at p7 especially those collected in the apuan alps and the apennine sites where plentiful precipitation can occur spearmańs rank correlation analysis between stable isotope signatures and temperature and precipitation amount was also performed for each season in order to understand whether the influence of meteorological variables on the isotopic composition of precipitation changed seasonally spearmańs correlation coefficients for each season are reported in table 4 the isotope signatures showed a moderate positive correlation statistically significant at 99 9 with monthly mean temperature during each season except for winter when it was weak the correlation was higher in autumn and in spring 0 56 and 0 55 for δ18o respectively and lower in other seasons especially in winter 0 37 and 0 33 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the relationship was weakly linear fig 11 better in spring and in autumn consistent with the correlation coefficients as shown by r2 values similarly we found a moderate negative correlation significant at 99 9 between the isotopic composition of precipitation and the monthly rainfall amount in spring and summer 0 57 and 0 53 for δ18o respectively whereas it was weak in winter and autumn 0 34 and 0 31 for δ18o respectively however the low linear regression coefficients r2 highlighted a very weak linear relationship between the isotope signature of rainwater and the precipitation amount in spring and summer fig 11 the data were instead strongly scattered in winter and autumn and no linear relationship was found therefore spring and summer appear to be the seasons most affected although rather weakly by the local meteorological conditions however air temperature also has a detectable effect on the isotopic composition of precipitation during autumn on the contrary the influence of the local meteorological conditions is very weak or negligible in winter during the more rainy seasons autumn and winter the isotopic composition of precipitation appears to be more controlled by large scale processes such as moisture origin and air mass trajectories rather than by local meteorological variables for instance in the autumn winter season the differentiated arrival of disturbances from the north atlantic and the mediterranean sea or of the moisture resulting from their mix could be the main causes of the changes in rainfall isotope signature in the study area conversely the amount effect appears to be more important when rainfall is generally lower spring and summer temperature is higher and the air is more humid under these conditions convection is more intense rain drops are larger and re evaporation is smaller dansgaard 1964 these results emphasize the need to better investigate the dependency of the rainfall isotopic composition on the meteorological variables in the mediterranean basin which has important implications for both local hydrogeological studies and palaeohydrological reconstructions 5 3 geographical control on stable isotopes and d excess in precipitation as mentioned above the data from the three sites p1 p8 and p10 were excluded from statistical correlation analysis but were taken into account to evaluate the influence of geographical variables on the isotopic composition of precipitation mean air temperature at the sampling sites showed a moderate negative correlation r 0 53 statistically significant at 99 9 p 0 001 with altitude fig 12 with a vertical gradient of 0 7 c 100 m conversely mean monthly precipitation exhibited a strong positive correlation r 0 74 p 0 001 with altitude both correlations were linear fig 12 even though linearity was lower for the relationship between rainfall amount and altitude owing to the large variability of rain amounts recorded at the apuan alps stations p4 and p5 this evidence is congruent with the meteo climatic regime of the apuan alps where precipitation can be very high and strongly variable on a yearly time scale giannecchini and d amato avanzi 2012 spatial variability of the isotopic rainfall signature fig 7 is mostly affected by the altitude effect as evidenced in fig 12 δ18o and δ2h weighted annual mean values showed a moderate to strong negative correlation with altitude 0 70 and 0 62 respectively which is statistically significant at 99 9 the relationship was linear fig 12 with a δ18o vertical gradient of 0 13 100 m lower than the overall mean value for central italy of 0 22 100 m reported by giustini et al 2016 the isotope signature of p3 the inner site of the study area slightly deviated from the linear correlation δ18o altitude it presented more depleted isotope values as a result of the higher degree of rainout of moist air masses coming from northwest and west this evidences a continental effect on rainfall isotope signature in tuscany rainfall d excess was similar in all tuscan sites except for the high altitude sites p2 p3 and p10 which showed significantly higher values fig s4 however p6 p7 and p8 exhibited d excess values slightly lower than those of p4 p5 p9 p11 and p12 even though the differences were often not statistically significant table s6 in addition to the above discussed differentiation of d excess caused by the different origin of the moisture a strong positive correlation r 0 77 p 0 001 was identified between the weighted annual mean d excess and altitude this apparent linear correlation fig 12 also found in other mediterranean areas cruz san et al 1992 liotta et al 2013 2006 vreča et al 2006 is probably due to the so called pseudo altitude effect moser and stichler 1974 this effect is linked to the evaporative enrichment of δ18o and δ2h in raindrops as they fall beneath the cloud base i e sub cloud evaporation which is greater at low altitudes on account of the greater distance between the average cloud base level and the sampling point such an effect explains the lower d excess of precipitation recorded at p6 p7 and p8 even if other coastal sites p11 and p12 showed comparable values with the mountain sites of the apuan alps p4 and p5 fig s4 in mountain environments higher d excess values may be also ascribable to the presence of orographic clouds liotta et al 2006 enriched in deuterium for kinetic condensation processes stewart 1975 some authors have also invoked the so called seeder feeder mechanism that occurs when small droplets falling from higher level clouds pass through the saturated air within the orographic cloud and increase their size liotta et al 2006 this process could explain the higher d excess recorded at the apennine sites p2 and p3 and p10 however as stated above the addition of re evaporated moisture from continental areas to water vapor most likely over mountain sites more distant from the coast or solid precipitation snow or hail can produce high d excess these evidences allowed us to concentrate on an important issue concerning the use of d excess for disentangling different moisture sources in precipitation reaching the study area in the event that d excess is only altered by evaporative enrichment in raindrops below the clouds the actual d excess bearing the imprint of the vapor source would be the one recorded at high altitude sites under these conditions the mediterranean contribution to total precipitation in this area of western mediterranean would become stronger conversely in the event that orographic clouds seeder feeder mechanisms or solid precipitation are responsible for the high d excess values recorded in mountain sites only low altitude sites should be used to this end in this case the contribution of mediterranean vapor should be downsized however the most probable hypothesis is that all these effects contribute to the observed seasonal fluctuations of d excess in tuscan precipitation the morphological complexity of the tuscan territory makes d excess interpretation even more difficult the study of isotopic composition of single meteoric events might be useful to better understand these processes especially if combined with a back trajectory analysis of precipitating air masses 6 conclusions the results presented in this work indicate that variations of δ18o and δ2h in precipitation are rather a regionally integrated signal of several climatic and geographical variables than a proxy for either local temperature or precipitation amount the morphological complexity of the territory of tuscany characterized by strong altitudinal gradients associated with well distinct climatic and weather conditions further complicates the interpretation of the isotopic signals recorded in precipitation and of the d excess signatures however despite these premises some important general conclusions can be drawn the isotopic variability in rainfall recorded over tuscany is largely ascribable to the differentiated contribution from atlantic and mediterranean moisture sources it and appears to be different depending on the season assuming the reliability of d excess to trace the mediterranean vapor the data presented here indicate a larger contribution of mediterranean sources in autumn especially during the months characterized by heavy precipitation the temperature and amount effects can explain about 50 of the isotopic variability and their effect is more noticeable over yearly time scales than monthly ones however the relationship between the rainfall isotopic composition and the precipitation amounts is weakly linear further investigations are therefore required to better understand the underlying mechanisms regulating this process understanding the degree of the amount effect in the mediterranean basin is essential to correctly interpret the isotope signature recorded in the paleoclimatic archives the meteorological effects appear to be stronger during the periods of low rainfall such as spring and summer on the contrary these local factors are less important in winter and autumn when the large scale synoptic processes moisture origin trajectories and rainout play a major role according to this scheme the isotopic differences between winter and autumn could be driven by the differentiated arrival of disturbances from the mediterranean or atlantic areas the altitude effect is the main driver of spatial variability of the isotope signatures the apparent correlation between d excess and altitude could be the result of different processes pseudo altitude effect resulting from sub cloud evaporation orographic clouds seeder feeder mechanism solid precipitation snow and or hail continental moisture recycling further investigations will be necessary to understand which process is decisive in generating the observed d excess values this would make it possible to identify the most suitable site for using the d excess parameter as tracer of mediterranean vapor which has direct implications to disentangle the different contribution of atlantic and mediterranean sources in precipitation over the western

4018,the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation are widely used to track processes occurring within the hydrological cycle and understand regional atmospheric patterns that influence a specific area moreover the oxygen isotopic composition of continental carbonates is extensively used for palaeohydrological reconstruction nevertheless few comprehensive investigations have been performed in the western mediterranean to analyze the statistical relationships between oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes in precipitation and meteorological variables for understanding the factors that regulate the rainfall stable isotopic signature at present day in this area of mediterranean region we selected the tuscany region central italy due to its considerable climatic seasonality complex morphology and orography tuscany is affected by both atlantic atmospheric disturbances from nw and moist air masses originated in the mediterranean and also by the secondary cyclogenesis center of the gulf of genoa the most active in the entire mediterranean the ideal position of the tuscany region thus offers the opportunity to investigate the complex influence of moisture sources on the rainfall isotopic composition moreover in this region many hydrogeological and palaeohydrological studies were performed and require a more precise and quantitative interpretation in this work 644 isotope monthly data δ18o δ2h and deuterium excess of precipitation collected in 12 sites through tuscany from 1971 to 2018 were gathered in a database then only sites whose monthly data covered almost one year were considered for processing resulting in 553 precipitation samples archived along with monthly mean temperature and rainfall amount in this framework the lmwl for tuscany was determined by applying different regression techniques and statistical analyses were performed to define the influence of meteorological and geographical variables on the rainfall isotopic composition the outcomes point out the variations of rainfall isotopic signature as result of several climate and geographical variables than a univocal proxy for both local temperature and precipitation amount the atlantic and mediterranean moisture sources differently contribute for generating the observed isotopic variability and their influence may seasonally change overall the temperature and amount effect allow to explain the 50 of the isotopic variability but temperature appears to be more important these local effects are more pronounced during the periods with low rainfall spring and summer whereas the large scale processes moisture origin trajectories and rainout are prevailing in winter and autumn the altitude effect is the main driver of isotopic spatial variability the deuterium excess parameter is revealed to be a very complex but useful signal for disentangling the different contribution of atlantic and mediterranean sources in tuscan precipitation even if it is sometime misused keywords precipitation stable isotopes deuterium excess amount effect moisture origin 1 introduction the stable isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation is considered a powerful tool to trace the hydrological cycle clark and fritz 1997 characterize the regional atmospheric patterns baldini et al 2008 comas bru et al 2016 understand the aquifer recharge mechanisms and groundwater dynamics and carry out hydrological balances gat et al 1996 jasechko 2019 the application of stable isotopes in the water molecule has recently increased also in ecohydrology to investigate water uptake and transpiration in both natural and agricultural vegetated systems penna et al 2020 sprenger et al 2016 likewise the oxygen isotope signature recorded in paleoclimatic archives for example in speleothems which derive their isotopic imprinting from rainwater is a well known proxy for reconstructing climatic variations in the recent past e g isola et al 2019 lachniet 2009 zanchetta et al 2007 the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are therefore able to trace hydrological processes on a different spatial and time scale roberts et al 2010 and can provide important information for investigations related to the future water cycle yoshimura 2015 hence understanding and quantifiying the factors governing isotopic variability in modern precipitation is necessary for many hydrological ecohydrological and paleohydrological investigations the isotopic rainfall composition basically depends on fractionation processes occurring during the phase transitions within the hydrological cycle which induce fractionation of hydrogen in relation to oxygen isotopes craig 1961a dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 sharp 2007 equilibrium or kinetic non equilibrium isotopic fractionation typically occurs during the evaporation and condensation processes gat 2010 responsible for the wide range of isotopic signatures recorded in precipitation the condensation process of water vapor into rain drops in the clouds is a typical example of equilibrium fractionation which implies that the isotopic ratios in each phase are constant for a specific temperature the heavier isotopologues h2 18o and h2h16o have a greater tendency to enter the liquid solid phase than the lighter one h2 16o which preferentially remains in the vapor phase conversely evaporation from the ocean surface and from the continental water basins under relative humidity rh conditions lower than 100 is an example of kinetic fractionation it depends on the different masses and diffusivity of isotopologues due to the different strength of molecular bonds pfahl and sodemann 2014 during evaporation the lighter isotopologues enter the vapor phase more easily than the heavier ones leading to a depletion in heavy isotopes 2h and 18o in the vapor that develops over the water bodies equilibrium evaporation and kinetic condensation may also occur deshpande et al 2013 jouzel and merlivat 1984 stewart 1975 as a result of isotopic fractionation the rainfall isotopic signature is affected by geographical factors e g latitude altitude distance from the coast related to the location of monitoring sites dansgaard 1964 gonfiantini et al 2001 whose effects are stable for a particular area and it is also affected by meteorological variables such as precipitation amount and surface air temperature araguás araguás et al 2000 dansgaard 1964 lechler and niemi 2011 rozanski et al 1993 zhang et al 2020 or by cloud base temperature rindsberger et al 1983 the last two factors are closely linked to climate and their effects depend on seasonal fluctuations moreover the moisture source and rainout history of air masses also have important effects on rainfall isotopic composition araguás araguás et al 2000 krklec and domínguez villar 2014 such effects are due to the different isotopic composition of the source regions to the distinct pathways and trajectories followed by atmospheric water vapor and to the differentiated moisture uptake along the trajectories over the source regions e g baldini et al 2010 bershaw et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 the deuterium excess d excess parameter first introduced by dansgaard 1964 has been widely used to characterize the origin of moisture gat and carmi 1970 jouzel et al 2013 juhlke et al 2019 d excess values are mainly governed by the non equilibrium formation process of water vapor at the air sea interface gat and carmi 1970 gat et al 2003 which is in turn controlled by the meteorological conditions at the source region such as near surface rh and sea surface temperature sst bonne et al 2019 merlivat and jouzel 1979 pfahl and sodemann 2014 however d excess of precipitation may also change in response to processes occurring during moisture transport bershaw 2018 pfahl and sodemann 2014 it decreases when secondary evaporation occurs in air masses or rainfall wang et al 2016 conversely it increases with the rise of moisture recycling aemisegger et al 2014 froehlich et al 2008 2001 a specific case is the mediterranean region where precipitation mostly derives from the vapor forming over the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean bard et al 2002 batibeniz et al 2020 it is usually reported that the mediterranean sources tend to be isotopically enriched in heavy isotopes compared to the atlantic ones legrande and schmidt 2006 therefore it follows that even the isotopic composition of precipitation generated within the mediterranean is more positive than that of atlantic origin celle jeanton et al 2001 moreover compared to the atlantic sources in the semi closed mediterranean basin especially in the eastern sectors the source vapor undergoes greater kinetic fractionation effects caused by lower rh and higher sst which lead to a higher d excess in the evaporating moisture gat et al 1996 pfahl and sodemann 2014 as a result air masses originated in the eastern mediterranean show d excess values up to 25 cruz san et al 1992 gat and carmi 1970 higher than those coming from the atlantic ocean 10 rozanski et al 1993 d excess values around 14 are typical of precipitation over the western mediterranean casellas et al 2019 celle jeanton et al 2001 however the mechanisms regulating d excess variability at ground have not yet been fully understood thus questioning the reliability of this parameter as a proxy of moisture source regions krklec et al 2018 in the mediterranean region continental carbonate δ18o is generally used as a proxy of paleo precipitation and paleo hydrological reconstruction roberts et al 2008 zanchetta et al 2007 nevertheless few comprehensive investigations have been performed in the western mediterranean to analyze the statistical relationships between stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation and meteorological and geographical variables casellas et al 2019 cruz san et al 1992 giustini et al 2016 longinelli and selmo 2003 rindsberger et al 1983 understanding the prevailing factors that drive the seasonal cycle in δ18o δ2h and d excess of precipitation is a challenging task in the mediterranean where the different contribution of distal atlantic or local mediterranean moisture sources has not yet been disentangled a key region for understanding the complexity of the different processes acting on the isotopic composition of precipitation in the western mediterranean is tuscany located in central western italy owing to its geographic location it is affected by both atlantic atmospheric disturbances from nw and moist air masses originated in the mediterranean and also affected by the secondary cyclogenesis center of the gulf of genoa the most active in the entire mediterranean reale and lionello 2013 the ideal position of the tuscany region thus offers the opportunity to investigate the complex influence of moisture sources on the rainfall isotopic composition considerable climatic seasonality as well as complex morphology and orography of the region which imply strong climatic and meteorological gradients allow to investigate all possible controls on isotopic variability in a relatively small area so far only a few isotopic data in precipitation have been produced in tuscany namely those of the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip by the international atomic energy agency iaea and those resulting from local hydrological and hydrogeological studies baneschi et al 2015 doveri et al 2019 magi et al 2019 nevertheless to the best of our knowledge no comprehensive investigations have been performed in tuscany to analyze the relationship between stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation and geographical and meteorological variables this type of research is required by hydrogeological and ecohydrological surveys useful to better define the recharge mechanisms of regional aquifer systems and to understand the water uptake and transpiration processes in plants and crops and also by palaeohydrological studies that need a more accurate and quantitative interpretation in this work we present the isotopic data of 644 precipitation samples collected at 12 sites across tuscany from 1971 to 2018 statistical approaches were applied to investigate the relationships with geographical and meteorological variables the main objectives of this work were 1 to gather all the precipitation isotopic data available in tuscany in a structured database 2 to define for the first time the local meteoric water line lmwl of tuscany by applying different regression techniques useful for regional atmospheric and local hydrological studies 3 to investigate the meteorological control on the rainfall isotopic composition on an annual seasonal and monthly basis 4 to analyze the spatial variability of the isotopic signature and the influence of local geographical factors 5 to test the reliability of d excess in discerning different sources of humidity in this area of the mediterranean basin underlying risks and potentiality resulting from its use for this purpose this work focuses on the discussion of isotopic data as a whole giving less emphasis to temporal and spatial variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation over the study area spatial heterogeneity is however only partly taken into account 2 location and climate tuscany is a heterogeneous region for both its morphological and climatic features its topography varies from seaside and plains near the coastline to the hilly areas and flat valleys around the rivers to the mountains with altitudes varying from mean sea level up to the more than 2000 m a s l of the main apennine reliefs fig 1 the region is surrounded on the western side by the ligurian sea to the north and the tyrrhenian sea to the south and is bordered by the northern apennines both to the north and the east the main climatic features of the region are those typical of a mediterranean climatic regime especially for the low altitude sites with hot dry summers and mild wet winters lionello et al 2006b the mediterranean region lies in a transition zone between the arid climate of north africa and the temperate and rainy climate of central europe where mid latitude and tropical conditions compete with each other bolle 2003 lionello et al 2006b these characteristics result in a winter climate that is mostly characterized by disturbances originating over the atlantic ocean and moving eastwards to reach the western european coasts in addition to storms coming from the scandinavian and siberian regions lionello et al 2006b in summer high pressure centers dominate over the region leading to prevailing dry conditions storms coming from north africa and subtropical areas may occur in spring and summer several studies have demonstrated that the winter climate of the western mediterranean and especially its precipitation patterns is influenced by midlatitude teleconnections trigo et al 2006 like the north atlantic oscillation nao hurrell et al 2003 hurrell and van loon 1997 trigo et al 2002 the nao index which represents the dominant mode of north atlantic atmospheric variability driving storm track changes over europe hurrell 1995 is anti correlated with winter precipitation over most of the western mediterranean region lópez moreno et al 2007 trigo et al 2008 2004 including italy caloiero et al 2011 ferrari et al 2013 luppichini et al 2021 romano and preziosi 2013 vergni et al 2016 however storm events may originate from mediterranean disturbances produced internally to the region in correspondence of cyclogenetic areas such as the lee of the alps the gulf of lyon and the gulf of genoa lionello et al 2006a in this general context tuscany is characterized by a strong spatial variability of climatic parameters deriving from local factors such as orography and distance from the sea and the main reliefs the temperature is largely variable at different sites rapetti and vittorini 2012 with differences of about 6 c in winter and summer temperatures between mountainous and coastal sites bartolini et al 2008 rapetti and vittorini 2012 yearly mean precipitation can range from about 500 mm in the islands of the tuscan archipelago and in the coastal areas to over 2500 mm in the apuan alps bartolini et al 2018 fatichi and caporali 2009 rapetti and vittorini 2012 the average rainfall regime is characterized by two peaks of precipitation the main one in autumn and the secondary one in late winter spring whereas summer is the driest period of the year bartolini et al 2018 rapetti and vittorini 1994 the maximum number of wet days p 1 mm day occurs in winter and autumn in the northern apennines and in the apuan alps with a decreasing trend towards the coast from north to south and a minimum on the islands rapetti and vittorini 2012 the temporal distribution of yearly precipitation is most uniform in the eastern inner part of the region and in the central southern hills whereas the greatest seasonality of precipitation is typical of the central southern coast and the islands where 70 of the total annual rainfall is concentrated from october to march bartolini et al 2018 the northwestern areas of the region are quite frequently exposed to intense meteoric events especially in autumn when the sea surface temperature sst is at its highest bartolini et al 2014 d amato avanzi et al 2004 giannecchini and d amato avanzi 2012 most of these thunderstorms derive from the arrival of atlantic frontal systems in the western mediterranean or from secondary cyclogenesis over the gulf of genoa associated with the passage of major cyclones to the north of the mediterranean basin reale and lionello 2013 in this area the presence of the apennines and of the apuan alps prevents disturbances from northern and eastern europe on the other hand the inner sites more distant from the sea show a more continental precipitation regime so that the precipitation fraction caused by other synoptic conditions is not negligible bartolini et al 2014 3 data and methods 3 1 isotope pluviometric stations the isotopic data presented and discussed in this work derive from rainfall samples collected at 12 isotopic pluviometric stations across tuscany fig 1 during the 1971 2018 period the latitude longitude and altitude of each sampling site are presented in table 1 six stations are situated in northwestern tuscany p1 p2 p4 p5 p6 p7 two in the northeastern part of the region p3 p8 three in the southern part p9 p10 p11 and one p12 on pianosa island tuscan archipelago located between tuscany and corsica p3 actually falls within the territory of the emilia romagna region but it was included to better represent the isotopic signature of the precipitations over the apennine the northwestern sites represent peculiar meteorological patterns since they are the first to be intercepted by the frontal disturbances coming from the north atlantic on the other hand the inner sites p3 p8 p9 p10 show a more continental climate with a likely influence of storm tracks coming from north and north east the pianosa island station is mainly representative of the rainfall generated or significantly affected by the mediterranean basin the stations some of them still operating are placed at different altitudes from the seaside towards the inner areas of the region altitudes range from 0 m a s l at p6 to 1685 m a s l at p10 five stations are situated in mountain environments at altitudes higher than 500 m a s l two in the apuan alps p4 p5 two in the northern apennines p2 p3 and one on the mt amiata summit p10 these sites are characterized by cold winters and higher precipitations compared with the low altitude stations nearest to the coast p6 p7 p11 which show a more typical mediterranean climate similar conditions can be observed on pianosa island p12 where precipitations tend to be less frequent and intense all the rain samplers were of the oil collector type except for the one placed at p5 which was a tube dip in water collector doveri et al 2019 both types are recommended by iaea iaea gnip 2014 and their reliability has been proven by previous works gröning et al 2012 michelsen et al 2018 3 2 literature review and isotopic dataset a database has been created of 644 precipitation samples collected from 12 pluviometric stations over tuscany during the 1971 2018 period the samples are not equally distributed among the various stations p7 and p2 are the most represented sites 21 1 and 15 8 respectively followed by p6 11 5 p1 and p10 had the lowest number of samples 2 6 and 2 5 respectively table 1 the database includes both published data baneschi et al 2015 doveri et al 2019 iaea wmo 2020 longinelli and selmo 2003 magi et al 2019 and unpublished measurements performed within three different projects the first project was carried out between 2007 and 2015 in north western tuscany by the institute of geosciences and earth resources igg cnr of pisa as complementary project of the palaeoclimatological researches performed by the university of pisa and the university of melbourne several precipitation samples were collected at the two sites the first one is located in the apuan alps near the village of levigliani and downstream the corchia cave p4 discontinuous isotope monitoring of precipitation at this site was conducted from october 2009 to october 2015 and part of the dataset has not yet been published the second site is located along the shores of lake massaciuccoli p6 where precipitations were monitored from 2007 to 2014 rainfalls were also collected on pianosa island p12 where hydrogeological and climatic studies by the igg cnr and earth sciences department of university of pisa have been going on for several years a continuous isotope series of precipitation at this site is available for the period between november 2014 and december 2018 data from the p2 p3 and p7 stations were extracted from the database of the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip iaea wmo 2020 and integrated with new data covering the 1996 1999 period at p2 and the 1996 1999 and 2003 2004 periods at p7 the isotope records from p1 p8 p9 and p11 were published by longinelli and selmo 2003 only as mean annual weighted isotopic values raw data were analyzed as monthly mean finally data from p5 and p10 were produced within local hydrogeological studies doveri et al 2019 magi et al 2019 the database table s1 supplementary includes data of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of precipitation d excess and total amount of precipitation monthly recorded at the sampling sites d excess was calculated by dansgaard s equation dansgaard 1964 using the relationship d δ2h 8 δ18o isotope series cover different time spans in particular from 1971 to 2018 most of the collected data are based on monthly measurements whereas other samples were collected every two months some samples were taken over a 30 day period but they do not correspond to exactly one month from the 1st to the last day of the month for the purposes of this study only monthly precipitation isotope data δ2h and δ18o produced from stations that had been active for at least one year were selected for processing for this reason we excluded data from p1 p8 and p10 and just a few samples of p4 and p6 whose precipitations had been collected bi monthly or randomly furthermore we decided to discard samples whose d excess values were 0 due to probable interferences from post precipitation evaporation harvey 2005 harvey and welker 2000 welker 2000 the resulting dataset includes 553 samples subdivided into 9 stations as shown in fig 2 p7 is the most represented site and together with p2 it represents 40 of the dataset whereas p11 shows the shortest series overall the tyrrhenian side of the region is quite well represented as well as the mountain areas of the apuan alps and those behind the northern apennines on the contrary the central eastern and southern sectors were poorly represented however the data from three discarded sites were used for comparison with the results obtained from the main dataset in order to investigate the relationship between the isotopic composition of precipitation and the meteorological variables monthly air temperature t records were included in the database unfortunately the t at the sampling site was only available for 45 new samples collected on pianosa island a diver baro probe schlumberger water services with an accuracy of 0 1 c still operating recorded the hourly air temperature in the other sites t records were derived from stations of the regional hydrologic service of tuscany sir https www sir toscana it that were as close as possible to the rain collectors the monthly mean t were calculated by daily minimum and maximum temperatures recorded at these sites t records for brasimone derived from the regional agency for environmental protection and prevention arpae in the emilia romagna region https simc arpae it dext3r more details on the t series are provided in table s2 supplementary 3 3 stable isotope analysis and regression all the samples collected at p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7 p10 and p12 were analyzed at the laboratories of the institute of geosciences and earth resources of the national research council igg cnr in pisa the samples collected at p1 p8 p9 and p11 were analyzed at the laboratory of isotope geochemistry of the university of parma the same analytical techniques were used at both laboratories oxygen isotope composition was measured by the water co2 equilibration technique epstein and mayeda 1953 followed by the analysis of co2 using finnigan mat 252 and finnigan delta s mass spectrometers at the igg cnr in pisa and at the university of parma respectively hydrogen isotope composition was determined by the zinc reduction method coleman et al 1982 and the same mass spectrometers used for δ18o a los gatos research liquid water isotope analyzer based on the off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy technique lis et al 2008 was used at igg cnr for samples collected after 2013 the data are expressed as δ compared to the international reference standard v smow analytical precision was 0 1 for δ18o and 2 or 1 for δ2h for samples collected and analyzed before 2013 at igg cnr and for all the other samples respectively error propagation for d excess resulted in a precision ranging approximately from 2 5 to 1 8 respectively for samples collected and analyzed at igg cnr before 2013 and for all the other samples in this work different regression techniques have been tested to derive the lmwl reduced major axis rma major axis ma least squares and precipitation weighted regressions pwlsr pwrma pwma in addition to ordinary least squares regression olsr were applied crawford et al 2014 hughes and crawford 2012 theoretically the rma and ma regressions are more suitable than olsr because they consider errors in both correlated variables δ18o and δ2h precipitation weighted regressions are useful to minimize the impact of possible evaporation processes when dealing with small precipitation amounts hughes and crawford 2012 the root mean of sum of squared errors rmsseav crawford et al 2014 was used to determine the goodness of fit which is better when rmsseav equals 1 00 statistical analyses were performed using r 3 6 1 r core team 2019 all the standard deviations calculated were given at 1σ shapiro wilk s method was used for the normality test on the data spearman s rank correlation analysis was performed to summarize the strength and direction negative or positive of the relationships between the stable isotope signatures of precipitation and the meteorological variables the classification proposed in fowler et al 2009 was used to describe the strength of the correlation the kruskal wallisrank sum test is a rank based nonparametric test kruskal and wallis 1952 alternative to one way anova which can be used when anova assumptions are not met since these assumptions were not fulfilled for all the investigated variables we applied the kruskal wallis test to determine whether there were statistically significant differences in isotopic and meteorological variables in different seasons and in different sampling sites 4 results 4 1 δ18o δ2h and d excess signatures of precipitation in tuscany the monthly isotopic values for precipitation in 9 sites across tuscany the calculated d excess values the monthly precipitation amount and the monthly mean air temperature are reported in table s3 supplementary summary statistics of raw monthly data are provided in table 2 whereas the distribution of the data is shown in fig 3 through histograms and boxplots as a whole the isotopic parameters showed a large variability which is typical of rainwater the δ18o values ranged between 0 61 and 12 0 with a median value of 6 17 the δ2h values ranged between 5 36 and 87 1 with a median value of 37 3 d excess ranged between 0 32 and 24 1 with a median value of 12 1 n 553 means were similar to median isotopic values the isotopic parameters followed a normal distribution as shown by the shapiro wilk normality test p 0 05 skewness was nearly zero indicating a symmetrical dataset with frequency values lower and higher than the medium the kurtosis coefficient was around zero which is typical of mesokurtic distribution the probability of extreme or outlier data is close to zero normality cannot be assumed for air temperature values at the sampling sites p 0 05 which ranged from 4 2 c to 27 9 c with a mean value of 13 6 c the monthly precipitation amount was better described by a log normal distribution with the lower values 160 mm that were more frequent than the higher ones the positive skewness and high kurtosis coefficient indicate a large influence of months with a high precipitation amount as also evidenced by the wide difference between the median 83 mm and the mean value 113 mm in the sampling sites the monthly rainfall amount ranged from 1 to 854 mm with samples higher than 320 mm identified as outliers n 35 the outliers were distributed among the apuan alps and the apennine sites p2 p4 and p5 and only one sample belonged to p7 this distribution of outliers probably evidences that they are not real extreme values but rather the result of putting together the sites characterized by plentiful precipitation e g apuan alps with drier locations accordingly very high amounts of precipitation that would be usual for high altitude sites appear as outliers when considering the data as a whole precipitation data in the δ space fig 4 show a strong correlation as evidenced by spearman s correlation coefficient r of 0 97 p 0 001 the calculated values of rmsseav for different regressions table s4 indicated that pwlsr and rma were the most suitable models when fitting precipitation data for the study area rmsseav of 1 00 thus we obtained two very similar lmwls labelled as lmwlrma and lmwlpwlsr 1 2 1 lmwlpwlsr δ2h 7 22 0 08 δ18o 7 53 0 54 r2 0 95 n 553 2 lmwlrma δ2h 7 28 0 07 δ18o 7 30 0 46 r2 0 95 n 553 the isotope precipitation values recorded at p1 p6 and p10 sampled over periods not exactly corresponding to the duration of a month were also plotted above the derived lmwls for comparison fig s1 the lmwls recalculated by including data from these stations 3 4 had slopes and intercepts that were very similar to previous ones both for rma and pwlsr regression table s4 thus confirming their reliability in describing the isotopic composition of precipitation in the study area 3 lmwlpwlsr δ2h 7 22 0 07 δ18o 7 58 0 50 r2 0 95 n 612 4 lmwlrma δ2h 7 26 0 07 δ18o 7 23 0 44 r2 0 95 n 612 a weighted local meteoric water line wlmwl was also derived by using volume weighted annual isotopic means computing for years the data covering almost ten months at each site table s5 the wlmwl fig s2 calculated by applying the rma regression best fitting model along with pwrma table s4 was quite similar to lmwl with a slightly lower slope and intercept 5 5 wlmwlrma δ2h 6 99 0 24 δ18o 5 86 1 55 r2 0 96 n 42 the relationship between δ18o and δ2h of precipitation in the study area can also be distinguished seasonally fig s3 only unweighted regression models were tested of which rma was the most suitable in fitting precipitation data table s4 the slope and intercept of the seasonal local meteoric water lines mwls were between 7 08 and 7 90 and 5 32 and 12 1 respectively the values were higher in winter 7 90 0 15 and 12 1 1 10 and autumn 7 52 0 13 and 10 3 0 89 and lower in spring 7 08 0 14 and 5 34 0 91 and summer 7 15 0 16 and 5 32 0 82 4 2 seasonality of rainfall isotopic signature the stable isotopic precipitation signature in the study area exhibited a clear intra annual variability with higher values of δ18o and δ2h in summer and lower in winter figs 5 6 the differences among seasons were statistically significant p 0 05 except for δ2h between spring and autumn table s6 considering the mean values for the ensemble of pluviometer sites in each season the minimum δ18o and δ2h was recorded in winter 7 15 2 13 and 44 3 16 8 respectively the maximum in summer 4 72 2 16 and 28 4 15 4 respectively intermediate δ18o values of 6 00 1 90 and 6 60 1 83 and 37 1 13 4 and 39 3 13 8 for δ2h were calculated for spring and autumn respectively isotopic variability was generally wider in winter and summer while a narrower range of isotopic values was found in spring and autumn as also evidenced by the relative standard deviation the intra annual trend roughly follows the mean monthly air temperature trend figs 5 6 which shows higher values in summer 21 5 c 3 7 c and lower in winter 7 0 c 3 5 c the temperature differences among seasons were always statistically significant table s6 august was the warmest january the coldest month an opposite trend was shown by the monthly precipitation amount with the dry season occurring in summer in keeping with the climatic conditions of this sector of the mediterranean basin the most abundant precipitation was recorded in autumn and secondarily in winter the differences were statistically significant except for those between winter and spring the maximum rainfall amount was in november when precipitation showed slightly lower isotopic values and higher d excess than in the winter months fig 6 the minimum rain amount was in july d excess in precipitation follows an opposite trend with respect to the water isotope signatures and the differences among the four groups were always statistically significant the higher values were recorded in autumn and winter with a mean value of 13 5 3 2 and 12 9 3 8 respectively in spring and summer d excess was lower ranging from 10 9 3 9 and 9 3 4 4 respectively with a wider variability in the dry and hot summer season 4 3 spatial variability of rainfall isotopic composition the mean annual air temperature ranged from a minimum of 3 8 c in the p2 apennine site to a maximum of 18 0 c at p7 p11 p12 and p6 showed the lowest mean annual precipitation 529 mm 625 mm and 632 mm respectively whereas the p4 apuan alps site presented the highest mean annual precipitation 2302 mm followed by p2 p5 and p3 as expected rainfall was generally more abundant in the apuan alps and in the apennine sites compared with the low altitude stations overall the monthly mean precipitations were statistically different between the mountain and plain sites but not between nearby sites or at similar altitudes table s6 the monthly isotope values recorded at each sampling site are summarized in fig 7 in order to compare the monthly isotopic composition recorded at 9 selected sites with the isotopic values measured at p1 p8 and p10 all the data grouped for 12 stations were plotted in fig s4 overall the lowest isotope values were measured at the higher altitude stations p2 and p3 monthly mean δ18o of 7 52 1 80 and 8 01 2 23 respectively with p3 being slightly more negative although its altitude was 650 m lower than p2 however the δ18o and δ2h differences between p2 and p3 were not statistically significant table s6 p10 also showed low values with a mean δ18o of 7 52 1 48 which is equal to the mean value recorded at p2 placed at a similar altitude 1500 m a s l the isotope values at p2 p3 and p10 were statistically different from the other sites table s6 considering all the stations p1 showed the highest values mean of 5 17 1 32 followed by p7 which had the longest isotope series mean of 5 21 1 77 it is worth noting that the isotope signature of the apuan alps site p5 was very similar to that of the coastal site p11 mean of 5 70 and 5 67 respectively and p6 mean of 5 78 despite the higher altitude the isotopic differences among sites were not statistically significant in most cases except for p2 p3 and p10 which always differed from the other stations d excess had an opposite trend with respect to the stable isotopes the higher values were recorded at high altitude sites with p10 showing the highest mean value 16 0 3 8 followed by p2 and p3 monthly mean of 13 7 2 8 and 14 9 4 7 respectively whereas p7 p8 and p6 exhibited the lowest values 9 95 3 5 10 1 2 6 and 10 3 3 8 respectively the differences between these two groups of sites were statistically significant the other sites recorded very similar values means from 11 6 to 12 0 despite the different geographical location and altitude 5 discussion 5 1 isotopic rainfall composition in the western mediterranean and lmwls the yearly isotopic variability of tuscany rainfall was consistent with the mixed influence between atlantic and mediterranean moisture sources consistently with other results from the western mediterranean casellas et al 2019 celle jeanton et al 2001 cruz san et al 1992 dumitru et al 2017 stable isotopes exhibited a clear seasonal variability figs 5 and 6 which can be attributed at least partly to changes in temperature and in precipitation amount this variability can be explained by the two well known isotopic effects the temperature effect dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 which results in isotopically enriched rains during the warm season and isotopically depleted ones in the colder months the amount effect clark and fritz 1997 which implies depleted precipitation in heavy isotopes as the rainfall amount increases mean winter δ18o of 7 15 was consistent both with measured data at gnip mediterranean stations and with modelled echam5 wiso ones langebroek et al 2011 however a greater frequency variability is superimposed on the seasonal variability unlikely to be ascribable only to seasonal climatic variations this variability may be attributed to different moisture origins trajectories and rainout or to geographical factors such as latitude altitude and distance from the coast i e continentality effect dansgaard 1964 moreover input of continental moisture recycling can further alter the isotopic signature recorded in precipitation the wide variability of d excess recorded in tuscany is congruent with the one found for the entire italian peninsula from 1 to 22 giustini et al 2016 distribution of d excess values was quite symmetrical indicating a similar probability of obtaining higher or lower values than the mean value of 11 8 this suggested the influence of vapor coming from the moisture sources of both the atlantic and the mediterranean in generating the precipitations over tuscany it is worth mentioning that the secondary cyclogenesis over the gulf of genoa associated with the passage of major atlantic cyclones is often responsible for intense precipitation in this mediterranean area hence isotope and d excess values in precipitation may result from mixing the different air masses with local origin and advected from the atlantic however d excess variability should also be interpreted as the result of different processes occurring from the vapor source to the site of the rain event indeed the seasonal changes in d excess figs 5 and 6 could be controlled by three different factors acting individually or jointly i inter annual changes in sst and rh over the ocean surface which modify the evaporative conditions ii differentiated contribution of various moisture sources acting with variable intensity in different seasons iii more or less frequent secondary processes according to the season drier conditions are also responsible for high d excess in winter precipitation whereas lower values are recorded in the summer interestingly d excess values were generally higher in autumn october and november even when compared to winter ones when rh and sst at the moisture source should be lower similar patterns are reported in nearby areas facing the northern adriatic sea bronić et al 2020 masiol et al 2021 vreča et al 2006 2007 d excess 14 typical of the rainfall originated in the mediterranean casellas et al 2019 celle jeanton et al 2001 was frequently recorded in autumn 41 and secondarily in winter 30 and this could indicate the mediterranean sea as the major source of moisture in autumn precipitation over the study area this pattern is consistent with findings from mariotti et al 2002 of higher mediterranean evaporation rates from october to january and maximum evaporation rates in november this stronger evaporation could be linked to a larger thermal gradient between sea surface and atmosphere in this season as the sst of mediterranean sea is still high compared with air temperature pastor et al 2018 this gradient is lower in the north atlantic yielding a lower moisture uptake over this region than in the mediterranean one in addition to an nao regime not yet predominant luppichini et al 2021 these evidences are consistent with the results from gómez hernández et al 2013 who identified the western mediterranean sea as the main moisture source region for mediterranean areas during the wet season from october to march on the contrary batibeniz et al 2020 indicated a lower influence of the mediterranean than the atlantic sources 10 in all seasons whereas drumond et al 2011 found a predominant contribution from the mediterranean sea in the warm season high d excess values are less frequent in spring and summer whereas d excess 10 in summer precipitation can be attributed to more humid conditions at the moisture source which reduce the kinetic fractionation effects this could also evidence a lesser mediterranean contribution to total moisture in this season liotta et al 2008 however secondary evaporation of raindrops below the clouds in a warmer atmosphere can explain very low d excess values the mixed origin of moisture reaching the study area reflects the inadequacy of the gmwl to describe precipitation in the mediterranean basin two local meteoric water lines were calculated on 553 monthly isotope data using the rma unweighted method and the pwlsr weighted method fig 4 crawford et al 2014 although the lmwls differ only slightly they are suitable for different applications the lmwlpwlsr is more appropriate to represent hydrologically significant precipitation which is important for local hydrological applications especially when investigating the stable isotope signature of groundwater in relation to meteoric recharge on the contrary the unweighted lmwlrma is advisable when facing the atmospheric and hydrometeorological processes that govern the isotopic composition of precipitation considering the uncertainties given as standard error of the slope and intercept the obtained lmwls overlap with the central italy meteoric water line cimwl by longinelli and selmo 2003 δ2h 7 05 δ18o 5 61 and giustini et al 2016 δ2h 7 46 0 33 δ18o 8 29 2 33 the lmwls are also very close to the western mediterranean meteoric water line wmmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 13 7 calculated by celle jeanton 2000 who show a higher intercept than the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961b rozanski et al 1993 it is worth noting that these lines were obtained by using the olsr method which generally produces a lower slope and intercept than the other techniques crawford et al 2014 marchina et al 2020 however values of 7 09 0 07 and 6 13 0 46 for slope and intercept respectively achieved by applying the olsr method to our dataset agree with those found by these authors the lower slope and intercept compared to the gmwl suggest warmer and less humid climatic conditions and the possible partial evaporation of falling droplets gonfiantini 1986 congruently with the climatic conditions over the mediterranean basin the differences among seasonal mwls fig s3 may be attributed to several factors including the evaporative conditions and the sst at the moisture source but also the secondary processes along the trajectories affected by local variables such as surface air temperature rh and precipitation rate the changes in slope and intercept over the year are congruent with the general trend of air temperature and precipitation amount with smaller slope and intercept when local air temperature is higher and precipitation is lower thus the effects of sub cloud secondary evaporation leading to an isotope enrichment of raindrops appear to be more probable in the warm season as evidenced by lower summer d excess on the contrary winter and autumn intercept values over 10 indicate primary evaporation controlled by the near surface rh at the source whereas secondary processes associated with local effects and non equilibrium fractionation seem to be negligible 5 2 meteorological control on rainfall isotopic signatures and mediterranean influence in order to evaluate the influence of temperature and amount effects on the rainfall isotope signature δ18o δ2h and d excess values were plotted against monthly mean temperature and total monthly precipitation fig 8 spearman s rank correlation coefficients are provided in table 3 a moderate positive correlation was found between air temperature and δ18o precipitation signature in tuscany which were significant at 99 9 confidence level r 0 56 p 0 001 a similar correlation was identified between t and δ2h r 0 52 p 0 001 pearson s correlation coefficients were slightly higher than spearman s coefficients which indicated a linear relationship between isotope values and temperature as shown by r2 values of 0 34 and 0 29 for δ18o and δ2h respectively this suggests a moderate influence of the temperature effect on the rainfall isotope composition with a slope of 0 19 c and an intercept of 8 60 for δ18o slope is consistent with the value of ca 0 2 c calculated for iaea stations at pisa genoa and palermo bard et al 2002 both for observations and for modelled data similar values were also found in sw france zhang et al 2020 greece argiriou and lykoudis 2006 slovenia and croatia vreča et al 2006 casellas et al 2019 observed a moderate temperature effect r2 0 44 in ne spain by using weekly data although with a higher slope 0 4 c a moderate negative correlation significant at 99 9 was found between monthly precipitation amount and isotopic composition of precipitation r 0 51 p 0 001 for δ18o r 0 46 p 0 001 for δ2h indicating a monotonic relationship however the r2 values of 0 15 and 0 12 for δ18o and δ2h respectively fig 8 showed that the association with the precipitation amount can be better described as non linear pearson s correlation coefficients were lower than spearman s the logarithmic function represented a better fit on the data r2 of 0 41 and 0 40 for δ18o and δ2h respectively however a linear gradient of about 0 8 per 100 mm month was calculated for δ18o which was similar to that found in sw france 0 7 0 8 per 100 mm month zhang et al 2020 some previous works zanchetta et al 2014 2007 cited the value of about 2 per 100 mm month found by bard et al 2002 as a reference for the amount effect in the western mediterranean bard et al 2002 excluded some very rare months with rainfall amount 300 mm and included data from the palermo iaea station in addition to those of genoa and pisa we found a δ18o rainfall amount gradient of about 1 5 per 100 mm month when the samples with monthly precipitation 300 mm were excluded however by using the data made available by the pisa genoa and palermo stations we recalculated a gradient of 0 7 per 100 mm month including all the data and of 1 per 100 mm month excluding the months with precipitation 300 mm the slope values were also very similar when pisa and genoa were considered alone whereas we found a value of 4 4 per 100 mm month in palermo this evidences a possible overestimation of the gradient by bard et al 2002 on account of the large weight exerted by palermo therefore the value of 2 per 100 mm month should be used carefully very weak linear relationships between stable isotopes and precipitation amount were also evidenced in the eastern mediterranean argiriou and lykoudis 2006 with particular regard to winter precipitation correlations using volume weighted annual means were better for precipitation in tuscany table 3 with r2 up to 0 38 that indicated a weak linear relationship with a gradient of 0 09 per 100 mm year for δ18o fig 9 the linear relationship with air temperature was also stronger with r2 up to 0 49 fig 9 and slope of 0 18 c congruently with the value derived by using monthly data it is worth noting that weighted annual means were calculated only where the data covered an almost ten month period the dry months included these evidences indicate a moderate influence of the amount effect on precipitation which was more linear over yearly time than monthly time scales across the study area d excess showed a weak negative correlation with monthly air temperature r 0 36 p 0 001 and a weak positive correlation with monthly precipitation amount r 0 37 p 0 001 fig 8 the low r2 values suggested a weak linearity of the relationships correlations with rainfall amount were moderate when weighted volume annual means were used whereas no significant correlation was found with air temperature table 3 fig 9 this suggests a scarce influence of local meteorological conditions on rainfall d excess the results are consistent with the climatological significance of this parameter mostly depending on the meteorological conditions at the moisture source which means that precipitating air masses originated in different areas have well distinct d excess values overall temperature and amount effects contribute to generating only a part of the isotopic variability observed in our dataset especially over time scales longer than the monthly one e g yearly and temperature appears to be the prevailing meteorological factor however these two factors can explain only ca 50 of monthly isotopic variability therefore other processes must be taken into account such as the different origin of the air masses and trajectories as well as the continental latitude and altitude effects the weak linear relationship between monthly isotopic composition of precipitation and total monthly rainfall amount fig 8 is mainly attributable to the presence of a consistent group of monthly rains characterized by little depletion in heavy isotopes despite the large amounts of precipitation 300 mm month as mentioned above the slope of the δ18o rainfall amount relationship changed from 0 8 to 1 5 per 100 mm month when these samples were excluded and r2 also slightly increased from 0 15 to 0 21 argiriou and lykoudis 2006 also observed that precipitations over greece were depleted for rainfall amounts increasing up to 100 mm month while this effect did not appear for higher amounts a similar pattern was evidenced for single meteoric events sampled at avignon celle jeanton et al 2001 where the authors classified as mediterranean events large amounts of precipitation with less negative isotope signature indeed proximity to the mediterranean sea limits fractionation due to weak rainout and negligible continental effect conversely samples showing a more evident amount effect were classified as atlantic rains corresponding to longer travel distance and higher degree of rainout our data can suggest similar processes even if no quantitative evaluation of influence of two different moisture sources can be performed because of monthly sampling frequency data grouped on the d excess parameter fig 10 a indicate that 46 of samples higher than 300 mm month showed d excess 14 and the percentage increased to 73 when d excess 12 was considered these values were more frequently recorded in autumn about 50 than in other seasons high amounts of precipitation with d excess close to 15 were also observed at the gibraltar tunis and genoa stations cruz san et al 1992 supporting the hypothesis of a mediterranean origin for more abundant precipitations in the western mediterranean celle jeanton et al 2001 especially in autumn however some samples with high d excess were more depleted than would be expected from mediterranean vapor fig 10a in these cases more frequent in autumn and in winter fig s3 the high d excess could be associated with other processes such as continental moisture recycling or solid precipitation snow or hail jouzel and merlivat 1984 as a matter of fact the data grouped on different sampling sites fig 10b indicated that the most depleted isotope values which also had high d excess were mostly recorded at the high altitude stations p3 and p2 where snowfall can occur in late autumn and in winter the formation of orographic clouds in mountain sites can further increase the d excess in precipitation liotta et al 2006 see section 5 3 the binary diagram of fig 10b also highlighted that samples with precipitation amounts 300 mm were in northwestern tuscany p2 p4 p5 and just two samples at p7 especially those collected in the apuan alps and the apennine sites where plentiful precipitation can occur spearmańs rank correlation analysis between stable isotope signatures and temperature and precipitation amount was also performed for each season in order to understand whether the influence of meteorological variables on the isotopic composition of precipitation changed seasonally spearmańs correlation coefficients for each season are reported in table 4 the isotope signatures showed a moderate positive correlation statistically significant at 99 9 with monthly mean temperature during each season except for winter when it was weak the correlation was higher in autumn and in spring 0 56 and 0 55 for δ18o respectively and lower in other seasons especially in winter 0 37 and 0 33 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the relationship was weakly linear fig 11 better in spring and in autumn consistent with the correlation coefficients as shown by r2 values similarly we found a moderate negative correlation significant at 99 9 between the isotopic composition of precipitation and the monthly rainfall amount in spring and summer 0 57 and 0 53 for δ18o respectively whereas it was weak in winter and autumn 0 34 and 0 31 for δ18o respectively however the low linear regression coefficients r2 highlighted a very weak linear relationship between the isotope signature of rainwater and the precipitation amount in spring and summer fig 11 the data were instead strongly scattered in winter and autumn and no linear relationship was found therefore spring and summer appear to be the seasons most affected although rather weakly by the local meteorological conditions however air temperature also has a detectable effect on the isotopic composition of precipitation during autumn on the contrary the influence of the local meteorological conditions is very weak or negligible in winter during the more rainy seasons autumn and winter the isotopic composition of precipitation appears to be more controlled by large scale processes such as moisture origin and air mass trajectories rather than by local meteorological variables for instance in the autumn winter season the differentiated arrival of disturbances from the north atlantic and the mediterranean sea or of the moisture resulting from their mix could be the main causes of the changes in rainfall isotope signature in the study area conversely the amount effect appears to be more important when rainfall is generally lower spring and summer temperature is higher and the air is more humid under these conditions convection is more intense rain drops are larger and re evaporation is smaller dansgaard 1964 these results emphasize the need to better investigate the dependency of the rainfall isotopic composition on the meteorological variables in the mediterranean basin which has important implications for both local hydrogeological studies and palaeohydrological reconstructions 5 3 geographical control on stable isotopes and d excess in precipitation as mentioned above the data from the three sites p1 p8 and p10 were excluded from statistical correlation analysis but were taken into account to evaluate the influence of geographical variables on the isotopic composition of precipitation mean air temperature at the sampling sites showed a moderate negative correlation r 0 53 statistically significant at 99 9 p 0 001 with altitude fig 12 with a vertical gradient of 0 7 c 100 m conversely mean monthly precipitation exhibited a strong positive correlation r 0 74 p 0 001 with altitude both correlations were linear fig 12 even though linearity was lower for the relationship between rainfall amount and altitude owing to the large variability of rain amounts recorded at the apuan alps stations p4 and p5 this evidence is congruent with the meteo climatic regime of the apuan alps where precipitation can be very high and strongly variable on a yearly time scale giannecchini and d amato avanzi 2012 spatial variability of the isotopic rainfall signature fig 7 is mostly affected by the altitude effect as evidenced in fig 12 δ18o and δ2h weighted annual mean values showed a moderate to strong negative correlation with altitude 0 70 and 0 62 respectively which is statistically significant at 99 9 the relationship was linear fig 12 with a δ18o vertical gradient of 0 13 100 m lower than the overall mean value for central italy of 0 22 100 m reported by giustini et al 2016 the isotope signature of p3 the inner site of the study area slightly deviated from the linear correlation δ18o altitude it presented more depleted isotope values as a result of the higher degree of rainout of moist air masses coming from northwest and west this evidences a continental effect on rainfall isotope signature in tuscany rainfall d excess was similar in all tuscan sites except for the high altitude sites p2 p3 and p10 which showed significantly higher values fig s4 however p6 p7 and p8 exhibited d excess values slightly lower than those of p4 p5 p9 p11 and p12 even though the differences were often not statistically significant table s6 in addition to the above discussed differentiation of d excess caused by the different origin of the moisture a strong positive correlation r 0 77 p 0 001 was identified between the weighted annual mean d excess and altitude this apparent linear correlation fig 12 also found in other mediterranean areas cruz san et al 1992 liotta et al 2013 2006 vreča et al 2006 is probably due to the so called pseudo altitude effect moser and stichler 1974 this effect is linked to the evaporative enrichment of δ18o and δ2h in raindrops as they fall beneath the cloud base i e sub cloud evaporation which is greater at low altitudes on account of the greater distance between the average cloud base level and the sampling point such an effect explains the lower d excess of precipitation recorded at p6 p7 and p8 even if other coastal sites p11 and p12 showed comparable values with the mountain sites of the apuan alps p4 and p5 fig s4 in mountain environments higher d excess values may be also ascribable to the presence of orographic clouds liotta et al 2006 enriched in deuterium for kinetic condensation processes stewart 1975 some authors have also invoked the so called seeder feeder mechanism that occurs when small droplets falling from higher level clouds pass through the saturated air within the orographic cloud and increase their size liotta et al 2006 this process could explain the higher d excess recorded at the apennine sites p2 and p3 and p10 however as stated above the addition of re evaporated moisture from continental areas to water vapor most likely over mountain sites more distant from the coast or solid precipitation snow or hail can produce high d excess these evidences allowed us to concentrate on an important issue concerning the use of d excess for disentangling different moisture sources in precipitation reaching the study area in the event that d excess is only altered by evaporative enrichment in raindrops below the clouds the actual d excess bearing the imprint of the vapor source would be the one recorded at high altitude sites under these conditions the mediterranean contribution to total precipitation in this area of western mediterranean would become stronger conversely in the event that orographic clouds seeder feeder mechanisms or solid precipitation are responsible for the high d excess values recorded in mountain sites only low altitude sites should be used to this end in this case the contribution of mediterranean vapor should be downsized however the most probable hypothesis is that all these effects contribute to the observed seasonal fluctuations of d excess in tuscan precipitation the morphological complexity of the tuscan territory makes d excess interpretation even more difficult the study of isotopic composition of single meteoric events might be useful to better understand these processes especially if combined with a back trajectory analysis of precipitating air masses 6 conclusions the results presented in this work indicate that variations of δ18o and δ2h in precipitation are rather a regionally integrated signal of several climatic and geographical variables than a proxy for either local temperature or precipitation amount the morphological complexity of the territory of tuscany characterized by strong altitudinal gradients associated with well distinct climatic and weather conditions further complicates the interpretation of the isotopic signals recorded in precipitation and of the d excess signatures however despite these premises some important general conclusions can be drawn the isotopic variability in rainfall recorded over tuscany is largely ascribable to the differentiated contribution from atlantic and mediterranean moisture sources it and appears to be different depending on the season assuming the reliability of d excess to trace the mediterranean vapor the data presented here indicate a larger contribution of mediterranean sources in autumn especially during the months characterized by heavy precipitation the temperature and amount effects can explain about 50 of the isotopic variability and their effect is more noticeable over yearly time scales than monthly ones however the relationship between the rainfall isotopic composition and the precipitation amounts is weakly linear further investigations are therefore required to better understand the underlying mechanisms regulating this process understanding the degree of the amount effect in the mediterranean basin is essential to correctly interpret the isotope signature recorded in the paleoclimatic archives the meteorological effects appear to be stronger during the periods of low rainfall such as spring and summer on the contrary these local factors are less important in winter and autumn when the large scale synoptic processes moisture origin trajectories and rainout play a major role according to this scheme the isotopic differences between winter and autumn could be driven by the differentiated arrival of disturbances from the mediterranean or atlantic areas the altitude effect is the main driver of spatial variability of the isotope signatures the apparent correlation between d excess and altitude could be the result of different processes pseudo altitude effect resulting from sub cloud evaporation orographic clouds seeder feeder mechanism solid precipitation snow and or hail continental moisture recycling further investigations will be necessary to understand which process is decisive in generating the observed d excess values this would make it possible to identify the most suitable site for using the d excess parameter as tracer of mediterranean vapor which has direct implications to disentangle the different contribution of atlantic and mediterranean sources in precipitation over the western

4019,the ecohydrological and biochemical processes responsible for the globally significant stores of carbon in northern peatlands are largely controlled by the soil s hydrophysical properties in particular the relationship that soil water tension ψ has with soil water content θ and hydraulic conductivity k despite the importance little is known about how these relationships vary between species in different physiological sphagnum microforms such a hummock and hollow as well as with depth within a profile complicating matters is that laboratory experiments to determine these relationships are almost always completed with 5 cm high samples despite no real scientific evidence supporting this height to address these shortcomings we sampled 8 replicates samples moss surface to 15 cm depth each from a s magellanicum hollow and a s fuscum hummock we determined the k ψ and θ ψ relationships at various pressure heads 0 to 32 cm and then sub sectioned the 15 cm samples into 3x5 cm top middle bottom samples and repeated the tests there were important differences in both k ψ and θ ψ relationships between the top middle and bottom samples additionally comparison of the average of the 3x5 cm samples versus the 15 cm samples suggested that the 15 cm samples were not a good representation due to not being fully compatible with the methodology and that 3x5 cm samples were preferred using hydrus 1d to simulate a 30 day drought period with local hydroclimatological data we assessed whether the statistically significant differences were ecohydrologically significant when accounting for the different topographic niches of the two species the different moss species responded differently with s fuscum becoming more water stressed than s magellanicum yet s fuscum lost less water from soil water storage than s magellanicum this highlighted the critically important need to replicate the species niche in the landscape and not give two distinct species the same

as photosynthesis growth and reproduction hayward and clymo 1982 due to sphagnum s reliance on capillary water for growth and peat accumulation understanding the variability of soil hydraulic

other land use changes such as peatland drainage for agriculture sphagnum dominated peatland microforms are generally associated with specific sphagnum moss species and differences are driven in part by the growth and subsequent decomposition of the different sphagnum moss species hummock species e g s capillifolium s fuscum grow above the average water table atherton et al 2010 ayotte and rochefort 2020 and have a greater proportion of small pore spaces and greater hydrological connectivity due to a greater density of overlapping leaves and branches mccarter and price 2014 waddington et al 2010 this physical structure maintains upward water supply during periods of limited precipitation and increases evaporation as the pore network more effectively transfers water from the wetter peat below to the moss surface kettridge et al 2016 mccarter et al 2020 mccarter and price 2014 conversely hollow and pool species e g s cuspidatum grow closer to the water table and are often found between hummocks atherton et al 2010 ayotte and rochefort 2020 and are thought to have a lower kunsat due to a less dense pore network with fewer overlapping leaves and branches as water is readily

hummocks hollows and lawns and as such often have intermediate hydrophysical properties golubev and whittington 2018 gong et al 2020 mccarter and price 2014 complicating matters beyond physical morphological differences the age and stage of decomposition also increases with increased depth within the profile belyea and clymo 2001 boelter 1968 grover and baldock 2013 hogg 1993 and decomposition rates vary between moss species bengtsson et al 2018 2016 turetsky et al 2008 decomposition reduces the pore sizes as pores collapse and thereby increases water retention and kunsat mccarter et al 2020 these layers have different soil hydraulic properties and therefore it is important to also consider the vertical variability when working with sphagnum profiles kettridge et al 2016 terminology can complicate things too with watts et al in press noting the differences between sphagnum moss the upper few cm of living material sphagnum litter the slightly decomposed peat in the acrotelm more formally known as the oi fibric horizon and peat the more highly decomposed material typical of the catotlem after malmer and wallen 1993 we note that clymo 1983 calls anything that is not alive peat but given the enormous range in soil hydraulic properties from surface to several metres depth using the term litter can help the reader differentiate it from deeper peat in addition to the vertical variability horizontal e g species or microform differences are also important in a comparison between a lawn s fallax and intermediate s magellanicum species gong et al 2020 noted that spatial distribution and habitat of the two species microform was dependent on the hydrophysical properties and associated hydrological processes yet data on the spatial variability of hydrophysical properties between and within the litter of different microforms i e not living moss are rare in the literature liu and lennartz 2019 but has been shown to vary considerably over short distances baird et al 2016 balliston and price 2020 whittington and price 2006 the unsaturated parts of the k θ θ ψ and k ψ curves can be determined using the method of mccarter et al 2017 which is an updated version of the method developed by price et al 2008 since the original kunsat method was established price et al 2008 almost all studies using this method have selected a sample height of 5 cm and diameter of 10 2 cm which has become the de facto standard for kunsat measurements of moss litter materials despite no systematic evaluation of this de facto standard balliston and price 2020 elliott and price 2020 gauthier et al 2018 goetz and price 2015 golubev and whittington 2018 mccarter et al 2017 mccarter and price 2015 price and whittington 2010 taylor and price 2015 originally the sample diameter of 10 2 cm was chosen due to the increasing surface roughness of sphagnum moss as the area increases since both price et al 2008 and mccarter et al 2017 require a relatively smooth contact area for accurate measurements thus it remains impractical to measure larger diameters using this method like the sample diameter the 5 cm sample height was chosen for ease of sampling in the field price et al 2008 however there is no consensus on what sample height provides the most robust estimations of soil hydraulic properties at high close to 0 cm soil water pressures given the prevalence within the literature of using 5 cm sections for determining the soil hydraulic properties of sphagnum there remains no information on the extension of this method to larger samples e g 15 cm which may provide a better estimate of average fluxes rather than interpolating small layers into a larger profile in mineral soil science bouma 1980 and bathke and cassel 1991 argued that small samples break the pore continuity within the soil structure substantially influencing hydraulic conductivity particularly the ks therefore they argued a larger soil sample would give a better representation of a soil profile similarly beckwith et al 2003 proposed that due to the high heterogeneity of peat a large peat sample would include greater soil variability and thus be more representative whereas small samples might not adequately characterise hydraulic conductivity of a peat profile conversely the current literature on sphagnum soil hydraulic properties assumes that the high vertical variability is best characterized by a greater number of small samples to better highlight the changes in hydraulic conductivity with depth mccarter et al 2020 mccarter et al 2017 thus it is prudent to assess whether a larger vertical sphagnum sample or a series of smaller samples produce different soil hydraulic properties furthermore these sampling issues could be further compounded by variations between species microform and depth therefore the objectives of this research are to 1 compare the results obtained from using a single 15 cm sample to those from using 3x5 cm samples and to evaluate whether a larger sample may produce better estimates of a sphagnum profile 2 determine the soil hydraulic properties and asses their variability with depth for two different microform moss species s fuscum and s magellanicum and 3 assess how different sampling regimes affect the quality of the estimations of the ecohydrological role for both species it should be noted that a recent study by hassel et al 2018 showed that s magellanicum might not be present in canada and the species identified in this study might be s divinum or s medium instead of s magellanicum however the moss identification was completed in 2016 prior to hassel et al 2018 therefore following standard naming practices in ecology s magellanicum will be used in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling hummock and hollow sphagnum samples were collected from two different locations in bog peatlands near whitemouth manitoba canada the species from the hummock and hollow were identified as s fuscum fus and s magellanicum mag see note above respectively marie claire leblanc personal communication 2016 large monoliths 50 75 50 cm of the moss were first extracted using a hand saw 49 55 39 n 96 14 33 w for s fuscum 1 monolith and 49 47 07 n 95 57 49 w for s magellanicum 2 monoliths after the extraction the samples were placed into large plastic containers for transport to brandon university manitoba canada for the determination of their soil hydraulic properties the samples which were unsaturated during transport were then frozen to aid in sub sampling smaller sub samples were prepared from each moss monolith by cutting from the frozen monolith using a knife and scissors to create cylindrical shapes of 15 cm high and 10 2 cm in diameter using a cylindrical 4 10 2 cm pvc guide this two step sampling procedure minimized the potential for deformation as the frozen samples remained rigid and did not deform when sub sampling after sub sampling the samples were left to thaw before conducting hydraulic parameterization of the 15 cm samples each moss species had eight replicates of the 15 cm samples 16 samples total between the two species after hydraulic parameterization of the 15 cm samples was complete the samples were frozen unsaturated and sub sectioned into three 5 cm layers 0 5 cm or top 5 10 cm or middle and 10 15 cm or bottom and the hydraulic parameterization was repeated for each new 5 cm sample therefore each species had 8 top 8 middle and 8 bottom replicates for a total of 24 8 3 5 cm samples or 48 24 2 5 cm samples total between the two species note that the data from one quarter i e half of s magellanicum of the 5 cm samples presented in this paper are the same data found in golubev and whittington 2018 as the uncompressed values 2 2 soil hydraulic properties measurements unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat was measured following methods of mccarter et al 2017 however the system was modified to provide automated measurements of water discharge using a microcontroller and water sensors see golubev and whittington 2018 for further detail on the automated methodology briefly a moss sample was placed between two tension disks and encapsulated in a pvc tube the tension disks were set at the same pressure head ψ ψtop ψbottom so that there is no soil water pressure gradient across the samples that will bias the results c f mccarter et al 2017 the tension of the disks was maintained using a 25 µm nytex mesh the kunsat was tested in the range of ψ from 5 cm to 32 cm one half of the s magellanicum samples were tested at the pressure steps of 5 cm 10 cm 17 cm 24 cm and 32 cm due to originally being used for a different study see golubev and whittington 2018 however the other half of the s magellanicum samples and all s fuscum samples were tested at the pressure steps of 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm 25 cm and 32 cm the soil water pressure head ψ was adjusted by moving the sample up relative to the inflow and outflow flasks distilled water was used in the system in order to avoid deposition of minerals on the surface of the tension disks water was recirculated through a filter and the system was completely cleaned after each set of samples finished running from pressure steps of 5 cm to 32 cm additional distilled water was periodically added to the water reservoir as water slowly evaporated the tension disks were cleaned and rinsed at each ψ step when the sample was removed for mass measurements to later determine volumetric water content the height of each sample was measured at each pressure step and the height difference between the inflow and outflow flasks was adjusted to the value of the sample height if it changed water discharge from the outflow flask was automatically measured by a microcontroller with solenoid valves 5 5 cm3 in volume and water sensors two copper wires within each valve a solenoid valve was normally closed and accumulated discharged water from a sample while the microcontroller measured the time until the water level inside the valve reached the two sensor wires which triggered the microcontroller to log the time in a text file open the valve to dump water and reset the timer the water discharge rate was calculated by dividing the known volume unique to each valve and periodically verified of the valve by the time it took to fill it the water discharge measurements were finalised when the discharge curve became level over time little change compared to previous values bulk density was determined after the samples were oven dried for 24 h at 105 c porosity was calculated as 1 porosity 1 bulk density particle density where particle density was found using the kerosene and pycnometer method blake and hartge 1986 a 125 ml flask was used to mix approximately 4 g of dried moss mean 4 3 g with kerosene while stirring until air bubbles were removed from the mix particle density for s magellanicum and s fuscum was determined from one half of the samples with a total n 12 per species the other half of the s magellanicum and s fuscum samples were not used in the particle density analysis due to other destructive sampling performed during golubev and whittington 2018 on s magellanicum or measurement inconsistancies while learning the particle density pycnometer method with s fucsum samples the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks tests were conducted after the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat tests were complete a constant head permeameter was used to determine the water discharge rate q over three different hydraulic gradients where the pressure head difference ranged between 3 mm and 15 mm the ks values of moss samples were found as the slope of the line fitted to the function q i where q is the specific discharge and i is the hydraulic gradient with an intercept set to 0 2 3 hydrophysical parameterization the soil water retention and conductivity curves were parameterized in retc van genuchten et al 1998 by fitting the van genuchten mualem vgm equation to the collected data datasets were used as the input parameters for the vgm fitting routines resulting in three different sampling regimes for each species 15 cm 15 cm no 5 10 and 5 cm first all the measurements from the intact 15 cm samples were combined for a given species 15 cm n 8 species a second sampling regime was conducted from the intact 15 cm samples without ψ 5 and 10 cm tension measurements to remove the data that could be inaccurate due potential drainage of the samples when setting up the measurement apparatus at these two pressure steps 15 cm no 5 10 n 8 species the last sampling regime was derived from the 5 cm samples top middle bottom grouped by species and sample depth 5 cm n 8 depth species the vgm parameters were estimated using the partial least squares fitting routine in retc using all the measurements for a given sample set i e the total number of data points for the kunsat and θ values ranged between 56 and 96 thus the resultant parameters and measures of spread represent the average values for a given sample depth and species the measured arithmetic mean of the θs water content at saturation and geometric mean ks were inputted as fixed parameters whereas all the other water flow and retention parameters θr α n and l were fitted using retc partial least squares objective function to minimize errors in the estimation of the buridine maulem conductivity parameters ks values were log transformed in retc van genuchten et al 1998 a two way analysis of covariance ancova was used to test whether the differences between the linear relationships between log10 k and log10 θ of each layer 5 cm top middle bottom and intact 15 cm were statistically significant within the same species and between the two species in r statistical software version 4 1 0 r core team 2021 the dharma r package hartig 2021 was used to test and ensure the normality and heteroscedasticity of the ancova linear models four ancova models were prepared for analysis table si 2 two models all ψ and ψ 0 cm for 5 cm samples and two models all ψ and ψ 0 cm for intact 15 cm samples in each ancova model log10 θ was the independent variable log10 k was the dependent variable the covariate variables were moss species fus mag and layer depth top middle bottom table si 2 because there were separate models for 15 cm samples the terms layer was excluded from these models as there were no other layers except for 15 cm the r package emmeans lenth 2021 was used to run post hoc tests and produce p values of pair wise comparisons between the layers table si 3 the post hoc tests included p value adjustment using benjamini hochberg test benjamini and hochberg 1995 additional information on ancova models such as r2 f statistic degrees of freedom and significance of each term in linear models on the dependent variable is provided in table si 2 and table si 3 in the supplementary information 2 4 ecohydrological modelling to evaluate if the different sampling regimes 15 cm intact 15 cm no 5 10 and 3x5 cm affect the accuracy of the estimations of the ecohydrology for both moss species a hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2013 was used to simulate an extended period 30 days of no precipitation the model consisted of 100 evenly spaced nodes with a total model height of 15 cm and was parameterized by the average parameters determined from fitting the soil hydraulic parameters to the vgm parameters in retc see above for the 15 cm intact models there was one soil material while for the 3x5 cm there were three soil materials and each material was parameterized with the values determined for that given peat layer and species for each model the upper boundary was characterized by a total actual evaporative flux determined from measured actual evaporation from the peatlands where the samples were obtained with a total potential evaporative flux of 2 6 mm day 1 this daily rate linearly increased from hour 8 until a maximum at hour 13 0 3 mm hr 1 then remained relatively constant before exponentially decreasing from hour 15 until hour 20 of each day this pattern was repeated for each day over the entire simulation a decreasing water table 0 06 cm hr 1 was used as the bottom boundary pressure head following a measured water table decline at a nearby bog peatland during the same exceptionally dry period in july august 2019 unpublished data initial bottom boundary conditions were 27 7 cm and 52 7 cm for s magellanicum and s fuscum respectively and an initial soil water pressure distribution assumed a linear increase in soil water pressure from the bottom to top of the model domain the 25 cm offset between the initial bottom boundary conditions between species was to account for the difference in absolute height above the water table between hollows s magellanicum and hummocks s fuscum and were derived from systematic measurements of surface topography at the peatland brewer and whittington 2019 an absolute value of the minimum allowed pressure head at the soil surface hcrita of 400 cm was used following mccarter and price 2014 to simulate the mid point of pressures at which drainage of the hyaline cells occurs and actual evaporation is likely greatly reduced in sphagnum mosses 3 results bulk density increased and porosity decreased with depth for both moss species table 1 the bulk density of s magellanicum ranged from 0 018 to 0 037 g cm 3 mean 0 028 g cm 3 and for s fuscum ranged from 0 015 to 0 037 g cm 3 mean 0 026 g cm 3 particle density varied between 0 558 and 0 809 g cm 3 with mean values of 0 735 and 0 636 g cm 3 for s magellanicum and s fuscum respectively table 1 3 1 soil water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity the data obtained at ψ 17 and 24 cm were interpolated between the two neighbouring pressure heads to be regrouped to ψ 15 20 and 25 cm using linear weighted proportions for the θ and an exponential function for the kunsat this adjustment was necessary because half of the s magellanicum samples were tested at a few slightly different pressure heads than the other samples as explained above these interpolated data were only used for display purposes in figs 1 and 2 and were not used in any other data analyses or modelling regardless of moss species soil water retention increased with sample depth below surface fig 1 bottom orange middle green top blue in general the variability in volumetric water content for all samples decreased with decreasing pressure head particularly the rate of decrease was greater within the ψ range from 5 cm to 15 cm at ψ 5 cm the top layer of s fuscum filled blue retained at least 0 2 cm3 cm 3 less water than s fuscum s other layers and between pressure heads of ψ 10 to 32 cm water retention in s fuscum top was lower by 0 1 and 0 15 cm3 cm 3 fig 1 when comparing the 15 cm samples to the 3x5 cm samples regardless of moss species the mass of 15 cm samples at the end of kunsat tests at ψ 5 cm and ψ 10 cm was noticeably lower than the summed mass of their 5 cm layers data not shown which resulted in lower volumetric water content in 15 cm samples fig 1 grey the difference can be easily observed in s magellanicum samples at ψ 5 and 10 cm where the median volumetric water content of 15 cm samples was even lower than that in the top 5 cm layers fig 1 this indicated that there were possible methodological issues with the 15 cm samples when testing them at these two higher pressure heads ψ 5 and 10 cm a longer discussion on this issue is present at the start of the discussion but some results below are shown as no 5 10 that indicate both the ψ 5 and 10 cm data points were removed from the analysis the ks decreased with depth for both species fig 2 ψ 0 cm the median standard deviation ks for s magellanicum fig 2 open ranged from 1 06 0 93 cm s 1 bottom to 1 71 1 01 cm s 1 top while for s fuscum filled ranged from 1 93 0 65 cm s 1 bottom orange to 4 25 0 77 cm s 1 top blue the kunsat typically increased with depth top blue middle green bottom orange kunsat decreased several orders of magnitude from ψ 5 cm to ψ 32 cm fig 2 regardless of moss species similar to the soil water retention measurements the median kunsat of the s fuscum top layer fig 2 filled blue was noticeably lower than s fuscum s middle and bottom layers and the difference remained throughout all ψ 5 cm whereas the difference between median kunsat of s magellanicum top layer and its other layers decreased with decreasing ψ with overlapping kunsat ranges at ψ 25 cm which was not observed in s fuscum at ψ 32 cm the range of kunsat was the greatest for all layers and both moss species the kunsat of the intact 15 cm samples fig 2 grey followed the same pattern as those of individual 5 cm layers similar to the volumetric water content of the 15 cm samples fig 1 the median kunsat of 15 cm samples at ψ 5 and 10 cm was also lower than the 5 cm layers except for s fuscum at ψ 10 cm where it was similar to the kunsat of the top 5 cm samples the median standard deviation ks of the 15 cm samples ψ 0 cm were 3 21 1 66 cm s 1 and 2 22 1 78 cm s 1 for s fuscum and s magellanicum respectively the harmonic mean ks freeze and cherry 1979 of the 3x5 cm layers was 2 38 cm s 1 and 1 36 cm s 1 for s fuscum and s magellanicum respectively which is lower than the average ks of the intact 15 cm samples 3 21 and 2 22 cm s 1 respectively but the harmonic mean ks were still within one standard deviation of the average intact 15 cm ks 3 2 interspecific comparison in all samples hydraulic conductivity increased with increasing volumetric water content reaching the maximum hydraulic conductivity at saturation fig 3 a and 3c linear regression fitted to the k θ function was used to compare the hydrophysical relationship between moss species and profile layers the large difference between hydraulic conductivity at saturation θ θs and hydraulic conductivity at the next highest unsaturated volumetric water content artificially improved the regression analysis ignoring the larger data variability at the unsaturated volumetric water contents θ 1 cm 3 cm 3 indicated by higher r2 for data with saturation compared to much lower r2 for data without saturation see table si 1 therefore the analyses were repeated showing data without saturation fig 3b and 3d hence a focus on the unsaturated conditions which are more important for moss growth as these species are rarely saturated all linear regressions fig 3 were statistically significant p 0 0001 for all regressions except fus 15 cm no 5 10 at ψ 0 cm where p 0 08 table si 1 within a given species fus or mag there were no significantly different p 0 05 k θ relationships among all layers top vs middle vs bottom when considering both the all ψ and ψ 0 models table 2 when comparing between the two species there were significant differences p 0 05 at each equivalent sampling height i e top to top middle to middle and bottom to bottom for both the all ψ and ψ 0 cm models table 2 there was no statistical difference between fus and mag 15 cm samples in both the all ψ and ψ 0 cm models table 2 3 3 hydrophysical parameterization the alpha parameter α which is inversely related to the air entry pressure increased from the bottom to top layers for both species table 3 but increased 3x for s fuscum 0 503 to 1 476 cm 1 while only marginally for s magellanicum 0 506 to 0 805 cm 1 the average of the α for top middle and bottom of s fuscum 0 876 cm 1 and s magellanicum 0 638 cm 1 was within the standard error of the 15 cm no 5 10 s fuscum 0 800 cm 1 and s magellanicum 0 680 cm 1 table 3 as mentioned earlier parameterization based on 15 cm no 5 10 dataset herein no 5 10 omitting data at ψ 5 and ψ 10 cm was thought to better represent 15 cm samples as methodological issues were discovered at these particular pressure heads the n parameter which describes the pore size distribution remained similar among the layers and standard errors overlapped within and between species and sample sets table 3 in estimating the residual water content θr in retc the resultant values for all simulations were θr 0 0 the pore connectivity and tortuosity parameter l shown here was the last computed l parameter found during the retc parameter fitting the l parameter was nearly 0 throughout the samples except for the s magellanicum bottom layer thus no further statistics were available to report in this case 3 4 ecohydrological modelling the modelled soil water pressure distributions of s magellanicum did not substantially vary between the 3x5 1x15 and no 5 10 sample sets until the end of the simulation 30 day fig 4 red lines all pressure heads for s magellanicum regardless of model parameterization were within 20 cm of soil water pressure for a given time step and all under 5 cm when t 360 h when considering only the 3x5 the pressure barely exceeded 100 cm at the last time step 109 cm at 720 h suggesting that for this particular parameter set s magellanicum was never water limited i e ψ 100 cm in contrast s fuscum exceeded the 100 cm ψ threshold when hyaline cells begin to drain c f hayward and clymo 1983 by 144 h in the 3x5 and the entire profile in all modelling iterations exceeding 100 cm in the surface node by 360 h however the hcrita value of 400 cm was never exceeded along with larger difference in soil water pressure distributions there were much larger differences between the modelled s fuscum sample sets with the 1x15 having surficial capitula pressures 38 cm lower than the 3x5 and 52 cm lower than the no 5 10 fig 4 by 720 h the pressure heads in the modelling results presented here greatly exceed those measured experimentally however the vgm coupled with hydrus 1d has often been used in the literature to extrapolate the hydrological response in sphagnum moss litter and peat based on a shorter range of experimental pressure heads typically 0 cm to 30 cm gauthier et al 2018 golubev and whittington 2018 liu and lennartz 2019 mccarter and price 2014 the diurnal pressure head at the capitula as estimated by the average of the upper 1 cm of nodes nodes 1 3 varied considerably less within all the s magellanicum simulations red versus the s fuscum simulations black fig 5 the large 100 cm diurnal variability in s fuscum started within 24 h and remained similar throughout the rest of the simulation within the diurnal trends the simulated capitula soil water pressures in s magellanicum almost always returned to greater than 100 cm overnight tops of the diurnal trend for all three iterations it took until 351 h over 14 days for any pressures to go lower than 100 cm in the simulated s magellanicum capitula but only 13 h for the simulated s fuscum capitula noticeably the variability in the simulated soil water pressure heads in the s magellanicum simulations increased with time from 5 to 100 cm until it was more similar to that of s fuscum simulation by 720 h in none of the iterations or species did the pressure head hit 400 cm which is approximately the mid point for when hyaline cells drain lewis 1988 suggesting that there was not severe hydrological limit on these particular mosses under the modelled conditions despite the s fuscum models having lower soil water pressure heads the total water lost from soil storage was much greater in s magellanicum than s fuscum fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 sample size and sampling regime comparison when comparing the water retention data of a 15 cm sample to 3x5 cm samples there were large differences in volumetric water content the greatest deviations were observed at the ψ 5 cm and ψ 10 cm regardless of moss species fig 1 this was likely an artefact of the methodology and not an especial property of sphagnum moss or peat the laboratory setup to measure kunsat was designed so that there would be a single pressure head through the sample without a pressure head gradient mccarter et al 2017 when exposed to atmospheric pressure any sample height creates a pressure head gradient from top to bottom of the sample proportional to the height of the sample thus while setting up the 15 cm samples for kunsat tests the water would drain to average soil water pressures lower than both the ψ 5 cm and ψ 10 cm pressure steps as the sample height was greater than the tested pressures this was evident from the sample mass measurements and observed in the k ψ and θ ψ relationships where values at ψ 5 cm and ψ 10 cm for the 15 cm samples were well away from the expected relationship figs 1 and 2 as such removing the 5 and 10 cm pressure steps from already collected data would allow the 1 15 cm sample to give more reliable parameters hence all the parameterisation and modelling was repeated with 1x15 cm samples with data from ψ 5 cm and ψ 10 cm removed which was listed as 1x15 no 5 10 or simply no 5 10 the derived vgm parameters for each tested sampling set can give addition information about the suitability of the different tested methodologies there were markedly different α values table 3 between the 1x15 and no 5 10 for s fuscum 1 16 vs 0 8 cm 1 and to a lesser degree for s magellanicum 0 85 vs 0 68 cm 1 however the no 5 10 agreed well with the average of the 3x5 samples for both species suggesting a convergence of derived parameters the difference when excluding the ψ 5 cm and ψ 10 cm data clearly impacts the ecohydrological modelling as the 1x15 model regularly suggests much lower pressure heads throughout the profile than either the 3x5 and no 5 10 fig 4 while the difference between the 3x5 and no 5 10 were likely due to the sharp transition between model layers and the inherent graduation of parameters with depth based on both the physical measurements and the hydrological modelling results we suggest that a 15 cm sample is not suitable for measurements at ψ 5 cm and ψ 10 cm a 5 cm sample would theoretically be the tallest moss sample that could be tested correctly at ψ 5 cm and avoid impact of the pressure head gradient although a 15 cm sample could be correctly tested at ψ 15 cm and below this would result in losing 30 40 of ψ range e g not measuring at ψ 15 cm and ψ 0 cm providing less collected data and ultimately reducing the accuracy of modelling the soil hydraulic properties see figure si 1 black lines note the large difference in slopes at ψ 0 cm with the no 5 10 beyond average soil hydraulic properties the derived vgm parameters can have important implications on estimation of ecohydrology of sphagnum mosses dixon et al 2017 kettridge et al 2016 kettridge et al 2016 noted that the α parameter is correlated with moss productivity where higher α parameter and lower ksat suggest the sphagnum moss favours soil water retention while lower α parameter and higher ksat suggest an evolution to maximize productivity in surface litter that includes the capitula the capitula are the primary zone of biological processes in sphagnum mosses hayward and clymo 1983 unlike the 3x5 cm samples that provide depth dependent vgm parameters the 15 cm profiles were the average estimated parameters for the entire profile and indeed the average α parameter of the 3x5 cm samples agreed with the estimated value from the no 5 10 table 3 because the 15 cm profiles were an average of the entire profile the resultant α parameters were lower than that of the top samples of which a greater proportion is the capitula e g 1 cm capitula out of 5 cm vs 15 cm and are unlikely to adequately describe the more detailed ecohydrological processes described by kettridge et al 2016 the summation of these results suggests that the 3x5 sampling regime would more accurately represent the hydrology of sphagnum profiles than the 1x15 based on this understanding of decreasing sample height it would however be instructive to understand the relative role of the capitula layer in the upper 5 cm soil hydraulic properties potentially through sequential partitioning and the subsequent determination of soil hydraulic properties of each partitioned layer of the upper 5 cm layer of sphagnum moss given that both the soil hydraulic property data and the ecohydrological modelling suggest that the 3x5 cm sampling regime best represents the overall hydrological properties of the profile we will use these parameters and associated uncertainties in the following discussions 4 2 hydrophysical variability within and between moss species understanding the spatial and interspecific variability of sphagnum moss hydrophysical properties is critical to properly assessing the ecohydrological function of sphagnum dominated peatlands mccarter et al 2020 waddington et al 2015 mccarter and price 2014 suggested that it was the hydrological connectivity of the entire moss litter peat profile that governed the ability of a given sphagnum moss to supply water during periods of hydrological limitations s fuscum is a hummock species and is normally found higher above the water table than s magellanicum hence s fuscum s ability to supply more water in dry conditions should allow it to maintain the water demand of the growing capitula at the surface mccarter and price 2014 in this study there were clear differences at all sample depths in soil water retention fig 1 and hydraulic conductivity fig 2 these differences in soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity were maintained throughout the peat profile where s fuscum had higher kunsat under drier conditions θ 0 3 cm3 cm 3 however the upper 5 cm of s fuscum had consistently lower soil water content but equivalent kunsat than s magellanicum and the deeper s fuscum derived peats these results indicate that the specific pore network created by the overlapping leaves and branches between s fuscum and s magellanicum mosses might impact the evolution of soil hydraulic properties during initial decomposition processes thus understanding the variability below the capitula and upper few cm of sphagnum is important to properly assessing the ecohydrological processes that support sphagnum growth in contrast the upper 5 cm of s magellanicum was similar not statistically different table 2 to its middle layers suggesting that there was not much variation in soil hydraulic properties within the top 10 cm samples from s fuscum top were the only ones that had volumetric water content lower than 0 2 cm3 cm 3 and still were able to conduct water by maintaining an 15x higher kunsat under dry conditions than s magellanicum fig 3b these findings support that the structure of s fuscum moss has evolved to more efficiently conduct water to the surface to ensure sufficient water for biological processes an observation shared by mccarter and price 2014 coupled with the higher effective hydraulic connectivity under dry conditions expressed as higher kunsat at low θ than hollow species s fuscum is better equipped to supply water to the capitula than s magellanicum at all tested sample depths and therefore evolved to resist drought and is more suitable to grow in a drier environment laing et al 2014 mazziotta et al 2019 which is evident from its presence in hummocks the larger change in pore structure between the top and bottom for s fuscum mccarter and price 2014 results in a larger change in the derived α values with depth as s fuscum has denser leaves and branches than s magellanicum as depth and degree of decomposition increases the spaces between leaves would decrease increasing the water holding capacity hence smaller α numbers with depth table 3 for s magellanicum the decline with depth was less pronounced suggesting a smaller overall change in soil hydraulic properties potentially related to the closer proximity to the water table and associated higher soil water contents that lowers the effective stress on the pore network limiting pore collapse increased compression has been shown to increase kunsat an order of magnitude in moss gauthier et al 2018 golubev and whittington 2018 but integrating these into hydrus was well beyond the scope of the modelling presented here conversely when considering biochemical processes turetsky et al 2008 found that a lower landscape position was related to higher growth and higher decomposition due to a lower allocation of structural carbohydrates taken together the resulting pore structure in peat is likely controlled by ecohydrological processes that balances physical consolidation hydrological processes and ecological biochemical mechanisms in general the observed hydrophysical trends of s fuscum providing higher kunsat values at lower volumetric water contents θ 0 3 cm3 cm 3 than s magellanicum was not consistent with the observations between these two species in mccarter and price 2014 rather this trend was observed by mccarter and price 2014 between s fuscum and s rubellum figure si 2 and not s magellanicum when comparing the k θ relationships from mccarter and price 2014 it is clear that both s rubellum and s fuscum were similar while s magellanicum has a much shallower slope and higher intercepts figure si 2 in comparison the k θ relationships of both s magellanicum and s fuscum in this study were more similar fig 3 despite significant differences between the individual k θ relationships table 2 we hypothesise that this difference is due to the specific sampling location i e microforms between the two studies in this study s fuscum and s magellanicum formed a hummock hollow topography whereas for mccarter and price 2014 the hummock hollow topography was formed by s fucsum and s rubellum while s magellanicum was sampled as a small hummock from a much wetter sphagnum lawn surrounding a bog pool in both studies it is the hummock hollow pair that have more similar k θ relationships regardless of species this suggests that sphagnum species may not be a reliable indicator for hydrophysical properties rather we should focus on the sphagnum microform i e hummock hollow lawn pool when classifying hydrophysical properties of sphagnum moss peat and use species only as a secondary or tertiary descriptor such a shift in classification would better align with the broader peatland science community who often generalize the hydrology by depth to water table which is effectively hummock hollow topography andrus et al 1983 arsenault et al 2019 asemaninejad et al 2017 chaudhary et al 2018 johnson and damman 1991 moore et al 2019 moore and dalva 1993 pouliot et al 2012 rydin 1985 rydin and mcdonald 1985 schipperges and rydin 1998 however more detailed studies on the transferability and expandability of these results to the broader hydrophysical characterization of sphagnum mosses is needed we also note the much drier climate in manitoba where the samples were from versus quebec mccarter and price 2014 which may also play a role in the observed differences we note that direct comparisons between values of the two studies is not recommended as mccarter and price 2014 followed price et al 2008 and this study followed mccarter et al 2017 for determination of the hydrophysical properties this methodological difference results in a systematic difference in the measured data mccarter et al 2017 that simply comparing the values together may lead to erroneous conclusions thus we have limited this comparison to broad descriptions of the trends which are internally consistent within each study 4 3 ecohydrological implications mccarter and price 2014 observed that s magellanicum retained less water than s fuscum and s rubellum while having similar kunsat for a given pressure this resulted in s magellanicum having a different k θ relationship than s fuscum and s rubellum which were similar here s magellanicum retained more water than s fuscum the observed differences in hydrophysical properties observed between these two studies drove a difference in the modelling results between the sphagnum species mccarter and price 2014 assumed identical hydrological conditions between species and found that s magellanicum was under greater water limitations quicker and to a greater degree than s fuscum expectedly following the differences in soil hydraulic properties this was also observed here when s magellanicum had the same water table conditions imposed as experienced by s fuscum reaching below 250 cm pressure whereas s fuscum never exceeded this threshold figure si 3 while these artificial simulations are instructive they do not account for the landscape position of either species by using measured relative differences between the two species to set the water table and initial conditions we were able to capture the ecohydrological differences between the two species it is clear that the higher relative water table associated with s magellanicum reduced hydrological limitations at the capitula throughout the simulated drought period the higher moisture content in s magellanicum associated with higher soil water pressures increased the effective hydraulic conductivity allowing for the capitula soil water pressure to remain well above the upper threshold for hydrological limit in sphagnum moss under dry conditions conversely s fuscum was under greater hydrological limitation as defined by hyaline cell drainage 100 cm for the majority of the simulation fig 4 despite the capitula soil water pressure of s fuscum decreasing well below the hydrological threshold of 100 cm it would likely maintain its photosynthetic capabilities as s fuscum has been observed to be active during droughts and dry periods due to potentially lower optimal water contents where photosynthesis can continue to occur at lower water contents than hollow species bengtsson et al 2016 rydin 1993 in a comparison between capitulum water content as a driver for sphagnum species habitat between s magellanicum hummock and s fallax gong et al 2020 found that it was the hydrological processes and soil hydraulic properties that had the greatest impact on species distribution under various modelled scenarios the findings of gong et al 2020 agree with the findings of this study where the measured soil hydraulic properties regardless of the magnitude of differences between species can produce important ecohydrological difference despite differences in biological processes that may allow hummock species to be photosynthetically active at lower moisture contents bengtsson et al 2016 it is important to consider the water balance ins minus outs of the moss profile in the model to understand potential differences governing the hydrological processes between species any non zero difference in water balance must be met by a change in storage or in this case a cumulative loss of water from within the moss profile fig 6 loss shown as positive values here s fuscum lost only 5 0 mm whereas s magellanicum lost 10 6 mm at first this seems counter intuitive s magellanicum is losing more water internally despite greater access to the water table however because the pressures are higher in s magellanicum closer to zero generally over 100 cm the kunsat is higher allowing for more movement of water in s fuscum however less water is lost internally as the pressures and thus kunsat are lower limiting the water loss these results are consistent with mccarter and price 2014 as s fuscum was still better at transmitting water to the surface to keep the capitula healthy than s magellanicum that had a greater reliance on internal stores of water to supply the evaporative demand even when accounting for their specific ecohydrological niche 5 conclusions the hydrological parameterization of sphagnum mosses is critical to understanding the ecohydrological functionality and feedbacks within peatlands yet many measurement techniques remained untested in the broader literature here we show that the original 5 cm sample height which has become the de facto standard is in fact ideal when coupled with a maximum pressure head step of 5 cm although larger samples may increase the efficiency of these often time and personnel intensive measurements they come with their own considerations limitations in particular one cannot measure at pressure heads larger than the sample height in fact smaller samples e g surface to 2 cm depth at higher pressure heads e g 2 cm from the very surface of the peatland microform would better help characterise the profile for modelling ecohydrological processes despite there being clear differences in the soil hydraulic properties between the two different sphagnum species the need to consider the ecohydrological niche of the different sphagnum species is critical to properly understanding their function we show that when considering the ecohydrological niche of s fuscum and s magellanicum neither species reaches the critical soil water pressure threshold 400 cm imposed within this study rather the closer proximity of the water table for s magellanicum offsets its lower effective hydraulic conductivity than the hummock forming s fuscum which was able to effectively transmit water from the deeper water table to the capitula despite being drier as experimental apparatuses and techniques to measure the soil hydraulic properties of moss advance so too do the questions that can be asked moving beyond just obtaining a k θ relationship for a generic sphagnum moss we sought to understand and quantify the hydraulic differences at different depths within a moss profile and critically between moss species that occupy different ecohydrological niches concurrent with advances in laboratory parameterization numerical modelling has become significantly more sophisticated and computationally complex thus numerical modellers are able to use these species specific microform specific data to link sphagnum species net primary productivity with their ecohydrological functionality creating these ecohydrological linkages will strengthen our potential to understand the role of

4019,the ecohydrological and biochemical processes responsible for the globally significant stores of carbon in northern peatlands are largely controlled by the soil s hydrophysical properties in particular the relationship that soil water tension ψ has with soil water content θ and hydraulic conductivity k despite the importance little is known about how these relationships vary between species in different physiological sphagnum microforms such a hummock and hollow as well as with depth within a profile complicating matters is that laboratory experiments to determine these relationships are almost always completed with 5 cm high samples despite no real scientific evidence supporting this height to address these shortcomings we sampled 8 replicates samples moss surface to 15 cm depth each from a s magellanicum hollow and a s fuscum hummock we determined the k ψ and θ ψ relationships at various pressure heads 0 to 32 cm and then sub sectioned the 15 cm samples into 3x5 cm top middle bottom samples and repeated the tests there were important differences in both k ψ and θ ψ relationships between the top middle and bottom samples additionally comparison of the average of the 3x5 cm samples versus the 15 cm samples suggested that the 15 cm samples were not a good representation due to not being fully compatible with the methodology and that 3x5 cm samples were preferred using hydrus 1d to simulate a 30 day drought period with local hydroclimatological data we assessed whether the statistically significant differences were ecohydrologically significant when accounting for the different topographic niches of the two species the different moss species responded differently with s fuscum becoming more water stressed than s magellanicum yet s fuscum lost less water from soil water storage than s magellanicum this highlighted the critically important need to replicate the species niche in the landscape and not give two distinct species the same

between hummocks atherton et al 2010 ayotte and rochefort 2020 and are thought to have a lower kunsat due to a less dense pore network with fewer overlapping leaves and branches as water is readily available from the water table golubev and whittington 2018 mccarter et al 2020 mccarter and price 2014 intermediate species e g s magellanicum atherton et al 2010 occupy a broad niche growing in hummocks hollows and lawns and as such often have intermediate hydrophysical properties golubev and whittington 2018 gong et al 2020 mccarter and price 2014 complicating matters beyond physical morphological differences the age and stage of decomposition also increases with increased depth within the profile belyea and clymo 2001 boelter 1968 grover and baldock 2013 hogg 1993 and decomposition rates vary between moss species bengtsson et al 2018 2016 turetsky et al 2008 decomposition reduces the pore sizes as pores collapse and thereby increases water retention and kunsat mccarter et al 2020 these layers have different soil hydraulic properties and therefore it is important to also consider the vertical variability when working with sphagnum profiles kettridge et al 2016 terminology can complicate things too with watts et al in press noting the differences between sphagnum moss the upper few cm of living material sphagnum litter the slightly decomposed peat in the acrotelm more formally known as the oi fibric horizon and peat the more highly decomposed material typical of the catotlem after malmer and wallen 1993 we note that clymo 1983 calls anything that is not alive peat but given the enormous range in soil hydraulic properties from surface to several metres depth using the term litter can help the reader differentiate it from deeper peat in addition to the vertical variability horizontal e g species or microform differences are also important in a comparison between a lawn s fallax and intermediate s magellanicum species gong et al 2020 noted that spatial distribution and habitat of the two species microform was dependent on the hydrophysical properties and associated hydrological processes yet data on the spatial variability of hydrophysical properties between and within the litter of different microforms i e not living moss are rare in the literature liu and lennartz 2019 but has been shown to vary considerably over short distances baird et al 2016 balliston and price 2020 whittington and price 2006 the unsaturated parts of the k θ θ ψ and k ψ curves can be determined using the method of mccarter et al 2017 which is an updated version of the method developed by price et al 2008 since the original kunsat method was established price et al 2008 almost all studies using this method have selected a sample height of 5 cm and diameter of 10 2 cm which has become the de facto standard for kunsat measurements of moss litter materials despite no systematic evaluation of this de facto standard balliston and price 2020 elliott and price 2020 gauthier et al 2018 goetz and price 2015 golubev and whittington 2018 mccarter et al 2017 mccarter and price 2015 price and whittington 2010 taylor and price 2015 originally the sample diameter of 10 2 cm was chosen due to the increasing surface roughness of sphagnum moss as the area increases since both price et al 2008 and mccarter et al 2017 require a relatively smooth contact area for accurate measurements thus it remains impractical to measure larger diameters using this method like the sample diameter the 5 cm sample height was chosen for ease of sampling in the field price et al 2008 however there is no consensus on what sample height provides the most robust estimations of soil hydraulic properties at high close to 0 cm soil water pressures given the prevalence within the literature of using 5 cm sections for determining the soil hydraulic properties of sphagnum there remains no information on the extension of this method to larger samples e g 15 cm which may provide a better estimate of average fluxes rather than interpolating small layers into a larger profile in mineral soil science bouma 1980 and bathke and cassel 1991 argued that small samples break the pore continuity within the soil structure substantially influencing hydraulic conductivity particularly the ks therefore they argued a larger soil sample would give a better representation of a soil profile similarly beckwith et al 2003 proposed that due to the high heterogeneity of peat a large peat sample would include greater soil variability and thus be more representative whereas small samples might not adequately characterise hydraulic conductivity of a peat profile conversely the current literature on sphagnum soil hydraulic properties assumes that the high vertical variability is best characterized by a greater number of small samples to better highlight the changes in hydraulic conductivity with depth mccarter et al 2020 mccarter et al 2017 thus it is prudent to assess whether a larger vertical sphagnum sample or a series of smaller samples produce different soil hydraulic properties furthermore these sampling issues could be further compounded by variations between species microform and depth therefore the objectives of this research are to 1 compare the results obtained from using a single 15 cm sample to those from using 3x5 cm samples and to evaluate whether a larger sample may produce better estimates of a sphagnum profile 2 determine the soil hydraulic properties and asses their variability with depth for two different microform moss species s fuscum and s magellanicum and 3 assess how different sampling regimes affect the quality of the estimations of the ecohydrological role for both species it should be noted that a recent study by hassel et al 2018 showed that s magellanicum might not be present in canada and the species identified in this study might be s divinum or s medium instead of s magellanicum however the moss identification was completed in 2016 prior to hassel et al 2018 therefore following standard naming practices in ecology s magellanicum will be used in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling hummock and hollow sphagnum samples were collected from two different locations in bog peatlands near whitemouth manitoba canada the species from the hummock and hollow were identified as s fuscum fus and s magellanicum mag see note above respectively marie claire leblanc personal communication 2016 large monoliths 50 75 50 cm of the moss were first extracted using a hand saw 49 55 39 n 96 14 33 w for s fuscum 1 monolith and 49 47 07 n 95 57 49 w for s magellanicum 2 monoliths after the extraction the samples were placed into large plastic containers for transport to brandon university manitoba canada for the determination of their soil hydraulic properties the samples which were unsaturated during transport were then frozen to aid in sub sampling smaller sub samples were prepared from each moss monolith by cutting from the frozen monolith using a knife and scissors to create cylindrical shapes of 15 cm high and 10 2 cm in diameter using a cylindrical 4 10 2 cm pvc guide this two step sampling procedure minimized the potential for deformation as the frozen samples remained rigid and did not deform when sub sampling after sub sampling the samples were left to thaw before conducting hydraulic parameterization of the 15 cm samples each moss species had eight replicates of the 15 cm samples 16 samples total between the two species after hydraulic parameterization of the 15 cm samples was complete the samples were frozen unsaturated and sub sectioned into three 5 cm layers 0 5 cm or top 5 10 cm or middle and 10 15 cm or bottom and the hydraulic parameterization was repeated for each new 5 cm sample therefore each species had 8 top 8 middle and 8 bottom replicates for a total of 24 8 3 5 cm samples or 48 24 2 5 cm samples total between the two species note that the data from one quarter i e half of s magellanicum of the 5 cm samples presented in this paper are the same data found in golubev and whittington 2018 as the uncompressed values 2 2 soil hydraulic properties measurements unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat was measured following methods of mccarter et al 2017 however the system was modified to provide automated measurements of water discharge using a microcontroller and water sensors see golubev and whittington 2018 for further detail on the automated methodology briefly a moss sample was placed between two tension disks and encapsulated in a pvc tube the tension disks were set at the same pressure head ψ ψtop ψbottom so that there is no soil water pressure gradient across the samples that will bias the results c f mccarter et al 2017 the tension of the disks was maintained using a 25 µm nytex mesh the kunsat was tested in the range of ψ from 5 cm to 32 cm one half of the s magellanicum samples were tested at the pressure steps of 5 cm 10 cm 17 cm 24 cm and 32 cm due to originally being used for a different study see golubev and whittington 2018 however the other half of the s magellanicum samples and all s fuscum samples were tested at the pressure steps of 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm 25 cm and 32 cm the soil water pressure head ψ was adjusted by moving the sample up relative to the inflow and outflow flasks distilled water was used in the system in order to avoid deposition of minerals on the surface of the tension disks water was recirculated through a filter and the system was completely cleaned after each set of samples finished running from pressure steps of 5 cm to 32 cm additional distilled water was periodically added to the water reservoir as water slowly evaporated the tension disks were cleaned and rinsed at each ψ step when the sample was removed for mass measurements to later determine volumetric water content the height of each sample was measured at each pressure step and the height difference between the inflow and outflow flasks was adjusted to the value of the sample height if it changed water discharge from the outflow flask was automatically measured by a microcontroller with solenoid valves 5 5 cm3 in volume and water sensors two copper wires within each valve a solenoid valve was normally closed and accumulated discharged water from a sample while the microcontroller measured the time until the water level inside the valve reached the two sensor wires which triggered the microcontroller to log the time in a text file open the valve to dump water and reset the timer the water discharge rate was calculated by dividing the known volume unique to each valve and periodically verified of the valve by the time it took to fill it the water discharge measurements were finalised when the discharge curve became level over time little change compared to previous values bulk density was determined after the samples were oven dried for 24 h at 105 c porosity was calculated as 1 porosity 1 bulk density particle density where particle density was found using the kerosene and pycnometer method blake and hartge 1986 a 125 ml flask was used to mix approximately 4 g of dried moss mean 4 3 g with kerosene while stirring until air bubbles were removed from the mix particle density for s magellanicum and s fuscum was determined from one half of the samples with a total n 12 per species the other half of the s magellanicum and s fuscum samples were not used in the particle density analysis due to other destructive sampling performed during golubev and whittington 2018 on s magellanicum or measurement inconsistancies while learning the particle density pycnometer method with s fucsum samples the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks tests were conducted after the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat tests were complete a constant head permeameter was used to determine the water discharge rate q over three different hydraulic gradients where the pressure head difference ranged between 3 mm and 15 mm the ks values of moss samples were found as the slope of the line fitted to the function q i where q is the specific discharge and i is the hydraulic gradient with an intercept set to 0 2 3 hydrophysical parameterization the soil water retention and conductivity curves were parameterized in retc van genuchten et al 1998 by fitting the van genuchten mualem vgm equation to the collected data datasets were used as the input parameters for the vgm fitting routines resulting in three different sampling regimes for each species 15 cm 15 cm no 5 10 and 5 cm first all the measurements from the intact 15 cm samples were combined for a given species 15 cm n 8 species a second sampling regime was conducted from the intact 15 cm samples without ψ 5 and 10 cm tension measurements to remove the data that could be inaccurate due potential drainage of the samples when setting up the measurement apparatus at these two pressure steps 15 cm no 5 10 n 8 species the last sampling regime was derived from the 5 cm samples top middle bottom grouped by species and sample depth 5 cm n 8 depth species the vgm parameters were estimated using the partial least squares fitting routine in retc using all the measurements for a given sample set i e the total number of data points for the kunsat and θ values ranged between 56 and 96 thus the resultant parameters and measures of spread represent the average values for a given sample depth and species the measured arithmetic mean of the θs water content at saturation and geometric mean ks were inputted as fixed parameters whereas all the other water flow and retention parameters θr α n and l were fitted using retc partial least squares objective function to minimize errors in the estimation of the buridine maulem conductivity parameters ks values were log transformed in retc van genuchten et al 1998 a two way analysis of covariance ancova was used to test whether the differences between the linear relationships between log10 k and log10 θ of each layer 5 cm top middle bottom and intact 15 cm were statistically significant within the same species and between the two species in r statistical software version 4 1 0 r core team 2021 the dharma r package hartig 2021 was used to test and ensure the normality and heteroscedasticity of the ancova linear models four ancova models were prepared for analysis table si 2 two models all ψ and ψ 0 cm for 5 cm samples and two models all ψ and ψ 0 cm for intact 15 cm samples in each ancova model log10 θ was the independent variable log10 k was the dependent variable the covariate variables were moss species fus mag and layer depth top middle bottom table si 2 because there were separate models for 15 cm samples the terms layer was excluded from these models as there were no other layers except for 15 cm the r package emmeans lenth 2021 was used to run post hoc tests and produce p values of pair wise comparisons between the layers table si 3 the post hoc tests included p value adjustment using benjamini hochberg test benjamini and hochberg 1995 additional information on ancova models such as r2 f statistic degrees of freedom and significance of each term in linear models on the dependent variable is provided in table si 2 and table si 3 in the supplementary information 2 4 ecohydrological modelling to evaluate if the different sampling regimes 15 cm intact 15 cm no 5 10 and 3x5 cm affect the accuracy of the estimations of the ecohydrology for both moss species a hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2013 was used to simulate an extended period 30 days of no precipitation the model consisted of 100 evenly spaced nodes with a total model height of 15 cm and was parameterized by the average parameters determined from fitting the soil hydraulic parameters to the vgm parameters in retc see above for the 15 cm intact models there was one soil material while for the 3x5 cm there were three soil materials and each material was parameterized with the values determined for that given peat layer and species for each model the upper boundary was characterized by a total actual evaporative flux determined from measured actual evaporation from the peatlands where the samples were obtained with a total potential evaporative flux of 2 6 mm day 1 this daily rate linearly increased from hour 8 until a maximum at hour 13 0 3 mm hr 1 then remained relatively constant before exponentially decreasing from hour 15 until hour 20 of each day this pattern was repeated for each day over the entire simulation a decreasing water table 0 06 cm hr 1 was used as the bottom boundary pressure head following a measured water table decline at a nearby bog peatland during the same exceptionally dry period in july august 2019 unpublished data initial bottom boundary conditions were 27 7 cm and 52 7 cm for s magellanicum and s fuscum respectively and an initial soil water pressure distribution assumed a linear increase in soil water pressure from the bottom to top of the model domain the 25 cm offset between the initial bottom boundary conditions between species was to account for the difference in absolute height above the water table between hollows s magellanicum and hummocks s fuscum and were derived from systematic measurements of surface topography at the peatland brewer and whittington 2019 an absolute value of the minimum allowed pressure head at the soil surface hcrita of 400 cm was used following mccarter and price 2014 to simulate the mid point of pressures at which drainage of the hyaline cells occurs and actual evaporation is likely greatly reduced in sphagnum mosses 3 results bulk density increased and porosity decreased with depth for both moss species table 1 the bulk density of s magellanicum ranged from 0 018 to 0 037 g cm 3 mean 0 028 g cm 3 and for s fuscum ranged from 0 015 to 0 037 g cm 3 mean 0 026 g cm 3 particle density varied between 0 558 and 0 809 g cm 3 with mean values of 0 735 and 0 636 g cm 3 for s magellanicum and s fuscum respectively table 1 3 1 soil water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity the data obtained at ψ 17 and 24 cm were interpolated between the two neighbouring pressure heads to be regrouped to ψ 15 20 and 25 cm using linear weighted proportions for the θ and an exponential function for the kunsat this adjustment was necessary because half of the s magellanicum samples were tested at a few slightly different pressure heads than the other samples as explained above these interpolated data were only used for display purposes in figs 1 and 2 and were not used in any other data analyses or modelling regardless of moss species soil water retention increased with sample depth below surface fig 1 bottom orange middle green top blue in general the variability in volumetric water content for all samples decreased with decreasing pressure head particularly the rate of decrease was greater within the ψ range from 5 cm to 15 cm at ψ 5 cm the top layer of s fuscum filled blue retained at least 0 2 cm3 cm 3 less water than s fuscum s other layers and between pressure heads of ψ 10 to 32 cm water retention in s fuscum top was lower by 0 1 and 0 15 cm3 cm 3 fig 1 when comparing the 15 cm samples to the 3x5 cm samples regardless of moss species the mass of 15 cm samples at the end of kunsat tests at ψ 5 cm and ψ 10 cm was noticeably lower than the summed mass of their 5 cm layers data not shown which resulted in lower volumetric water content in 15 cm samples fig 1 grey the difference can be easily observed in s magellanicum samples at ψ 5 and 10 cm where the median volumetric water content of 15 cm samples was even lower than that in the top 5 cm layers fig 1 this indicated that there were possible methodological issues with the 15 cm samples when testing them at these two higher pressure heads ψ 5 and 10 cm a longer discussion on this issue is present at the start of the discussion but some results below are shown as no 5 10 that indicate both the ψ 5 and 10 cm data points were removed from the analysis the ks decreased with depth for both species fig 2 ψ 0 cm the median standard deviation ks for s magellanicum fig 2 open ranged from 1 06 0 93 cm s 1 bottom to 1 71 1 01 cm s 1 top while for s fuscum filled ranged from 1 93 0 65 cm s 1 bottom orange to 4 25 0 77 cm s 1 top blue the kunsat typically increased with depth top blue middle green bottom orange kunsat decreased several orders of magnitude from ψ 5 cm to ψ 32 cm fig 2 regardless of moss species similar to the soil water retention measurements the median kunsat of the s fuscum top layer fig 2 filled blue was noticeably lower than s fuscum s middle and bottom layers and the difference remained throughout all ψ 5 cm whereas the difference between median kunsat of s magellanicum top layer and its other layers decreased with decreasing ψ with overlapping kunsat ranges at ψ 25 cm which was not observed in s fuscum at ψ 32 cm the range of kunsat was the greatest for all layers and both moss species the kunsat of the intact 15 cm samples fig 2 grey followed the same pattern as those of individual 5 cm layers similar to the volumetric water content of the 15 cm samples fig 1 the median kunsat of 15 cm samples at ψ 5 and 10 cm was also lower than the 5 cm layers except for s fuscum at ψ 10 cm where it was similar to the kunsat of the top 5 cm samples the median standard deviation ks of the 15 cm samples ψ 0 cm were 3 21 1 66 cm s 1 and 2 22 1 78 cm s 1 for s fuscum and s magellanicum respectively the harmonic mean ks freeze and cherry 1979 of the 3x5 cm layers was 2 38 cm s 1 and 1 36 cm s 1 for s fuscum and s magellanicum respectively which is lower than the average ks of the intact 15 cm samples 3 21 and 2 22 cm s 1 respectively but the harmonic mean ks were still within one standard deviation of the average intact 15 cm ks 3 2 interspecific comparison in all samples hydraulic conductivity increased with increasing volumetric water content reaching the maximum hydraulic conductivity at saturation fig 3 a and 3c linear regression fitted to the k θ function was used to compare the hydrophysical relationship between moss species and profile layers the large difference between hydraulic conductivity at saturation θ θs and hydraulic conductivity at the next highest unsaturated volumetric water content artificially improved the regression analysis ignoring the larger data variability at the unsaturated volumetric water contents θ 1 cm 3 cm 3 indicated by higher r2 for data with saturation compared to much lower r2 for data without saturation see table si 1 therefore the analyses were repeated showing data without saturation fig 3b and 3d hence a focus on the unsaturated conditions which are more important for moss growth as these species are rarely saturated all linear regressions fig 3 were statistically significant p 0 0001 for all regressions except fus 15 cm no 5 10 at ψ 0 cm where p 0 08 table si 1 within a given species fus or mag there were no significantly different p 0 05 k θ relationships among all layers top vs middle vs bottom when considering both the all ψ and ψ 0 models table 2 when comparing between the two species there were significant differences p 0 05 at each equivalent sampling height i e top to top middle to middle and bottom to bottom for both the all ψ and ψ 0 cm models table 2 there was no statistical difference between fus and mag 15 cm samples in both the all ψ and ψ 0 cm models table 2 3 3 hydrophysical parameterization the alpha parameter α which is inversely related to the air entry pressure increased from the bottom to top layers for both species table 3 but increased 3x for s fuscum 0 503 to 1 476 cm 1 while only marginally for s magellanicum 0 506 to 0 805 cm 1 the average of the α for top middle and bottom of s fuscum 0 876 cm 1 and s magellanicum 0 638 cm 1 was within the standard error of the 15 cm no 5 10 s fuscum 0 800 cm 1 and s magellanicum 0 680 cm 1 table 3 as mentioned earlier parameterization based on 15 cm no 5 10 dataset herein no 5 10 omitting data at ψ 5 and ψ 10 cm was thought to better represent 15 cm samples as methodological issues were discovered at these particular pressure heads the n parameter which describes the pore size distribution remained similar among the layers and standard errors overlapped within and between species and sample sets table 3 in estimating the residual water content θr in retc the resultant values for all simulations were θr 0 0 the pore connectivity and tortuosity parameter l shown here was the last computed l parameter found during the retc parameter fitting the l parameter was nearly 0 throughout the samples except for the s magellanicum bottom layer thus no further statistics were available to report in this case 3 4 ecohydrological modelling the modelled soil water pressure distributions of s magellanicum did not substantially vary between the 3x5 1x15 and no 5 10 sample sets until the end of the simulation 30 day fig 4 red lines all pressure heads for s magellanicum regardless of model parameterization were within 20 cm of soil water pressure for a given time step and all under 5 cm when t 360 h when considering only the 3x5 the pressure barely exceeded 100 cm at the last time step 109 cm at 720 h suggesting that for this particular parameter set s magellanicum was never water limited i e ψ 100 cm in contrast s fuscum exceeded the 100 cm ψ threshold when hyaline cells begin to drain c f hayward and clymo 1983 by 144 h in the 3x5 and the entire profile in all modelling iterations exceeding 100 cm in the surface node by 360 h however the hcrita value of 400 cm was never exceeded along with larger difference in soil water pressure distributions there were much larger differences between the modelled s fuscum sample sets with the 1x15 having surficial capitula pressures 38 cm lower than the 3x5 and 52 cm lower than the no 5 10 fig 4 by 720 h the pressure heads in the modelling results presented here greatly exceed those measured experimentally however the vgm coupled with hydrus 1d has often been used in the literature to extrapolate the hydrological response in sphagnum moss litter and peat based on a shorter range of experimental pressure heads typically 0 cm to 30 cm gauthier et al 2018 golubev and whittington 2018 liu and lennartz 2019 mccarter and price 2014 the diurnal pressure head at the capitula as estimated by the average of the upper 1 cm of nodes nodes 1 3 varied considerably less within all the s magellanicum simulations red versus the s fuscum simulations black fig 5 the large 100 cm diurnal variability in s fuscum started within 24 h and remained similar throughout the rest of the simulation within the diurnal trends the simulated capitula soil water pressures in s magellanicum almost always returned to greater than 100 cm overnight tops of the diurnal trend for all three iterations it took until 351 h over 14 days for any pressures to go lower than 100 cm in the simulated s magellanicum capitula but only 13 h for the simulated s fuscum capitula noticeably the variability in the simulated soil water pressure heads in the s magellanicum simulations increased with time from 5 to 100 cm until it was more similar to that of s fuscum simulation by 720 h in none of the iterations or species did the pressure head hit 400 cm which is approximately the mid point for when hyaline cells drain lewis 1988 suggesting that there was not severe hydrological limit on these particular mosses under the modelled conditions despite the s fuscum models having lower soil water pressure heads the total water lost from soil storage was much greater in s magellanicum than s fuscum fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 sample size and sampling regime comparison when comparing the water retention data of a 15 cm sample to 3x5 cm samples there were large differences in volumetric water content the greatest deviations were observed at the ψ 5 cm and ψ 10 cm regardless of moss species fig 1 this was likely an artefact of the methodology and not an especial property of sphagnum moss or peat the laboratory setup to measure kunsat was designed so that there would be a single pressure head through the sample without a pressure head gradient mccarter et al 2017 when exposed to atmospheric pressure any sample height creates a pressure head gradient from top to bottom of the sample proportional to the height of the sample thus while setting up the 15 cm samples for kunsat tests the water would drain to average soil water pressures lower than both the ψ 5 cm and ψ 10 cm pressure steps as the sample height was greater than the tested pressures this was evident from the sample mass measurements and observed in the k ψ and θ ψ relationships where values at ψ 5 cm and ψ 10 cm for the 15 cm samples were well away from the expected relationship figs 1 and 2 as such removing the 5 and 10 cm pressure steps from already collected data would allow the 1 15 cm sample to give more reliable parameters hence all the parameterisation and modelling was repeated with 1x15 cm samples with data from ψ 5 cm and ψ 10 cm removed which was listed as 1x15 no 5 10 or simply no 5 10 the derived vgm parameters for each tested sampling set can give addition information about the suitability of the different tested methodologies there were markedly different α values table 3 between the 1x15 and no 5 10 for s fuscum 1 16 vs 0 8 cm 1 and to a lesser degree for s magellanicum 0 85 vs 0 68 cm 1 however the no 5 10 agreed well with the average of the 3x5 samples for both species suggesting a convergence of derived parameters the difference when excluding the ψ 5 cm and ψ 10 cm data clearly impacts the ecohydrological modelling as the 1x15 model regularly suggests much lower pressure heads throughout the profile than either the 3x5 and no 5 10 fig 4 while the difference between the 3x5 and no 5 10 were likely due to the sharp transition between model layers and the inherent graduation of parameters with depth based on both the physical measurements and the hydrological modelling results we suggest that a 15 cm sample is not suitable for measurements at ψ 5 cm and ψ 10 cm a 5 cm sample would theoretically be the tallest moss sample that could be tested correctly at ψ 5 cm and avoid impact of the pressure head gradient although a 15 cm sample could be correctly tested at ψ 15 cm and below this would result in losing 30 40 of ψ range e g not measuring at ψ 15 cm and ψ 0 cm providing less collected data and ultimately reducing the accuracy of modelling the soil hydraulic properties see figure si 1 black lines note the large difference in slopes at ψ 0 cm with the no 5 10 beyond average soil hydraulic properties the derived vgm parameters can have important implications on estimation of ecohydrology of sphagnum mosses dixon et al 2017 kettridge et al 2016 kettridge et al 2016 noted that the α parameter is correlated with moss productivity where higher α parameter and lower ksat suggest the sphagnum moss favours soil water retention while lower α parameter and higher ksat suggest an evolution to maximize productivity in surface litter that includes the capitula the capitula are the primary zone of biological processes in sphagnum mosses hayward and clymo 1983 unlike the 3x5 cm samples that provide depth dependent vgm parameters the 15 cm profiles were the average estimated parameters for the entire profile and indeed the average α parameter of the 3x5 cm samples agreed with the estimated value from the no 5 10 table 3 because the 15 cm profiles were an average of the entire profile the resultant α parameters were lower than that of the top samples of which a greater proportion is the capitula e g 1 cm capitula out of 5 cm vs 15 cm and are unlikely to adequately describe the more detailed ecohydrological processes described by kettridge et al 2016 the summation of these results suggests that the 3x5 sampling regime would more accurately represent the hydrology of sphagnum profiles than the 1x15 based on this understanding of decreasing sample height it would however be instructive to understand the relative role of the capitula layer in the upper 5 cm soil hydraulic properties potentially through sequential partitioning and the subsequent determination of soil hydraulic properties of each partitioned layer of the upper 5 cm layer of sphagnum moss given that both the soil hydraulic property data and the ecohydrological modelling suggest that the 3x5 cm sampling regime best represents the overall hydrological properties of the profile we will use these parameters and associated uncertainties in the following discussions 4 2 hydrophysical variability within and between moss species understanding the spatial and interspecific variability of sphagnum moss hydrophysical properties is critical to properly assessing the ecohydrological function of sphagnum dominated peatlands mccarter et al 2020 waddington et al 2015 mccarter and price 2014 suggested that it was the hydrological connectivity of the entire moss litter peat profile that governed the ability of a given sphagnum moss to supply water during periods of hydrological limitations s fuscum is a hummock species and is normally found higher above the water table than s magellanicum hence s fuscum s ability to supply more water in dry conditions should allow it to maintain the water demand of the growing capitula at the surface mccarter and price 2014 in this study there were clear differences at all sample depths in soil water retention fig 1 and hydraulic conductivity fig 2 these differences in soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity were maintained throughout the peat profile where s fuscum had higher kunsat under drier conditions θ 0 3 cm3 cm 3 however the upper 5 cm of s fuscum had consistently lower soil water content but equivalent kunsat than s magellanicum and the deeper s fuscum derived peats these results indicate that the specific pore network created by the overlapping leaves and branches between s fuscum and s magellanicum mosses might impact the evolution of soil hydraulic properties during initial decomposition processes thus understanding the variability below the capitula and upper few cm of sphagnum is important to properly assessing the ecohydrological processes that support sphagnum growth in contrast the upper 5 cm of s magellanicum was similar not statistically different table 2 to its middle layers suggesting that there was not much variation in soil hydraulic properties within the top 10 cm samples from s fuscum top were the only ones that had volumetric water content lower than 0 2 cm3 cm 3 and still were able to conduct water by maintaining an 15x higher kunsat under dry conditions than s magellanicum fig 3b these findings support that the structure of s fuscum moss has evolved to more efficiently conduct water to the surface to ensure sufficient water for biological processes an observation shared by mccarter and price 2014 coupled with the higher effective hydraulic connectivity under dry conditions expressed as higher kunsat at low θ than hollow species s fuscum is better equipped to supply water to the capitula than s magellanicum at all tested sample depths and therefore evolved to resist drought and is more suitable to grow in a drier environment laing et al 2014 mazziotta et al 2019 which is evident from its presence in hummocks the larger change in pore structure between the top and bottom for s fuscum mccarter and price 2014 results in a larger change in the derived α values with depth as s fuscum has denser leaves and branches than s magellanicum as depth and degree of decomposition increases the spaces between leaves would decrease increasing the water holding capacity hence smaller α numbers with depth table 3 for s magellanicum the decline with depth was less pronounced suggesting a smaller overall change in soil hydraulic properties potentially related to the closer proximity to the water table and associated higher soil water contents that lowers the effective stress on the pore network limiting pore collapse increased compression has been shown to increase kunsat an order of magnitude in moss gauthier et al 2018 golubev and whittington 2018 but integrating these into hydrus was well beyond the scope of the modelling presented here conversely when considering biochemical processes turetsky et al 2008 found that a lower landscape position was related to higher growth and higher decomposition due to a lower allocation of structural carbohydrates taken together the resulting pore structure in peat is likely controlled by ecohydrological processes that balances physical consolidation hydrological processes and ecological biochemical mechanisms in general the observed hydrophysical trends of s fuscum providing higher kunsat values at lower volumetric water contents θ 0 3 cm3 cm 3 than s magellanicum was not consistent with the observations between these two species in mccarter and price 2014 rather this trend was observed by mccarter and price 2014 between s fuscum and s rubellum figure si 2 and not s magellanicum when comparing the k θ relationships from mccarter and price 2014 it is clear that both s rubellum and s fuscum were similar while s magellanicum has a much shallower slope and higher intercepts figure si 2 in comparison the k θ relationships of both s magellanicum and s fuscum in this study were more similar fig 3 despite significant differences between the individual k θ relationships table 2 we hypothesise that this difference is due to the specific sampling location i e microforms between the two studies in this study s fuscum and s magellanicum formed a hummock hollow topography whereas for mccarter and price 2014 the hummock hollow topography was formed by s fucsum and s rubellum while s magellanicum was sampled as a small hummock from a much wetter sphagnum lawn surrounding a bog pool in both studies it is the hummock hollow pair that have more similar k θ relationships regardless of species this suggests that sphagnum species may not be a reliable indicator for hydrophysical properties rather we should focus on the sphagnum microform i e hummock hollow lawn pool when classifying hydrophysical properties of sphagnum moss peat and use species only as a secondary or tertiary descriptor such a shift in classification would better align with the broader peatland science community who often generalize the hydrology by depth to water table which is effectively hummock hollow topography andrus et al 1983 arsenault et al 2019 asemaninejad et al 2017 chaudhary et al 2018 johnson and damman 1991 moore et al 2019 moore and dalva 1993 pouliot et al 2012 rydin 1985 rydin and mcdonald 1985 schipperges and rydin 1998 however more detailed studies on the transferability and expandability of these results to the broader hydrophysical characterization of sphagnum mosses is needed we also note the much drier climate in manitoba where the samples were from versus quebec mccarter and price 2014 which may also play a role in the observed differences we note that direct comparisons between values of the two studies is not recommended as mccarter and price 2014 followed price et al 2008 and this study followed mccarter et al 2017 for determination of the hydrophysical properties this methodological difference results in a systematic difference in the measured data mccarter et al 2017 that simply comparing the values together may lead to erroneous conclusions thus we have limited this comparison to broad descriptions of the trends which are internally consistent within each study 4 3 ecohydrological implications mccarter and price 2014 observed that s magellanicum retained less water than s fuscum and s rubellum while having similar kunsat for a given pressure this resulted in s magellanicum having a different k θ relationship than s fuscum and s rubellum which were similar here s magellanicum retained more water than s fuscum the observed differences in hydrophysical properties observed between these two studies drove a difference in the modelling results between the sphagnum species mccarter and price 2014 assumed identical hydrological conditions between species and found that s magellanicum was under greater water limitations quicker and to a greater degree than s fuscum expectedly following the differences in soil hydraulic properties this was also observed here when s magellanicum had the same water table conditions imposed as experienced by s fuscum reaching below 250 cm pressure whereas s fuscum never exceeded this threshold figure si 3 while these artificial simulations are instructive they do not account for the landscape position of either species by using measured relative differences between the two species to set the water table and initial conditions we were able to capture the ecohydrological differences between the two species it is clear that the higher relative water table associated with s magellanicum reduced hydrological limitations at the capitula throughout the simulated drought period the higher moisture content in s magellanicum associated with higher soil water pressures increased the effective hydraulic conductivity allowing for the capitula soil water pressure to remain well above the upper threshold for hydrological limit in sphagnum moss under dry conditions conversely s fuscum was under greater hydrological limitation as defined by hyaline cell drainage 100 cm for the majority of the simulation fig 4 despite the capitula soil water pressure of s fuscum decreasing well below the hydrological threshold of 100 cm it would likely maintain its photosynthetic capabilities as s fuscum has been observed to be active during droughts and dry periods due to potentially lower optimal water contents where photosynthesis can continue to occur at lower water contents than hollow species bengtsson et al 2016 rydin 1993 in a comparison between capitulum water content as a driver for sphagnum species habitat between s magellanicum hummock and s fallax gong et al 2020 found that it was the hydrological processes and soil hydraulic properties that had the greatest impact on species distribution under various modelled scenarios the findings of gong et al 2020 agree with the findings of this study where the measured soil hydraulic properties regardless of the magnitude of differences between species can produce important ecohydrological difference despite differences in biological processes that may allow hummock species to be photosynthetically active at lower moisture contents bengtsson et al 2016 it is important to consider the water balance ins minus outs of the moss profile in the model to understand potential differences governing the hydrological processes between species any non zero difference in water balance must be met by a change in storage or in this case a cumulative loss of water from within the moss profile fig 6 loss shown as positive values here s fuscum lost only 5 0 mm whereas s magellanicum lost 10 6 mm at first this seems counter intuitive s magellanicum is losing more water internally despite greater access to the water table however because the pressures are higher in s magellanicum closer to zero generally over 100 cm the kunsat is higher allowing for more movement of water in s fuscum however less water is lost internally as the pressures and thus kunsat are lower limiting the water loss these results are consistent with mccarter and price 2014 as s fuscum was still better at transmitting water to the surface to keep the capitula healthy than s magellanicum that had a greater reliance on internal stores of water to supply the evaporative demand even when accounting for their specific ecohydrological niche 5 conclusions the hydrological parameterization of sphagnum mosses is critical to understanding the ecohydrological functionality and feedbacks within peatlands yet many measurement techniques remained untested in the broader literature here we show that the original 5 cm sample height which has become the de facto standard is in fact ideal when coupled with a maximum pressure head step of 5 cm although larger samples may increase the efficiency of these often time and personnel intensive measurements they come with their own considerations limitations in particular one cannot measure at pressure heads larger than the sample height in fact smaller samples e g surface to 2 cm depth at higher pressure heads e g 2 cm from the very surface of the peatland microform would better help characterise the profile for modelling ecohydrological processes despite there being clear differences in the soil hydraulic properties between the two different sphagnum species the need to consider the ecohydrological niche of the different sphagnum species is critical to properly understanding their function we show that when considering the ecohydrological niche of s fuscum and s magellanicum neither species reaches the critical soil water pressure threshold 400 cm imposed within this study rather the closer proximity of the water table for s magellanicum offsets its lower effective hydraulic conductivity than the hummock forming s fuscum which was able to effectively transmit water from the deeper water table to the capitula despite being drier as experimental apparatuses and techniques to measure the soil hydraulic properties of moss advance so too do the questions that can be asked moving beyond just obtaining a k θ relationship for a generic sphagnum moss we sought to understand and quantify the hydraulic differences at different depths within a moss profile and critically between moss species that occupy different ecohydrological niches concurrent with advances in laboratory parameterization numerical modelling has become significantly more sophisticated and computationally complex thus numerical modellers are able to use these species specific microform specific data to link sphagnum species net primary productivity with their ecohydrological functionality creating these ecohydrological linkages will strengthen our potential to understand the role of
