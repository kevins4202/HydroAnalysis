13045,adsorption using different adsorbents is seen as the most effective method of treating wastewater contaminated by heavy metal ions such as copper ions in particular nano adsorbents have emerged as the state of the art materials for heavy metal removal because of their unique physicochemical properties the aim of this study was to review the progress made in the last decade 2011 2021 on the removal of copper ions from aqueous environment relevant works were sourced and carefully analysed the findings revealed that various classes of nano adsorbents have been employed in the copper ion removal among which magnetic nanoparticles mnps 43 4 was the most frequently used class while aerogels 1 2 are the least frequently used class of nano adsorbents best results were obtained by the modification functionalization of the nano adsorbents with other materials which resulted in an increase in their specific surface area the majority of the nano adsorbents showed high removal efficiencies 90 while the highest adsorption capacity 1937 5 mg g was obtained experimentally with the aerogel class the adsorption isotherm fitted well with the langmuir and freundlich models while the kinetic data provided the best correlation with the pseudo second order kinetic model for most of the nano adsorbents the mnps in particular showed high reusability with most of them maintaining high efficiencies even after 3 5 rounds of regeneration effective treatment of copper contaminated wastewater can therefore be achieved with the use of nano adsorbents as a novel non toxic and cost effective technique of adsorption graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption copper nano adsorbent nano material pollution wastewater 1 introduction water an essential source of life sustenance has suffered increased contamination over the past decades 1 increased industrial activities have resulted in the contamination of many water bodies with a number of pollutants that exceed the allowable limit for wastewater 2 more than 650 different pollutants have been reported in wastewater including dyes phenols pharmaceuticals pesticides and heavy metals 3 among these heavy metals are the major concerns for environmental and human health because of their non biodegradability and accumulation heavy metals can be introduced into the environment through natural sources such as rainwater soil erosion and rock weathering 4 but the main sources of heavy metals are through human activities particularly wastewaters released from various industries such as mining paper fertilizer petroleum tannery battery production electroplating pigment leather and plastic industries 5 9 the most dangerous heavy metals according to the united states environmental protection agency usepa are arsenic mercury cadmium lead chromium and copper 4 copper is an abundant trace element found in a number of rocks and minerals and whose divalent form cu2 is relatively known for its negative effects 10 12 although an essential element needed in human health in trace amounts copper can be very toxic when consumed beyond permissible limits copper is the third most used metal in the world 13 it is widely used as an algicide in ornamental ponds water supply reservoirs and various industries where when released as wastewater gets distributed in water bodies and contaminates drinking water 14 16 copper is the second most toxic metal in drinking water after mercury 5 in high concentrations copper can cause abdominal pain vomiting diarrhoea nausea liver and kidney damage cramps in the calves and gastrointestinal irritation 17 18 today water contamination with copper ions is a serious environmental issue as copper can permeate both surface and groundwater systems 19 the control and removal of copper from water therefore becomes imperative about 20 25 of human copper consumption is accounted for by drinking water 20 table 1 shows the acceptable limit of copper in drinking water by various bodies and countries copper like other heavy metals can accumulate in the human body and cause adverse health effects such as high blood pressure kidney and liver respiratory damage cramps vomiting and even death 5 the oxidative potential of copper may be the plausible reason for its toxicity as it produces oxidative damage to the biological system including peroxidation of lipids and other macromolecules 22 studies have shown that elevated concentrations of copper can lead to oxidative stress hepatocirrhosis renal dysfunction and stimulation of the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal 23 in aquatic life the toxicity of copper includes both chronic effects such as reduced growth and lifespan impaired fertility and behavioural alterations and acute effects such as death 24 johnson et al 10 showed that exposure to copper significantly decreased the survival of zebrafish embryos with the highest effect exerted during the sensitive stages of gastrulation and segmentation in plants high concentrations of copper may result in the damage of cell membranes leading to cell death decreased plant cover and growth and causing general ecological damage 25 several conventional methods have been employed in the removal of copper from the aqueous environment including ion exchange 26 oxidation reduction 27 chemical precipitation 28 electrodialysis 29 and solvent extraction 30 however some of these methods are characterized by high cost of operation high sensitivity to operational conditions significant energy consumption and generation of waste residues 31 33 adsorption on the other hand is regarded as the most effective and promising method of removing heavy metals from wastewater even in low concentrations 34 36 nano materials are materials with a particle size of between 1 and 100 nm 37 39 they have been receiving a great deal of attention in science and technology because of their magnetic catalytic and adsorptive properties 13 40 it is believed that many of the environmental issues associated with water quality can be addressed using nanoparticles nps nano filtration or other techniques developed from nanotechnology 41 the application of nano adsorbents in the removal of toxic metals from wastewater over conventional adsorbents such as activated carbon and biomass is as a result of their numerous advantages that include their size high surface area and recyclability 42 43 several reviews exist in literature on the adsorption of heavy metals using nano adsorbents wadhawan et al 6 kaushal singh 44 thekkudan et al 7 and kyzas matis 42 are among those who have contributed in this field of study these reviews are however generic and fail to give an in depth knowledge of the adsorption of the specific metals a lot of papers have been published in the last decade on the treatment of copper containing wastewaters with nano adsorbents but to the best of our knowledge no attempt has been made to bring these findings together for easy comprehension the aim of this study was therefore to provide a summary of information related to the use of nano adsorbents for the removal of cu2 ions from aqueous solutions with a focus on studies completed and published within the last decade 2011 2021 adsorption process parameters were also discussed as well as recommendations and the way forward this review will also serve as a guide for future researchers working on the mitigation of this toxic pollutant 2 methodology only peer reviewed articles written in english were considered for this study between september 2021 and december 2021 scopus google scholar and science direct databases were searched and relevant articles were downloaded various search phrases were utilized to identify as many relevant papers as possible such as copper adsorption nanoadsorbent copper adsorption nanoparticle and copper adsorption nanocomposite the search was restricted to only articles published within the past decade 2011 2021 so as to obtain the most recent studies carried out in this field for this review only applied research articles were selected duplicate articles and review articles were not considered a total of 83 publications that met all the criteria were selected from all the articles examined and these served as the bedrock of this study the nano adsorbents employed in the removal of cu2 from aqueous solutions in the last decade were grouped into seven different classes fig 1 this was done for the sake of convenience and to provide clarity on the different nano sized adsorbents used in the timeframe under consideration a nano adsorbent can fall into two or more groups depending on the modification functionalization nevertheless the classification was done taking into account the initial nano adsorbent before the modification and considering only nano materials whose diameter ranges between 1 and 100 nm the classifications include i magnetic nanoparticles ii nanoscale metals metallic oxides iii carbon based nanoadsorbents iv polymer based nanoadsorbents v clay based nanoadsorbents vi nanofibers vii aerogels 3 adsorption as a method for the removal of copper ions adsorption is preferred over other methods of removing heavy metal ions from wastewater because of its simplicity in design low cost of operation and high resistance to heavy metals 34 35 45 it is highly dependent on the surface chemistry of the adsorbent and the adsorbate 46 47 one of the major challenges of the adsorption process is choosing an adsorbent suitable for the uptake of a particular pollutant when selecting the choice of the adsorbent to be used several properties such as porosity specific surface area adsorption capacities reusability among others are taken into consideration 48 in addition an adsorbent s particle size pore volume and pore size also play an important role in the adsorption process 49 50 an ideal adsorbent should be able to provide sufficient binding sites for effective adsorption of the pollutants 6 51 adsorption capacity q max and removal efficiency re are the two most important features of adsorption as they determine the effectiveness of an adsorbent in removing the adsorbates 24 adsorption capacity is an inherent feature of an adsorbent towards the adsorbate while removal efficiency depends on the adsorbate s concentration and dosage as well as the competing ions in the system 24 52 the adsorption process is also controlled by several other factors such as the ph of the solution contact time initial metal ion concentration the adsorbent dose and the temperature adsorption equilibrium is another essential feature of an adsorption study that gives information regarding the capacity of the adsorbent to remove metal ions under optimal conditions 53 equilibrium data is determined using isotherm models such as langmuir and freundlich models and kinetic models such as pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso models several adsorbents have been utilized for the adsorption of cu2 ions from the aqueous environment including carbon based compounds 54 55 clays and minerals 56 57 polymers and resins 58 59 agricultural wastes 60 61 among others however some of these adsorbents suffer from poor adsorption capacity or removal efficiency of the metal ions 5 moreover some of them show weak recovery of the adsorbate in bulk solutions due to their diffusion inadequacy and insufficiency of active binding sites 62 nano adsorbents have since emerged as the state of the art material that addresses some of these shortcomings in wastewater treatment 4 nano adsorbents for cu2 uptake nanotechnology has been playing a major role in addressing the problems of health energy and water quality the use of nano materials as nano adsorbents in the removal of contaminants from wastewater has been gaining interest over the last decade because of their unique properties and morphologies the properties of nano materials are studied using transmission electron microscopy tem dynamic light scattering dls scanning electron microscopy sem fourier transform infrared ftir microscopy x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps x ray diffraction xrd thermogravimetric analysis tga and brunauer emmett teller bet analysis fig 2 shows an example of the morphology and imaging of the nano adsorbent nano sio2 crosslinked chitosan nano tio2 synthesized by mahmoud et al 63 and characterized by sem and tem techniques as can be observed the images showed aggregated spherical nanoparticles nps a property of a material in nano sized scale they also showed homogeneous distributions of the nps on a uniform surface with the size of the synthesized material ranging from 14 to 40 nm most nano materials are available in fine powder form as they are synthesized as suspensions in liquids thus making them unsuitable for adsorption 48 64 as a result they are used with the support of other materials to increase their porosity and surface area modification of the surface of the nps gives stability to the particles and produces molecular makeup substantially different from the core of the nps which confers on them properties that facilitate increased adsorption 7 the nano adsorbents employed in the removal of cu2 from aqueous solutions in the last decade were grouped into seven different classes as discussed in section 2 from fig 3 it was observed that magnetic nanoparticles were the most frequent class of nano adsorbents employed for the removal of copper ions from the aqueous environment this was followed by nanoscale metals metallic oxides polymer based clay based carbon based nano fiber and lastly aerogels 4 1 magnetic nanoparticles magnetic nanoparticles mnps are iron oxide based nano adsorbents with magnetic properties that facilitates their separation from water after adsorption based on high gradient magnetic separation hgms 64 included in this group are magnetite fe3o4 maghemite γ fe2o4 hematite α fe2o3 and all modified iron oxide magnetite is the commonest magnetic core used in adsorption studies though in aqueous solution it quickly oxidizes to maghemite the more stable magnetic oxide 41 mnps are the most commonly used class of nano adsorbent due to their special properties such as extreme small size high surface area to volume ratio and the absence of internal diffusion resistance which provides much better kinetics for adsorption 65 in addition chemical inertness high degree of dispersion and biocompatibility have all been reported for mnps 66 raw mnps are however easily oxidized by the surrounding environment and may leach into low ph media and become toxic 19 also their high surface area and energy makes them susceptible to aggregation in solutions leading to decreased sorption capacity and restricting their applications 19 much focus has therefore been on the surface modification of mnps with core shell nanostructures such as polymers 67 68 clays 69 activated carbon 16 70 biomass 71 among others to compensate for their limitations it has been reported that functionalization of mnps with natural adsorbents increases their pollutant removal efficiency by 20 30 times greater than the un functionalized material 69 72 mnps can be prepared using various techniques such as solvothermal hydrothermal thermal decomposition sol gel and chemical vapour deposition 4 73 cui et al 74 synthesized a magnetic nano composite by co precipitation via embedding of ferro feric oxide into magnesium hydroxyapatite for the removal of cu2 ions from solution at optimum conditions an adsorption capacity of 305 mg g was achieved at an optimum of 0 32 g l adsorbent dose 90 min of contact time ph 5 9 and a temperature of 25 c hosseinzadeh ramin 49 synthesized a novel magnetic chitosan graphene oxide nano composite by the copolymerization of graphene oxide with ethylenediamine mnps and chitosan g poly acrylic acid co 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropane sulfonic acid the adsorbent showed a high specific surface area 132 9 m2 g a large pore volume 4 03 cm3 g and a small particle size 15 nm a high adsorption capacity of 217 4 mg g was obtained with the adsorption process following the pso and langmuir isotherm models in another study ge et al 68 prepared a magnetic nano composite by modification of mnps with 3 amino propyltriethoxysilane and copolymers of acrylic acid and crotonic acid the adsorption capacity of cu2 ions removal was found to be 126 9 mg g at ph 5 5 temperature of 25 c and dosage of 1 g l demonstrating the effectiveness of the prepared nano adsorbent badruddoza et al 65 synthesized a novel nano adsorbent by surface modification of mnps with carboxymethyl β cyclodextrin and obtained a maximum cu2 ion adsorption capacity of 47 2 mg g at 25 c while wang et al 75 effectively removed cu2 ions from aqueous solution using mnps whose surface area is 115 3 m2 g obtaining an adsorption capacity of 8 90 mg g after 240 min furthermore nano magnetite fe3o4 nps and kaolinite functionalized magnetite nps mag kl were synthesized by lasheen et al 66 the adsorption process follows the langmuir isotherm and pso kinetics with a maximum adsorption capacity of 138 and 98 mg g at contact times of 60 and 120 min for fe3o4 nps and mag kl nps respectively a major downside of mnps though is the cost of obtaining large external magnetic fields to overcome opposing forces encountered especially when the size of the nps is very small 12 nm 4 table 2 presents more comprehensive information on the adsorption of cu2 ions using mnps in general magnetic nano adsorbents showed high specific surface area which is further enhanced by their ease of functionalization their magnetic property also means they can be regenerated and reused several times as can be seen in table 2 4 2 nano scale metals metallic oxides nanoparticles grouped into metallic nano adsorbents include metallic nps bimetallic nps metallic oxide nps metallic nano sheets nano zerovalent metals and functionalized metallic nps nano zerovalent metals are very stable have a greater surface area and are non toxic the drawback of nano scale zerovalent metals is their accumulation in effluent after treatment 96 dada et al 97 studied the adsorption of cu2 ions onto nano scale zerovalent manganese synthesized by chemical reduction with a surface area of 131 4 m2 g the adsorbent showed a high monolayer adsorption capacity of 181 82 mg g at ph 5 0 with a high removal efficiency 99 this result demonstrated the potential of nanoscale zerovalent manganese as a novel nano adsorbent for the uptake of heavy metals and can be recommended for wastewater treatment in an industrial setting rafiq et al 98 prepared magnesium and zinc oxide nano adsorbents for the removal of copper ions from electroplating industry wastewater both adsorbents possessed high adsorption capacities of 226 and 593 mg g for mgo and zno adsorbents respectively showing the efficiency of the low cost nano adsorbent in the treatment of heavy metal contaminated effluents the experimental results for the adsorption of cu2 ions by γ alumina nps were found to follow the freundlich isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic models and the adsorption capacity was 31 30 mg g at a contact time of 240 min an adsorbent dose of 5 g l and a 200 mg l metallic ion concentration 99 the study showed that both metal oxide nps can serve as effective cheap and eco friendly nano adsorbents for treating effluents from the electroplating industry prabu et al 96 investigated the potential of nano scale zerovalent iron impregnated cashew nut shells to uptake cu2 the adsorption process was hugely influenced by the operating parameters and 100 removal efficiency was obtained at optimum conditions in 40 min table 3 gives more details on the adsorptive removal of cu2 ions using metals metallic oxides the major disadvantage of metals metallic oxide nano adsorbents is their potential to become unstable during their reduction to nano scale when increasing their surface area this instability can leave them liable to agglomeration because of the presence of van der waals forces and their interactions 4 this could also limit their ability to adsorb other heavy metals in wastewater 7 notwithstanding this class of nano adsorbents showed high removal efficiencies for all the reported studies as can be seen in table 3 4 3 carbon based nano adsorbents these are carbon containing nano sized adsorbents the most commonly used adsorbents in this class are graphene and nanotubes graphene is a two dimensional nanomaterial prepared by the chemical oxidation of natural graphite 108 carbon nanotubes cnts are made up of cylindrical graphite sheets an allotropic form of carbon rolled up into a tube like structure 5 cnts possess exceptional electrical chemical and physical properties and are widely used for the removal of contaminants from wastewater due to their large specific surface area small size hollow and layered structure and marked electrical conductivities that often result in high sorption capacities 109 111 cnts are divided into two types based on their structure single wall cnts swcnts and multi wall cnts mwcnts swcnts are made up of a single shell of graphene containing cylindrical shapes whereas mwcnts are made up of multiple layers of graphene sheets 5 112 onundi et al 113 successfully synthesized cnts on granular activated carbon for the removal of various heavy metals from wastewater at ph 5 1 g l dosage 2 mg l metal concentration and 60 min contact time 60 removal efficiency was obtained for cu2 ions as synthesized mwcnts as mwcnts and oxidized mwcnts ox mwcnts prepared by egbosiuba abdulkareem 114 showed remarkable high specific surface areas of 1140 and 1210 m2 g and subsequently high adsorption capacities of 364 7 and 416 5 mg g for as mwcnts and ox mwcnts respectively after only 30 min the high adsorption capacities as well as the stability and reusable nature of the nano materials make them ideal candidates for several industrial applications including wastewater treatment eftekhari et al 115 prepared a folic acid coated graphene oxide nano composite and obtained a maximum computational adsorption capacity of 116 3 mg g and a removal efficiency of 91 5 copper ion removal using carbon based nano adsorbents is presented in table 4 the major limitations of this class of nano adsorbents include the toxicity of cnts that affect human health selectivity and low removal efficiency due to the non reactivity of the cnt walls 4 nonetheless the low removal efficiency can easily be overcome by modification with chemicals 4 4 polymer based nano adsorbents nano sized polymer materials are ideal nano adsorbents because of their large surface area perfect mechanical rigidity turnable surface chemistry and pore size distribution as well as their regenerative ability 4 they include bio based polymers such as cellulose and chitosan alginate and polydopamine as well as hydrogels chitosan is a biopolymer produced by de acetylation of the polysaccharide chitin obtained from the shells of crustaceans and fungal biomass 77 80 chitosan is hydrophilic non toxic environmentally friendly and biocompatible and forms complexes when in combination with other metals 6 alginate is extracted from brown seaweed and it is also non toxic biocompatible and biodegradable 116 hydrogels are a type of polymeric material with a three dimensional cross linked structure that can absorb and retain large amounts of water without dissolving 117 they can easily be regenerated without any significant decrease in their sorption capacity 117 alsabagh et al 118 prepared a multifunctional nano composite based on chitosan modified with silver nps copper nps and cnts for the uptake of cu2 ions from solution the removal efficiency of the adsorbent reached 100 in 60 min and the adsorbent dosage amount was 1 g l with a langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of 70 40 mg g this multifunctional nanomaterial was regenerated and reused up to five times showing its prowess as a promising water purification material farnad et al 119 used polydopamine with a mean diameter of 75 nm to achieve a maximum adsorption capacity of 34 4 mg g at a dosage of 0 8 g l a polyethyleneimine based nano adsorbent polyethyleneimine sio2 γ fe3o4 was prepared by plohl et al 120 for effective metal removal the nano adsorbent showed a maximum removal of 143 mg g at ph 6 and could be reused up to four times without significant loss in adsorption capacity the recyclability and extraordinary properties of the amino rich material make it an effective stable and environmentally friendly material for the sequestration of heavy metals from sludge awual 121 developed a ligand based hydrogel composite that showed a specific surface of 379 m2 g and an adsorption capacity of 171 3 mg g 99 efficiency using langmuir equations in furtherance barati et al 122 functionalized a nano composite hydrogel based on poly methacrylamide co acrylic acid and nano sized montmorillonite for copper containing effluent treatment the adsorbent showed good affinity for the metallic ion with an adsorption capacity of 46 94 mg g at ph 6 8 and a temperature of 45 c this result is enough for the nano composite to be regarded as a low cost and efficient adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals from solutions the disadvantage of polymer based nano adsorbents is the difficulty of synthesizing them with good selectivity to the target pollutant and also the difficulty of recycling them particularly when they are of low purity 7 table 5 shows the complete data on polymer based nano adsorbents for the uptake of copper ions 4 5 clay based nano adsorbents clays are hydrous alumina silicates that include crystalline and amorphous fibrous minerals such as carbonates and metal oxides 129 clay minerals are known for their adsorptive properties which can be enhanced by modification in several ways including acid treatment calcinations intercalation pillaring among others 130 azzam et al 130 beneficiated the surface of natural clay with chitosan ag nps and chitosan au nps adsorbents showed good adsorption capacities of 181 5 mg g and 100 removal efficiency in both cases after 60 min the results of these hybrid composites suggest their suitability for hg2 uptake from water shabani et al 131 investigated the adsorptive properties of diatomite nps whose bet surface area is 119 5 m2 g langmuir calculations revealed the adsorption capacity as 142 86 mg g at room temperature and ph 4 5 thus the nano mineral that is locally available in high quantity and cheap showed high efficiency to remove the metal ions from aqueous solution an iron oxide modified montmorillonite with a diameter of 8 24 nm was synthesized by kalantari et al 132 for the removal of various heavy metals from solution the adsorbent showed a high cu2 ion removal efficiency of 94 9 in another study saadat et al 129 used montmorillonite doped with al2o3 nps to achieve 99 copper ion removal from industrial wastewater the clayey nano adsorbent was used up to four times without washing showing its high effectiveness table 6 is a summary of cu2 uptake using clay based nano adsorbents in general clay minerals represent a promising and abundant natural nano adsorbent that can be beneficiated for not just metal ion uptake but several other water treatment purposes 4 6 nano fibers electrospun nano fiber membranes have become an important one dimensional nanomaterial that can be used in a wide range of applications due to their special physicochemical properties and characteristics 133 134 these properties such as high porosity high permeability and ease of separation from water make them exceptional wastewater treatment materials 135 136 nano fibers can be prepared from various materials including both natural and synthetic polymers carbon containing materials semiconducting materials and composite nano materials by a process known as electrospinning 134 137 the study of electrospun nano fiber membranes for wastewater treatment however is still in an early stage and only a few studies have reported their use in heavy metal removal 135 garcía díaz et al 138 studied the adsorption of cu2 ions using carbon nano fiber and achieved a maximum adsorption capacity of 8 80 mg g at ph 4 while the experimental data fitted well with langmuir isotherm and pso kinetic models the helical carbon nano fiber proved a potential adsorbent in the treatment of cu2 contaminated effluent yari et al 53 prepared mercapto groups functionalized electrospun ceo2 nano fiber which showed a specific surface area of 163 6 m2 g and a high sorption capacity of 263 4 mg g at 45 c in addition polyaniline nano fibers doped with chlorine and phytic acid were fabricated by kim et al 139 the ph dependent adsorption process showed the adsorption capacity of the phytic acid doped polyaniline fiber 5 29 mg g was 4 times higher than that of chlorinated nano fiber 1 28 mg g using the langmuir calculations at ph 5 3 this study clearly showed how surface functionalization can incredibly enhance the sorption capacity of an adsorbent and was recommended for metal recovery in mining and water purification table 7 contains more detailed information on the use of nano fibers of nanometer size as adsorbents for the removal of cu2 ions reported during the review period 4 7 aerogels aerogels are highly porous and networked materials that have received increased attention as adsorbents for removing heavy metal ions from wastewater because of their extraordinary number of properties 140 they are new materials in adsorptive wastewater treatment with high removal efficiency lightweight flexibility non toxicity recyclability and ph and water stability 141 142 the adsorption capacities of aerogels are however quite low because of a lack of surface affinity groups hence they are always functionalized with other materials prior to adsorption 140 shahnaz et al 142 fabricated a nanobentonite modified nanocellulose chitosan aerogel which showed excellent removal efficiency of cu2 ions 99 with an experimental adsorption capacity of 1937 5 mg g the highest reported in this study the halsey isotherm and pso kinetic models best described the adsorption process this study demonstrated that aerogel can serve as a cheap substitute for high cost conventional adsorbents consequently more studies on this class of nano adsorbents are needed to further buttress this fact table 8 summarizes these findings 5 effect of process parameters 5 1 effect of ph water contaminated with heavy metals from industrial effluents is known to show different ph values depending on the type of industrial activities that produce the effluents 18 the ph of the solution is a very important parameter in the adsorption process because it affects the solubility of the metal ions the concentration of the counter ion on the adsorbent functional groups and the ionization degree of the adsorbent during reaction 69 82 147 generally the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent for heavy metals increases as the ph increases 148 the adsorption capacity of cu2 ions on nh2 mnps increased from 1 76 mg g to 22 4 mg g as the ph increased from 1 0 to 6 0 78 showing the high dependency of the adsorption process on the solution ph also the adsorption capacity of cnts on granular ac increased significantly as the ph of the solution increased from 3 to 5 but decreased above ph 5 113 however this is not always the case as adsorbent efficiencies have been found to decrease as ph increases the adsorption capacity of magnetic chitosan graphene oxide nano composite was found to decrease as the solution ph increased 49 this was attributed to the presence of excess h ions that competes with the cationic ions for adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface the ph of point of zero charge phpzc is the solution ph when the net charge of the adsorbent surface is zero 149 when the ph phpzc the adsorbent surface is protonated and positively charged but when the ph phpzc the surface is deprotonated and negatively charged 5 2 effect of contact time contact time plays a significant role in the adsorptive removal of pollutants from aqueous solutions it gives an idea of the time taken to attain equilibrium and also describes the kinetics of the removal of the metal ions by the nano adsorbents 77 79 contact time is particularly important when dealing with economic evaluation and practical applicability of the adsorbent in water treatment 18 48 most of the studied articles reported a similar pattern for the contact time effects a rapid removal of cu2 ions for a certain period of time and then a drastic reduction before reaching equilibrium the amount of metal ions adsorbed in the rapid stage is a result of the many binding sites on the adsorbent surface but this decreases as the adsorption continues before equilibrium is attained 67 in the adsorption of the metal ions onto magnesium hydroxyapatite 74 the process was found to be comprised of two phases a primary rapid phase and a secondary slow phase most of the cu2 removal was achieved from the rapid phase that lasted for approximately 70 min while the adsorption reached its maximum at 90 min which showed saturation of the active points in the same vein a very fast removal within the first 5 min was observed with bentonite mnps followed by a slower removal speed and finally the gradual attainment of the equilibrium state 69 5 3 effect of nano adsorbent dosage the dosage of the nano adsorbents is a very important parameter that influences the removal efficiency of the metal ions in solution it determines the adsorption capacity of a catalytic agent for a given initial concentration of the metal ion in operating conditions 72 it also controls the capacity of the adsorbent for a given solution 62 an increase in adsorbent dose will result in a rapid adsorption of the metal ion onto the adsorbent surface leading to de concentration of the adsorbate in the solution and consequently unsaturation of the adsorbents active site 98 the removal efficiency of cu2 ions rose from 33 1 to 99 5 as the dose of chitosan coated mnps increased from 0 4 to 3 2 g l 77 while an increase in bamboo supported manganese nano composite dosage increased the cu2 ions removal from 65 6 to 100 22 this increase is as a result of an increase in the active binding sites of the adsorbent as its dosage increases in the study using rice husk synthesized nano cellulose 13 the removal efficiency of the metal ions increased from 75 to 97 as the amount of the adsorbent increased but decreased in adsorption capacity from 18 79 to 4 88 mg g under the same conditions this is a result of overlapping of the adsorbent s active sites due to excessive crowding of the adsorbent molecules 5 4 effect of temperature temperature is another important factor that significantly affects the adsorption of copper from wastewater onto nano adsorbents this is because industrial effluents are released at varying temperatures 98 it is also known that any change in reaction temperature in most chemical reactions and processes will influence the adsorption efficiency of a solid surface 124 various temperatures ranging from 25 c to 70 c have been reported as the optimum temperature however most of the maximum adsorption capacities occurred at room temperature 25 c an increase in temperature can either lead to an increase in adsorption capacity 53 131 as a result of an increase in effective collision between the adsorbent adsorbate phases or a decrease in adsorption capacity 2 77 as a result of a decrease in the surface activity of the adsorbent the results obtained from the temperature effect on polydopamine nps revealed that the adsorption capacity decreased from 36 mg g at 25 c to 18 mg g at 50 c indicating an exothermic process 119 while an increased efficiency up to 99 8 was achieved with an increase in temperature for cu2 ion adsorption onto bamboo supported manganese nano composite 22 which implies that the adsorption process is endothermic 5 5 effect of initial copper ion concentration the initial concentration of the metal ion accounts for the mass transfer resistance of the adsorbate from the bulk of the solution to the adsorbent surface 124 the effects of the metal ion concentration are dependent on the immediate relationship between the concentration of the ions and the available binding sites on the surface of the adsorbent 2 increasing the concentration of cu2 ions increases the adsorption capacities of the nano adsorbents and this is the major trend reported for most of the articles this may be as a result of the interaction between the metal ions and the nano adsorbents which provides the driving force to overcome the resistance to the mass transfer of metal ions between the aqueous solution and the adsorbent 62 67 however a few of the studied papers also reported a decrease in removal efficiency as the metal ion concentration increased the percentage removal of cu2 ions by tio2 nps decreased from 98 to 90 as the initial concentration of the adsorbate ions increased with the maximum removal efficiency obtained at a metal ion concentration of 10 mg l 106 while the removal efficiency decreased from 99 8 to 90 1 for nanoscale zerovalent iron impregnated cashew nut shell as the initial concentrations of cu2 ions increased from 20 to 100 mg l 96 6 isotherm and kinetic models the adsorption isotherm and kinetic models are key factors in describing the interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate the models express the chemical kinetics during the adsorption of the metal ions at constant temperature and equilibrium conditions 46 150 the langmuir and freundlich models are the most frequently used models in describing the adsorption isotherm in the removal of cu2 ions using nano adsorbents the langmuir model is based on the assumption that the maximum adsorption is equivalent to a saturated monolayer of adsorbate molecules on the surface of the adsorbent 151 while the freundlich model is an indication of the surface heterogeneity of the adsorbent 75 notwithstanding other models have also been used in describing the adsorption of cu2 ions by nano adsorbents they include redlich peterson 77 toth 77 temkin 43 62 sips langmuir freundlich 11 76 86 118 dubinin radushkevich 97 145 and halsey 142 isotherm models the equations of these models are presented in table 9 the adsorption kinetics determines the reaction limiting phase of the adsorption process the dominant model used in describing the adsorption kinetic of the nano adsorbents is the pseudo second order pso model the model assumes that the chemisorption involving exchange of electron between adsorbate and adsorbent molecules is the rate limiting step of adsorption 153 154 however there are few cases where other kinetic models were used including pseudo first order pfo 98 double exponential 53 76 and intra particle diffusion 111 models table 10 shows the equations of the different kinetic models 7 adsorption mechanism the adsorption capacities of the nano adsorbents in the uptake of cu2 ions can be described by several mechanisms the ph of a solution the point of zero charge phzc isotherm and kinetic models and desorption studies all play important roles in determining an adsorption mechanism analytical techniques such as ftir and xrd can also be used to determine the adsorption mechanism as they indicate the functional groups in the system and their sites of interaction 46 in general adsorption mechanisms can occur by physisorption and or chemisorption depending on the nature of the adsorbent adsorbate interactions 155 156 the mechanism of adsorption of the cu2 ion by the nano adsorbents is summarized in table 11 these are the findings reported in the articles under review as some of the papers simply reported the adsorption process but not the mechanism notably the nanofiber and aerogel classes complexation and ion exchange dominate the mechanism of adsorption for all the classes of nano adsorbents these are chemical mechanisms chemisorption which have also been generalized as the uptake mechanism in some studies 82 85 92 128 chemisorptions are strong bonds of interaction that can be ionic or covalent in nature 157 in the mnps class electrostatic attraction 70 86 and repulsion 76 89 were also reported as the uptake mechanisms the attraction and repulsion of molecules with opposite charges are referred to as electrostatic interaction 158 the mechanism of the adsorption of cu2 ions onto nh2 magnetic nanobiochar is shown in fig 4 76 the adsorbents get protonated at lower ph to form nh3 cations which results in electrostatic repulsion between the bindings of cu2 ions on their surfaces the binding of the ions was facilitated at higher ph levels as more binding sites became available electrostatic attraction occurs between the functional groups of amino and hydroxyl groups on the adsorbent adsorbate surfaces 76 aside from complexation and ion exchange intra particle diffusion 20 and surface precipitation 100 106 also served as the adsorption mechanisms for the metals metallic oxide nano adsorbent class primo et al 105 utilized zno nps for the metal ion removal the highest adsorption capacity was observed at ph phzc which implies that the adsorption may occur through non electrostatic interaction the adsorption mechanism was explained by the model of complex ion adsorption in hydrated solids where the cu2 ions interact with active groups oh on the surface of the oxide several mechanisms for copper ion adsorption on the surface of carboxyl cnts cnts cooh and hydroxyl cnts cnts oh have been reported 111 the binding on cnts oh was brought about by electrostatic interactions while chemical complexation and electrostatic attraction accounted for the binding on cnts cooh similar mechanisms were reported for both the polymer based and carbon based nano adsorbents as can be seen in table 11 8 effect of competing ions heavy metal ions are frequently found in aqueous solutions with alkaline or alkaline earth metal ions 68 the ionic strength of the solution can be altered by the presence of other ions species competing for the active sites on the surface of the nano adsorbents studying on the effects of competing ions is therefore important as it is used to ascertain the efficiency of the nano adsorbents to still remove the cu2 in the presence of other ions this study is particularly helpful in establishing the potential of a given nano adsorbent to be used in real wastewater treatment 155 a higher number of articles under review revealed that the presence of other ions in the solution decreased the adsorption capacity of the nano adsorbents for the cu2 ions while the rest reported that the presence of other ions did not affect the capacity of the nano adsorbents to remove cu2 in any way the adsorption capacity of ac modified mnps decreased with increased acidity as a result of the competition between ions and h ions for the same binding sites 16 the competition for adsorption sites with ca2 and na led to a decline in the adsorption of cu2 on tio2 106 with nano scale zerovalent manganese 20 the influence of competing species was studied using different ionic strengths of nacl solution it was found that an increase in na ions decreased the percentage removal of cu2 ions from 95 8 to 73 5 however the coexistence of k ca2 na and mg2 had no effect on the adsorption of cu2 onto magnesium hydroxyapatite mnps 74 9 regeneration and reuse desorption and regeneration of an adsorbent are always carried out to determine its reusability regeneration and reuse are very important integrals of adsorption studies as they help in establishing the adsorbent s industrial applicability this is particularly important because it also reduces the overall cost of the process 155 159 metal ions that have been adsorbed can be desorbed using an eluent such as acid or chelating agents 147 among the different classes of nano adsorbents for cu2 removal mnps are the easiest regenerative class owing to their magnetism which makes them easily separable by an external magnetic field 74 the desorption of cu2 ions from nano magnetic and kaolin functionalized mnps was carried out using hno3 as the eluent 66 the removal efficiency of the adsorbent was found to be between 90 and 96 after the first round of reuse and almost the same as the fresh ones even after five recycling rounds in the study using mnps coated with mixtures of sodium oleate and 2 ethyhexyl phosphonic acid 87 the removal efficiency was still very high 99 after the first four adsorption desorption cycles 96 after five cycles but decreased drastically to 46 9 after the seventh cycle this sharp decrease was attributed to extractant leakage and magnetic loss in the first cycle the adsorption capacity of cu2 onto regenerated two dimensional ti3c2tx mxene nano sheet was 80 but sharply decreased to 47 and 30 in the second and third rounds respectively 102 this is as a result of the partial oxidation of ti3c2tx into tio2 nps during adsorption and the incomplete desorption of the adsorbed metal ions the reusability of diatomite nps was investigated after being desorbed with 1 m of both nacl and nh4oh 131 although the adsorptive potential of the nano material decreased after four cycles due to a reduction in its surface area as a result of coagulation and agglomeration of the particles it was still able to retain over 80 of the initial adsorptive capacity the summary of these findings is presented in tables 2 8 10 performance evaluation of the nano adsorbents in real wastewater sample treatment determining the real water treatment potential of the nano adsorbents will go a long way towards justifying their claimed efficiencies and capacities this is particularly important because some of the known wastewater treatment adsorbents with up to 99 efficiency under optimum conditions always decrease to 90 or even less during real wastewater treatment 160 however studies on this are rarely reported in all the papers reviewed in this study only four investigated the real wastewater treatment performance of the used nano adsorbents 19 88 98 128 donia et al 128 investigated the potential of nano magnetic cellulose in actual wastewater treatment using effluents from battery factories the results obtained using inductive coupled plasma icp showed 95 6 cu2 removal from the effluents rafiq et al 98 obtained equally promising result for zno 92 4 97 6 and mgo 93 7 98 2 nps on actual industrial samples collected from electroplating industries on a seasonal variation basis collected in different months in a real world treatment analysis naghizadeh et al 88 investigated the potentials of fe3o4 egg shell membrane to recover cu2 ions from various water samples all samples showed high relative recovery ranging from 95 to 105 showing the suitability of the nano adsorbent in environmental samples similar results were obtained by abd ali et al 19 in the extraction of cu2 ions from various water samples using chrysin functionalized silica core shell nps with the relative recovery ranging from 96 8 105 these findings demonstrated the efficiencies of the nano adsorbents towards cu2 ions demonstrating their applicability in real world wastewater treatment more studies are however needed on all the classes of the nano adsorbents to fully establish these findings 11 comparison with commercial activated carbon this section compares the efficiency of nano adsorbents for cu2 removal to that of commercial adsorbents this comparison is important in a bid to determine the commercialization potential of nano adsorbents for cu2 adsorption for the purpose of this comparison commercial activated carbon ac was chosen ac was chosen as the reference adsorbent material because of its wide acceptance and application in large scale adsorption processes acs are characterized by their high surface area microporous structure pore volume high adsorption capacity regenerability and amphoteric nature which allows them to adsorb both cationic and anionic pollutants 161 164 one major limitation of commercial acs however is their high cost owing to the fact that they are produced from non renewable and expensive materials such as coal 162 this has restricted the application of commercial ac as researchers are now turning their attention to low cost precursors such as bagasse pith coconut shell peat lignite and agricultural by products for the production of ac some relevant studies on the removal of cu2 using commercial ac were sourced and their adsorption capacities are reported in table 12 it could be observed by comparing table 12 which contains the adsorption capacities of commercial ac and tables 2 8 that more than 50 of the reported studies for each class of nano adsorbent reported in this study have adsorption capacities greater than those of commercial ac this could be due to the larger surface area of the former which implies the presence of more active sites for metallic uptake in addition nano adsorbents especially those with magnetic properties can be separated with ease by an external magnetic field making them highly regenerative and reusable this implies that the large scale implementation of nano adsorbents for cu2 removal from water and wastewater would benefit industries especially as it relates to its removal efficiency as compared to the commercial ac 12 conclusion and perspectives although copper is an essential element in trace amounts it can be very toxic when consumed beyond certain limits this study thoroughly reviewed the use of nano adsorbents in sequestering copper ions from the aqueous environment with a focus on works published in the last decade 2011 2021 it was observed that magnetic nanoparticles mnps were the best class of nano adsorbents and the most commonly used for the uptake of copper ions while aerogels were the least commonly used the highest adsorption capacity 1937 5 mg g reported within this timeframe was obtained experimentally with the aerogel class while most of the nano adsorbents all classes showed high removal efficiencies 90 the langmuir and freundlich models were best used to describe the adsorption isotherm for the majority of the nano adsorbents while the kinetic model fitted well with the pseudo second model depending on the nature of the adsorbent adsorbate interactions the adsorption mechanisms were physisorption and or chemisorption some of the nano adsorbents can easily be recovered and reused especially the mnps because of their magnetism with most of them maintaining up to 90 efficiency even after 3 5 rounds of reuse factors affecting the adsorption process were also discussed with the maximum adsorption capacity occurring at an optimal temperature of 25 c and ph of 2 8 for most of the nano adsorbents even though much work has been done on the adsorption of copper ions using nano materials there is still so much to do in this field of study firstly the use of some nano adsorbents such as aerogels nano fibers and carbon based materials for the treatment of copper polluted water needs to be explored as some of these materials especially aerogels hold great promises secondly studies on copper adsorption such as adsorption mechanisms thermodynamic modelling competitive adsorption column adsorption and regeneration studies should be encouraged because these studies enable us to understand the adsorption process better and optimally while also encouraging the industrial usage of nano adsorbents finally future studies should focus on mechanistic knowledge of adsorption the creation of new nano adsorbents and their lifecycles as well as the application of additional kinetic models based on statistical parameters

13045,adsorption using different adsorbents is seen as the most effective method of treating wastewater contaminated by heavy metal ions such as copper ions in particular nano adsorbents have emerged as the state of the art materials for heavy metal removal because of their unique physicochemical properties the aim of this study was to review the progress made in the last decade 2011 2021 on the removal of copper ions from aqueous environment relevant works were sourced and carefully analysed the findings revealed that various classes of nano adsorbents have been employed in the copper ion removal among which magnetic nanoparticles mnps 43 4 was the most frequently used class while aerogels 1 2 are the least frequently used class of nano adsorbents best results were obtained by the modification functionalization of the nano adsorbents with other materials which resulted in an increase in their specific surface area the majority of the nano adsorbents showed high removal efficiencies 90 while the highest adsorption capacity 1937 5 mg g was obtained experimentally with the aerogel class the adsorption isotherm fitted well with the langmuir and freundlich models while the kinetic data provided the best correlation with the pseudo second order kinetic model for most of the nano adsorbents the mnps in particular showed high reusability with most of them maintaining high efficiencies even after 3 5 rounds of regeneration effective treatment of copper contaminated wastewater can therefore be achieved with the use of nano adsorbents as a novel non toxic and cost effective technique of adsorption graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption copper nano adsorbent nano material pollution wastewater 1 introduction water an essential source of life sustenance has suffered increased contamination over the past decades 1 increased industrial activities have resulted in the contamination of many water bodies with a number of pollutants that exceed the allowable limit for wastewater 2 more than 650 different pollutants have been reported in wastewater including dyes phenols pharmaceuticals pesticides and heavy metals 3 among these heavy metals are the major concerns for environmental and human health because of their non biodegradability and accumulation heavy metals can be introduced into the environment through natural sources such as rainwater soil erosion and rock weathering 4 but the main sources of heavy metals are through human activities particularly wastewaters released from various industries such as mining paper fertilizer petroleum tannery battery production electroplating pigment leather and plastic industries 5 9 the most dangerous heavy metals according to the united states environmental protection agency usepa are arsenic mercury cadmium lead chromium and copper 4 copper is an abundant trace element found in a number of rocks and minerals and whose divalent form cu2 is relatively known for its negative effects 10 12 although an essential element needed in human health in trace amounts copper can be very toxic when consumed beyond permissible limits copper is the third most used metal in the world 13 it is widely used as an algicide in ornamental ponds water supply reservoirs and various industries where when released as wastewater gets distributed in water bodies and contaminates drinking water 14 16 copper is the second most toxic metal in drinking water after mercury 5 in high concentrations copper can cause abdominal pain vomiting diarrhoea nausea liver and kidney damage cramps in the calves and gastrointestinal irritation 17 18 today water contamination with copper ions is a serious environmental issue as copper can permeate both surface and groundwater systems 19 the control and removal of copper from water therefore becomes imperative about 20 25 of human copper consumption is accounted for by drinking water 20 table 1 shows the acceptable limit of copper in drinking water by various bodies and countries copper like other heavy metals can accumulate in the human body and cause adverse health effects such as high blood pressure kidney and liver respiratory damage cramps vomiting and even death 5 the oxidative potential of copper may be the plausible reason for its toxicity as it produces oxidative damage to the biological system including peroxidation of lipids and other macromolecules 22 studies have shown that elevated concentrations of copper can lead to oxidative stress hepatocirrhosis renal dysfunction and stimulation of the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal 23 in aquatic life the toxicity of copper includes both chronic effects such as reduced growth and lifespan impaired fertility and behavioural alterations and acute effects such as death 24 johnson et al 10 showed that exposure to copper significantly decreased the survival of zebrafish embryos with the highest effect exerted during the sensitive stages of gastrulation and segmentation in plants high concentrations of copper may result in the damage of cell membranes leading to cell death decreased plant cover and growth and causing general ecological damage 25 several conventional methods have been employed in the removal of copper from the aqueous environment including ion exchange 26 oxidation reduction 27 chemical precipitation 28 electrodialysis 29 and solvent extraction 30 however some of these methods are characterized by high cost of operation high sensitivity to operational conditions significant energy consumption and generation of waste residues 31 33 adsorption on the other hand is regarded as the most effective and promising method of removing heavy metals from wastewater even in low concentrations 34 36 nano materials are materials with a particle size of between 1 and 100 nm 37 39 they have been receiving a great deal of attention in science and technology because of their magnetic catalytic and adsorptive properties 13 40 it is believed that many of the environmental issues associated with water quality can be addressed using nanoparticles nps nano filtration or other techniques developed from nanotechnology 41 the application of nano adsorbents in the removal of toxic metals from wastewater over conventional adsorbents such as activated carbon and biomass is as a result of their numerous advantages that include their size high surface area and recyclability 42 43 several reviews exist in literature on the adsorption of heavy metals using nano adsorbents wadhawan et al 6 kaushal singh 44 thekkudan et al 7 and kyzas matis 42 are among those who have contributed in this field of study these reviews are however generic and fail to give an in depth knowledge of the adsorption of the specific metals a lot of papers have been published in the last decade on the treatment of copper containing wastewaters with nano adsorbents but to the best of our knowledge no attempt has been made to bring these findings together for easy comprehension the aim of this study was therefore to provide a summary of information related to the use of nano adsorbents for the removal of cu2 ions from aqueous solutions with a focus on studies completed and published within the last decade 2011 2021 adsorption process parameters were also discussed as well as recommendations and the way forward this review will also serve as a guide for future researchers working on the mitigation of this toxic pollutant 2 methodology only peer reviewed articles written in english were considered for this study between september 2021 and december 2021 scopus google scholar and science direct databases were searched and relevant articles were downloaded various search phrases were utilized to identify as many relevant papers as possible such as copper adsorption nanoadsorbent copper adsorption nanoparticle and copper adsorption nanocomposite the search was restricted to only articles published within the past decade 2011 2021 so as to obtain the most recent studies carried out in this field for this review only applied research articles were selected duplicate articles and review articles were not considered a total of 83 publications that met all the criteria were selected from all the articles examined and these served as the bedrock of this study the nano adsorbents employed in the removal of cu2 from aqueous solutions in the last decade were grouped into seven different classes fig 1 this was done for the sake of convenience and to provide clarity on the different nano sized adsorbents used in the timeframe under consideration a nano adsorbent can fall into two or more groups depending on the modification functionalization nevertheless the classification was done taking into account the initial nano adsorbent before the modification and considering only nano materials whose diameter ranges between 1 and 100 nm the classifications include i magnetic nanoparticles ii nanoscale metals metallic oxides iii carbon based nanoadsorbents iv polymer based nanoadsorbents v clay based nanoadsorbents vi nanofibers vii aerogels 3 adsorption as a method for the removal of copper ions adsorption is preferred over other methods of removing heavy metal ions from wastewater because of its simplicity in design low cost of operation and high resistance to heavy metals 34 35 45 it is highly dependent on the surface chemistry of the adsorbent and the adsorbate 46 47 one of the major challenges of the adsorption process is choosing an adsorbent suitable for the uptake of a particular pollutant when selecting the choice of the adsorbent to be used several properties such as porosity specific surface area adsorption capacities reusability among others are taken into consideration 48 in addition an adsorbent s particle size pore volume and pore size also play an important role in the adsorption process 49 50 an ideal adsorbent should be able to provide sufficient binding sites for effective adsorption of the pollutants 6 51 adsorption capacity q max and removal efficiency re are the two most important features of adsorption as they determine the effectiveness of an adsorbent in removing the adsorbates 24 adsorption capacity is an inherent feature of an adsorbent towards the adsorbate while removal efficiency depends on the adsorbate s concentration and dosage as well as the competing ions in the system 24 52 the adsorption process is also controlled by several other factors such as the ph of the solution contact time initial metal ion concentration the adsorbent dose and the temperature adsorption equilibrium is another essential feature of an adsorption study that gives information regarding the capacity of the adsorbent to remove metal ions under optimal conditions 53 equilibrium data is determined using isotherm models such as langmuir and freundlich models and kinetic models such as pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso models several adsorbents have been utilized for the adsorption of cu2 ions from the aqueous environment including carbon based compounds 54 55 clays and minerals 56 57 polymers and resins 58 59 agricultural wastes 60 61 among others however some of these adsorbents suffer from poor adsorption capacity or removal efficiency of the metal ions 5 moreover some of them show weak recovery of the adsorbate in bulk solutions due to their diffusion inadequacy and insufficiency of active binding sites 62 nano adsorbents have since emerged as the state of the art material that addresses some of these shortcomings in wastewater treatment 4 nano adsorbents for cu2 uptake nanotechnology has been playing a major role in addressing the problems of health energy and water quality the use of nano materials as nano adsorbents in the removal of contaminants from wastewater has been gaining interest over the last decade because of their unique properties and morphologies the properties of nano materials are studied using transmission electron microscopy tem dynamic light scattering dls scanning electron microscopy sem fourier transform infrared ftir microscopy x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps x ray diffraction xrd thermogravimetric analysis tga and brunauer emmett teller bet analysis fig 2 shows an example of the morphology and imaging of the nano adsorbent nano sio2 crosslinked chitosan nano tio2 synthesized by mahmoud et al 63 and characterized by sem and tem techniques as can be observed the images showed aggregated spherical nanoparticles nps a property of a material in nano sized scale they also showed homogeneous distributions of the nps on a uniform surface with the size of the synthesized material ranging from 14 to 40 nm most nano materials are available in fine powder form as they are synthesized as suspensions in liquids thus making them unsuitable for adsorption 48 64 as a result they are used with the support of other materials to increase their porosity and surface area modification of the surface of the nps gives stability to the particles and produces molecular makeup substantially different from the core of the nps which confers on them properties that facilitate increased adsorption 7 the nano adsorbents employed in the removal of cu2 from aqueous solutions in the last decade were grouped into seven different classes as discussed in section 2 from fig 3 it was observed that magnetic nanoparticles were the most frequent class of nano adsorbents employed for the removal of copper ions from the aqueous environment this was followed by nanoscale metals metallic oxides polymer based clay based carbon based nano fiber and lastly aerogels 4 1 magnetic nanoparticles magnetic nanoparticles mnps are iron oxide based nano adsorbents with magnetic properties that facilitates their separation from water after adsorption based on high gradient magnetic separation hgms 64 included in this group are magnetite fe3o4 maghemite γ fe2o4 hematite α fe2o3 and all modified iron oxide magnetite is the commonest magnetic core used in adsorption studies though in aqueous solution it quickly oxidizes to maghemite the more stable magnetic oxide 41 mnps are the most commonly used class of nano adsorbent due to their special properties such as extreme small size high surface area to volume ratio and the absence of internal diffusion resistance which provides much better kinetics for adsorption 65 in addition chemical inertness high degree of dispersion and biocompatibility have all been reported for mnps 66 raw mnps are however easily oxidized by the surrounding environment and may leach into low ph media and become toxic 19 also their high surface area and energy makes them susceptible to aggregation in solutions leading to decreased sorption capacity and restricting their applications 19 much focus has therefore been on the surface modification of mnps with core shell nanostructures such as polymers 67 68 clays 69 activated carbon 16 70 biomass 71 among others to compensate for their limitations it has been reported that functionalization of mnps with natural adsorbents increases their pollutant removal efficiency by 20 30 times greater than the un functionalized material 69 72 mnps can be prepared using various techniques such as solvothermal hydrothermal thermal decomposition sol gel and chemical vapour deposition 4 73 cui et al 74 synthesized a magnetic nano composite by co precipitation via embedding of ferro feric oxide into magnesium hydroxyapatite for the removal of cu2 ions from solution at optimum conditions an adsorption capacity of 305 mg g was achieved at an optimum of 0 32 g l adsorbent dose 90 min of contact time ph 5 9 and a temperature of 25 c hosseinzadeh ramin 49 synthesized a novel magnetic chitosan graphene oxide nano composite by the copolymerization of graphene oxide with ethylenediamine mnps and chitosan g poly acrylic acid co 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropane sulfonic acid the adsorbent showed a high specific surface area 132 9 m2 g a large pore volume 4 03 cm3 g and a small particle size 15 nm a high adsorption capacity of 217 4 mg g was obtained with the adsorption process following the pso and langmuir isotherm models in another study ge et al 68 prepared a magnetic nano composite by modification of mnps with 3 amino propyltriethoxysilane and copolymers of acrylic acid and crotonic acid the adsorption capacity of cu2 ions removal was found to be 126 9 mg g at ph 5 5 temperature of 25 c and dosage of 1 g l demonstrating the effectiveness of the prepared nano adsorbent badruddoza et al 65 synthesized a novel nano adsorbent by surface modification of mnps with carboxymethyl β cyclodextrin and obtained a maximum cu2 ion adsorption capacity of 47 2 mg g at 25 c while wang et al 75 effectively removed cu2 ions from aqueous solution using mnps whose surface area is 115 3 m2 g obtaining an adsorption capacity of 8 90 mg g after 240 min furthermore nano magnetite fe3o4 nps and kaolinite functionalized magnetite nps mag kl were synthesized by lasheen et al 66 the adsorption process follows the langmuir isotherm and pso kinetics with a maximum adsorption capacity of 138 and 98 mg g at contact times of 60 and 120 min for fe3o4 nps and mag kl nps respectively a major downside of mnps though is the cost of obtaining large external magnetic fields to overcome opposing forces encountered especially when the size of the nps is very small 12 nm 4 table 2 presents more comprehensive information on the adsorption of cu2 ions using mnps in general magnetic nano adsorbents showed high specific surface area which is further enhanced by their ease of functionalization their magnetic property also means they can be regenerated and reused several times as can be seen in table 2 4 2 nano scale metals metallic oxides nanoparticles grouped into metallic nano adsorbents include metallic nps bimetallic nps metallic oxide nps metallic nano sheets nano zerovalent metals and functionalized metallic nps nano zerovalent metals are very stable have a greater surface area and are non toxic the drawback of nano scale zerovalent metals is their accumulation in effluent after treatment 96 dada et al 97 studied the adsorption of cu2 ions onto nano scale zerovalent manganese synthesized by chemical reduction with a surface area of 131 4 m2 g the adsorbent showed a high monolayer adsorption capacity of 181 82 mg g at ph 5 0 with a high removal efficiency 99 this result demonstrated the potential of nanoscale zerovalent manganese as a novel nano adsorbent for the uptake of heavy metals and can be recommended for wastewater treatment in an industrial setting rafiq et al 98 prepared magnesium and zinc oxide nano adsorbents for the removal of copper ions from electroplating industry wastewater both adsorbents possessed high adsorption capacities of 226 and 593 mg g for mgo and zno adsorbents respectively showing the efficiency of the low cost nano adsorbent in the treatment of heavy metal contaminated effluents the experimental results for the adsorption of cu2 ions by γ alumina nps were found to follow the freundlich isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic models and the adsorption capacity was 31 30 mg g at a contact time of 240 min an adsorbent dose of 5 g l and a 200 mg l metallic ion concentration 99 the study showed that both metal oxide nps can serve as effective cheap and eco friendly nano adsorbents for treating effluents from the electroplating industry prabu et al 96 investigated the potential of nano scale zerovalent iron impregnated cashew nut shells to uptake cu2 the adsorption process was hugely influenced by the operating parameters and 100 removal efficiency was obtained at optimum conditions in 40 min table 3 gives more details on the adsorptive removal of cu2 ions using metals metallic oxides the major disadvantage of metals metallic oxide nano adsorbents is their potential to become unstable during their reduction to nano scale when increasing their surface area this instability can leave them liable to agglomeration because of the presence of van der waals forces and their interactions 4 this could also limit their ability to adsorb other heavy metals in wastewater 7 notwithstanding this class of nano adsorbents showed high removal efficiencies for all the reported studies as can be seen in table 3 4 3 carbon based nano adsorbents these are carbon containing nano sized adsorbents the most commonly used adsorbents in this class are graphene and nanotubes graphene is a two dimensional nanomaterial prepared by the chemical oxidation of natural graphite 108 carbon nanotubes cnts are made up of cylindrical graphite sheets an allotropic form of carbon rolled up into a tube like structure 5 cnts possess exceptional electrical chemical and physical properties and are widely used for the removal of contaminants from wastewater due to their large specific surface area small size hollow and layered structure and marked electrical conductivities that often result in high sorption capacities 109 111 cnts are divided into two types based on their structure single wall cnts swcnts and multi wall cnts mwcnts swcnts are made up of a single shell of graphene containing cylindrical shapes whereas mwcnts are made up of multiple layers of graphene sheets 5 112 onundi et al 113 successfully synthesized cnts on granular activated carbon for the removal of various heavy metals from wastewater at ph 5 1 g l dosage 2 mg l metal concentration and 60 min contact time 60 removal efficiency was obtained for cu2 ions as synthesized mwcnts as mwcnts and oxidized mwcnts ox mwcnts prepared by egbosiuba abdulkareem 114 showed remarkable high specific surface areas of 1140 and 1210 m2 g and subsequently high adsorption capacities of 364 7 and 416 5 mg g for as mwcnts and ox mwcnts respectively after only 30 min the high adsorption capacities as well as the stability and reusable nature of the nano materials make them ideal candidates for several industrial applications including wastewater treatment eftekhari et al 115 prepared a folic acid coated graphene oxide nano composite and obtained a maximum computational adsorption capacity of 116 3 mg g and a removal efficiency of 91 5 copper ion removal using carbon based nano adsorbents is presented in table 4 the major limitations of this class of nano adsorbents include the toxicity of cnts that affect human health selectivity and low removal efficiency due to the non reactivity of the cnt walls 4 nonetheless the low removal efficiency can easily be overcome by modification with chemicals 4 4 polymer based nano adsorbents nano sized polymer materials are ideal nano adsorbents because of their large surface area perfect mechanical rigidity turnable surface chemistry and pore size distribution as well as their regenerative ability 4 they include bio based polymers such as cellulose and chitosan alginate and polydopamine as well as hydrogels chitosan is a biopolymer produced by de acetylation of the polysaccharide chitin obtained from the shells of crustaceans and fungal biomass 77 80 chitosan is hydrophilic non toxic environmentally friendly and biocompatible and forms complexes when in combination with other metals 6 alginate is extracted from brown seaweed and it is also non toxic biocompatible and biodegradable 116 hydrogels are a type of polymeric material with a three dimensional cross linked structure that can absorb and retain large amounts of water without dissolving 117 they can easily be regenerated without any significant decrease in their sorption capacity 117 alsabagh et al 118 prepared a multifunctional nano composite based on chitosan modified with silver nps copper nps and cnts for the uptake of cu2 ions from solution the removal efficiency of the adsorbent reached 100 in 60 min and the adsorbent dosage amount was 1 g l with a langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of 70 40 mg g this multifunctional nanomaterial was regenerated and reused up to five times showing its prowess as a promising water purification material farnad et al 119 used polydopamine with a mean diameter of 75 nm to achieve a maximum adsorption capacity of 34 4 mg g at a dosage of 0 8 g l a polyethyleneimine based nano adsorbent polyethyleneimine sio2 γ fe3o4 was prepared by plohl et al 120 for effective metal removal the nano adsorbent showed a maximum removal of 143 mg g at ph 6 and could be reused up to four times without significant loss in adsorption capacity the recyclability and extraordinary properties of the amino rich material make it an effective stable and environmentally friendly material for the sequestration of heavy metals from sludge awual 121 developed a ligand based hydrogel composite that showed a specific surface of 379 m2 g and an adsorption capacity of 171 3 mg g 99 efficiency using langmuir equations in furtherance barati et al 122 functionalized a nano composite hydrogel based on poly methacrylamide co acrylic acid and nano sized montmorillonite for copper containing effluent treatment the adsorbent showed good affinity for the metallic ion with an adsorption capacity of 46 94 mg g at ph 6 8 and a temperature of 45 c this result is enough for the nano composite to be regarded as a low cost and efficient adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals from solutions the disadvantage of polymer based nano adsorbents is the difficulty of synthesizing them with good selectivity to the target pollutant and also the difficulty of recycling them particularly when they are of low purity 7 table 5 shows the complete data on polymer based nano adsorbents for the uptake of copper ions 4 5 clay based nano adsorbents clays are hydrous alumina silicates that include crystalline and amorphous fibrous minerals such as carbonates and metal oxides 129 clay minerals are known for their adsorptive properties which can be enhanced by modification in several ways including acid treatment calcinations intercalation pillaring among others 130 azzam et al 130 beneficiated the surface of natural clay with chitosan ag nps and chitosan au nps adsorbents showed good adsorption capacities of 181 5 mg g and 100 removal efficiency in both cases after 60 min the results of these hybrid composites suggest their suitability for hg2 uptake from water shabani et al 131 investigated the adsorptive properties of diatomite nps whose bet surface area is 119 5 m2 g langmuir calculations revealed the adsorption capacity as 142 86 mg g at room temperature and ph 4 5 thus the nano mineral that is locally available in high quantity and cheap showed high efficiency to remove the metal ions from aqueous solution an iron oxide modified montmorillonite with a diameter of 8 24 nm was synthesized by kalantari et al 132 for the removal of various heavy metals from solution the adsorbent showed a high cu2 ion removal efficiency of 94 9 in another study saadat et al 129 used montmorillonite doped with al2o3 nps to achieve 99 copper ion removal from industrial wastewater the clayey nano adsorbent was used up to four times without washing showing its high effectiveness table 6 is a summary of cu2 uptake using clay based nano adsorbents in general clay minerals represent a promising and abundant natural nano adsorbent that can be beneficiated for not just metal ion uptake but several other water treatment purposes 4 6 nano fibers electrospun nano fiber membranes have become an important one dimensional nanomaterial that can be used in a wide range of applications due to their special physicochemical properties and characteristics 133 134 these properties such as high porosity high permeability and ease of separation from water make them exceptional wastewater treatment materials 135 136 nano fibers can be prepared from various materials including both natural and synthetic polymers carbon containing materials semiconducting materials and composite nano materials by a process known as electrospinning 134 137 the study of electrospun nano fiber membranes for wastewater treatment however is still in an early stage and only a few studies have reported their use in heavy metal removal 135 garcía díaz et al 138 studied the adsorption of cu2 ions using carbon nano fiber and achieved a maximum adsorption capacity of 8 80 mg g at ph 4 while the experimental data fitted well with langmuir isotherm and pso kinetic models the helical carbon nano fiber proved a potential adsorbent in the treatment of cu2 contaminated effluent yari et al 53 prepared mercapto groups functionalized electrospun ceo2 nano fiber which showed a specific surface area of 163 6 m2 g and a high sorption capacity of 263 4 mg g at 45 c in addition polyaniline nano fibers doped with chlorine and phytic acid were fabricated by kim et al 139 the ph dependent adsorption process showed the adsorption capacity of the phytic acid doped polyaniline fiber 5 29 mg g was 4 times higher than that of chlorinated nano fiber 1 28 mg g using the langmuir calculations at ph 5 3 this study clearly showed how surface functionalization can incredibly enhance the sorption capacity of an adsorbent and was recommended for metal recovery in mining and water purification table 7 contains more detailed information on the use of nano fibers of nanometer size as adsorbents for the removal of cu2 ions reported during the review period 4 7 aerogels aerogels are highly porous and networked materials that have received increased attention as adsorbents for removing heavy metal ions from wastewater because of their extraordinary number of properties 140 they are new materials in adsorptive wastewater treatment with high removal efficiency lightweight flexibility non toxicity recyclability and ph and water stability 141 142 the adsorption capacities of aerogels are however quite low because of a lack of surface affinity groups hence they are always functionalized with other materials prior to adsorption 140 shahnaz et al 142 fabricated a nanobentonite modified nanocellulose chitosan aerogel which showed excellent removal efficiency of cu2 ions 99 with an experimental adsorption capacity of 1937 5 mg g the highest reported in this study the halsey isotherm and pso kinetic models best described the adsorption process this study demonstrated that aerogel can serve as a cheap substitute for high cost conventional adsorbents consequently more studies on this class of nano adsorbents are needed to further buttress this fact table 8 summarizes these findings 5 effect of process parameters 5 1 effect of ph water contaminated with heavy metals from industrial effluents is known to show different ph values depending on the type of industrial activities that produce the effluents 18 the ph of the solution is a very important parameter in the adsorption process because it affects the solubility of the metal ions the concentration of the counter ion on the adsorbent functional groups and the ionization degree of the adsorbent during reaction 69 82 147 generally the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent for heavy metals increases as the ph increases 148 the adsorption capacity of cu2 ions on nh2 mnps increased from 1 76 mg g to 22 4 mg g as the ph increased from 1 0 to 6 0 78 showing the high dependency of the adsorption process on the solution ph also the adsorption capacity of cnts on granular ac increased significantly as the ph of the solution increased from 3 to 5 but decreased above ph 5 113 however this is not always the case as adsorbent efficiencies have been found to decrease as ph increases the adsorption capacity of magnetic chitosan graphene oxide nano composite was found to decrease as the solution ph increased 49 this was attributed to the presence of excess h ions that competes with the cationic ions for adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface the ph of point of zero charge phpzc is the solution ph when the net charge of the adsorbent surface is zero 149 when the ph phpzc the adsorbent surface is protonated and positively charged but when the ph phpzc the surface is deprotonated and negatively charged 5 2 effect of contact time contact time plays a significant role in the adsorptive removal of pollutants from aqueous solutions it gives an idea of the time taken to attain equilibrium and also describes the kinetics of the removal of the metal ions by the nano adsorbents 77 79 contact time is particularly important when dealing with economic evaluation and practical applicability of the adsorbent in water treatment 18 48 most of the studied articles reported a similar pattern for the contact time effects a rapid removal of cu2 ions for a certain period of time and then a drastic reduction before reaching equilibrium the amount of metal ions adsorbed in the rapid stage is a result of the many binding sites on the adsorbent surface but this decreases as the adsorption continues before equilibrium is attained 67 in the adsorption of the metal ions onto magnesium hydroxyapatite 74 the process was found to be comprised of two phases a primary rapid phase and a secondary slow phase most of the cu2 removal was achieved from the rapid phase that lasted for approximately 70 min while the adsorption reached its maximum at 90 min which showed saturation of the active points in the same vein a very fast removal within the first 5 min was observed with bentonite mnps followed by a slower removal speed and finally the gradual attainment of the equilibrium state 69 5 3 effect of nano adsorbent dosage the dosage of the nano adsorbents is a very important parameter that influences the removal efficiency of the metal ions in solution it determines the adsorption capacity of a catalytic agent for a given initial concentration of the metal ion in operating conditions 72 it also controls the capacity of the adsorbent for a given solution 62 an increase in adsorbent dose will result in a rapid adsorption of the metal ion onto the adsorbent surface leading to de concentration of the adsorbate in the solution and consequently unsaturation of the adsorbents active site 98 the removal efficiency of cu2 ions rose from 33 1 to 99 5 as the dose of chitosan coated mnps increased from 0 4 to 3 2 g l 77 while an increase in bamboo supported manganese nano composite dosage increased the cu2 ions removal from 65 6 to 100 22 this increase is as a result of an increase in the active binding sites of the adsorbent as its dosage increases in the study using rice husk synthesized nano cellulose 13 the removal efficiency of the metal ions increased from 75 to 97 as the amount of the adsorbent increased but decreased in adsorption capacity from 18 79 to 4 88 mg g under the same conditions this is a result of overlapping of the adsorbent s active sites due to excessive crowding of the adsorbent molecules 5 4 effect of temperature temperature is another important factor that significantly affects the adsorption of copper from wastewater onto nano adsorbents this is because industrial effluents are released at varying temperatures 98 it is also known that any change in reaction temperature in most chemical reactions and processes will influence the adsorption efficiency of a solid surface 124 various temperatures ranging from 25 c to 70 c have been reported as the optimum temperature however most of the maximum adsorption capacities occurred at room temperature 25 c an increase in temperature can either lead to an increase in adsorption capacity 53 131 as a result of an increase in effective collision between the adsorbent adsorbate phases or a decrease in adsorption capacity 2 77 as a result of a decrease in the surface activity of the adsorbent the results obtained from the temperature effect on polydopamine nps revealed that the adsorption capacity decreased from 36 mg g at 25 c to 18 mg g at 50 c indicating an exothermic process 119 while an increased efficiency up to 99 8 was achieved with an increase in temperature for cu2 ion adsorption onto bamboo supported manganese nano composite 22 which implies that the adsorption process is endothermic 5 5 effect of initial copper ion concentration the initial concentration of the metal ion accounts for the mass transfer resistance of the adsorbate from the bulk of the solution to the adsorbent surface 124 the effects of the metal ion concentration are dependent on the immediate relationship between the concentration of the ions and the available binding sites on the surface of the adsorbent 2 increasing the concentration of cu2 ions increases the adsorption capacities of the nano adsorbents and this is the major trend reported for most of the articles this may be as a result of the interaction between the metal ions and the nano adsorbents which provides the driving force to overcome the resistance to the mass transfer of metal ions between the aqueous solution and the adsorbent 62 67 however a few of the studied papers also reported a decrease in removal efficiency as the metal ion concentration increased the percentage removal of cu2 ions by tio2 nps decreased from 98 to 90 as the initial concentration of the adsorbate ions increased with the maximum removal efficiency obtained at a metal ion concentration of 10 mg l 106 while the removal efficiency decreased from 99 8 to 90 1 for nanoscale zerovalent iron impregnated cashew nut shell as the initial concentrations of cu2 ions increased from 20 to 100 mg l 96 6 isotherm and kinetic models the adsorption isotherm and kinetic models are key factors in describing the interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate the models express the chemical kinetics during the adsorption of the metal ions at constant temperature and equilibrium conditions 46 150 the langmuir and freundlich models are the most frequently used models in describing the adsorption isotherm in the removal of cu2 ions using nano adsorbents the langmuir model is based on the assumption that the maximum adsorption is equivalent to a saturated monolayer of adsorbate molecules on the surface of the adsorbent 151 while the freundlich model is an indication of the surface heterogeneity of the adsorbent 75 notwithstanding other models have also been used in describing the adsorption of cu2 ions by nano adsorbents they include redlich peterson 77 toth 77 temkin 43 62 sips langmuir freundlich 11 76 86 118 dubinin radushkevich 97 145 and halsey 142 isotherm models the equations of these models are presented in table 9 the adsorption kinetics determines the reaction limiting phase of the adsorption process the dominant model used in describing the adsorption kinetic of the nano adsorbents is the pseudo second order pso model the model assumes that the chemisorption involving exchange of electron between adsorbate and adsorbent molecules is the rate limiting step of adsorption 153 154 however there are few cases where other kinetic models were used including pseudo first order pfo 98 double exponential 53 76 and intra particle diffusion 111 models table 10 shows the equations of the different kinetic models 7 adsorption mechanism the adsorption capacities of the nano adsorbents in the uptake of cu2 ions can be described by several mechanisms the ph of a solution the point of zero charge phzc isotherm and kinetic models and desorption studies all play important roles in determining an adsorption mechanism analytical techniques such as ftir and xrd can also be used to determine the adsorption mechanism as they indicate the functional groups in the system and their sites of interaction 46 in general adsorption mechanisms can occur by physisorption and or chemisorption depending on the nature of the adsorbent adsorbate interactions 155 156 the mechanism of adsorption of the cu2 ion by the nano adsorbents is summarized in table 11 these are the findings reported in the articles under review as some of the papers simply reported the adsorption process but not the mechanism notably the nanofiber and aerogel classes complexation and ion exchange dominate the mechanism of adsorption for all the classes of nano adsorbents these are chemical mechanisms chemisorption which have also been generalized as the uptake mechanism in some studies 82 85 92 128 chemisorptions are strong bonds of interaction that can be ionic or covalent in nature 157 in the mnps class electrostatic attraction 70 86 and repulsion 76 89 were also reported as the uptake mechanisms the attraction and repulsion of molecules with opposite charges are referred to as electrostatic interaction 158 the mechanism of the adsorption of cu2 ions onto nh2 magnetic nanobiochar is shown in fig 4 76 the adsorbents get protonated at lower ph to form nh3 cations which results in electrostatic repulsion between the bindings of cu2 ions on their surfaces the binding of the ions was facilitated at higher ph levels as more binding sites became available electrostatic attraction occurs between the functional groups of amino and hydroxyl groups on the adsorbent adsorbate surfaces 76 aside from complexation and ion exchange intra particle diffusion 20 and surface precipitation 100 106 also served as the adsorption mechanisms for the metals metallic oxide nano adsorbent class primo et al 105 utilized zno nps for the metal ion removal the highest adsorption capacity was observed at ph phzc which implies that the adsorption may occur through non electrostatic interaction the adsorption mechanism was explained by the model of complex ion adsorption in hydrated solids where the cu2 ions interact with active groups oh on the surface of the oxide several mechanisms for copper ion adsorption on the surface of carboxyl cnts cnts cooh and hydroxyl cnts cnts oh have been reported 111 the binding on cnts oh was brought about by electrostatic interactions while chemical complexation and electrostatic attraction accounted for the binding on cnts cooh similar mechanisms were reported for both the polymer based and carbon based nano adsorbents as can be seen in table 11 8 effect of competing ions heavy metal ions are frequently found in aqueous solutions with alkaline or alkaline earth metal ions 68 the ionic strength of the solution can be altered by the presence of other ions species competing for the active sites on the surface of the nano adsorbents studying on the effects of competing ions is therefore important as it is used to ascertain the efficiency of the nano adsorbents to still remove the cu2 in the presence of other ions this study is particularly helpful in establishing the potential of a given nano adsorbent to be used in real wastewater treatment 155 a higher number of articles under review revealed that the presence of other ions in the solution decreased the adsorption capacity of the nano adsorbents for the cu2 ions while the rest reported that the presence of other ions did not affect the capacity of the nano adsorbents to remove cu2 in any way the adsorption capacity of ac modified mnps decreased with increased acidity as a result of the competition between ions and h ions for the same binding sites 16 the competition for adsorption sites with ca2 and na led to a decline in the adsorption of cu2 on tio2 106 with nano scale zerovalent manganese 20 the influence of competing species was studied using different ionic strengths of nacl solution it was found that an increase in na ions decreased the percentage removal of cu2 ions from 95 8 to 73 5 however the coexistence of k ca2 na and mg2 had no effect on the adsorption of cu2 onto magnesium hydroxyapatite mnps 74 9 regeneration and reuse desorption and regeneration of an adsorbent are always carried out to determine its reusability regeneration and reuse are very important integrals of adsorption studies as they help in establishing the adsorbent s industrial applicability this is particularly important because it also reduces the overall cost of the process 155 159 metal ions that have been adsorbed can be desorbed using an eluent such as acid or chelating agents 147 among the different classes of nano adsorbents for cu2 removal mnps are the easiest regenerative class owing to their magnetism which makes them easily separable by an external magnetic field 74 the desorption of cu2 ions from nano magnetic and kaolin functionalized mnps was carried out using hno3 as the eluent 66 the removal efficiency of the adsorbent was found to be between 90 and 96 after the first round of reuse and almost the same as the fresh ones even after five recycling rounds in the study using mnps coated with mixtures of sodium oleate and 2 ethyhexyl phosphonic acid 87 the removal efficiency was still very high 99 after the first four adsorption desorption cycles 96 after five cycles but decreased drastically to 46 9 after the seventh cycle this sharp decrease was attributed to extractant leakage and magnetic loss in the first cycle the adsorption capacity of cu2 onto regenerated two dimensional ti3c2tx mxene nano sheet was 80 but sharply decreased to 47 and 30 in the second and third rounds respectively 102 this is as a result of the partial oxidation of ti3c2tx into tio2 nps during adsorption and the incomplete desorption of the adsorbed metal ions the reusability of diatomite nps was investigated after being desorbed with 1 m of both nacl and nh4oh 131 although the adsorptive potential of the nano material decreased after four cycles due to a reduction in its surface area as a result of coagulation and agglomeration of the particles it was still able to retain over 80 of the initial adsorptive capacity the summary of these findings is presented in tables 2 8 10 performance evaluation of the nano adsorbents in real wastewater sample treatment determining the real water treatment potential of the nano adsorbents will go a long way towards justifying their claimed efficiencies and capacities this is particularly important because some of the known wastewater treatment adsorbents with up to 99 efficiency under optimum conditions always decrease to 90 or even less during real wastewater treatment 160 however studies on this are rarely reported in all the papers reviewed in this study only four investigated the real wastewater treatment performance of the used nano adsorbents 19 88 98 128 donia et al 128 investigated the potential of nano magnetic cellulose in actual wastewater treatment using effluents from battery factories the results obtained using inductive coupled plasma icp showed 95 6 cu2 removal from the effluents rafiq et al 98 obtained equally promising result for zno 92 4 97 6 and mgo 93 7 98 2 nps on actual industrial samples collected from electroplating industries on a seasonal variation basis collected in different months in a real world treatment analysis naghizadeh et al 88 investigated the potentials of fe3o4 egg shell membrane to recover cu2 ions from various water samples all samples showed high relative recovery ranging from 95 to 105 showing the suitability of the nano adsorbent in environmental samples similar results were obtained by abd ali et al 19 in the extraction of cu2 ions from various water samples using chrysin functionalized silica core shell nps with the relative recovery ranging from 96 8 105 these findings demonstrated the efficiencies of the nano adsorbents towards cu2 ions demonstrating their applicability in real world wastewater treatment more studies are however needed on all the classes of the nano adsorbents to fully establish these findings 11 comparison with commercial activated carbon this section compares the efficiency of nano adsorbents for cu2 removal to that of commercial adsorbents this comparison is important in a bid to determine the commercialization potential of nano adsorbents for cu2 adsorption for the purpose of this comparison commercial activated carbon ac was chosen ac was chosen as the reference adsorbent material because of its wide acceptance and application in large scale adsorption processes acs are characterized by their high surface area microporous structure pore volume high adsorption capacity regenerability and amphoteric nature which allows them to adsorb both cationic and anionic pollutants 161 164 one major limitation of commercial acs however is their high cost owing to the fact that they are produced from non renewable and expensive materials such as coal 162 this has restricted the application of commercial ac as researchers are now turning their attention to low cost precursors such as bagasse pith coconut shell peat lignite and agricultural by products for the production of ac some relevant studies on the removal of cu2 using commercial ac were sourced and their adsorption capacities are reported in table 12 it could be observed by comparing table 12 which contains the adsorption capacities of commercial ac and tables 2 8 that more than 50 of the reported studies for each class of nano adsorbent reported in this study have adsorption capacities greater than those of commercial ac this could be due to the larger surface area of the former which implies the presence of more active sites for metallic uptake in addition nano adsorbents especially those with magnetic properties can be separated with ease by an external magnetic field making them highly regenerative and reusable this implies that the large scale implementation of nano adsorbents for cu2 removal from water and wastewater would benefit industries especially as it relates to its removal efficiency as compared to the commercial ac 12 conclusion and perspectives although copper is an essential element in trace amounts it can be very toxic when consumed beyond certain limits this study thoroughly reviewed the use of nano adsorbents in sequestering copper ions from the aqueous environment with a focus on works published in the last decade 2011 2021 it was observed that magnetic nanoparticles mnps were the best class of nano adsorbents and the most commonly used for the uptake of copper ions while aerogels were the least commonly used the highest adsorption capacity 1937 5 mg g reported within this timeframe was obtained experimentally with the aerogel class while most of the nano adsorbents all classes showed high removal efficiencies 90 the langmuir and freundlich models were best used to describe the adsorption isotherm for the majority of the nano adsorbents while the kinetic model fitted well with the pseudo second model depending on the nature of the adsorbent adsorbate interactions the adsorption mechanisms were physisorption and or chemisorption some of the nano adsorbents can easily be recovered and reused especially the mnps because of their magnetism with most of them maintaining up to 90 efficiency even after 3 5 rounds of reuse factors affecting the adsorption process were also discussed with the maximum adsorption capacity occurring at an optimal temperature of 25 c and ph of 2 8 for most of the nano adsorbents even though much work has been done on the adsorption of copper ions using nano materials there is still so much to do in this field of study firstly the use of some nano adsorbents such as aerogels nano fibers and carbon based materials for the treatment of copper polluted water needs to be explored as some of these materials especially aerogels hold great promises secondly studies on copper adsorption such as adsorption mechanisms thermodynamic modelling competitive adsorption column adsorption and regeneration studies should be encouraged because these studies enable us to understand the adsorption process better and optimally while also encouraging the industrial usage of nano adsorbents finally future studies should focus on mechanistic knowledge of adsorption the creation of new nano adsorbents and their lifecycles as well as the application of additional kinetic models based on statistical parameters

13046,development of hydrophilic microfiltration carbon membrane mfcm is essential for improving the separation performance of oil water emulsion in this work a strategy was proposed to modify the microstructure and property of mfcm by surface synthesizing a hydrophilic polyethylene glutaraldehyde pvg coating the thermal stability functional groups morphology and porous structure of modified mfcm were characterized by thermogravimetric analyzer fourier transform infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscope and general weight difference filtration velocity techniques respectively the effects of coating types coating solution concentration on the structure and separation performance of mfcm for oily wastewater were investigated the results showed that the surface pvg coating was sufficiently stable to resist the aggressive system of oily wastewater both water permeation flux and oil rejection were significantly improved for mfcm after modification moreover the water permeation flux and oil rejection of mfcm respectively decreased and increased as the concentration of coating solution was increased the maximum oil rejection reached to 94 8 for mfcm modified with a pvg surface layer formed by coating a starting solution of 9 along with a permeation flux of 691 1 kg m2 h mpa graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microfiltration carbon membrane surface coating polyvinyl alcohol polyethylene glutaraldehyde oily wastewater 1 introduction the continuous deterioration of water resources has seriously threatened the human health in global the survival of animals and plants and the ecological security undoubtedly the problem is mainly attributed to a large variety of pollution from human activities such as agricultural reduction industrial sewage domestic wastewater discharge etc in particular many factories including textile producing pharmaceutics leather manufacturing paper making food processing and oil refining were preferred to build near rivers lakes and seashores for the sake of convenient transportation and saving cost 1 it further increase the possibility of contaminating surrounding water body due to oil leakage and sewage discharge 1 3 nowadays environmental awareness is increasingly strengthened with the improvement of social concerns and national emission standards 4 5 on the other hand it would also save a huge amount of losses if the valuable oil could be recovered from wastewater by proper means 6 7 at present oily wastewater is usually coped with the technologies of photocatalysis 8 9 adsorption 10 11 skimming air flotation 12 electrochemistry coagulation 13 and membrane separation 14 15 among the techniques membrane separation is regarded as one of the most promising candidates owing to the advantages of superior oil rejection simple process easy operation low energy consumption no chemical addition and little secondary pollution risk 16 18 nevertheless modification of membrane materials is still an everlasting hot topic in pursuit of high separation efficiency for improving the academic attractiveness and market competition generally speaking the separation performance of membranes for oily wastewater is closely related to their surface hydrophilicity and porous structure therefore great effort has been paid to enhance the hydrophilicity of porous membranes during the last two decades by various ways such as heterogeneous blending 19 molecular grafting 20 surface coating 21 etc heterogeneous blending could improve the permeation flux and surface wettability of membranes by incorporation of some hetero atom guest species depending on their hydrophilicity porous characteristics adsorption and affinity towards special penetrants 22 the species are titanium dioxide tio2 23 24 alumina al2o3 25 zirconium dioxide zro2 26 silicon dioxide sio2 27 28 and so forth unfortunately blending membranes are sometimes suffered from the serious loss of separation performance and flexibility due to bad compatibility and unwanted particle aggregation of fillers 29 molecular grafting can enhance the antifouling ability and hydrophilicity of membranes by introducing polar chemical groups e g hydroxyl carbonyl etc into the membrane surface through chemical reactions 30 adversely the introduced pending groups might reduce the permeation flux of membranes by blocking partial porous entrance in the membrane matrix 31 in comparison surface coating is an effective and feasible way for tailoring the membrane surface to achieve the desired performance 32 nevertheless traditionally physical attachment of coating layer on membranes is usually too weak to resist the mechanical flushing and aggressive invasion during long term filtration 33 35 therefore it is essential to construct a sufficiently stable and hydrophilic surface layer on membranes in order to greatly improve the separation performance and service duration for oily wastewater treatment previously our research team fabricated a microfiltration carbon membrane mfcm for purifying oily wastewater which exhibited quite well separation factors in addition to many attractive advantages over traditional membrane materials in terms of thermal resistance chemical inertness and mechanical strength 36 37 despite this the intrinsically weak surface hydrophilicity of mfcm has strictly inhibited the improvement in separation performance for the purpose of academic attractiveness and market competition regarding this here an attempt was made for the first time to modify mfcm by surface producing a hydrophilic polyethylene glutaraldehyde pvg layer to the best of our knowledge there is no report on the surface modification of mfcm with hydrophilic coating as reinforcing strategy for oily wastewater treatment we believe that the formed pvg layer would be greatly helpful for improving the surface hydrophilicity porous structure permeation flux and oil rejection of resultant mfcm in particular the pvg coating is expected to sustain excellent property even by the aggressive invasion of oily wastewater during filtration owing to chemical crosslinking formation on mfcm surface the schematics of the preparation and modification processes are illustrated in fig 1 supposedly the formed pvg layer could endow the surface of mfcm with more abundant hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups so as to largely enhance the hydrophilicity and separation efficiency moreover fig 2 gives the enhanced separation process of mfcm for emulsified oil water system in the presence of pvg coating hopefully the proposed modification would demonstrate a significant improvement in emulsified oil removal which allows its application for wastewater treatment purposes 2 experimental 2 1 raw materials thermoplastic phenolic resin powder with industrial grade was offered by henan xinxiang bomafengfan industrial ltd co polyvinyl alcohol polymerization deg 2600 was purchased from guangzhou chemical reagent and glass instrument co crosslinking agent glutaraldehyde ga sinopharma chemical reagent ltd co was used to produce pvg other reagents including hexamethylenetetramine shenyang reagent fifth factory sodium carboxymethyl cellulose liaoyang baitahongfeng cellulose factory and hcl sinopharma chemical reagent co ltd were all procured commercially without further purification 2 2 preparation and modification 2 2 1 preparation of mfcm first of all hexamethylenetetramine hmta was mixed into the thermoplastic phenolic resin pr powder in a mass ratio of 3 25 followed by curing at 150 c for 1 h and grinding into fine powder of particulate size beneath 100 meshes again after that sodium carboxy methyl cellulose nacmc was evenly dispersed into the pr powder in a mass fraction of 20 wt furthermore an appropriate amount of distilled water with a mass ratio of 1 2 over the total powder was adopted to assist the formation of a plasticine like dough by successive hand kneading after aging for 80 min the dough was compressed into dozens of circular plates with a diameter of 30 mm and thickness of 5 mm by a tablet machine at 4 mpa finally precursor membranes were obtained after drying for several days at ambient indoor condition subsequently the precursor membranes were carbonized in a horizontal furnace equipped with an automatic temperature controller under an atmosphere of 100 ml min flowing nitrogen the precursor membranes were first heated from room temperature to 400 c at 2 c min and dwelling for 2 h then ramped to 600 c at 1 c min and dwelling for 2 h next to 650 c at 0 5 c min and dwelling for 2 h before naturally cooling down to room temperature 2 2 2 surface modification of mfcm in this work in addition to pvg pva coating was also investigated to modify mfcm as a comparative study pva is a hydrophilic polymer well known for good film forming properties high water vapor permeance nontoxicity low cost biocompatibility and biodegradability 38 these properties of pva have led to its use in a variety of industry areas including chemical engineering pharmaceutics textiles medical devices and food additives 39 particularly the inherent hydrophilicity of pva makes it an attractive polymer for water treatment applications in the form of membranes 39 40 1 pva coating a certain amount of pva was dissolved into distilled water at 90 c for 30 min in a constant temperature water bath to form a solution with a concentration of 3 9 wt then three droplets approx 0 2 g of the solution were dropped and spread on the upper side of mfcm fixed horizontally in a desktop spreading machine by rotating for 15 s after standing for a while the coating layer was dried naturally the coated mfcm was marked as cm x pva where the x represented the concentration of used pva solution 2 pvg coating by the same means pvg layer was also coated on mfcm differently some ga solution with a concentration of 2 5 in water was mixed with 5 hcl in water to form a ga hcl solution in advance then the ga hcl solution was blended with pva solution 3 9 wt at a constant temperature of 40 c by rigorously stirring for 4 h to form a kind of sol herein the mass ratio of pva over ga equaled 1 0 01 in staring solution subsequently the as obtained sol was coated on the surface of mfcm to yield a polyvinyl alcohol glutaraldehyde pvg layer after ambient drying and curing as per the process of pva coating 41 42 the modified mfcm was labelled with cm y pvg where the letter y referred to the concentration of initial pva solution 2 3 characterization the surface functional groups of the samples were detected by a nicolet nexus470 atr fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir at a resolution of 1 4 cm 1 in a scanning wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 the thermal stability of the coatings was determined by a tga 4000 thermogravimetric analyzer tga under flowing nitrogen atmosphere of 20 ml min with a heating rate of 20 c min the morphology of mfcm was observed by a tm 3000 scanning electron microscope sem at an accelerated voltage of 15 kv in standard mode the surface hydrophilicity of membranes was evaluated by the images of water contact angles the images were taken by a jc2000d contact angle analyzer at the moment when the distilled water droplet was just touching the surface of the membranes the oil droplet size distributions of oil water emulsion were measured by a laser diffraction particle size analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 manufactured by malvern co the porous structure of carbon membranes was determined by bulk porosity and average pore radius the bulk porosity φ of the membranes was calculated by eq 1 43 1 φ w wet w dry ρ w al 100 where w wet and w dry are the weights of wet and dry membrane respectively kg ρ w the density of water 1004 06 kg m3 l the membrane thickness m a the effective membrane area m2 average pore radius r f μm was assessed by filtration velocity method on the

test of oily wastewater first a series of standard solutions of oily wastewater were made by fully smashing and uniformly dispersing crude oil droplets into double distilled water via vigorous smashing and ultrasonication more than 1 h the major characteristics of the crude oil was given in our previous report 45 namely the crude oil was mined from turmin oil fields in russia featuring with the properties of api of 35 7 sulfuric content of 0 53 density of 842 3 kg m3 and kinematic viscosity of 4 304 mm2 s 1 a standard equation was ultimately acquired by correlating the oil concentrations with their function of absorbance of oil in water solutions by a uv1800 pc uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 220 nm the water permeation flux and oil rejection of mfcm were calculated by the following eq 3 and eq 4 respectively 3 j w 600 t s where j w t s and 600 referred to the permeation flux kg m2 h the accumulated weight of penetrating fluid g the elapsed running time min and the effective area of mfcm cm2 and the conversion factor for normalized units respectively 4 r 1 c p c f 100 where r c p and cf were the oil rejection and the oil concentrations mg l of permeate side and feed side respectively the oil concentration at the penetrating stream was detected in real time by the uv vis spectrophotometer and the afore mentioned standard equation in the preparation of feed emulsions no surfactant was applied in the system with respect to environmental and practical concerns hence all the emulsions were prepared just before filtration test in order to prevent any possible side effect such as agglomeration and sedimentation of the oil droplets in actual the oil droplet size distribution of the prepared emulsified oil water solution is stable enough over time as shown in fig 3 obviously the oil droplets size is mainly located in the range of 0 3 1 3 μm with the average value of 0 69 0 75 μm confirming that the wastewater is a typical oil in water emulsion 46 the measurement of separation performance was conducted under the condition of a feed flow rate of 6 ml min operating pressure of 0 02 mpa and feed oil concentration of 100 mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermal stability of coating layers fig 4 gives the thermogravimetric curves of the applied pva and pvg layers from the curves it can deduce the maximum operation temperature and the potentially chemical reactions such as cross linking of the surface layer of mfcm as shown all the thermal weight loss processes could be divided into four stages i 250 c ii 250 420 c iii 420 500 c and iv 500 800 c in the first stage a minor weight loss is mainly due to the structural evolution of pva and pvg with the rise of temperature and the evaporation of residual water in coating layers 47 in the second stage the weight loss of first half lies in the continuous evaporation of residual moisture and the elimination of some derived small molecules from pva or pvg e g hydrocarbons hcs h2o co2 and co 48 in the second half a rapid weight loss is attributed to the irregularly breaking of the molecular skeleton of pva and pvg into small molecular pieces along with the release of a large amount of gases such as ch4 and co2 49 in the third stage the weight loss curves turn to a placid as the result of further deep decomposition of molecular main chains instead of primary thermal degradation reactions in previous stage 37 in the fourth stage the curves of thermal degradation rate almost remain constant together with the weight remaining values approaching to zero it indicates that the skeleton degradation of pva and pvg has been completed except for some minor structural rearrangement and the evolution of small fragments 50 in addition the thermal stability with respect to the ultimate carbon residue and the onset degradation temperature for the coatings increases with the increment of pva and pvg content in the starting solution one reason is that the higher concentration of the membrane solution with lower fluidity is likely to form a thicker coating layer owing to higher solution viscosity consequently the thermal decomposition process of the inner polymer chains would be delayed by the outer layer of the membranes due to the enhanced resistance of heat transfer and mass transfer for a thicker coating 51 52 the second reason is that the coating formed by the solution of higher concentration has higher molecular cohesive energy and polymer chain entanglement behavior 53 they also tend to retard the thermal decomposition of the polymer in contrast pvg layer has a more thermal stability in the second and third stages as the result of derived cross linking structure formation by pva and ga 41 42 3 2 functional groups analysis of coating layers ftir spectra were used to investigate the evolution of chemical groups on the membrane surface as shown in fig 5 the strong peak at 3267 cm 1 is identified as the typical stretching vibration of oh for pva and pvg coatings 54 moreover the peak intensity remarkably increases by elevating the concentration of the coating solution in comparison the peak intensity of oh for pvg coating is obviously weaker than that of pva due to the inhibition of groups movement by the ga crosslinking with pva 55 the other peaks are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of ch2 at 2928 cm 1 and 1422 cm 1 and the stretching vibration of co at 1078 cm 1 in pva and pvg molecules respectively 42 in addition the peak intensity of co further rises with raising the pva and pvg concentration of coating solutions it suggests that more hydrophilic groups are likely to be introduced by coating a solution with higher concentration on the membrane surface by contrast the peak intensities of pvg layer are obviously weaker than those of pva at the same coating concentration owing to cross linking formation this can also be confirmed by the diminishing intensity of cho groups in ftir spectra of pvg because of the occurrence of cross linking between cho of ga and oh of pva 55 56 the result is in good accordance with the foregoing tga deduction 3 3 morphology observation sem was used to insight into the apparent morphology of mfcm with variable coating modification in fig 6 a lot of macropores are clearly observed from the surface and cross section view of pristine mfcm in contrast the pores are less noticeable or even completely vanished for the mfcm coated with pva or pvg layers especially for coating at a higher concentration at the same time the mfcm surface becomes denser and smoother due to the reinforcement of masking effect this indicates that pva and pvg coating layers have been tightly adhered to mfcm surface compared with the pristine mfcm although the surface of the mfcm modified by low concentrations e g 3 6 shows significantly denser and smoother in surface morphology it is difficult to distinguish the boundary line of the surface layer from the cross section view the reason is that the coating solutions can easily fill into the macroporous matrix of mfcm and form an inseparable whole 57 at a higher concentration such as 9 the surface layer with a thickness of about 5 μm is clearly visible on the cross section of mfcm as a rule the degree of polymer chain entanglement in the solution will be enhanced as the concentration of the coating solution increases along with a transition from a microscopic diluted solution to a semi diluted and concentrated solution 51 at the same time the increased viscosity and poor fluidity at higher concentration make the solution more difficult to penetrate into the pores of mfcm substrate 58 59 therefore more coating solution is remained on the mfcm surface by forming a thicker surface layer 52 for the spent mfcm after oily emulsion separation the surface pvg layer is intact by remaining the originally dense and opaque morphology with less visible pores oppositely the pva layer almost disappears with exposing the porous substrate of spent mfcm in another word the unstable pva layer is prone to detach from mfcm surface by aggressive invasion of oily wastewater therefore pvg coating is more reliable and feasible for scalable production of mfcm with high performance for oily wastewater treatment 3 4 porous structure analysis in table 1 it shows that modification results into the reduction in the average pore radius and the increment in bulk porosity of mfcm samples furthermore the average pore radius of modified mfcm decreases from 0 252 μm to 0 223 μm as the pvg concentration in coating solution increases from 3 to 9 at the same time the bulk porosity improves from 41 76 to 49 80 it is found that the polymer molecules in coating solution will evolve from a free dilute state to a concentrated state with a higher molecular entanglement degree and intermolecular cohesion energy by increasing the concentration of coating solution 51 this is beneficial to reduce the effective pore size of permeation of membranes more importantly it also tends to reduce the flexibility of polymer molecules and fluidity of the coating solution as the result of enhanced molecular entanglement so as to prevent the coating solution from filling into the macroporous mfcm matrix 58 59 as such higher coating solution yields higher bulk porosity of mfcm 3 5 separation properties of modified mfcm 3 5 1 effect of coating types fig 7 a shows the effect of different coating types on the permeation flux of mfcm for oily wastewater for pristine mfcm the permeation flux slightly declines with the elapse of running time meanwhile the modified mfcm with surface coating layer presents more fluctuating permeation flux especially at the beginning of filtration the permeation flux change with time is commonly occurred for most membrane materials during wastewater treatment prior to the advent of equilibrium states 60 the reason is that more pores in the dry substrate of mfcm would be gradually wetted and accessible for the passages of water permeation with time going on considering this membrane materials are usually pre soaked by pure water before filtration applications in most studies 61 herein we also investigated the effect of water wetting for 30 min in advance the corresponding water soaked mfcm was marked as cm x pva h2o or cm y pvg h2o different from the dried mfcm all the mfcm samples pre soaked with water showed a drastically decreasing trend in water permeation flux at the beginning of filtration this phenomenon is probably due to the continuous release of excessive water adsorbed previously from the porous matrix of mfcm at the driving force of permeation stream as has been demonstrated in our early studies the spongy like porous matrix of mfcm indeed has a huge adsorption capacity towards oily wastewater which can drastically affect the initial stage of membrane filtration 37 notably the effect is tightly associated with the abundance of smaller microporous and mesoporous structures with higher adsorption capacity inside the mfcm matrix in addition to apparently visible larger submicron and nanoscale pores 36 37 moreover the fluctuation of permeation flux at the beginning stage of filtration might also be related to the concentration polarization and membrane pore blocking before the permeation process achieving the steady equilibrium state 16 anyhow all the mfcm could reach the steady state for running over 140 min on the whole permeation flux among the membranes follows the order of cm 9 pva cm 9 pva h2o cm 9 pvg h2o pristine mfcm this demonstrates that the hydrophilic pvg and pva coatings definitely improve the permeation flux of mfcm to a large extent in comparison pva coating is more beneficial for elevating the permeation flux than pvg coating due to its higher hydrophilicity as proofed by water contact angles in fig 7 this can be explained by the consumption of some hydrophilic hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups of initial pva by cross linking bonding for pvg formation 55 56 usually the membrane resistance to water and solute permeation will inevitably increase by introducing a new coating layer 32 however this rule is invalid to the present permeation flux results in fig 7 a therefore it can be concluded that the effect of hydrophilicity on water permeation flux is more pronounced than that of resistance of surface coating layer of mfcm additionally the smoother surface coating is also beneficial for providing membranes with lower surface roughness and better antifouling performance 62 we will address on the related aspect in the near future work fig 7 b shows the effect of coating types on the oil rejection of mfcm the order of oil rejection is cm 9 pvg h2o pristine mfcm cm 9 pva h2o cm 9 pva except for pristine mfcm the oil rejection of the three modified mfcm is exactly in the opposite order of their permeation flux this is consistent with the general trade off relationship that permeation flux is inversely proportional to the oil rejection of membrane materials it is worth noting that the oil removal of pva modified mfcm is abnormally lower than that of pristine mfcm the reason is probably related to the gradual dissolution of pva on the membrane surface and in the pores of the mfcm into the permeate flow as has been observed in previous sem images 63 64 this leads to increased turbidity of the permeate water and improves the emulsified oil water solution stability which could directly influence the uv light transmittance for measurement of oil concentration involved in the determination of oil rejection 40 therefore only pvg coating is feasible and applicable for modification of mfcm no matter how pva coating is attractive for permeation flux in addition there is a sharp increase of oil rejection at the early stage of filtration for mfcm without pre immersion with pure water the reason can be interpreted by the decrease of pore size of mfcm with the adhesion of more oil droplets on the membrane surface which leads to an obvious increment of oil rejection with time during the early filtration process 65 anyhow all the oil rejection reaches to their steady states after running for over 60 min in contrast cm 9 pvg h2o presents the highest oil rejection of 94 8 while cm 9 pva is only 58 5 at the same time the corresponding permeation flux of cm 9 pvg h2o is 691 1 kg m2 h mpa the results of present cm 9 pvg h2o are comparable to the oily wastewater separation performance of other membrane materials in reports including sic 66 silicate clay mineral ceramic membranes 67 cnts go psf 68 go pan 69 etc in addition it also implies that pvg coating layer can fully tolerate the rigorous invasion of flowing wastewater throughout the permeation but the pva coating layer is easily eroded and dissolved by wastewater 70 despite of this the data in fig 7 b primarily demonstrate that pva modified mfcm is more easily to reach steady state thus all the mfcm with surface synthesizing hydrophilic pvg were soaked by water in the following test 3 5 2 effect of coating concentrations fig 8 shows the influence of coating concentration of pvg on the water permeation flux and oil rejection of pvg modified mfcm within the scope of operating time the water permeation flux of the pristine mfcm membrane is relatively stable by a decrease of ca 64 at the end point in comparison to the initial value simultaneously the oil rejection of the pristine mfcm membrane is lowest among all the samples which is only 58 5 at the termination point this implies that the pristine mfcm is more likely to be deposited by oily foulants due to the weak hydrophilicity among the mfcm samples the water permeation flux obeys the sequence of cm 3 pvg h2o cm 6 pvg h2o cm 9 pvg h2o pristine mfcm in magnitude simultaneously the oil rejection follows the order of cm 9 pvg h2o cm 6 pvg h2o cm 3 pvg h2o pristine mfcm namely the highest water permeation flux and oil rejection are 1073 4 kg m2 h mpa for cm 3 pvg h2o and 94 8 for cm 9 pvg h2o respectively as has been discussed formerly as the concentration of the coating solution increases it tends to increase the viscosity and decrease the fluidity thereby forming a thicker membrane layer on mfcm 58 59 as such it inevitably boosts the permeation resistance of mfcm for oily wastewater at the same time this also diminishes the effective pore size of the mfcm as shown in table 1 besides although the increase of pvg concentration provides more polar hydroxyl groups on mfcm surface the hydroxyl groups might no longer preferentially attract water due to the enhanced molecular entanglement and hydrogen bonding between the groups 71 72 consequently it certainly reduces the water permeation flux through mfcm with elevating coating concentration in terms of oil rejection almost all the relevant variables with the increment of coating concentration are beneficial to improve the separation efficacy of pvg coated mfcm they are directly contributed to the pore size exclusion by decreased pore size and the hydrophilic affinity and wettability by hydroxyl groups 40 in short the above results have proved that pvg coating is a promising modification method for improving the water permeation flux and oil rejection of mfcm 3 6 comparison of separation performance table 2 lists the separation performance of oily wastewater for some membranes in reports clearly the as modified mfcm exhibits comparable separation performance to recent literature results 36 37 66 73 76 this demonstrates that pvg coating is a most promising strategy for the preparation of high performance mfcm for oily wastewater due to its excellent adherence to membrane matrix chemical stability scalable production and facile process 4 conclusions a surface synthesizing hydrophilic layer was developed to tailor microfiltration carbon membrane mfcm in relation to efficient separation of oily wastewater the results have shown that the permeation flux of mfcm increases significantly after polyethylene glutaraldehyde pvg coating modification pvg coating layer can drastically improve the separation performance and long term stability of mfcm with the increase of coating solution concentration it is favorable for increasing the oil rejection along with the reduction in permeation flux the highest oil rejection reaches to 94 8 for mfcm modified with 9 pvg coating solution together with the permeation flux of 691 1 kg m2 h mpa in conclusion this study shows that pvg coating modification is an extremely attractive method which can substantially improve the separation permeation of mfcm for oil water emulsion declaration of competing

13046,development of hydrophilic microfiltration carbon membrane mfcm is essential for improving the separation performance of oil water emulsion in this work a strategy was proposed to modify the microstructure and property of mfcm by surface synthesizing a hydrophilic polyethylene glutaraldehyde pvg coating the thermal stability functional groups morphology and porous structure of modified mfcm were characterized by thermogravimetric analyzer fourier transform infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscope and general weight difference filtration velocity techniques respectively the effects of coating types coating solution concentration on the structure and separation performance of mfcm for oily wastewater were investigated the results showed that the surface pvg coating was sufficiently stable to resist the aggressive system of oily wastewater both water permeation flux and oil rejection were significantly improved for mfcm after modification moreover the water permeation flux and oil rejection of mfcm respectively decreased and increased as the concentration of coating solution was increased the maximum oil rejection reached to 94 8 for mfcm modified with a pvg surface layer formed by coating a starting solution of 9 along with a permeation flux of 691 1 kg m2 h mpa graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microfiltration carbon membrane surface coating polyvinyl alcohol polyethylene glutaraldehyde oily wastewater 1 introduction the continuous deterioration of water resources has seriously threatened the human health in global the survival of animals and plants and the ecological security undoubtedly the problem is mainly attributed to a large variety of pollution from human activities such as agricultural reduction industrial sewage domestic wastewater discharge etc in particular many factories including textile producing pharmaceutics leather manufacturing paper making food processing and oil refining were preferred to build near rivers lakes and seashores for the sake of convenient transportation and saving cost 1 it further increase the possibility of contaminating surrounding water body due to oil leakage and sewage discharge 1 3 nowadays environmental awareness is increasingly strengthened with the improvement of social concerns and national emission standards 4 5 on the other hand it would also save a huge amount of losses if the valuable oil could be recovered from wastewater by proper means 6 7 at present oily wastewater is usually coped with the technologies of photocatalysis 8 9 adsorption 10 11 skimming air flotation 12 electrochemistry coagulation 13 and membrane separation 14 15 among the techniques membrane separation is regarded as one of the most promising candidates owing to the advantages of superior oil rejection simple process easy operation low energy consumption no chemical addition and little secondary pollution risk 16 18 nevertheless modification of membrane materials is still an everlasting hot topic in pursuit of high separation efficiency for improving the academic attractiveness and market competition generally speaking the separation performance of membranes for oily wastewater is closely related to their surface hydrophilicity and porous structure therefore great effort has been paid to enhance the hydrophilicity of porous membranes during the last two decades by various ways such as heterogeneous blending 19 molecular grafting 20 surface coating 21 etc heterogeneous blending could improve the permeation flux and surface wettability of membranes by incorporation of some hetero atom guest species depending on their hydrophilicity porous characteristics adsorption and affinity towards special penetrants 22 the species are titanium dioxide tio2 23 24 alumina al2o3 25 zirconium dioxide zro2 26 silicon dioxide sio2 27 28 and so forth unfortunately blending membranes are sometimes suffered from the serious loss of separation performance and flexibility due to bad compatibility and unwanted particle aggregation of fillers 29 molecular grafting can enhance the antifouling ability and hydrophilicity of membranes by introducing polar chemical groups e g hydroxyl carbonyl etc into the membrane surface through chemical reactions 30 adversely the introduced pending groups might reduce the permeation flux of membranes by blocking partial porous entrance in the membrane matrix 31 in comparison surface coating is an effective and feasible way for tailoring the membrane surface to achieve the desired performance 32 nevertheless traditionally physical attachment of coating layer on membranes is usually too weak to resist the mechanical flushing and aggressive invasion during long term filtration 33 35 therefore it is essential to construct a sufficiently stable and hydrophilic surface layer on membranes in order to greatly improve the separation performance and service duration for oily wastewater treatment previously our research team fabricated a microfiltration carbon membrane mfcm for purifying oily wastewater which exhibited quite well separation factors in addition to many attractive advantages over traditional membrane materials in terms of thermal resistance chemical inertness and mechanical strength 36 37 despite this the intrinsically weak surface hydrophilicity of mfcm has strictly inhibited the improvement in separation performance for the purpose of academic attractiveness and market competition regarding this here an attempt was made for the first time to modify mfcm by surface producing a hydrophilic polyethylene glutaraldehyde pvg layer to the best of our knowledge there is no report on the surface modification of mfcm with hydrophilic coating as reinforcing strategy for oily wastewater treatment we believe that the formed pvg layer would be greatly helpful for improving the surface hydrophilicity porous structure permeation flux and oil rejection of resultant mfcm in particular the pvg coating is expected to sustain excellent property even by the aggressive invasion of oily wastewater during filtration owing to chemical crosslinking formation on mfcm surface the schematics of the preparation and modification processes are illustrated in fig 1 supposedly the formed pvg layer could endow the surface of mfcm with more abundant hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups so as to largely enhance the hydrophilicity and separation efficiency moreover fig 2 gives the enhanced separation process of mfcm for emulsified oil water system in the presence of pvg coating hopefully the proposed modification would demonstrate a significant improvement in emulsified oil removal which allows its application for wastewater treatment purposes 2 experimental 2

guangzhou chemical reagent and glass instrument co crosslinking agent glutaraldehyde ga sinopharma chemical reagent ltd co was used to produce pvg other reagents including hexamethylenetetramine shenyang reagent fifth factory sodium carboxymethyl cellulose liaoyang baitahongfeng cellulose factory and hcl sinopharma chemical reagent co ltd were all procured commercially without further purification 2 2 preparation and modification 2 2 1 preparation of mfcm first of all hexamethylenetetramine hmta was mixed into the thermoplastic phenolic resin pr powder in a mass ratio of 3 25 followed by curing at 150 c for 1 h and grinding into fine powder of particulate size beneath 100 meshes again after that sodium carboxy methyl cellulose nacmc was evenly dispersed into the pr powder in a mass fraction of 20 wt furthermore an appropriate amount of distilled water with a mass ratio of 1 2 over the total powder was adopted to assist the formation of a plasticine like dough by successive hand kneading after aging for 80 min the dough was compressed into dozens of circular plates with a diameter of 30 mm and thickness of 5 mm by a tablet machine at 4 mpa finally precursor membranes were obtained after drying for several days at ambient indoor condition subsequently the precursor membranes were carbonized in a horizontal furnace equipped with an automatic temperature controller under an atmosphere of 100 ml min flowing nitrogen the precursor membranes were first heated from room temperature to 400 c at 2 c min and dwelling for 2 h then ramped to 600 c at 1 c min and dwelling for 2 h next to 650 c at 0 5 c min and dwelling for 2 h before naturally cooling down to room temperature 2 2 2 surface modification of mfcm in this work in addition to pvg pva coating was also investigated to modify mfcm as a comparative study pva is a hydrophilic polymer well known for good film forming properties high water vapor permeance nontoxicity low cost biocompatibility and biodegradability 38 these properties of pva have led to its use in a variety of industry areas including chemical engineering pharmaceutics textiles medical devices and food additives 39 particularly the inherent hydrophilicity of pva makes it an attractive polymer for water treatment applications in the form of membranes 39 40 1 pva coating a certain amount of pva was dissolved into distilled water at 90 c for 30 min in a constant temperature water bath to form a solution with a concentration of 3 9 wt then three droplets approx 0 2 g of the solution were dropped and spread on the upper side of mfcm fixed horizontally in a desktop spreading machine by rotating for 15 s after standing for a while the coating layer was dried naturally the coated mfcm was marked as cm x pva where the x represented the concentration of used pva solution 2 pvg coating by the same means pvg layer was also coated on mfcm differently some ga solution with a concentration of 2 5 in water was mixed with 5 hcl in water to form a ga hcl solution in advance then the ga hcl solution was blended with pva solution 3 9 wt at a constant temperature of 40 c by rigorously stirring for 4 h to form a kind of sol herein the mass ratio of pva over ga equaled 1 0 01 in staring solution subsequently the as obtained sol was coated on the surface of mfcm to yield a polyvinyl alcohol glutaraldehyde pvg layer after ambient drying and curing as per the process of pva coating 41 42 the modified mfcm was labelled with cm y pvg where the letter y referred to the concentration of initial pva solution 2 3 characterization the surface functional groups of the samples were detected by a nicolet nexus470 atr fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir at a resolution of 1 4 cm 1 in a scanning wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 the thermal stability of the coatings was determined by a tga 4000 thermogravimetric analyzer tga under flowing nitrogen atmosphere of 20 ml min with a heating rate of 20 c min the morphology of mfcm was observed by a tm 3000 scanning electron microscope sem at an accelerated voltage of 15 kv in standard mode the surface hydrophilicity of membranes was evaluated by the images of water contact angles the images were taken by a jc2000d contact angle analyzer at the moment when the distilled water droplet was just touching the surface of the membranes the oil droplet size distributions of oil water emulsion were measured by a laser diffraction particle size analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 manufactured by malvern co the porous structure of carbon membranes was determined by bulk porosity and average pore radius the bulk porosity φ of the membranes was calculated by eq 1 43 1 φ w wet w dry ρ w al 100 where w wet and w dry are the weights of wet and dry membrane respectively kg ρ w the density of water 1004 06 kg m3 l the membrane thickness m a the effective membrane area m2 average pore radius r f μm was assessed by filtration velocity method on the

test of oily wastewater first a series of standard solutions of oily wastewater were made by fully smashing and uniformly dispersing crude oil droplets into double distilled water via vigorous smashing and ultrasonication more than 1 h the major characteristics of the crude oil was given in our previous report 45 namely the crude oil was mined from turmin oil fields in russia featuring with the properties of api of 35 7 sulfuric content of 0 53 density of 842 3 kg m3 and kinematic viscosity of 4 304 mm2 s 1 a standard equation was ultimately acquired by correlating the oil concentrations with their function of absorbance of oil in water solutions by a uv1800 pc uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 220 nm the water permeation flux and oil rejection of mfcm were calculated by the following eq 3 and eq 4 respectively 3 j w 600 t s where j w t s and 600 referred to the permeation flux kg m2 h the accumulated weight of penetrating fluid g the elapsed running time min and the effective area of mfcm cm2 and the conversion factor for normalized units respectively 4 r 1 c p c f 100 where r c p and cf were the oil rejection and the oil concentrations mg l of permeate side and feed side respectively the oil concentration at the penetrating stream was detected in real time by the uv vis spectrophotometer and the afore mentioned standard equation in the preparation of feed emulsions no surfactant was applied in the system with respect to environmental and practical concerns hence all the emulsions were prepared just before filtration test in order to prevent any possible side effect such as agglomeration and sedimentation of the oil droplets in actual the oil droplet size distribution of the prepared emulsified oil water solution is stable enough over time as shown in fig 3 obviously the oil droplets size is mainly located in the range of 0 3 1 3 μm with the average value of 0 69 0 75 μm confirming that the wastewater is a typical oil in water emulsion 46 the measurement of separation performance was conducted under the condition of a feed flow rate of 6 ml min operating pressure of 0 02 mpa and feed oil concentration of 100 mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermal stability of coating layers fig 4 gives the thermogravimetric curves of the applied pva and pvg layers from the curves it can deduce the maximum operation temperature and the potentially chemical reactions such as cross linking of the surface layer of mfcm as shown all the thermal weight loss processes could be divided into four stages i 250 c ii 250 420 c iii 420 500 c and iv 500 800 c in the first stage a minor weight loss is mainly due to the structural evolution of pva and pvg with the rise of temperature and the evaporation of residual water in coating layers 47 in the second stage the weight loss of first half lies in the continuous evaporation of residual moisture and the elimination of some derived small molecules from pva or pvg e g hydrocarbons hcs h2o co2 and co 48 in the second half a rapid weight loss is attributed to the irregularly breaking of the molecular skeleton of pva and pvg into small molecular pieces along with the release of a large amount of gases such as ch4 and co2 49 in the third stage the weight loss curves turn to a placid as the result of further deep decomposition of molecular main chains instead of primary thermal degradation reactions in previous stage 37 in the fourth stage the curves of thermal degradation rate almost remain constant together with the weight remaining values approaching to zero it indicates that the skeleton degradation of pva and pvg has been completed except for some minor structural rearrangement and the evolution of small fragments 50 in addition the thermal stability with respect to the ultimate carbon residue and the onset degradation temperature for the coatings increases with the increment of pva and pvg content in the starting solution one reason is that the higher concentration of the membrane solution with lower fluidity is likely to form a thicker coating layer owing to higher solution viscosity consequently the thermal decomposition process of the inner polymer chains would be delayed by the outer layer of the membranes due to the enhanced resistance of heat transfer and mass transfer for a thicker coating 51 52 the second reason is that the coating formed by the solution of higher concentration has higher molecular cohesive energy and polymer chain entanglement behavior 53 they also tend to retard the thermal decomposition of the polymer in contrast pvg layer has a more thermal stability in the second and third stages as the result of derived cross linking structure formation by pva and ga 41 42 3 2 functional groups analysis of coating layers ftir spectra were used to investigate the evolution of chemical groups on the membrane surface as shown in fig 5 the strong peak at 3267 cm 1 is identified as the typical stretching vibration of oh for pva and pvg coatings 54 moreover the peak intensity remarkably increases by elevating the concentration of the coating solution in comparison the peak intensity of oh for pvg coating is obviously weaker than that of pva due to the inhibition of groups movement by the ga crosslinking with pva 55 the other peaks are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of ch2 at 2928 cm 1 and 1422 cm 1 and the stretching vibration of co at 1078 cm 1 in pva and pvg molecules respectively 42 in addition the peak intensity of co further rises with raising the pva and pvg concentration of coating solutions it suggests that more hydrophilic groups are likely to be introduced by coating a solution with higher concentration on the membrane surface by contrast the peak intensities of pvg layer are obviously weaker than those of pva at the same coating concentration owing to cross linking formation this can also be confirmed by the diminishing intensity of cho groups in ftir spectra of pvg because of the occurrence of cross linking between cho of ga and oh of pva 55 56 the result is in good accordance with the foregoing tga deduction 3 3 morphology observation sem was used to insight into the apparent morphology of mfcm with variable coating modification in fig 6 a lot of macropores are clearly observed from the surface and cross section view of pristine mfcm in contrast the pores are less noticeable or even completely vanished for the mfcm coated with pva or pvg layers especially for coating at a higher concentration at the same time the mfcm surface becomes denser and smoother due to the reinforcement of masking effect this indicates that pva and pvg coating layers have been tightly adhered to mfcm surface compared with the pristine mfcm although the surface of the mfcm modified by low concentrations e g 3 6 shows significantly denser and smoother in surface morphology it is difficult to distinguish the boundary line of the surface layer from the cross section view the reason is that the coating solutions can easily fill into the macroporous matrix of mfcm and form an inseparable whole 57 at a higher concentration such as 9 the surface layer with a thickness of about 5 μm is clearly visible on the cross section of mfcm as a rule the degree of polymer chain entanglement in the solution will be enhanced as the concentration of the coating solution increases along with a transition from a microscopic diluted solution to a semi diluted and concentrated solution 51 at the same time the increased viscosity and poor fluidity at higher concentration make the solution more difficult to penetrate into the pores of mfcm substrate 58 59 therefore more coating solution is remained on the mfcm surface by forming a thicker surface layer 52 for the spent mfcm after oily emulsion separation the surface pvg layer is intact by remaining the originally dense and opaque morphology with less visible pores oppositely the pva layer almost disappears with exposing the porous substrate of spent mfcm in another word the unstable pva layer is prone to detach from mfcm surface by aggressive invasion of oily wastewater therefore pvg coating is more reliable and feasible for scalable production of mfcm with high performance for oily wastewater treatment 3 4 porous structure analysis in table 1 it shows that modification results into the reduction in the average pore radius and the increment in bulk porosity of mfcm samples furthermore the average pore radius of modified mfcm decreases from 0 252 μm to 0 223 μm as the pvg concentration in coating solution increases from 3 to 9 at the same time the bulk porosity improves from 41 76 to 49 80 it is found that the polymer molecules in coating solution will evolve from a free dilute state to a concentrated state with a higher molecular entanglement degree and intermolecular cohesion energy by increasing the concentration of coating solution 51 this is beneficial to reduce the effective pore size of permeation of membranes more importantly it also tends to reduce the flexibility of polymer molecules and fluidity of the coating solution as the result of enhanced molecular entanglement so as to prevent the coating solution from filling into the macroporous mfcm matrix 58 59 as such higher coating solution yields higher bulk porosity of mfcm 3 5 separation properties of modified mfcm 3 5 1 effect of coating types fig 7 a shows the effect of different coating types on the permeation flux of mfcm for oily wastewater for pristine mfcm the permeation flux slightly declines with the elapse of running time meanwhile the modified mfcm with surface coating layer presents more fluctuating permeation flux especially at the beginning of filtration the permeation flux change with time is commonly occurred for most membrane materials during wastewater treatment prior to the advent of equilibrium states 60 the reason is that more pores in the dry substrate of mfcm would be gradually wetted and accessible for the passages of water permeation with time going on considering this membrane materials are usually pre soaked by pure water before filtration applications in most studies 61 herein we also investigated the effect of water wetting for 30 min in advance the corresponding water soaked mfcm was marked as cm x pva h2o or cm y pvg h2o different from the dried mfcm all the mfcm samples pre soaked with water showed a drastically decreasing trend in water permeation flux at the beginning of filtration this phenomenon is probably due to the continuous release of excessive water adsorbed previously from the porous matrix of mfcm at the driving force of permeation stream as has been demonstrated in our early studies the spongy like porous matrix of mfcm indeed has a huge adsorption capacity towards oily wastewater which can drastically affect the initial stage of membrane filtration 37 notably the effect is tightly associated with the abundance of smaller microporous and mesoporous structures with higher adsorption capacity inside the mfcm matrix in addition to apparently visible larger submicron and nanoscale pores 36 37 moreover the fluctuation of permeation flux at the beginning stage of filtration might also be related to the concentration polarization and membrane pore blocking before the permeation process achieving the steady equilibrium state 16 anyhow all the mfcm could reach the steady state for running over 140 min on the whole permeation flux among the membranes follows the order of cm 9 pva cm 9 pva h2o cm 9 pvg h2o pristine mfcm this demonstrates that the hydrophilic pvg and pva coatings definitely improve the permeation flux of mfcm to a large extent in comparison pva coating is more beneficial for elevating the permeation flux than pvg coating due to its higher hydrophilicity as proofed by water contact angles in fig 7 this can be explained by the consumption of some hydrophilic hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups of initial pva by cross linking bonding for pvg formation 55 56 usually the membrane resistance to water and solute permeation will inevitably increase by introducing a new coating layer 32 however this rule is invalid to the present permeation flux results in fig 7 a therefore it can be concluded that the effect of hydrophilicity on water permeation flux is more pronounced than that of resistance of surface coating layer of mfcm additionally the smoother surface coating is also beneficial for providing membranes with lower surface roughness and better antifouling performance 62 we will address on the related aspect in the near future work fig 7 b shows the effect of coating types on the oil rejection of mfcm the order of oil rejection is cm 9 pvg h2o pristine mfcm cm 9 pva h2o cm 9 pva except for pristine mfcm the oil rejection of the three modified mfcm is exactly in the opposite order of their permeation flux this is consistent with the general trade off relationship that permeation flux is inversely proportional to the oil rejection of membrane materials it is worth noting that the oil removal of pva modified mfcm is abnormally lower than that of pristine mfcm the reason is probably related to the gradual dissolution of pva on the membrane surface and in the pores of the mfcm into the permeate flow as has been observed in previous sem images 63 64 this leads to increased turbidity of the permeate water and improves the emulsified oil water solution stability which could directly influence the uv light transmittance for measurement of oil concentration involved in the determination of oil rejection 40 therefore only pvg coating is feasible and applicable for modification of mfcm no matter how pva coating is attractive for permeation flux in addition there is a sharp increase of oil rejection at the early stage of filtration for mfcm without pre immersion with pure water the reason can be interpreted by the decrease of pore size of mfcm with the adhesion of more oil droplets on the membrane surface which leads to an obvious increment of oil rejection with time during the early filtration process 65 anyhow all the oil rejection reaches to their steady states after running for over 60 min in contrast cm 9 pvg h2o presents the highest oil rejection of 94 8 while cm 9 pva is only 58 5 at the same time the corresponding permeation flux of cm 9 pvg h2o is 691 1 kg m2 h mpa the results of present cm 9 pvg h2o are comparable to the oily wastewater separation performance of other membrane materials in reports including sic 66 silicate clay mineral ceramic membranes 67 cnts go psf 68 go pan 69 etc in addition it also implies that pvg coating layer can fully tolerate the rigorous invasion of flowing wastewater throughout the permeation but the pva coating layer is easily eroded and dissolved by wastewater 70 despite of this the data in fig 7 b primarily demonstrate that pva modified mfcm is more easily to reach steady state thus all the mfcm with surface synthesizing hydrophilic pvg were soaked by water in the following test 3 5 2 effect of coating concentrations fig 8 shows the influence of coating concentration of pvg on the water permeation flux and oil rejection of pvg modified mfcm within the scope of operating time the water permeation flux of the pristine mfcm membrane is relatively stable by a decrease of ca 64 at the end point in comparison to the initial value simultaneously the oil rejection of the pristine mfcm membrane is lowest among all the samples which is only 58 5 at the termination point this implies that the pristine mfcm is more likely to be deposited by oily foulants due to the weak hydrophilicity among the mfcm samples the water permeation flux obeys the sequence of cm 3 pvg h2o cm 6 pvg h2o cm 9 pvg h2o pristine mfcm in magnitude simultaneously the oil rejection follows the order of cm 9 pvg h2o cm 6 pvg h2o cm 3 pvg h2o pristine mfcm namely the highest water permeation flux and oil rejection are 1073 4 kg m2 h mpa for cm 3 pvg h2o and 94 8 for cm 9 pvg h2o respectively as has been discussed formerly as the concentration of the coating solution increases it tends to increase the viscosity and decrease the fluidity thereby forming a thicker membrane layer on mfcm 58 59 as such it inevitably boosts the permeation resistance of mfcm for oily wastewater at the same time this also diminishes the effective pore size of the mfcm as shown in table 1 besides although the increase of pvg concentration provides more polar hydroxyl groups on mfcm surface the hydroxyl groups might no longer preferentially attract water due to the enhanced molecular entanglement and hydrogen bonding between the groups 71 72 consequently it certainly reduces the water permeation flux through mfcm with elevating coating concentration in terms of oil rejection almost all the relevant variables with the increment of coating concentration are beneficial to improve the separation efficacy of pvg coated mfcm they are directly contributed to the pore size exclusion by decreased pore size and the hydrophilic affinity and wettability by hydroxyl groups 40 in short the above results have proved that pvg coating is a promising modification method for improving the water permeation flux and oil rejection of mfcm 3 6 comparison of separation performance table 2 lists the separation performance of oily wastewater for some membranes in reports clearly the as modified mfcm exhibits comparable separation performance to recent literature results 36 37 66 73 76 this demonstrates that pvg coating is a most promising strategy for the preparation of high performance mfcm for oily wastewater due to its excellent adherence to membrane matrix chemical stability scalable production and facile process 4 conclusions a surface synthesizing hydrophilic layer was developed to tailor microfiltration carbon membrane mfcm in relation to efficient separation of oily wastewater the results have shown that the permeation flux of mfcm increases significantly after polyethylene glutaraldehyde pvg coating modification pvg coating layer can drastically improve the separation performance and long term stability of mfcm with the increase of coating solution concentration it is favorable for increasing the oil rejection along with the reduction in permeation flux the highest oil rejection reaches to 94 8 for mfcm modified with 9 pvg coating solution together with the permeation flux of 691 1 kg m2 h mpa in conclusion this study shows that pvg coating modification is an extremely attractive method which can substantially improve the separation permeation of mfcm for oil water emulsion declaration of competing

13047,nitrogen in municipal wastewater must be removed prior to discharge to the environment however existing energy intensive aerobic processes used for nitrogen removal currently do not capture this important resource instead nitrogen capture in the form of ammonia using a lower energy technology such as the membrane distillation so far mostly tested in lab scale could be a significant improvement this study reports a vacuum membrane distillation vmd pilot trial conducted at a municipal wastewater treatment plant to uniquely demonstrate ammonium removal and recovery to meet effluent discharge targets the pilot plant was located in two streams on site in the plant s anaerobic digester liquor handling facilities the first trialed stream was on the existing phosphorus removal lime dosed effluent and the second stream was effluent from an experimental struvite phosphorous recovery operation in the post lime scenario vmd recovered n as ammonium sulphate solution and achieved up to 93 reduction in the post struvite scenario the vmd system achieved up to 85 reduction within the duration of the demonstration with vmd driving force derived from volatility of the compound of interest which is reliably calculated via henry s law the ammonia mass transfer coefficient across the membrane was 0 16 kg m2 h bar 37 rsd over the trial period being lower than typical best case laboratory test results overall the nitrogen removal and recovery process via vmd was proven technically viable on actual plant effluent leaving existing lime dosed and potential future struvite phosphorus removal systems however further studies are required to assess the economics of vmd for nitrogen removal compared with other nitrification denitrification methods used in wastewater treatment keywords nitrogen capture membrane distillation pilot study mass transfer coefficient sustainable water treatment 1 introduction the accelerating degradation of water resources nowadays can be attributed to human activities from various sources including agricultural industrial and municipal domains in particular nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are present at high concentrations in agricultural runoff municipal wastewaters and some industry waste streams the release of nutrients to an environment unable to naturally sequester such large loads has resulted in detrimental species proliferation and deteriorating water quality aquatic health and ecological balance consequently authorities impose limits on specific nutrients entering waterways from entities under their control 1 3 for industrial and or municipal water treatment facilities compliance with these limitations often requires investment in new plant and equipment restrictions to operating conditions or other economic imposition it is therefore important to search for effective and low cost alternative technologies for reducing nutrient levels from wastewaters one such stream is the effluent from anaerobic digester process of a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment operation which commonly is a large source of ammonia nitrogen to be recycled within wastewater treatment streams the current treatment practice of ammonia containing waste water is commonly achieved by biological processes such as deammonification by the aerobic and anoxic operations which require aeration and consumes a significant amount of energy accounting for 80 of the overall electrical energy use in a typical waste water treatment plant 4 over the last decades tremendous efforts have been made to develop nitrogen removal technologies for example biological nitrification electrodialysis ion exchange and ammonia stripping 5 8 particularly ammonia stripping from wastewater has attracted attention in the research community due to its dual benefit of ammonia removal and recovery as a chemical feedstock or ingredients for fertilizers which could be a sustainable solution to reduce the carbon footprint of the energy intensive haber bosch process 9 as studied in a recent stowa foundation for applied water research the netherlands report 8 however improvements are required to lower capital energy costs and chemical consumption by introducing sustainable solutions the ability to retrofit to existing water treatment facilities is also critical to avoid costly implementation membrane processes have been considered as a means to facilitate cost reductions with additional advantages of small footprint high retrofittability and scalablility within existing infrastructure in recent years several membrane processes are reported as effective alternatives to strip ammonia nitrogen from wastewaters 10 16 such as membrane contactors 10 16 17 membrane distillation md 11 15 18 and pervaporation specifically hydrophobic membrane contactors to recover ammonia into a sulphuric acid trapping solution have been reported 10 16 however a high ph 9 0 was recommended to achieve good transport of ammonia over water considering the equilibria of strippable volatile ammonia over the non volatile ammonium ion for example one vacuum membrane distillation vmd study reported that in the concentration of ammonia in the permeate was captured at much higher concentration 8 fold more concentrated than in the feed at ph 10 12 another vmd study obtained a 10 fold ammonia concentration of the using polypropylene pp hollow fibre membranes at ph 11 13 a recent study showed that effective ammonia removal was feasible under unadjusted ph of the wastewater from a range of sources under various tan concentrations low to high cod and ph conditions including neutral ph where the roles of water chemistries were comprehensively analysed 19 nevertheless these studies were mainly conducted with bench scale experiments recently the use of gas permeable membranes gpm have demonstrated in pilot scale to effectively remove ammonia from industrial wastes such as the supernatant of anaerobic digesters 20 which however was only demonstrated effective at relatively high ammonia concentrations 1000 mg n l recently dow et al reported that in a 3 month md pilot scale for desalinating biologically treated textile wastewater which contained ammonia at a low level of 8 5 mg n l 21 during the trial it was repeatedly observed that the transport of volatile ammonia occurred through the membrane at the original ph of the wastewater however the ability to deplete the nitrogen in the feed stream was not examined in that particular work evidently pilot scale md studies specifically targeting ammonia removal recovery are needed to explore the technology in a practical industrial setting here we report a vmd pilot scale study on nitrogen removal from anaerobic digestion effluent in a conventional municipal wastewater treatment plant with the existing site settings two treatment scenarios were proposed to examine the technical feasibility and retrofitability of the vmd plant the first scenario is through the direct connection of the vmd plant to the effluent of the existing lime treatment facility where phosphorus is removed as biosolids while nitrogen remains the second scenario was through the connection of the vmd plant to an experimental struvite precipitation system which was installed in a parallel trial to evaluate a phosphorus removal alternative to the existing lime dosing facilities in both testing scenarios the plant capacity was tested in low and high throughput modes with the aim to examine the separation efficiency at different target discharge concentration of the effluents as a result a comprehensive analysis of the separation efficiency is carried out in terms of the overall ammonia removal and mass transport coefficient of ammonia 2 experimental design 2 1 chemicals ammonia vapour was captured in an acid trap containing sulphuric acid at 0 1 mol l prepared from 98 wt acid obtained from sigma aldrich quantification of ammonia ammonium concentration was carried out on a spectroquant nova 30 spectrometer merck using reagents kits of the phenate colorimetric method based on apha standard methods 4500 nh3 f purchased from merck 2 2 md feed water tested and treatment scenarios on site the pilot plant was installed at ballarat south wastewater treatment plant bswwtp operated by central highlands water the site provided the feed water used for the vmd testing is located at the inland city of ballarat and consists of a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment operation with enhanced biological nutrient removal bnr augmentation the operation is broadly outlined in the diagram shown in fig 1a the digested sludge is dewatered via a belt filter press to produce filtrate liquor and bio solids where the belt press filtrate undergoes lime dosing and sedimentation to remove the phosphorus this supernatant liquor stream after the lime treatment contains relatively high ammonia typically 50 90 mg n l along with a high ph 9 11 is returned to the head of the process and incorporated into incoming influent where the bnr cycle has sufficient removal capacity hence an experimental question was posed what are the conditions needed to meet a hypothetical treatment objective by the site for removing both phosphorus and nitrogen and possible recovery using vmd two treatment scenarios were trialed as shown in fig 1a in which the proposed modifications to the existing plant black lines to incorporate the vmd process are indicated in red dash lines two treatment scenarios were proposed to examine the technical feasibility and retrofitability of the vmd plant in scenario 1 the post lime dosing supernatant with phosphorus removed and ammonia remained was directly fed into the vmd pilot plant while scenario 2 examines an alternative configuration where the phosphorus removal was achieved via an experimental struvite precipitation process which was installed in a parallel trial to evaluate a phosphorus removal alternative to the existing lime dosing facilities then the nitrogen containing post struvite stream was fed into the vmd plant the daily operation of the vmd plant was co ordinated to align with the daytime only operation of current sludge dewatering and lime treatment it is noted that the struvite precipitation operation was implemented on a 24 h basis using intermediate feedwater storage segregated to the daytime only vmd operation results of struvite performance are not reported in this study thus the vmd plant treated two different feedwaters with their resultant outcomes described separately in the following sections the fate of the proposed streams after the vmd treatment fig 1a consist of ammonia product sent back to the bio solid collection point i e residual solids and the depleted effluent returned to the head of the works an image of the containerised pilot plant installed at the bswwtp site is shown in fig 1b 2 3 on site plot testing the custom built vmd pilot plant consisted of a 4 inch hollow fibre commercial membrane element supplied by dupont namely memcor m10c with an effective surface area of 27 8m2 a length of 115 cm and a diameter of 12 cm respectively according to the supplier the membrane is hydrophobic polypropylene with a nominal pore size of 0 2 μm with an outer diameter of 650 μm the membrane was installed into a vmd capable housing with the liquid stream supplied through the shell side of the module and vacuum was applied to the lumen of the fibres as shown in fig 2 the vmd cycle water was pumped from a vmd cycle tank through the membrane module through a plate heat exchanger heated by a temperature controlled electric hot water heater and returned to the tank maintained at 64 l by level control module inlet temperature was controlled to 45 c and cycle flow rate was set at 400 l min throughout the trial in batch mode operation influent feedwater was added to the vmd cycle tank to replace permeated water only whereas in continuous mode the feedwater flow rate matched that of rejected rate retaining the 64 l level vacuum was applied to the lumen via a dry screw pump obtained from afapa vacuum equipment shanghai china operated within the range of 7 5 to 17 kpaa to ensure complete capture of the permeated ammonia the pump s vent was directed into 5 l of 0 1 m h2so4 solution refreshed at the start of each operating day at room temperature labelled acid trap in fig 2 to record the amount of permeated water the acid trap was controlled at the fixed 5 l via a level controlled pump passing excess volume to a permeate receiver placed on a balance 1 g which was logged after each day of operation vmd cycle solution was displaced from the membrane module with tapwater and stored under these clean water conditions overnight the displaced vmd cycle was retained and returned to the process at start up of the next day thereby achieving pseudo continuous data the vmd plant was operated 7 h per day 5 days per week to reflect the operation of the belt press filtration and lime dosing facilities a sequence of operating modes were undertaken over the 6 week trial utilising the 2 feedwater streams outlined in table 1 batch mode operation where the starting 64 l of feedwater was allowed to be treated with additional feedwater making up to that volume only depleting the nh3 until a target concentration of 6 mg n l was reached which was considered to represent a typical n discharge requirement from this point continuous mode was engaged where a constant influent and reject stream was maintained to achieve that target nh3 concentration subsequent experiments altered the discharge nh3 target listed in table 1 to explore the capability of the process for scenario 1 the received influent or effluent from the lime dosing facility was filtered through a 10 μm cartridge filter to eliminate variation in amount of sediment being carried into the membrane system the pre filter not illustrate in fig 2 in scenario 2 the influent was taken directly from the settled effluent of the experimental struvite precipitator in a word in both scenario 1 and 2 the plant capacity was tested in low and high throughput modes for examining the separation efficiency at different target discharge concentration of the effluents 2 4 water quality characterization the key chemical analyses required to demonstrate process efficiency was nh3 content in the three streams feedwater vmd cycle i e reject in fig 1 and permeate from these measurements the process performance can be established along with the fate of incoming nh3 monitoring and control of vmd pilot plant was made by determination of ammonia nh3 at the site using the previously described method feedwater and vmd cycle solution was measured for ph and e c using a field meter tps brendale australia 2 5 theories and calculations ammonia removal from an aqueous medium through vaporisation relies on the well described equilibrium between its protonated and molecular forms 1 determined by solution ph and ionic environment 22 1 n h 4 o h n h 3 h 2 o key performance measures to assess nh3 removal effectiveness in water treatment such as this is nh3 flux total water flux nh3 removal efficiency and the treated water s nh3 reduction the potential to recover a usable nh3 product also impacts system economics and practical value however nh3 product recovery was not part of the experimental work and will be explored conceptually total water flux j kg h m2 was calculated from mass of liquid permeate collected m p over period t and the amount of area of membrane exposed a 2 while nh3 flux j n mg h m2 can be defined from mass of nh3 permeated m n and calculated similarly 3 2 j m p a t 3 j n m n a t the driving force for transport is the vapour pressure difference across the membrane δpvap the vapour pressure on the permeate side is determined by the depth of vacuum driven by the vacuum pump and therefore near constant corrected for the mole fraction of nh3 in that atmosphere while the partial pressure of nh3 on the solution side in this case the vmd cycle is determined by the concentration of dissolved nh3 the temperature and henry s law volatility constant 22 the mass transfer coefficient of nh3 c m n can be calculated from 4 expressed as kg m2 h bar 4 c m n j n p vap where the pvap was calculated based on the partial pressure of ammonia at the feed side which was considered as a reasonable assumption given the only volatile components were ammonia and water i e the potential existence of non condensable components such as co2 and air occupied less than 20 of the lumen space in the calculation the influence of ph and the ionic strength on the fraction of free ammonia was taken into consideration 22 the membrane performance was evaluated in terms of the reduction of ammonia r d as the proportion of nh3 remaining in the treated water related to the supplied feedwater calculated by 5 r d c f c cyc c f where cf and c cyc are the nh3 concentration in feedwater and vmd cycle respectively a quantity related to the depletion of ammonia in the feedwater but more accurately reflecting the mass balance of process is the nh3 removal r m which is the amount of nh3 passed through the membrane as a proportion of the mass of nh3 presented to the membrane surface as defined as 6 r m m n m n cycle m n f where m n cycle is the mass of nh3 in the md cycle and m n f is the mass of nh3 added to the cycle over a fixed period of time 3 results and discussion 3 1 vmd plant performance for treatment scenario 1 post lime effluent 3 1 1 feedwater characteristics the water quality indicators of the two streams used as the feedwater to the vmd plant were determined at the pilot facility as shown in table 2 it was noted that the nitrogen concentration of the vmd plant feedwater from the wastewater treatment facility varied from day to day for example in run 2 of scenario 1 the feedwater exhibited an increase of nh3 concentration over the 4 day operation period from 69 to 85 mg n l thereby requiring alteration of the feed rate to meet the target discharge limit of nh3 the range of ionic strength values of the streams was obtained from ions measured when practical and or based on averaged plant statistics these values were used in the calculation of pvap required for eq 4 to enable calculation of the mass transfer coefficient it was found that the mass transfer coefficient was not significantly influenced with all possible ionic strength scenarios using the reported method 22 and therefore did not require a more comprehensive water analysis for every sample to appropriately calculate ammonia vapour pressure the worst case highest ionic strength was used in the calculations by assuming it consisted of divalent ions such as caso4 3 1 2 membrane flux over operation duration the total membrane flux and the change of vacuum pressure of the permeate side over the 14 day operation time for the three running modes described in section 2 is presented in fig 3 it was found that the membrane flux fluctuated between 0 05 and 0 25 kg m2 h which were obtained as the averaged flux values based on daily operation over the two week trial with the main goal of n removal the information relevant to the total membrane flux is presented here only for completeness nevertheless the vacuum pressure of the permeate side was maintained relatively constant in the range of 15 17 kpa indicating stable operating conditions 3 1 3 ammonium reduction in treated feedwater over time fig 4 shows the post lime effluent ammonia concentration and reduction for the three operational modes scenario 1 runs 1 3 on a continuous time series over 14 days it was found that ammonia in the md cycle 64 l volume was reduced to 6 mg n l nh3 representing a 93 reduction in run 1 over 4 day operation from this point onwards run 2 was conducted with 6 mg n l as the target effluent concentration by maintaining an averaged feedwater flowrate of 0 9 l h the adjustment of the feed rate in run 2 was needed because of the variation in the influent quality i e effluent from the wastewater treatment facility from 69 to 85 mg n l whereas in run 3 the discharge limit was set to be higher at 20 mg n l representing situations of a less stringent environment the feed rate was gradually adjusted over the 5 day operation period until 3 3 l h showing a treatment reduction of 71 therefore with careful process control a desired ammonium reduction target can be achieved which is an important finding from this pilot scale trial on the novel means to recover nitrogen 3 1 4 total ammonia removal and ph trend vs total recovered volume fig 5 shows the ph variation of the vmd cycle with the total removed liquid volume obtained in the permeate side it was observed that in general the ph of the vmd cycle increases gradually with increasing total removed volume while the total ammonia removal exhibits a plateau after the removed volume reached about 20 similar observation was reported in the previous work 19 3 2 vmd performance for treatment scenario 2 post struvite effluent 3 2 1 ammonium reduction in treated md feedwater over time table 2 shows water quality of the post struvite effluents and the settled effluent is depleted in po4 and approximately 27 lower nh3 with a ph of 8 7 9 2 making the expected exchange from lime treated effluent relatively simple with similarly alkaline conditions in terms of the ph value and compositional elements e g mg2 ca2 and a slight reduction of ammonia therefore it was considered that similar feedwaters were supplied to the vmd pilot plant under both treatment scenarios the trial results during run 4 and run 5 are presented in fig 6 in terms of the total ammonia reduction along with its concentration in feedwater and the vmd cycle mg n l over the 10 day operation period it was observed that in the first day of run 4 continuous with low throughput under the fixed feed rate an ammonia reduction of 36 from the initial feedwater concentration of 51 7 mg n l to 33 3 mg n l in the reject stream to reach a discharge target of 10 mg n l a total ammonia reduction of 85 was achieved at the end of this 5 day period for run 5 continuous with high throughput fig 6 show that the discharge water quality or the reject stream declined quickly to 29 6 mg n l in the first day of run 5 and continued to maintain at a similar level 33 mg n l over the rest of the operation period the overall ammonia reduction through run 5 was between 41 and 47 the slight variation of which was attributed to the variation of the feedwater quality table 2 the results obtained from run 4 and run 5 indicated the upper limit of the vmd plant considering both the discharge requirement and the integration with the capacity of the struvite precipitation system 3 3 summary of nitrogen removal via vmd pilot plant the results for plant performance presented in this report thus far focused on reduction yet removal is a measure that shows the actual quantity of nitrogen removed relative to what was fed removal calculated in steady state condition in table 3 shows the obtained concentration of the n depleted discharge reject stream and the nitrogen reduction and removal under each trial setting and fresh feed flowrate except in run 5 where the fluctuation of the receiving influent concentration was relatively significant overall the nitrogen reduction and removal are quite similar on those days under steady state operation which are also directly related to the concentration of their discharge reject streams i e the higher the removal reduction the lower the effluent concentration the novel application of vmd for nitrogen removal was further explored in more fundamental detail a key indicator of vmd performance is ammonia permeation flux as described in eq 3 of section 2 this is based on the results shown from figs 3 to 6 over the course of the trial ammonia fluxes were found to vary in the ranges of 1 4 2 5 mg m2 h in low reject concentration mode run 2 target nh3 in the reject stream was 10 mg n l and 5 4 13 9 mg m2 h in high throughput mode in run 5 nh3 in the discharge reject at 20 33 mg l periods of highest vmd cycle concentration demonstrated highest ammonia flux and run 5 experienced a 3 day period of vmd cycle ammonia averaging 33 0 mg n l corresponding to a sustained ammonia flux of 11 0 mg m2 h over the period overall the obtained ammonia flux was significantly lower than that of best case lab test results under similar feed concentration and temperature e g 1000 4000 mg m2 h for feeds with ph from 7 to 10 as described previously 19 the main reasons could be due to the difference in solution characteristics e g sources existence of carbonate ph range etc the magnitude of the vacuum pressure i e two order higher in the trial and the fluctuation in operating conditions in the pilot trial further the difference in ammonia flux across two different apparatuses using similar membrane types could also be due to the significant difference in membrane area employed i e 27 8 m2 in this pilot vs 0 005 m2 used previously 19 the membrane module and housing were designed for mf uf use so optimal conditions for vmd were not explored and could account the discrepancy ammonia mass transfer coefficient was also explored from the trial calculated by eq 4 the relationship between mass transfer coefficient in terms of the process driving force with units g m2 h bar with several process parameters such as trial time the nh3 concentration mg n l and ph of the feed side of the membrane module the solution cycling between vmd cycle tank and membrane is shown in fig 7 the degree of scatter in the data is likely due to the variations in waste water properties over time and deviations due to adjustment of operating conditions during the run overall it was observed that the magnitude of the normalised ammonia flux regardless of these process parameters i e more than 80 of the data points fall around the value of 0 16 kg m2 h bar 37 rsd this correlates with theory where feed ammonia vapour concentration follows solution concentration according to henry s law and influenced by temperature and ph of the solution 22 the temperature in this study were kept relatively constant throughout the trial observing trends in presenting against these parameters there appears to be a slight downward trend in mass transfer coefficient with time suggesting a possible loss in performance for example from membrane fouling no trend is observed with concentration which is to be expected if the driving force has been accounted for in the calculations this should also apply to ph however there appeared to be a declining trend with increasing ph lowest mass transfer coefficient values calculated at the highest ph values the reason for this trend is not able to be concluded from the current data but may relate to other properties in the wastewater that correlate to ph and that its influence on ammonia vapour pressure are not completely represented regardless the model for vapour pressure used in eq 4 accounting for more complex wastewater characteristics reported by 22 allowed us to calculate mass transfer coefficients where 80 of the values fell within one standard deviation of the average ammonia recovery by vmd is therefore technically valid as a process where the treatment targets can be configured by the process operation as demonstrated in our continuous mode trials given the scope of the trial investigations on the effects of operating conditions were not intended for example although previous bench studies demonstrated that the vacuum pressure at the permeate side may have significant impact on the membrane performance it was challenging to adjust the vacuum pressure to be precise given the fluctuating influent properties further work would require optimisation of membrane performance in terms of ammonia flux to minimise area requirement specifically for best possible process performance pending this optimisation a case study on the economic and environmental benefits of adding this more intensive means at wastewater treatment is needed economic benefits include savings from reduced activated sludge aeration electricity requirements for nitrogen removal in the existing plant environmental benefits include reduction in emissions generated by the associated electricity reduction further heat integration into the biogas combustion needs to be evaluated since the vmd process requires operation at 40 c a key factor in a case study would be the means to make value of the recovered ammonium for example as a valuable fertilizer the complexity of such a study for our case is beyond the scope of this paper which was more concerned with demonstrating continuous process viability and flexibility but opportunities such as valorisation of the recovered concentrated ammonia via the existing plant s biosolids removal means which are utilised for agriculture were considered also given that the costings are location specific assumptions and site details would have to be disclosed to enable a proper economic study which should be considered in further studies in addition due to the limited length of this proof of concept trial only minor membrane fouling was detected while no significant changes in the membrane performance was observed therefore a further study with a prolonged operation period is recommended to evaluate the fouling tendency of the process and the necessity for regular cleaning procedure 4 conclusion the presence of ammonia nitrogen in the wastewater causes serious pollution when the treated effluent is discharged into natural water ways hence it is removed prior to discharge this study successfully demonstrated the technical feasibility of the vacuum membrane distillation technology for the removal of nitrogen from the anaerobically digested supernatant liquor in a local municipal wastewater treatment plant the aim was to explore an alternative solution to reduce the nitrogen load that gets delivered into the conventional energy intensive aerobic treatment process two practical trial scenarios were demonstrated in scenario 1 the vmd plant treated the wastewater from the existing post lime treatment facility recovering n as ammonium sulphate solution and achieved up to 93 reduction in ammonia as n in scenario 2 the vmd system received post struvite precipitation effluent and achieved up to 85 reduction in ammonia as n within the duration of the demonstration trial in terms of ammonia flux reported previously for bench trials the residual nitrogen in the pilot trial was several orders of magnitude lower with vmd s driving force derived from volatility of the compound of interest which when calculated via henry s law the ammonia mass transfer coefficient across the membrane was found to be 0 16 0 13 kg m2 h bar over the trial period overall the nitrogen removal and recovery via vmd as part of the nutrient recovery trial from lime treated supernatant liquors of digested sludge was proven to be technically viable this technology shows promise as an alternative to current practise on nitrogen removal however further work is needed to translate pilot scale performance to large scale and prove its economic advantages through process optimization engineering

13047,nitrogen in municipal wastewater must be removed prior to discharge to the environment however existing energy intensive aerobic processes used for nitrogen removal currently do not capture this important resource instead nitrogen capture in the form of ammonia using a lower energy technology such as the membrane distillation so far mostly tested in lab scale could be a significant improvement this study reports a vacuum membrane distillation vmd pilot trial conducted at a municipal wastewater treatment plant to uniquely demonstrate ammonium removal and recovery to meet effluent discharge targets the pilot plant was located in two streams on site in the plant s anaerobic digester liquor handling facilities the first trialed stream was on the existing phosphorus removal lime dosed effluent and the second stream was effluent from an experimental struvite phosphorous recovery operation in the post lime scenario vmd recovered n as ammonium sulphate solution and achieved up to 93 reduction in the post struvite scenario the vmd system achieved up to 85 reduction within the duration of the demonstration with vmd driving force derived from volatility of the compound of interest which is reliably calculated via henry s law the ammonia mass transfer coefficient across the membrane was 0 16 kg m2 h bar 37 rsd over the trial period being lower than typical best case laboratory test results overall the nitrogen removal and recovery process via vmd was proven technically viable on actual plant effluent leaving existing lime dosed and potential future struvite phosphorus removal systems however further studies are required to assess the economics of vmd for nitrogen removal compared with other nitrification denitrification methods used in wastewater treatment keywords nitrogen capture membrane distillation pilot study mass transfer coefficient sustainable water treatment 1 introduction the accelerating degradation of water resources nowadays can be attributed to human activities from various sources including agricultural industrial and municipal domains in particular nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are present at high concentrations in agricultural runoff municipal wastewaters and some industry waste streams the release of nutrients to an environment unable to naturally sequester such large loads has resulted in detrimental species proliferation and deteriorating water quality aquatic health and ecological balance consequently authorities impose limits on specific nutrients entering waterways from entities under their control 1 3 for industrial and or municipal water treatment facilities compliance with these limitations often requires investment in new plant and equipment restrictions to operating conditions or other economic imposition it is therefore important to search for effective and low cost alternative technologies for reducing nutrient levels from wastewaters one such stream is the effluent from anaerobic digester process of a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment operation which commonly is a large source of ammonia nitrogen to be recycled within wastewater treatment streams the current treatment practice of ammonia containing waste water is commonly achieved by biological processes such as deammonification by the aerobic and anoxic operations which require aeration and consumes a significant amount of energy accounting for 80 of the overall electrical energy use in a typical waste water treatment plant 4 over the last decades tremendous efforts have been made to develop nitrogen removal technologies for example biological nitrification electrodialysis ion exchange and ammonia stripping 5 8 particularly ammonia stripping from wastewater has attracted attention in the research community due to its dual benefit of ammonia removal and recovery as a chemical feedstock or ingredients for fertilizers which could be a sustainable solution to reduce the carbon footprint of the energy intensive haber bosch process 9 as studied in a recent stowa foundation for applied water research the netherlands report 8 however improvements are required to lower capital energy costs and chemical consumption by introducing sustainable solutions the ability to retrofit to existing water treatment facilities is also critical to avoid costly implementation membrane processes have been considered as a means to facilitate cost reductions with additional advantages of small footprint high retrofittability and scalablility within existing infrastructure in recent years several membrane processes are reported as effective alternatives to strip ammonia nitrogen from wastewaters 10 16 such as membrane contactors 10 16 17 membrane distillation md 11 15 18 and pervaporation specifically hydrophobic membrane contactors to recover ammonia into a sulphuric acid trapping solution have been reported 10 16 however a high ph 9 0 was recommended to achieve good transport of ammonia over water considering the equilibria of strippable volatile ammonia over the non volatile ammonium ion for example one vacuum membrane distillation vmd study reported that in the concentration of ammonia in the permeate was captured at much higher concentration 8 fold more concentrated than in the feed at ph 10 12 another vmd study obtained a 10 fold ammonia concentration of the using polypropylene pp hollow fibre membranes at ph 11 13 a recent study showed that effective ammonia removal was feasible under unadjusted ph of the wastewater from a range of sources under various tan concentrations low to high cod and ph conditions including neutral ph where the roles of water chemistries were comprehensively analysed 19 nevertheless these studies were mainly conducted with bench scale experiments recently the use of gas permeable membranes gpm have demonstrated in pilot scale to effectively remove ammonia from industrial wastes such as the supernatant of anaerobic digesters 20 which however was only demonstrated effective at relatively high ammonia concentrations 1000 mg n l recently dow et al reported that in a 3 month md pilot scale for desalinating biologically treated textile wastewater which contained ammonia at a low level of 8 5 mg n l 21 during the trial it was repeatedly observed that the transport of volatile ammonia occurred through the membrane at the original ph of the wastewater however the ability to deplete the nitrogen in the feed stream was not examined in that particular work evidently pilot scale md studies specifically targeting ammonia removal recovery are needed to explore the technology in a practical industrial setting here we report a vmd pilot scale study on nitrogen removal from anaerobic digestion effluent in a conventional municipal wastewater treatment plant with the existing site settings two treatment scenarios were proposed to examine the technical feasibility and retrofitability of the vmd plant the first scenario is through the direct connection of the vmd plant to the effluent of the existing lime treatment facility where phosphorus is removed as biosolids while nitrogen remains the second scenario was through the connection of the vmd plant to an experimental struvite precipitation system which was installed in a parallel trial to evaluate a phosphorus removal alternative to the existing lime dosing facilities in both testing scenarios the plant capacity was tested in low and high throughput modes with the aim to examine the separation efficiency at different target discharge concentration of the effluents as a result a comprehensive analysis of the separation efficiency is carried out in terms of the overall ammonia removal and mass transport coefficient of ammonia 2 experimental design 2 1 chemicals ammonia vapour was captured in an acid trap containing sulphuric acid at 0 1 mol l prepared from 98 wt acid obtained from sigma aldrich quantification of ammonia ammonium concentration was carried out on a spectroquant nova 30 spectrometer merck using reagents kits of the phenate colorimetric method based on apha standard methods 4500 nh3 f purchased from merck 2 2 md feed water tested and treatment scenarios on site the pilot plant was installed at ballarat south wastewater treatment plant bswwtp operated by central highlands water the site provided the feed water used for the vmd testing is located at the inland city of ballarat and consists of a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment operation with enhanced biological nutrient removal bnr augmentation the operation is broadly outlined in the diagram shown in fig 1a the digested sludge is dewatered via a belt filter press to produce filtrate liquor and bio solids where the belt press filtrate undergoes lime dosing and sedimentation to remove the phosphorus this supernatant liquor stream after the lime treatment contains relatively high ammonia typically 50 90 mg n l along with a high ph 9 11 is returned to the head of the process and incorporated into incoming influent where the bnr cycle has sufficient removal capacity hence an experimental question was posed what are the conditions needed to meet a hypothetical treatment objective by the site for removing both phosphorus and nitrogen and possible recovery using vmd two treatment scenarios were trialed as shown in fig 1a in which the proposed modifications to the existing plant black lines to incorporate the vmd process are indicated in red dash lines two treatment scenarios were proposed to examine the technical feasibility and retrofitability of the vmd plant in scenario 1 the post lime dosing supernatant with phosphorus removed and ammonia remained was directly fed into the vmd pilot plant while scenario 2 examines an alternative configuration where the phosphorus removal was achieved via an experimental struvite precipitation process which was installed in a parallel trial to evaluate a phosphorus removal alternative to the existing lime dosing facilities then the nitrogen containing post struvite stream was fed into the vmd plant the daily operation of the vmd plant was co ordinated to align with the daytime only operation of current sludge dewatering and lime treatment it is noted that the struvite precipitation operation was implemented on a 24 h basis using intermediate feedwater storage segregated to the daytime only vmd operation results of struvite performance are not reported in this study thus the vmd plant treated two different feedwaters with their resultant outcomes described separately in the following sections the fate of the proposed streams after the vmd treatment fig 1a consist of ammonia product sent back to the bio solid collection point i e residual solids and the depleted effluent returned to the head of the works an image of the containerised pilot plant installed at the bswwtp site is shown in fig 1b 2 3 on site plot testing the custom built vmd pilot plant consisted of a 4 inch hollow fibre commercial membrane element supplied by dupont namely memcor m10c with an effective surface area of 27 8m2 a length of 115 cm and a diameter of 12 cm respectively according to the supplier the membrane is hydrophobic polypropylene with a nominal pore size of 0 2 μm with an outer diameter of 650 μm the membrane was installed into a vmd capable housing with the liquid stream supplied through the shell side of the module and vacuum was applied to the lumen of the fibres as shown in fig 2 the vmd cycle water was pumped from a vmd cycle tank through the membrane module through a plate heat exchanger heated by a temperature controlled electric hot water heater and returned to the tank maintained at 64 l by level control module inlet temperature was controlled to 45 c and cycle flow rate was set at 400 l min throughout the trial in batch mode operation influent feedwater was added to the vmd cycle tank to replace permeated water only whereas in continuous mode the feedwater flow rate matched that of rejected rate retaining the 64 l level vacuum was applied to the lumen via a dry screw pump obtained from afapa vacuum equipment shanghai china operated within the range of 7 5 to 17 kpaa to ensure complete capture of the permeated ammonia the pump s vent was directed into 5 l of 0 1 m h2so4 solution refreshed at the start of each operating day at room temperature labelled acid trap in fig 2 to record the amount of permeated water the acid trap was controlled at the fixed 5 l via a level controlled pump passing excess volume to a permeate receiver placed on a balance 1 g which was logged after each day of operation vmd cycle solution was displaced from the membrane module with tapwater and stored under these clean water conditions overnight the displaced vmd cycle was retained and returned to the process at start up of the next day thereby achieving pseudo continuous data the vmd plant was operated 7 h per day 5 days per week to reflect the operation of the belt press filtration and lime dosing facilities a sequence of operating modes were undertaken over the 6 week trial utilising the 2 feedwater streams outlined in table 1 batch mode operation where the starting 64 l of feedwater was allowed to be treated with additional feedwater making up to that volume only depleting the nh3 until a target concentration of 6 mg n l was reached which was considered to represent a typical n discharge requirement from this point continuous mode was engaged where a constant influent and reject stream was maintained to achieve that target nh3 concentration subsequent experiments altered the discharge nh3 target listed in table 1 to explore the capability of the process for scenario 1 the received influent or effluent from the lime dosing facility was filtered through a 10 μm cartridge filter to eliminate variation in amount of sediment being carried into the membrane system the pre filter not illustrate in fig 2 in scenario 2 the influent was taken directly from the settled effluent of the experimental struvite precipitator in a word in both scenario 1 and 2 the plant capacity was tested in low and high throughput modes for examining the separation efficiency at different target discharge concentration of the effluents 2 4 water quality characterization the key chemical analyses required to demonstrate process efficiency was nh3 content in the three streams feedwater vmd cycle i e reject in fig 1 and permeate from these measurements the process performance can be established along with the fate of incoming nh3 monitoring and control of vmd pilot plant was made by determination of ammonia nh3 at the site using the previously described method feedwater and vmd cycle solution was measured for ph and e c using a field meter tps brendale australia 2 5 theories and calculations ammonia removal from an aqueous medium through vaporisation relies on the well described equilibrium between its protonated and molecular forms 1 determined by solution ph and ionic environment 22 1 n h 4 o h n h 3 h 2 o key performance measures to assess nh3 removal effectiveness in water treatment such as this is nh3 flux total water flux nh3 removal efficiency and the treated water s nh3 reduction the potential to recover a usable nh3 product also impacts system economics and practical value however nh3 product recovery was not part of the experimental work and will be explored conceptually total water flux j kg h m2 was calculated from mass of liquid permeate collected m p over period t and the amount of area of membrane exposed a 2 while nh3 flux j n mg h m2 can be defined from mass of nh3 permeated m n and calculated similarly 3 2 j m p a t 3 j n m n a t the driving force for transport is the vapour pressure difference across the membrane δpvap the vapour pressure on the permeate side is determined by the depth of vacuum driven by the vacuum pump and therefore near constant corrected for the mole fraction of nh3 in that atmosphere while the partial pressure of nh3 on the solution side in this case the vmd cycle is determined by the concentration of dissolved nh3 the temperature and henry s law volatility constant 22 the mass transfer coefficient of nh3 c m n can be calculated from 4 expressed as kg m2 h bar 4 c m n j n p vap where the pvap was calculated based on the partial pressure of ammonia at the feed side which was considered as a reasonable assumption given the only volatile components were ammonia and water i e the potential existence of non condensable components such as co2 and air occupied less than 20 of the lumen space in the calculation the influence of ph and the ionic strength on the fraction of free ammonia was taken into consideration 22 the membrane performance was evaluated in terms of the reduction of ammonia r d as the proportion of nh3 remaining in the treated water related to the supplied feedwater calculated by 5 r d c f c cyc c f where cf and c cyc are the nh3 concentration in feedwater and vmd cycle respectively a quantity related to the depletion of ammonia in the feedwater but more accurately reflecting the mass balance of process is the nh3 removal r m which is the amount of nh3 passed through the membrane as a proportion of the mass of nh3 presented to the membrane surface as defined as 6 r m m n m n cycle m n f where m n cycle is the mass of nh3 in the md cycle and m n f is the mass of nh3 added to the cycle over a fixed period of time 3 results and discussion 3 1 vmd plant performance for treatment scenario 1 post lime effluent 3 1 1 feedwater characteristics the water quality indicators of the two streams used as the feedwater to the vmd plant were determined at the pilot facility as shown in table 2 it was noted that the nitrogen concentration of the vmd plant feedwater from the wastewater treatment facility varied from day to day for example in run 2 of scenario 1 the feedwater exhibited an increase of nh3 concentration over the 4 day operation period from 69 to 85 mg n l thereby requiring alteration of the feed rate to meet the target discharge limit of nh3 the range of ionic strength values of the streams was obtained from ions measured when practical and or based on averaged plant statistics these values were used in the calculation of pvap required for eq 4 to enable calculation of the mass transfer coefficient it was found that the mass transfer coefficient was not significantly influenced with all possible ionic strength scenarios using the reported method 22 and therefore did not require a more comprehensive water analysis for every sample to appropriately calculate ammonia vapour pressure the worst case highest ionic strength was used in the calculations by assuming it consisted of divalent ions such as caso4 3 1 2 membrane flux over operation duration the total membrane flux and the change of vacuum pressure of the permeate side over the 14 day operation time for the three running modes described in section 2 is presented in fig 3 it was found that the membrane flux fluctuated between 0 05 and 0 25 kg m2 h which were obtained as the averaged flux values based on daily operation over the two week trial with the main goal of n removal the information relevant to the total membrane flux is presented here only for completeness nevertheless the vacuum pressure of the permeate side was maintained relatively constant in the range of 15 17 kpa indicating stable operating conditions 3 1 3 ammonium reduction in treated feedwater over time fig 4 shows the post lime effluent ammonia concentration and reduction for the three operational modes scenario 1 runs 1 3 on a continuous time series over 14 days it was found that ammonia in the md cycle 64 l volume was reduced to 6 mg n l nh3 representing a 93 reduction in run 1 over 4 day operation from this point onwards run 2 was conducted with 6 mg n l as the target effluent concentration by maintaining an averaged feedwater flowrate of 0 9 l h the adjustment of the feed rate in run 2 was needed because of the variation in the influent quality i e effluent from the wastewater treatment facility from 69 to 85 mg n l whereas in run 3 the discharge limit was set to be higher at 20 mg n l representing situations of a less stringent environment the feed rate was gradually adjusted over the 5 day operation period until 3 3 l h showing a treatment reduction of 71 therefore with careful process control a desired ammonium reduction target can be achieved which is an important finding from this pilot scale trial on the novel means to recover nitrogen 3 1 4 total ammonia removal and ph trend vs total recovered volume fig 5 shows the ph variation of the vmd cycle with the total removed liquid volume obtained in the permeate side it was observed that in general the ph of the vmd cycle increases gradually with increasing total removed volume while the total ammonia removal exhibits a plateau after the removed volume reached about 20 similar observation was reported in the previous work 19 3 2 vmd performance for treatment scenario 2 post struvite effluent 3 2 1 ammonium reduction in treated md feedwater over time table 2 shows water quality of the post struvite effluents and the settled effluent is depleted in po4 and approximately 27 lower nh3 with a ph of 8 7 9 2 making the expected exchange from lime treated effluent relatively simple with similarly alkaline conditions in terms of the ph value and compositional elements e g mg2 ca2 and a slight reduction of ammonia therefore it was considered that similar feedwaters were supplied to the vmd pilot plant under both treatment scenarios the trial results during run 4 and run 5 are presented in fig 6 in terms of the total ammonia reduction along with its concentration in feedwater and the vmd cycle mg n l over the 10 day operation period it was observed that in the first day of run 4 continuous with low throughput under the fixed feed rate an ammonia reduction of 36 from the initial feedwater concentration of 51 7 mg n l to 33 3 mg n l in the reject stream to reach a discharge target of 10 mg n l a total ammonia reduction of 85 was achieved at the end of this 5 day period for run 5 continuous with high throughput fig 6 show that the discharge water quality or the reject stream declined quickly to 29 6 mg n l in the first day of run 5 and continued to maintain at a similar level 33 mg n l over the rest of the operation period the overall ammonia reduction through run 5 was between 41 and 47 the slight variation of which was attributed to the variation of the feedwater quality table 2 the results obtained from run 4 and run 5 indicated the upper limit of the vmd plant considering both the discharge requirement and the integration with the capacity of the struvite precipitation system 3 3 summary of nitrogen removal via vmd pilot plant the results for plant performance presented in this report thus far focused on reduction yet removal is a measure that shows the actual quantity of nitrogen removed relative to what was fed removal calculated in steady state condition in table 3 shows the obtained concentration of the n depleted discharge reject stream and the nitrogen reduction and removal under each trial setting and fresh feed flowrate except in run 5 where the fluctuation of the receiving influent concentration was relatively significant overall the nitrogen reduction and removal are quite similar on those days under steady state operation which are also directly related to the concentration of their discharge reject streams i e the higher the removal reduction the lower the effluent concentration the novel application of vmd for nitrogen removal was further explored in more fundamental detail a key indicator of vmd performance is ammonia permeation flux as described in eq 3 of section 2 this is based on the results shown from figs 3 to 6 over the course of the trial ammonia fluxes were found to vary in the ranges of 1 4 2 5 mg m2 h in low reject concentration mode run 2 target nh3 in the reject stream was 10 mg n l and 5 4 13 9 mg m2 h in high throughput mode in run 5 nh3 in the discharge reject at 20 33 mg l periods of highest vmd cycle concentration demonstrated highest ammonia flux and run 5 experienced a 3 day period of vmd cycle ammonia averaging 33 0 mg n l corresponding to a sustained ammonia flux of 11 0 mg m2 h over the period overall the obtained ammonia flux was significantly lower than that of best case lab test results under similar feed concentration and temperature e g 1000 4000 mg m2 h for feeds with ph from 7 to 10 as described previously 19 the main reasons could be due to the difference in solution characteristics e g sources existence of carbonate ph range etc the magnitude of the vacuum pressure i e two order higher in the trial and the fluctuation in operating conditions in the pilot trial further the difference in ammonia flux across two different apparatuses using similar membrane types could also be due to the significant difference in membrane area employed i e 27 8 m2 in this pilot vs 0 005 m2 used previously 19 the membrane module and housing were designed for mf uf use so optimal conditions for vmd were not explored and could account the discrepancy ammonia mass transfer coefficient was also explored from the trial calculated by eq 4 the relationship between mass transfer coefficient in terms of the process driving force with units g m2 h bar with several process parameters such as trial time the nh3 concentration mg n l and ph of the feed side of the membrane module the solution cycling between vmd cycle tank and membrane is shown in fig 7 the degree of scatter in the data is likely due to the variations in waste water properties over time and deviations due to adjustment of operating conditions during the run overall it was observed that the magnitude of the normalised ammonia flux regardless of these process parameters i e more than 80 of the data points fall around the value of 0 16 kg m2 h bar 37 rsd this correlates with theory where feed ammonia vapour concentration follows solution concentration according to henry s law and influenced by temperature and ph of the solution 22 the temperature in this study were kept relatively constant throughout the trial observing trends in presenting against these parameters there appears to be a slight downward trend in mass transfer coefficient with time suggesting a possible loss in performance for example from membrane fouling no trend is observed with concentration which is to be expected if the driving force has been accounted for in the calculations this should also apply to ph however there appeared to be a declining trend with increasing ph lowest mass transfer coefficient values calculated at the highest ph values the reason for this trend is not able to be concluded from the current data but may relate to other properties in the wastewater that correlate to ph and that its influence on ammonia vapour pressure are not completely represented regardless the model for vapour pressure used in eq 4 accounting for more complex wastewater characteristics reported by 22 allowed us to calculate mass transfer coefficients where 80 of the values fell within one standard deviation of the average ammonia recovery by vmd is therefore technically valid as a process where the treatment targets can be configured by the process operation as demonstrated in our continuous mode trials given the scope of the trial investigations on the effects of operating conditions were not intended for example although previous bench studies demonstrated that the vacuum pressure at the permeate side may have significant impact on the membrane performance it was challenging to adjust the vacuum pressure to

13048,nitrogen removal in integrated vertical flow constructed wetlands ivcw is often limited by denitrification processes due to the lack of carbon sources this study aims to elucidate the enhancement effects and mechanisms of alkali pretreated reeds as plant based carbon source on the nitrogen removal process of ivcw the results show near complete removal of both cod and nh4 n with removal efficiencies of circa 98 0 the alkali pretreated reeds were demonstrated to increase the removal efficiencies of no3 n and tn from 15 97 and 53 13 to 95 5 and 93 7 the plant based carbon source release organic matter primarily composed of tryptophan like fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances among these substances the low molecular weight organic matter closely related to the carboxyl functional group showed high bioavailability 16s rrna gene sequencing demonstrated the plant based carbon source to increase the relative abundance of nitrogen removal functional microbial genera up to 24 12 consequently total nitrogen tn removal increased notably from 47 77 to 89 10 primarily driven by a significant increase in denitrification from 0 16 mg l to 14 11 mg l the tn removal was further enhanced by a considerable increase in anaerobic ammonia oxidation from 0 18 mg l to 1 73 mg l the findings could support efficient nitrogen removal in cw via the enhancement of denitrification pathways graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords integrated vertical flow constructed wetlands plant based carbon source nitrogen removal microbial community 1 introduction constructed wetlands cw are widely used in the treatment of various types of wastewaters cw are known not only for their high wastewater purification capacity but also for the advantages of low energy consumption environmental friendliness and simple operation and maintenance 1 2 the main pathways for nitrogen transformation and removal in cw include nitrification denitrification anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra driven by microbial metabolic activities 3 recently innovative wetland designs or operations such as aerated subsurface flow cw tidal flow cw and baffled subsurface flow cw have been developed and applied for efficient nitrogen removal 4 5 the starting point of these designs is to enhance the nitrification denitrification efficiency of wetlands by creating an alternating aerobic anoxic anaerobic environment suitable for nitrogen removal integrated vertical flow constructed wetlands ivcw are designed to achieve aerobic anoxic anaerobic anoxic aerobic multi oxygen conditions by coupling a down flow unsaturated cw and an up flow saturated cw without additional power and operational input 5 6 however there is often a shortage of carbon sources in the second stage of ivcw which in turn limits the denitrification process and the tn removal efficiency 7 therefore optimization of the operational aerobic anoxic environmental conditions and c n is the key to improving the efficiency of nitrogen removal in ivcw compared with the use of organic fillers and segmented influents 8 the addition of an external carbon source between the two stages of the ivcw can control c n in the second stage of ivcw more flexibly and more efficiently however there are relatively few studies on carbon source addition and information on appropriate materials for use as a carbon source in wetlands is limited in addition to the common liquid carbon sources such as methanol ethanol and acetic acid 9 wetland plants such as cattail reed and agricultural crops such as wheat and straw are also used as carbon sources due to their low cost and ready supply 10 12 harvesting of dead wetland plants during the cold season is an effective method of preventing their decaying and releasing of pollutants therefore it is a more natural and ecological approach to use wetland plants obtained through harvesting as additional carbon sources in cw wetland plants can release amino acids such as tryptophan that can be easily utilized by microorganisms thus improving the organic carbon content and denitrification efficiency of the wetland after addition 13 however with the release of easily degradable organic matter cellulose and lignin in plant tissues are also gradually degraded or converted to humus 14 humic acid like compounds with high molecular weight and aromaticity tend to be less bioavailable 15 by contrast low molecular weight humic acid still has good bioavailability 12 few studies have demonstrated the applicability of plant based carbon sources in cw however studies on the release of various organic components of the plant based carbon sources in cw are scarce particularly knowledge on the utilization characteristics of plant based carbon sources in ivcw and the promotion of denitrification is scarce and further investigation is required nitrogen removal microorganisms in cw are affected by the wetland operational conditions such as dissolved oxygen ph and redox potential therefore the differential physicochemical conditions in the down flow and up flow cw of ivcw will inevitably lead to spatial differences in microbial community richness and structure in ivcw 16 however the distribution characteristics of the denitrifying microorganisms are not clear furthermore the addition of plant based carbon sources to cws also affects the microbial community structure for example the addition of wheat straw increased the relative abundance of paludibacter and saccharofermentans 17 also the addition of cattail litter increased the relative abundance of flavobacterium dechloromonas and bacillus 18 furthermore dissolved organic matter dom released from plant based carbon sources also contributes to microbial activity 19 since carbon addition significantly affects the composition and activity of denitrifying microorganisms in ivcw there is a possibility of inducing nitrogen removal pathways other than denitrification such as anaerobic ammonia oxidation amx under suitable reaction substrates and conditions however the effects of carbon source addition to ivcw on denitrification pathways have been less studied the mechanisms and enhancement patterns of denitrification by carbon source addition are even less clear therefore alkali pretreated reed as a carbon source was added to ivcw for the enhancement of nitrogen removal alkali pretreatment was demonstrated to break the ester and ether bonds of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin in plants to form small organic molecules 13 20 therefore the amount of carbon released from alkali treated reeds was higher and the release rate could be maintained over a longer period than other pretreatment methods and plants species which resulted in a continuous high denitrification promotion capacity 12 the specific objectives of this study were i determine the effect of wetland plant based carbon source on the denitrification performance of ivcw ii investigate the distribution and utilization characteristics of substances released by the plant based carbon source in ivcw iii clarify the effects of carbon source addition on the distribution and shifts of denitrification microorganisms in ivcw based on the results the denitrification enhancement mechanism of plant based carbon source addition in ivcw is elucidated also a theoretical basis for improving the pollutant purification performance of constructed wetlands is provided 2 materials and methods 2 1 set up and operation of the ivcw two parallel sets of ivcw were established under greenhouse conditions one of which was with no external carbon addition n ivcw and the other had external carbon addition c ivcw fig 1 each ivcw consists of two polymethyl methacrylate columns with identical dimensions h 100 cm ф 15 cm which were wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent algae growth the first columns of the ivcws were operated with down flow n1 c1 whereas the second columns were with up flow n2 c2 the substrate comprised a 60 cm layer of gravel φ2 6 mm on the top and a 20 cm layer of coarse gravel φ10 20 mm at the bottom acorus calamus was planted at an initial density of 10 plants per column synthetic sewage was prepared every two days from glucose nh4cl kno3 and kh2po4 yielding the influent concentrations of cod 570 32 mg l tn 32 08 mg l nh4 n 20 144 mg l no3 n 12 31 mg l no2 n 0 187 mg l and tp 5 53 mg l the ivcws were operated continuously at a hydraulic loading rate hlr of 0 17 m3 m2 d and hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 d in the experimental period from may to december in 2020 reed a common wetland plant was used to prepare a plant based carbon source the plant was first washed with deionized water and oven dried at 45 c to a constant weight subsequently it was cut into 2 3 cm soaked in 2 naoh solution at 25 c for 24 h finally it was washed to neutrality with deionized water dried and stored in a dryer at room temperature 60 g of the plant based carbon source was wrapped in gauze placed at the junction of the two c ivcw columns thus the c n in n2 and c2 was 0 90 and 3 67 respectively moreover the plant based carbon source was replaced every one month because the high denitrification promotion ability of the alkali treated group could be maintained for about 30 days 12 2 2 sampling and analytical methods 2 2 1 water sampling and chemical analysis water samples were collected weekly from the inlet and outlet of the first and second columns of two ivcws water quality parameters including cod tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n and tp concentrations were measured according to standard methods mepc 2002 water do and ph were measured at the same time of sampling using a portable meter hq30d hach usa the fluorescence characteristics of dom along the c ivcw were analyzed by using a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f7000 hix reflects the degree of doc humification or maturity of dom 21 and was calculated as follows 1 hix f ex 254 nm em 435 480 nm f ex 254 nm em 300 345 nm 2 2 2 substrate sampling and microbial analysis substrate samples were collected from the top labelled 1 6 middle labelled 2 5 and bottom labelled 3 4 of each column of the ivcws fig 1 using sterile shovels soil adhering to the substrates was washed off with ultrapure water and collected into 50 ml sterilized centrifuge tubes subsequently they were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min samples from the same column were homogenized consequently resulting in a total of four substrate samples n1 n2 c1 and c2 the samples were stored at 80 c before sending to sangong biotech inc shanghai china for dna extraction and illumina miseq sequencing analysis the v4 v5 regions of bacterial 16s rrna were selected as taxonomy specific fragments operational taxonomic unit otu clustering analysis based on a 97 similarity level was performed using usearch version 11 0 667 the richness index and diversity index of the microbial communities were calculated by mothur version 1 43 0 analysis at the 3 discrepancy level 2 2 3 characterization of plant based carbon source the surface functional groups were analyzed via diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy drift is50 thermo scientific usa at the scanning step of 1 cm 1 and wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 2 3 statistical analyses statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics software version 26 0 and origin 2021 software differences in removal efficiencies for each pollutant were analyzed using t tests and correlations were determined using pearson correlation coefficients differences and correlations were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 principal component analysis pca was performed using canoco 5 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhancement patterns of nitrogen removal of ivcw by carbon source addition the average effluent concentrations of cod in the first column of the ivcw n1 and c1 were 14 95 6 48 mg l and 9 11 4 76 mg l the resulting average removal efficiencies of 97 38 and 98 40 respectively were recorded with no significant differences p 0 05 table 1 the high removal efficiency of cod in the first column was attributed to the fact that n1 and c1 were unsaturated which reportedly exhibit high biodegradation of organic matter 22 for the second column the effluent cod concentration of n2 was 8 82 5 13 mg l due to the addition of a carbon source the influent cod concentration of c2 increased to 74 63 mg l with the effluent of only 13 33 5 58 mg l which was not significantly different from that in n2 p 0 05 table 1 the similarity showed that the addition of the carbon source did not influence the effluent cod concentration thus the slight increase of the effluent cod caused by the imbalance between carbon source release rate and utilization rate did not show any influence on the performance of ivcw c 20 in addition the cod release rate of the carbon source in c2 was 159 27 mg d while the cod removal rate in c2 was 146 59 mg d with a utilization rate that reached 92 04 therefore the cod released from the reed based carbon sources was almost completely degraded or utilized showing high bioavailability the average concentrations of tn recorded in the effluents of n1 and c1 were 16 62 2 97 mg l and 18 03 2 71 mg l resulting in the average removal efficiencies of 48 19 and 43 80 respectively p 0 05 table 1 table 1 also shows that nh4 n and no3 n in the ivcw influent accounted for 61 71 and 37 72 of tn respectively conversely no2 n concentrations in the influent and effluent were low with little variation moreover the concentrations of nh4 n in n1 and c1 were reduced to 0 49 0 34 mg l and 1 22 0 54 mg l in the effluent while the no3 n concentrations were increased to 14 65 1 88 mg l n1 and 14 93 1 61 mg l c1 respectively table 1 this finding indicated that the unsaturated operation of the first columns of the ivcw was highly conducive for nitrification processes and that tn removal in the wetland was also mainly driven by nitrification 22 in addition the increase in no3 n concentrations were lower than the removal of nh4 n in the first columns while ammonia nitrogen volatilization was negligible ph 6 47 and plant uptake was limited therefore simultaneous nitrification and denitrification processes likely occurred in the first column 23 the denitrification process in the first columns primarily used glucose as the carbon source and the reaction equation was 2 8no3 c6h12o6 0 5nh4 2 3h 0 5c5h7no2 1 4 n2 3 5co2 6 4h2o 24 in this process the stoichiometric ratio of nh4 n no3 n and c6h12o6 was 0 5 2 8 1 and the ratio of nh4 n to no3 n was 1 1 so the ratio of n to c6h12o6 was 3 3 1 and the cod consumption was 4 156 gcod gn thus the cod used for denitrification in c1 and n1 was 71 95 mg l and 67 71 mg l respectively accounting for only 12 95 and 12 06 of the cod degradation at this stage table 2 therefore the high cod concentration in the influent provided sufficient electron donors for denitrification but the efficient degradation of cod also led to a scarcity of carbon sources in the second columns of the ivcw n2 and c2 however the effluent tn concentration of c2 2 03 1 72 mg l was remarkably lower than that of n2 15 04 2 07 mg l consequently the tn removal efficiency was also significantly improved from 53 13 to 93 66 due to the addition of the plant based carbon source the influent tn concentration of c2 increased to 20 31 mg l and thus the cod n also increased from 0 9 in n2 to 3 67 this cod n was conducive for efficient denitrification reactions to occur in c ivcw in addition the effluent no3 n concentration in c2 0 55 0 61 mg l was also notably lower than that of n2 14 27 1 86 mg l p 0 05 therefore the enhancement of cod n by the carbon source and distribution of nitrogen removal microbial communities in the second column of the ivcw might be the reasons for the differences in nitrogen removal 19 previous studies have also shown that plant based carbon sources could provide sufficient electron donors for denitrification processes it could also provide carbon materials for microbial cells to improve denitrification microbial activity 13 25 furthermore the saturated operating conditions of the second column facilitated the amx process 26 the stoichiometric ratio of nh4 n to no3 n in amx was 1 1 06 5 so the nitrogen removed by amx and denitrification were 0 18 mg l and 0 16 mg l for 0 34 mg l of n2 accounting for 52 53 and 47 77 of the nitrogen removal respectively for c2 the nitrogen removed by amx and denitrification were 1 73 mg l and 14 11 mg l accounting for 10 90 and 89 10 of the nitrogen removal respectively table 2 overall the nitrogen removal by amx and denitrification processes increased in the wetland with carbon addition but the proportion of nitrogen removal by the denitrification process increased more significantly the effluent tp concentrations of n ivcw and c ivcw were 2 71 0 33 mg l and 2 22 0 47 mg l respectively the removal efficiencies of tp in c ivcw were higher than that in n ivcw 30 19 vs 19 58 due to the increase in phosphorus adsorption and complexation sites by the plant based carbon source 27 3 2 utilization characteristics of plant based carbon source in ivcw after the plant based carbon source addition and utilization in c ivcw the surface structure became looser with more pronounced irregular pores fig s1 these changes indicated that the biodegradable components of the plant based carbon source had been fully utilized additionally the fourier transform infrared spectrum of the carbon source before and after addition to the ivcw fig 2 showed a broad absorption band at 3420 14 cm 1 which is associated with intermolecular hydrogen bonds in carboxyl and alcohol groups oh 28 another at 2917 77 cm 1 shows the stretching vibration peak of saturated hydrocarbon ch corresponding to organic compounds such as hydrocarbons and lipids 29 furthermore an absorption band at 1734 17 cm 1 showed co stretching vibrational peaks mostly for carbonyl compounds and esters etc moreover the absorption peaks at 3420 14 cm 1 2917 77 cm 1 and 1734 17 cm 1 were significantly lower after application in c ivcw the lower peaks suggested that simple compounds released from the plant based carbon source might be used by heterotrophic bacterial genera such as denitrifying bacteria additionally hydroxyl and carboxyl groups could also act as binding sites for dissolved organic carbon and other pollutants within the c ivcw furthermore they could form complexes with pollutants through electrostatic adsorption complexation and ion exchange thereby facilitating the migration and removal of pollutants 30 however material peaks such as the bending vibration peak at 1462 26 cm 1 representing ch of alkanes the stretching vibration peaks at 1248 20 cm 1 and 1050 53 cm 1 representing co hemicellulose and the out of plane bending peak at 614 22 cm 1 of oh in the plant based carbon source were largely undiminished after application three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy 3deem of c ivcw before and after the carbon source addition a b and along column c2 b d are shown in fig 3 after the addition of the plant based carbon source the intensity of dissolved microbial metabolic by products ex 250 nm em 380 nm humic acid like substances ex 250 nm em 380 nm 31 and fulvic acid like substances ex 250 nm em 380 nm were significantly enhanced fig 3 the plant based carbon source with a high organic matter content provided significant amounts of protein for enzymatic decomposition resulting in higher amounts of protein like fluorescent substances moreover the decay of plant residues produced humic like substances ex em 250 300 400 460 nm the latter possibly associated with carbonyl and hydroxyl groups 32 in addition tryptophan like substances peaks were also present in the influent of column c2 ex em 275 340 nm fig 3 which were associated with carboxyl functional groups in the plant based carbon source 31 additionally the fluorescence peaks of tryptophan like substances and fulvic acid like substances decreased first along column c2 followed by the fluorescence peaks of humic acid like substances fig 3 this decrease indicated tryptophan like substances were bioavailable organic matter and could be preferentially utilized as the main nutrient source for denitrifying microorganisms 32 the more complex the structure of organic matter the higher the cod consumption for denitrification about 3 705 gcod gn 4 203 gcod gn 3 744 gcod gn and 5 272 gcod gn is required for denitrification using methanol ethanol acetic acid and typical organic matter as carbon sources respectively 24 the cod consumption in the lower and upper regions of c2 was approximately 3 152 gcod gn and 6 721 gcod gn respectively these consumption rates also indicated that the carbon sources first utilized by heterotrophic microorganisms in c2 were relatively simple compounds low molecular weight tryptophan like substances and fulvic acid like substances followed by more complex organic substances humic acid like substances this phenomenon in c2 was also consistent with the decrease in the oh intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups as well as the decrease in the co absorption peaks in the carbonyl and ester compounds moreover the hix index of dom in c2 increased slightly 0 65 vs 0 79 after the addition of the plant based carbon source subsequently it increased significantly along the ivcw 0 79 1 94 2 62 indicating that the plant based carbon source could release some macromolecular aromatic substances however the preferential utilization of simple and easily degradable organic matter by wetland microorganisms led to higher carbon to hydrogen ratios of doc in the ivcw 3 3 effect of plant based carbon source on microbial distribution in ivcw microbial nitrogen removal is the main pathway of nitrogen removal in cw high throughput analysis of microbial samples from the ivcw was conducted to further elucidate the mechanism of nitrogen removal enhancement by the plant based carbon source the coverage values for all microbial samples were close to 100 demonstrating that the likelihood of undetected sequences in the samples was extremely low the number of otus as well as the abundance and diversity of microbial communities in the second columns of the ivcw was significantly higher than in the first columns table s1 this difference indicated that the saturated operating conditions in the second columns were more conducive for the growth of microorganisms attached to the substrate filler 33 in addition the richness estimators ace and chao1 and diversity indexes simpson and shannon for c2 were superior to n2 the difference showed that the application of the plant based carbon source could promote microbial abundance and diversity in the second column resulting in higher microbial metabolic activity 34 pca analysis based on otu levels also revealed that the microbial communities of n1 and c1 clustered in the same quadrant therefore n1 and c1 had similar internal environments and microbial communities nevertheless differences in the internal environment of the first and second columns of the ivcw also led to differences in the internal microbial composition thus there were significant differences in the microbial community compositions of n2 and c2 due to the addition of the plant based carbon source fig s2 the composition of microorganisms in both ivcws at phylum and genus levels is shown in fig 4 the main dominant phyla in both n ivcw and c ivcw were proteobacteria 44 33 58 48 acidobacteria 4 14 8 87 and bacteroidetes 4 04 10 15 fig 4a these phyla play an important role in the degradation of pollutants 26 among them the absolute dominance of proteobacteria ensured the removal efficiency of organic matter and nitrogen in the ivcw 35 by contrast acidobacteria plays a significant role in the degradation of plant residues whereas bacteroidetes degraded substances such as proteins and cellulose therefore the presence of these two phyla facilitated the decomposition and utilization of the plant based carbon source in addition the relative abundance of firmicutes 2 06 vs 10 87 actinobacteria 2 31 vs 10 10 planctomycetes 1 17 vs 3 87 and chloroflexi 0 87 vs 3 46 in c2 were significantly higher than n2 fig 4a therefore the addition of the plant based carbon source demonstrably markedly influenced the composition of the microbial phyla in the ivcw 36 also firmicutes actinobacteria planctomycetes and chloroflexi were the dominant groups in c ivcw among them actinobacteria mainly contributes to the decomposition of organic matter in an anaerobic environment and plays an important role in the anaerobic biodegradation of pollutants 21 firmicutes and chloroflexi facilitate the carbon and nitrogen cycling processes as well as denitrification in wetlands 36 37 planctomycetes could promote synergistic denitrification with amx processes under a suitable organic carbon source 38 the relative abundance of planctomycetes in c2 was significantly higher than that of n2 which demonstrated that the plant based carbon source could promote synergistic effects of multiple denitrification pathways in ivcw the dominant bacterial genera in both n ivcw and c ivcw were unclassified xanthomonadaceae unclassified betaproteobacteria and unclassified gammaproteobacteria however the unclassified xanthomonadaceae had a higher relative abundance in the first columns 22 03 28 67 than in the second columns 10 16 1 17 conversely unclassified betaproteobacteria and unclassified gammaproteobacteria showed the opposite the relative abundance of the second columns 9 37 12 05 and 4 03 8 32 was higher than in the first columns 4 17 4 36 and 1 38 0 75 fig 4b unclassified xanthomonadaceae are potential aobs that could participate in nh4 n oxidation or autotrophic nitrification 39 so the better oxygenated conditions in the first columns were more conducive for the transformation of ammonia moreover unclassified betaproteobacteria and unclassified gammaproteobacteria could participate in the degradation of organic matter and denitrification 35 the anaerobic conditions of the second columns were more conducive to the growth of these genera moreover the relative abundance of unclassified xanthomonadaceae was lower in c2 than n2 whereas the relative abundance of unclassified betaproteobacteria and unclassified gammaproteobacteria was higher in c2 than n2 fig 4b this difference indicated that increasing the amount of carbon source promoted the enrichment of organic matter degrading genera also it provided the electron donor required for the denitrification process furthermore the consumption of dissolved oxygen by the organic matter degradation process further promoted the enrichment of denitrifying genera the denitrifying genera with high relative abundance in both ivcws included clostridium sensu stricto unclassified planctomycetaceae bacillus and unclassified rhizobiales 18 36 the relative abundance of these genera in c2 was 25 98 3 72 27 04 and 3 43 times higher than that of n2 respectively fig s3 these differences further indicated the contribution of the plant based carbon source to the enrichment of denitrifying functional genera clostridium sensu stricto is also a phosphorus accumulating bacterium which enhanced phosphorus removal in c ivcw 59 83 vs 51 09 3 4 role of plant based carbon source in ivcw denitrification enhancement the mechanism of nitrogen removal enhancement by the plant based carbon source in ivcw is illustrated in fig 5 the first columns of the ivcw were operated with unsaturated water flow which not only exhibited better nitrification 94 and simultaneous denitrification ability but also achieved efficient removal of organic matter 97 nonetheless this condition also caused the problem of insufficient carbon sources for denitrification in the second column however the addition of the plant based carbon source increased the cod n in c2 from 0 90 to 3 67 also the plant based carbon source released tryptophan like substances and fulvic acid like substances with low molecular weights that had higher bioavailability therefore at a cod release rate of 159 27 mg d from the plant based carbon source the utilization rate reached 92 04 providing sufficient electron donors for the denitrification process nonetheless with the utilization and degradation of readily biodegradable organic matter the proportion of relatively high molecular weight humic acid like substances released from the plant based carbon source gradually increased consequently the carbon to hydrogen ratio and hix index of organic matter in the ivcw gradually increased also the degradation process of organic matter caused a decrease in do within the ivcw from 7 57 mg l to 0 55 mg l and an increase in ph from 4 15 to 6 06 the effective release of organic matter by the plant based carbon source and the changes in environmental conditions caused by the degradation process provided favorable conditions for the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria fig 4b the correlation between the relative abundance of functional genera and no3 n removal r 0 909 such as clostridium sensu stricto bacillus and dechloromonas was also significantly higher from 17 85 to 24 12 due to the carbon source addition carbon source addition and enrichment of denitrifying functional genera ultimately resulted in an increase in the nitrogen removal by denitrification processes in c2 from 0 16 mg l to 14 11 mg l furthermore the anoxic and c n conditions in the second column also led to an increase in the relative abundance of unclassified planctomycetaceae from 0 85 to 3 17 the unclassified planctomycetaceae showed a positive correlation with the removal of nh4 n no3 n no2 n this finding indicated that it could drive both denitrification and amx therefore the nitrogen removal by the amx pathway in c2 also increased from 0 18 mg l to 1 73 mg l overall the addition of the plant based carbon source could improve the contribution of denitrification and amx pathways to nitrogen removal in the second column however the contribution of denitrification to total nitrogen removal was more significant 89 10 therefore carbon source addition enhanced tn removal in the ivcw up to 93 66 mainly via the denitrification pathway 4 conclusions the removal efficiencies of cod and nh4 n in ivcw reached circa 98 0 the plant based carbon source enhanced removal rates of no3 n and tn up to 95 5 and 93 7 respectively the plant based carbon source release organic matter mainly composed of tryptophan like fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances the tryptophan like substances closely related to carboxyl functional groups were demonstrated to be easily used preferentially by microorganisms the plant based carbon source also demonstrably promoted the enrichment of denitrification functional microbial genera significantly as well as others involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling consequently total nitrogen tn removal increased notably from 47 77 to 89 10 primarily driven by a significant increase in denitrification from 0 16 mg l to 14 11 mg l the tn removal was further enhanced by a considerable increase in anaerobic ammonia oxidation from 0 18 mg l to 1 73 mg l therefore plant based carbon source addition could enhance nitrogen removal through primarily denitrification 89 10 as well as amx 10 90 pathways credit authorship contribution statement

13048,nitrogen removal in integrated vertical flow constructed wetlands ivcw is often limited by denitrification processes due to the lack of carbon sources this study aims to elucidate the enhancement effects and mechanisms of alkali pretreated reeds as plant based carbon source on the nitrogen removal process of ivcw the results show near complete removal of both cod and nh4 n with removal efficiencies of circa 98 0 the alkali pretreated reeds were demonstrated to increase the removal efficiencies of no3 n and tn from 15 97 and 53 13 to 95 5 and 93 7 the plant based carbon source release organic matter primarily composed of tryptophan like fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances among these substances the low molecular weight organic matter closely related to the carboxyl functional group showed high bioavailability 16s rrna gene sequencing demonstrated the plant based carbon source to increase the relative abundance of nitrogen removal functional microbial genera up to 24 12 consequently total nitrogen tn removal increased notably from 47 77 to 89 10 primarily driven by a significant increase in denitrification from 0 16 mg l to 14 11 mg l the tn removal was further enhanced by a considerable increase in anaerobic ammonia oxidation from 0 18 mg l to 1 73 mg l the findings could support efficient nitrogen removal in cw via the enhancement of denitrification pathways graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords integrated vertical flow constructed wetlands plant based carbon source nitrogen removal microbial community 1 introduction constructed wetlands cw are widely used in the treatment of various types of wastewaters cw are known not only for their high wastewater purification capacity but also for the advantages of low energy consumption environmental friendliness and simple operation and maintenance 1 2 the main pathways for nitrogen transformation and removal in cw include nitrification denitrification anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra driven by microbial metabolic activities 3 recently innovative wetland designs or operations such as aerated subsurface flow cw tidal flow cw and baffled subsurface flow cw have been developed and applied for efficient nitrogen removal 4 5 the starting point of these designs is to enhance the nitrification denitrification efficiency of wetlands by creating an alternating aerobic anoxic anaerobic environment suitable for nitrogen removal integrated vertical flow constructed wetlands ivcw are designed to achieve aerobic anoxic anaerobic anoxic aerobic multi oxygen conditions by coupling a down flow unsaturated cw and an up flow saturated cw without additional power and operational input 5 6 however there is often a shortage of carbon sources in the second stage of ivcw which in turn limits the denitrification process and the tn removal efficiency 7 therefore optimization of the operational aerobic anoxic environmental conditions and c n is the key to improving the efficiency of nitrogen removal in ivcw compared with the use of organic fillers and segmented influents 8 the addition of an external carbon source between the two stages of the ivcw can control c n in the second stage of ivcw more flexibly and more efficiently however there are relatively few studies on carbon source addition and information on appropriate materials for use as a carbon source in wetlands is limited in addition to the common liquid carbon sources such as methanol ethanol and acetic acid 9 wetland plants such as cattail reed and agricultural crops such as wheat and straw are also used as carbon sources due to their low cost and ready supply 10 12 harvesting of dead wetland plants during the cold season is an effective method of preventing their decaying and releasing of pollutants therefore it is a more natural and ecological approach to use wetland plants obtained through harvesting as additional carbon sources in cw wetland plants can release amino acids such as tryptophan that can be easily utilized by microorganisms thus improving the organic carbon content and denitrification efficiency of the wetland after addition 13 however with the release of easily degradable organic matter cellulose and lignin in plant tissues are also gradually degraded or converted to humus 14 humic acid like compounds with high molecular weight and aromaticity tend to be less bioavailable 15 by contrast low molecular weight humic acid still has good bioavailability 12 few studies have demonstrated the applicability of plant based carbon sources in cw however studies on the release of various organic components of the plant based carbon sources in cw are scarce particularly knowledge on the utilization characteristics of plant based carbon sources in ivcw and the promotion of denitrification is scarce and further investigation is required nitrogen removal microorganisms in cw are affected by the wetland operational conditions such as dissolved oxygen ph and redox potential therefore the differential physicochemical conditions in the down flow and up flow cw of ivcw will inevitably lead to spatial differences in microbial community richness and structure in ivcw 16 however the distribution characteristics of the denitrifying microorganisms are not clear furthermore the addition of plant based carbon sources to cws also affects the microbial community structure for example the addition of wheat straw increased the relative abundance of paludibacter and saccharofermentans 17 also the addition of cattail litter increased the relative abundance of flavobacterium dechloromonas and bacillus 18 furthermore dissolved organic matter dom released from plant based carbon sources also contributes to microbial activity 19 since carbon addition significantly affects the composition and activity of denitrifying microorganisms in ivcw there is a possibility of inducing nitrogen removal pathways other than denitrification such as anaerobic ammonia oxidation amx under suitable reaction substrates and conditions however the effects of carbon source addition to ivcw on denitrification pathways have been less studied the mechanisms and enhancement patterns of denitrification by carbon source addition are even less clear therefore alkali pretreated reed as a carbon source was added to ivcw for the enhancement of nitrogen removal alkali pretreatment was demonstrated to break the ester and ether bonds of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin in plants to form small organic molecules 13 20 therefore the amount of carbon released from alkali treated reeds was higher and the release rate could be maintained over a longer period than other pretreatment methods and plants species which resulted in a continuous high denitrification promotion capacity 12 the specific objectives of this study were i determine the effect of wetland plant based carbon source on the denitrification performance of ivcw ii investigate the distribution and utilization characteristics of substances released by the plant based carbon source in ivcw iii clarify the effects of carbon source addition on the distribution and shifts of denitrification microorganisms in ivcw based on the results the denitrification enhancement mechanism of plant based carbon source addition in ivcw is elucidated also a theoretical basis for improving the pollutant purification performance of constructed wetlands is provided 2 materials and methods 2 1 set up and operation of the ivcw two parallel sets of ivcw were established under greenhouse conditions one of which was with no external carbon addition n ivcw and the other had external carbon addition c ivcw fig 1 each ivcw consists of two polymethyl methacrylate columns with identical dimensions h 100 cm ф 15 cm which were wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent algae growth the first columns of the ivcws were operated with down flow n1 c1 whereas the second columns were with up flow n2 c2 the substrate comprised a 60 cm layer of gravel φ2 6 mm on the top and a 20 cm layer of coarse gravel φ10 20 mm at the bottom acorus calamus was planted at an initial density of 10 plants per column synthetic sewage was prepared every two days from glucose nh4cl kno3 and kh2po4 yielding the influent concentrations of cod 570 32 mg l tn 32 08 mg l nh4 n 20 144 mg l no3 n 12 31 mg l no2 n 0 187 mg l and tp 5 53 mg l the ivcws were operated continuously at a hydraulic loading rate hlr of 0 17 m3 m2 d and hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 d in the experimental period from may to december in 2020 reed a common wetland plant was used to prepare a plant based carbon source the plant was first washed with deionized water and oven dried at 45 c to a constant weight subsequently it was cut into 2 3 cm soaked in 2 naoh solution at 25 c for 24 h finally it was washed to neutrality with deionized water dried and stored in a dryer at room temperature 60 g of the plant based carbon source was wrapped in gauze placed at the junction of the two c ivcw columns thus the c n in n2 and c2 was 0 90 and 3 67 respectively moreover the plant based carbon source was replaced every one month because the high denitrification promotion ability of the alkali treated group could be maintained for about 30 days 12 2 2 sampling and analytical methods 2 2 1 water sampling and chemical analysis water samples were collected weekly from the inlet and outlet of the first and second columns of two ivcws water quality parameters including cod tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n and tp concentrations were measured according to standard methods mepc 2002 water do and ph were measured at the same time of sampling using a portable meter hq30d hach usa the fluorescence characteristics of dom along the c ivcw were analyzed by using a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f7000 hix reflects the degree of doc humification or maturity of dom 21 and was calculated as follows 1 hix f ex 254 nm em 435 480 nm f ex 254 nm em 300 345 nm 2 2 2 substrate sampling and microbial analysis substrate samples were collected from the top labelled 1 6 middle labelled 2 5 and bottom labelled 3 4 of each column of the ivcws fig 1 using sterile shovels soil adhering to the substrates was washed off with ultrapure water and collected into 50 ml sterilized centrifuge tubes subsequently they were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min samples from the same column were homogenized consequently resulting in a total of four substrate samples n1 n2 c1 and c2 the samples were stored at 80 c before sending to sangong biotech inc shanghai china for dna extraction and illumina miseq sequencing analysis the v4 v5 regions of bacterial 16s rrna were selected as taxonomy specific fragments operational taxonomic unit otu clustering analysis based on a 97 similarity level was performed using usearch version 11 0 667 the richness index and diversity index of the microbial communities were calculated by mothur version 1 43 0 analysis at the 3 discrepancy level 2 2 3 characterization of plant based carbon source the surface functional groups were analyzed via diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy drift is50 thermo scientific usa at the scanning step of 1 cm 1 and wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 2 3 statistical analyses statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics software version 26 0 and origin 2021 software differences in removal efficiencies for each pollutant were analyzed using t tests and correlations were determined using pearson correlation coefficients differences and correlations were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 principal component analysis pca was performed using canoco 5 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhancement patterns of nitrogen removal of ivcw by carbon source addition the average effluent concentrations of cod in the first column of the ivcw n1 and c1 were 14 95 6 48 mg l and 9 11 4 76 mg l the resulting average removal efficiencies of 97 38 and 98 40 respectively were recorded with no significant differences p 0 05 table 1 the high removal efficiency of cod in the first column was attributed to the fact that n1 and c1 were unsaturated which reportedly exhibit high biodegradation of organic matter 22 for the second column the effluent cod concentration of n2 was 8 82 5 13 mg l due to the addition of a carbon source the influent cod concentration of c2 increased to 74 63 mg l with the effluent of only 13 33 5 58 mg l which was not significantly different from that in n2 p 0 05 table 1 the similarity showed that the addition of the carbon source did not influence the effluent cod concentration thus the slight increase of the effluent cod caused by the imbalance between carbon source release rate and utilization rate did not show any influence on the performance of ivcw c 20 in addition the cod release rate of the carbon source in c2 was 159 27 mg d while the cod removal rate in c2 was 146 59 mg d with a utilization rate that reached 92 04 therefore the cod released from the reed based carbon sources was almost completely degraded or utilized showing high bioavailability the average concentrations of tn recorded in the effluents of n1 and c1 were 16 62 2 97 mg l and 18 03 2 71 mg l resulting in the average removal efficiencies of 48 19 and 43 80 respectively p 0 05 table 1 table 1 also shows that nh4 n and no3 n in the ivcw influent accounted for 61 71 and 37 72 of tn respectively conversely no2 n concentrations in the influent and effluent were low with little variation moreover the concentrations of nh4 n in n1 and c1 were reduced to 0 49 0 34 mg l and 1 22 0 54 mg l in the effluent while the no3 n concentrations were increased to 14 65 1 88 mg l n1 and 14 93 1 61 mg l c1 respectively table 1 this finding indicated that the unsaturated operation of the first columns of the ivcw was highly conducive for nitrification processes and that tn removal in the wetland was also mainly driven by nitrification 22 in addition the increase in no3 n concentrations were lower than the removal of nh4 n in the first columns while ammonia nitrogen volatilization was negligible ph 6 47 and plant uptake was limited therefore simultaneous nitrification and denitrification processes likely occurred in the first column 23 the denitrification process in the first columns primarily used glucose as the carbon source and the reaction equation was 2 8no3 c6h12o6 0 5nh4 2 3h 0 5c5h7no2 1 4 n2 3 5co2 6 4h2o 24 in this process the stoichiometric ratio of nh4 n no3 n and c6h12o6 was 0 5 2 8 1 and the ratio of nh4 n to no3 n was 1 1 so the ratio of n to c6h12o6 was 3 3 1 and the cod consumption was 4 156 gcod gn thus the cod used for denitrification in c1 and n1 was 71 95 mg l and 67 71 mg l respectively accounting for only 12 95 and 12 06 of the cod degradation at this stage table 2 therefore the high cod concentration in the influent provided sufficient electron donors for denitrification but the efficient degradation of cod also led to a scarcity of carbon sources in the second columns of the ivcw n2 and c2 however the effluent tn concentration of c2 2 03 1 72 mg l was remarkably lower than that of n2 15 04 2 07 mg l consequently the tn removal efficiency was also significantly improved from 53 13 to 93 66 due to the addition of the plant based carbon source the influent tn concentration of c2 increased to 20 31 mg l and thus the cod n also increased from 0 9 in n2 to 3 67 this cod n was conducive for efficient denitrification reactions to occur in c ivcw in addition the effluent no3 n concentration in c2 0 55 0 61 mg l was also notably lower than that of n2 14 27 1 86 mg l p 0 05 therefore the enhancement of cod n by the carbon source and distribution of nitrogen removal microbial communities in the second column of the ivcw might be the reasons for the differences in nitrogen removal 19 previous studies have also shown that plant based carbon sources could provide sufficient electron donors for denitrification processes it could also provide carbon materials for microbial cells to improve denitrification microbial activity 13 25 furthermore the saturated operating conditions of the second column facilitated the amx process 26 the stoichiometric ratio of nh4 n to no3 n in amx was 1 1 06 5 so the nitrogen removed by amx and denitrification were 0 18 mg l and 0 16 mg l for 0 34 mg l of n2 accounting for 52 53 and 47 77 of the nitrogen removal respectively for c2 the nitrogen removed by amx and denitrification were 1 73 mg l and 14 11 mg l accounting for 10 90 and 89 10 of the nitrogen removal respectively table 2 overall the nitrogen removal by amx and denitrification processes increased in the wetland with carbon addition but the proportion of nitrogen removal by the denitrification process increased more significantly the effluent tp concentrations of n ivcw and c ivcw were 2 71 0 33 mg l and 2 22 0 47 mg l respectively the removal efficiencies of tp in c ivcw were higher than that in n ivcw 30 19 vs 19 58 due to the increase in phosphorus adsorption and complexation sites by the plant based carbon source 27 3 2 utilization characteristics of plant based carbon source in ivcw after the plant based carbon source addition and utilization in c ivcw the surface structure became looser with more pronounced irregular pores fig s1 these changes indicated that the biodegradable components of the plant based carbon source had been fully utilized additionally the fourier transform infrared spectrum of the carbon source before and after addition to the ivcw fig 2 showed a broad absorption band at 3420 14 cm 1 which is associated with intermolecular hydrogen bonds in carboxyl and alcohol groups oh 28 another at 2917 77 cm 1 shows the stretching vibration peak of saturated hydrocarbon ch corresponding to organic compounds such as hydrocarbons and lipids 29 furthermore an absorption band at 1734 17 cm 1 showed co stretching vibrational peaks mostly for carbonyl compounds and esters etc moreover the absorption peaks at 3420 14 cm 1 2917 77 cm 1 and 1734 17 cm 1 were significantly lower after application in c ivcw the lower peaks suggested that simple compounds released from the plant based carbon source might be used by heterotrophic bacterial genera such as denitrifying bacteria additionally hydroxyl and carboxyl groups could also act as binding sites for dissolved organic carbon and other pollutants within the c ivcw furthermore they could form complexes with pollutants through electrostatic adsorption complexation and ion exchange thereby facilitating the migration and removal of pollutants 30 however material peaks such as the bending vibration peak at 1462 26 cm 1 representing ch of alkanes the stretching vibration peaks at 1248 20 cm 1 and 1050 53 cm 1 representing co hemicellulose and the out of plane bending peak at 614 22 cm 1 of oh in the plant based carbon source were largely undiminished after application three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy 3deem of c ivcw before and after the carbon source addition a b and along column c2 b d are shown in fig 3 after the addition of the plant based carbon source the intensity of dissolved microbial metabolic by products ex 250 nm em 380 nm humic acid like substances ex 250 nm em 380 nm 31 and fulvic acid like substances ex 250 nm em 380 nm were significantly enhanced fig 3 the plant based carbon source with a high organic matter content provided significant amounts of protein for enzymatic decomposition resulting in higher amounts of protein like fluorescent substances moreover the decay of plant residues produced humic like substances ex em 250 300 400 460 nm the latter possibly associated with carbonyl and hydroxyl groups 32 in addition tryptophan like substances peaks were also present in the influent of column c2 ex em 275 340 nm fig 3 which were associated with carboxyl functional groups in the plant based carbon source 31 additionally the fluorescence peaks of tryptophan like substances and fulvic acid like substances decreased first along column c2 followed by the fluorescence peaks of humic acid like substances fig 3 this decrease indicated tryptophan like substances were bioavailable organic matter and could be preferentially utilized as the main nutrient source for denitrifying microorganisms 32 the more complex the structure of organic matter the higher the cod consumption for denitrification about 3 705 gcod gn 4 203 gcod gn 3 744 gcod gn and 5 272 gcod gn is required for denitrification using methanol ethanol acetic acid and typical organic matter as carbon sources respectively 24 the cod consumption in the lower and upper regions of c2 was approximately 3 152 gcod gn and 6 721 gcod gn respectively these consumption rates also indicated that the carbon sources first utilized by heterotrophic microorganisms in c2 were relatively simple compounds low molecular weight tryptophan like substances and fulvic acid like substances followed by more complex organic substances humic acid like substances this phenomenon in c2 was also consistent with the decrease in the oh intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups as well as the decrease in the co absorption peaks in the carbonyl and ester compounds moreover the hix index of dom in c2 increased slightly 0 65 vs 0 79 after the addition of the plant based carbon source subsequently it increased significantly along the ivcw 0 79 1 94 2 62 indicating that the plant based carbon source could release some macromolecular aromatic substances however the preferential utilization of simple and easily degradable organic matter by wetland microorganisms led to higher carbon to hydrogen ratios of doc in the ivcw 3 3 effect of plant based carbon source on microbial distribution in ivcw microbial nitrogen removal is the main pathway of nitrogen removal in cw high throughput analysis of microbial samples from the ivcw was conducted to further elucidate the mechanism of nitrogen removal enhancement by the plant based carbon source the coverage values for all microbial samples were close to 100 demonstrating that the likelihood of undetected sequences in the samples was extremely low the number of otus as well as the abundance and diversity of microbial communities in the second columns of the ivcw was significantly higher than in the first columns table s1 this difference indicated that the saturated operating conditions in the second columns were more conducive for the growth of microorganisms attached to the substrate filler 33 in addition the richness estimators ace and chao1 and diversity indexes simpson and shannon for c2 were superior to n2 the difference showed that the application of the plant based carbon source could promote microbial abundance and diversity in the second column resulting in higher microbial metabolic activity 34 pca analysis based on otu levels also revealed that the microbial communities of n1 and c1 clustered in the same quadrant therefore n1 and c1 had similar internal environments and microbial communities nevertheless differences in the internal environment of the first and second columns of the ivcw also led to differences in the internal microbial composition thus there were significant differences in the microbial community compositions of n2 and c2 due to the addition of the plant based carbon source fig s2 the composition of microorganisms in both ivcws at phylum and genus levels is shown in fig 4 the main dominant phyla in both n ivcw and c ivcw were proteobacteria 44 33 58 48 acidobacteria 4 14 8 87 and bacteroidetes 4 04 10 15 fig 4a these phyla play an important role in the degradation of pollutants 26 among them the absolute dominance of proteobacteria ensured the removal efficiency of organic matter and nitrogen in the ivcw 35 by contrast acidobacteria plays a significant role in the degradation of plant residues whereas bacteroidetes degraded substances such as proteins and cellulose therefore the presence of these two phyla facilitated the decomposition and utilization of the plant based carbon source in addition the relative abundance of firmicutes 2 06 vs 10 87 actinobacteria 2 31 vs 10 10 planctomycetes 1 17 vs 3 87 and chloroflexi 0 87 vs 3 46 in c2 were significantly higher than n2 fig 4a therefore the addition of the plant based carbon source demonstrably markedly influenced the composition of the microbial phyla in the ivcw 36 also firmicutes actinobacteria planctomycetes and chloroflexi were the dominant groups in c ivcw among them actinobacteria mainly contributes to the decomposition of organic matter in an anaerobic environment and plays an important role in the anaerobic biodegradation of pollutants 21 firmicutes and chloroflexi facilitate the carbon and nitrogen cycling processes as well as denitrification in wetlands 36 37 planctomycetes could promote synergistic denitrification with amx processes under a suitable organic carbon source 38 the relative abundance of planctomycetes in c2 was significantly higher than that of n2 which demonstrated that the plant based carbon source could promote synergistic effects of multiple denitrification pathways in ivcw the dominant bacterial genera in both n ivcw and c ivcw were unclassified xanthomonadaceae unclassified betaproteobacteria and unclassified gammaproteobacteria however the unclassified xanthomonadaceae had a higher relative abundance in the first columns 22 03 28 67 than in the second columns 10 16 1 17 conversely unclassified betaproteobacteria and unclassified gammaproteobacteria showed the opposite the relative abundance of the second columns 9 37 12 05 and 4 03 8 32 was higher than in the first columns 4 17 4 36 and 1 38 0 75 fig 4b unclassified xanthomonadaceae are potential aobs that could participate in nh4 n oxidation or autotrophic nitrification 39 so the better oxygenated conditions in the first columns were more conducive for the transformation of ammonia moreover unclassified betaproteobacteria and unclassified gammaproteobacteria could participate in the degradation of organic matter and denitrification 35 the anaerobic conditions of the second columns were more conducive to the growth of these genera moreover the relative abundance of unclassified xanthomonadaceae was lower in c2 than n2 whereas the relative abundance of unclassified betaproteobacteria and unclassified gammaproteobacteria was higher in c2 than n2 fig 4b this difference indicated that increasing the amount of carbon source promoted the enrichment of organic matter degrading genera also it provided the electron donor required for the denitrification process furthermore the consumption of dissolved oxygen by the organic matter degradation process further promoted the enrichment of denitrifying genera the denitrifying genera with high relative abundance in both ivcws included clostridium sensu stricto unclassified planctomycetaceae bacillus and unclassified rhizobiales 18 36 the relative abundance of these genera in c2 was 25 98 3 72 27 04 and 3 43 times higher than that of n2 respectively fig s3 these differences further indicated the contribution of the plant based carbon source to the enrichment of denitrifying functional genera clostridium sensu stricto is also a phosphorus accumulating bacterium which enhanced phosphorus removal in c ivcw 59 83 vs 51 09 3 4 role of plant based carbon source in ivcw denitrification enhancement the mechanism of nitrogen removal enhancement by the plant based carbon source in ivcw is illustrated in fig 5 the first columns of the ivcw were operated with unsaturated water flow which not only exhibited better nitrification 94 and simultaneous denitrification ability but also achieved efficient removal of organic matter 97 nonetheless this condition also caused the problem of insufficient carbon sources for denitrification in the second column however the addition of the plant based carbon source increased the cod n in c2 from 0 90 to 3 67 also the plant based carbon source released tryptophan like substances and fulvic acid like substances with low molecular weights that had higher bioavailability therefore at a cod release rate of 159 27 mg d from the plant based carbon source the utilization rate reached 92 04 providing sufficient electron donors for the denitrification process nonetheless with the utilization and degradation of readily biodegradable organic matter the proportion of relatively high molecular weight humic acid like substances released from the plant based carbon source gradually increased consequently the carbon to hydrogen ratio and hix index of organic matter in the ivcw gradually increased also the degradation process of organic matter caused a decrease in do within the ivcw from 7 57 mg l to 0 55 mg l and an increase in ph from 4 15 to 6 06 the effective release of organic matter by the plant based carbon source and the changes in environmental conditions caused by the degradation process provided favorable conditions for the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria fig 4b the correlation between the relative abundance of functional genera and no3 n removal r 0 909 such as clostridium sensu stricto bacillus and dechloromonas was also significantly higher from 17 85 to 24 12 due to the carbon source addition carbon source addition and enrichment of denitrifying functional genera ultimately resulted in an increase in the nitrogen removal by denitrification processes in c2 from 0 16 mg l to 14 11 mg l furthermore the anoxic and c n conditions in the second column also led to an increase in the relative abundance of unclassified planctomycetaceae from 0 85 to 3 17 the unclassified planctomycetaceae showed a positive correlation with the removal of nh4 n no3 n no2 n this finding indicated that it could drive both denitrification and amx therefore the nitrogen removal by the amx pathway in c2 also increased from 0 18 mg l to 1 73 mg l overall the addition of the plant based carbon source could improve the contribution of denitrification and amx pathways to nitrogen removal in the second column however the contribution of denitrification to total nitrogen removal was more significant 89 10 therefore carbon source addition enhanced tn removal in the ivcw up to 93 66 mainly via the denitrification pathway 4 conclusions the removal efficiencies of cod and nh4 n in ivcw reached circa 98 0 the plant based carbon source enhanced removal rates of no3 n and tn up to 95 5 and 93 7 respectively the plant based carbon source release organic matter mainly composed of tryptophan like fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances the tryptophan like substances closely related to carboxyl functional groups were demonstrated to be easily used preferentially by microorganisms the plant based carbon source also demonstrably promoted the enrichment of denitrification functional microbial genera significantly as well as others involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling consequently total nitrogen tn removal increased notably from 47 77 to 89 10 primarily driven by a significant increase in denitrification from 0 16 mg l to 14 11 mg l the tn removal was further enhanced by a considerable increase in anaerobic ammonia oxidation from 0 18 mg l to 1 73 mg l therefore plant based carbon source addition could enhance nitrogen removal through primarily denitrification 89 10 as well as amx 10 90 pathways credit authorship contribution statement

13049,hollow fibre membrane contactors hfmc have emerged as a promising technology for nitrogen recovery that can be implemented in wastewater treatment plants wwtps to promote circular economy in this process a hydrophobic membrane allows the transference of free ammonia across the hollow fibres during its operation the ammonium concentration decreases and real time measurements would be of great value for process monitoring optimization and control ammonium probes exist but they are expensive and present noticeably maintenance costs in this work results from eight n recovery experiments performed at different ph values using real supernatant of a full scale anaerobic digester were analysed in terms of the time evolution profiles of ph and total ammonium nitrogen tan the ph revealed to carry relevant information related to the tan concentration as it decreased in the feed solution due to free ammonia stripping the ph is an inexpensive to measure process variable that can be routinely acquired in any wwtp therefore a data driven soft sensor has been developed it uses the ph its derivative and the ph increments after each reagent dosing as input signals to estimate the tan concentration via pls an extended pls model incorporating interaction terms quadratic and cubic forms of the three input variables improved the tan concentration estimation the developed soft sensor was able to accurately reproduce the evolution of tan concentration in the range 0 1000 mgnh4 n l with r2 0 97 and rmse 40 mg l during the hfmc process operation thus making it possible to monitor the process as well as enabling future development of different control and optimization strategies graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nitrogen recovery hollow fibre membrane contactor pls soft sensor 1 introduction the nitrogen present in wastewater has been traditionally considered a major pollutant which can cause different impacts to the receiving aquatic ecosystem such as toxicity oxygen depletion and eutrophication however currently with the paradigm shift towards the circular economy in the wastewater sector nitrogen has begun to be considered a valuable resource that it is worth recovering this nutrient is essential for many agricultural crops and for this reason it is a key element in many commercial fertilizers despite nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere its conversion into ammonium through the haber bosch process is very energy demanding moreover this process releases a significant amount of greenhouse gases and in terms of global warming potential the production of one year of ammonium can be considered equivalent to nearly 80 000 000 people 1 in order to recover nutrients from wastewater several technologies have been developed in the last decades among them the struvite crystallization has been widely studied at different process scales and even implemented in many full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps thus turning them into water resource recovery facilities wrrfs however in this process the nitrogen recovery efficiency is limited due to the composition of the struvite note its equimolar stoichiometry mgnh4po4 6h2o robles et al 2 have reported recovery efficiencies ranging from 80 to 90 of the po4 3 present in the reject water from anaerobic digestion but only from 20 to 30 of the nh4 another technology with wide implementation at different process scales is air stripping in this process free ammonia is transferred from the waste stream i e the aqueous phase to a gas phase which is later circulated through an air cleaner where in the liquid phase usually sulphuric acid different processes mass transfer and absorption occur resulting in the formation of a solution of ammonium sulphate nh4 2so4 ams ams is an inorganic salt rich in macronutrients nitrogen and sulphur n and s which can act as substitute of traditional fertilizers chemically based produced from fossil resources the operation of air stripping units leads to high energy and chemical requirements as a result of the scaling and fouling problems that frequently occur within the packing material of the towers that are used in this technology 3 membrane based technologies have also been successfully used for nutrient recovery among them the hollow fibre membrane contactor hfmc has emerged as one of the most promising membrane technologies that is being explored for the recovery of nitrogen n in this process hydrophobic membranes are used to enable the transference of gaseous species such as free ammonia across the hollow fibres free ammonia is transferred from a n rich feed solution usually circulating by the lumen to an acid solution usually sulphuric acid pumped inside the hollow fibres the difference between free ammonia concentrations at both sides of the membranes is the driving force of the stripping process the ph in the n rich solution should be high enough to assure that free ammonia predominates see fig 1 the higher the ph the higher the percentage of ammonium nitrogen present as free ammonia and therefore the higher the n recovery rate temperature also affects the chemical equilibrium between ammonium and free ammonia fig 1 shows the percentage of ammonium nitrogen which is in the form of free ammonia at different ph and temperatures when free ammonia passes across the membrane it is transformed into ammonium consuming protons from the acid solution when the acid solution is exhausted the ph suddenly increases and should be replaced during the recovery process the ph of the feed solution decreases due to free ammonia stripping the ph drop will be more or less pronounced depending on the ammonium alkalinity ratio of the feed solution i e the n rich solution the alkalinity is due to the presence of ions mainly carbonates and bicarbonates that incorporate acid protons recall that the ph is the concentration of these acid protons into their molecules so that they are not available as a free acid that can lower the ph therefore the higher alkalinity i e lower ammonium alkalinity ratio the lower the ph variations when the ph drops below 8 5 the recovery process rate is greatly reduced therefore ph should be maintained over this value by adding chemical reagents usually naoh alkalinity of the feed solution also affects the economics of the hfmc process since it determines the amount of naoh that is needed to raise the ph to assure a high percentage of ammonium nitrogen present as free ammonia thus enabling high n recovery rates due to the addition of naoh required to keep high the percentage of nitrogen as free ammonia in the feed solution hfmcs are only applied for nitrogen rich streams such as the ones mentioned below diluted streams should be pre treated by means of zeolites exchange ion columns or electrodialysis prior to be fed to the hfmc however the economics of the process not only depends on the nitrogen content of feed solution but also on its alkalinity since alkalinity of the feed solution dampen the ph variations the higher the alkalinity the higher operational costs of the process in the case of the anaerobic digestion supernatant an economic and environmental study estimating costs and benefits of the hfmc technology implementation in full scale wwtps is presented in noriega hevia et al 4 the main advantages of hfmc technology are it is selective to free ammonia recovery its energy consumption is lower than other technologies such as air stripping and it is appropriate for recovery of ammonium nitrogen to really low concentration 5 high nitrogen recovery efficiencies between 80 and 99 have been obtained applying this technology to different streams such as chicken manure 6 reject water from anaerobic digestion 7 8 pig manure 9 or urine 10 although these studies were carried out at laboratory or pilot scale recently this technology has been implemented at the full scale munster wwtp 11 with recovery efficiencies close to those obtained at laboratory or pilot scale the acid solution usually sulphuric acid that circulates inside the membrane fibres reacts with free ammonia to form ams which is a marketable fertilizer it should be highlighted that recovering nitrogen from the reject water in wwtps produces several benefits such as the economic value of the produced ams the reduction in the energy consumption related to aeration system and the lower nox and n2o emissions as consequence of the lower n load entering the biological treatment aeration is the most energy demanding process in a wwtp and the nitrification process contributes to this consumption requiring over 5 kwh kg n hfmcs are usually operated in batch mode the nitrogen rich solution is pumped from a storage tank circulates by the lumen of the membrane module and is recycled to the storage tank when tan concentration of the feed solution decreases below the desired level the process should be stopped and the storage tank is emptied and filled again with nitrogen rich solution thus for monitoring optimization and process control purposes it would be of great importance to know the tan concentration in real time in the storage tank ammonium concentration is usually measured in wwtps and wrrfs by colorimeter procedures kits based on the nessler or salicylate methods or ion selective electrodes colorimeter procedures and kits are usually used for its determination in grab samples but there are not useful to provide continuous values of ammonium concentration although the ion selective electrodes for ammonium measurements can provide on line continuous data they present several drawbacks these electrodes are strongly affected by potassium and sodium ions the range of ammonium to be spanned in hfmcs is extremely wide and cannot be covered with the same electrode and the price and their maintenance costs are high 12 therefore for hfmc process monitoring optimization and control it would be extremely useful to be able to estimate the tan concentration in the feed tank during the experimentation indirectly the ph is an inexpensive easy to measure process variable that can be routinely acquired which is extremely relevant for the hfmc process operation since it decreases as nitrogen is being recovered a soft sensor is a computer software that maps the values from the input variables usually secondary variables i e process variables like conductivity ph temperature redox etc that are relatively cheap and easy to measure to predict the output variable s usually primary variables like nutrients and organic matter in the wastewater context note that primary variables mainly nutrient and organic concentration are traditionally measured in the laboratory thus are characterized by time delayed responses for example it takes 5 days to know the value of the bod5 concentration of a wastewater sample in the case of the cod concentration the required analytical procedure in laboratory makes that its value takes about 2 and a half hours to be known the sensors and analysers developed to on line measure primary variables are often associated with high capital

predict struvite purity 16 the harsh conditions in wwtps and wrrfs make reliable field measurements challenging thus proper instrumentation maintenance is of paramount importance for process monitoring and control of these facilities note that the quality of the measurements of the input sensors determines the reliability of any soft sensor as well as its accuracy according to ching et al 13 since 2000s the main methodology that has been used by researches for soft sensor development is based on the application of artificial neural networks anns however as these authors state in recent years new approaches based on the use of machine learning algorithms have appeared exhibiting high performance and the projection statistical methods that are well suited for handling multicollinearity and noise typical challenges in wwtp datasets being both relevant options to be used for soft sensor developtment since the ph of the feed solution decreases during the n recovery process in hfmcs due to the stripping of the free ammonia and increases when sodium hydroxide naoh is added to boost the amount of nitrogen present as free ammonia it is hypothesized that the tan

data to a personal computer pc for visualization and data storage a control software was developed and deployed to control the ph during the progress of each experiment whenever the ph dropped below the established set point 2 ml of naoh 1 mol l were dosed by the liquino dosino device this device whenever received the order from the computer to dose naoh perform the action until the ph was above the set point since the experiments were carried out in the laboratory and their duration did not exceed 1 h temperature variations along the experiments were negligible the nitrogen rich feed solution supernatant of a full scale anaerobic digester was boosted through the shell side of the contactors to minimize the risk of fouling due to the larger flow cross section available relative to the inside flow cross section which is much smaller inside the membrane fibre 5 the acid solution h2so4 0 1 mol l was boosted in counter current through the lumen side each fluid was recycled to its respective tank see fig 2 a flowrate ratio of 1 3 between the h2so4 solution and the n rich solution was maintained according to the recommendations of the membrane manufacturers to avoid membrane deformation and maintain its morphology 2 2 analytical methods to chemically characterize the supernatant of the full scale anaerobic digester several parameters were determined in the laboratory

analysed using a photometer smartchen 450 from ams alliance the concentration of volatile fatty acids and alkalinity were determined by titration using the methodology developed by moosbrugger et al 18 2 3 feed solution real supernatant from the anaerobic digester of a full scale wwtp from valencia spain with an average concentration of 800 mg nh4 n l was used as n rich solution in this research this supernatant was pre treated prior to being feed to the hfmcs a three stages pre treatment was performed which included ph adjustment followed by settling and finally filtration initially naoh 1 mol l was dosed to increase the ph up to the desired value between 9 and 11 at this high ph value precipitates formed like calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate which could clog the membranes in order to minimize the possible clogging of the membranes the digester supernatant was settled for 8 min and the supernatant from the settling was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter pore size prior to being feed to the hfmc the characterization of the real supernatant as obtained from the full scale anaerobic digester i e prior to the pre treatment applied in this research work and after the pre treatment feed solution is shown in table 1 2 4 experiments eight experiments were performed in laboratory at 25 c at a feed flow rate of 2 5 10 5 m3 s varying the ph between 9 and 11 2 5 statistical analysis the main objective of this work is to develop a data driven soft sensor solution based on pls to extract primary information on the ammonium concentration evolution in the hfmc which would be especially useful for process monitoring optimization and control of this process the pls will extract relevant information from the ph data which is an easy to measure process variable that can be routinely acquired and it is available in almost every wwtp pls is a multivariate statistical technique that connects two data matrices x which contain the predictors and y which contain the responses or variables to be predicted capturing simultaneously the correlation structure among all the variables latent variables are extracted through linear combination of the original variables trying to capture the underlying phenomenon that drives the process that is being studied pls aims at finding latent variables that explain as much variance in x as possible but focusing on that part of the variance in x that allows better forecasting of the variables in matrix y fitting and prediction with the pls technique were performed using the software simca p 10 0 umetrics sweden 3 results and discussion 3 1 feature engineering temperature and ph were the only two variables continuously recorded one value each 20 s in both tanks of the experimental set up the tank that contained the feed solution and the tank that contained the acid solution since the experimental set up was in the laboratory and the experiments were short the temperature along the different experiments relatively constant at 25 c with minimal variation thus no other information than that to check that the process was operated at the pre set temperature could be obtained however the ph value in the tank that stored the feed solution varied significantly during each experiment fig 3 shows the time evolution of the ph as well as the tan concentration in a previous experiment carried out without ph control as can be seen in this figure the ph drops from 9 to 8 1 along the duration of the experiment 30 min while the tan concentration decreased from 350 to 223 mg nh4 n l nitrogen recovery rate significantly decreased during the experiment due to the ph decrease almost 50 of the nitrogen recovered was achieved in the first 5 min ph 8 8 and 90 of the nitrogen recovered was achieved in the first half of the experiment ph 8 5 when the ph dropped below 8 5 the nitrogen recovery rate was almost negligible as commented in the introduction section the higher the ph in the feed solution tank the higher the rate of nitrogen recovery due to the higher the percentage of ammonium nitrogen is in the form of free ammonia thus a ph control system was implemented to keep the ph in the n rich solution tank i e feed tank close to the desired level fig 4 shows the ph evolution pattern observed along an experiment carried out with ph control together with the tan concentration at relevant time instants as can be seen in this figure the ph decreased linearly along the whole experiment but when the ph dropped until a value of 10 it was raised by naoh dosing it should be highlighted that with the same amount of naoh dosed the increment achieved in the ph of the feed solution was higher as the tan concentration was lower another interesting fact that could be observed in the ph profile along the experiment was that its derivative i e its slope in absolute value between every two dosages was smoother lower as the tan concentration was lower the ph slope depends on nitrogen recovery rate which in turns depends on free ammonia concentration in the feed solution therefore taking into account the underlying scientific principles and the technical knowledge of the process it became evident that in addition to the variable ph itself other variables such as the ph derivative and the ph increment after each naoh dosing could carry relevant information for prediction of tan concentration thus they were included as inputs to develop the soft sensor based on projection to latent structures model the fully specified architecture of the proposed soft sensor is shown in fig 5 fig 6 shows the time evolution of the ph and the tan concentration along five experiments throughout which the tan concentration in the feed solution was reduced from more than 950 mg nh4 n l to less than 100 mg nh4 n l these data will be used to fit the pls based soft sensor to develop the ammonium soft sensor 75 of the data i e 6 experiments were used for model fitting and the remaining 25 i e 2 experiments for testing its performance according to cross validation only two components resulted statistically significant the models were well balanced exhibiting in fit performance as well as in the prediction of the tan concentration performance values higher than 90 fig 7 shows the measured tan concentration versus the estimation by the pls model as can be seen in this figure although an overall reasonable fit is achieved the tan concentration is systematically underestimated for values higher than 600 mg nh4 n l while in the lower range values lower than 300 mg nh4 n l the tan concentration is systematically overestimated the loading plot in fig 8a provides a graphical summary of the correlation between all the variables x and y in this plot highly correlated variables are plotted together in the same quadrant when the correlation is positive and diagonally opposed quadrants when the correlation is negative thus fig 8 a evidences that two variables the slope of the ph slp and the ph increment after each naoh dosing δph are highly correlated and that these variables are inversely correlated with the output variable the tan concentration nh4 variable importance in the projection vip plot is also included in fig 8b to show the most important variables over the pls model as a whole the vip parameter is a weighted summary of the loadings of all input variables across all the responses therefore the higher the importance of given variable in a fitted pls model the higher its vip value it is interesting to point out that the extracted features from the ph resulted significantly more relevant than ph itself for the prediction of the ammonia concentration in order to improve the pls model performance model complexity was increased by incorporating as input variables the interaction terms as well as the quadratic and cubic forms of the three input variables shown in fig 5 as a result the new pls model had 12 input variables fig 9 shows the measured tan concentration versus the predicted concentration by the extended pls model as can be seen in this figure accurate predictions were possible in the entire range of values from 0 to 980 mg nh4 n l with this model therefore this demonstrates that is possible to predict the tan concentration evolution in a hollow fibre membrane contactor for nitrogen recovery extracting primary information from the ph which is an easy to measure process variable the predictions exhibit enough accuracy rmse 37 67 to make decisions and actions on the process such as determining whether the desired nitrogen recovery level has been achieved thus the proposed data driven solution based on pls unlocks a new dynamic approach in the hfmc process for process control and optimization the loading plot shown in fig 10a provides a graphical summary of the correlation between all the variables of the pls extended model as can be seen in this figure the correlation structure among the main variables is the same as before the cubic terms are in the opposite quadrant to the other expanded terms interactions and quadratic forms to know and visualize the importance of each input variable in the extended data driven model the variable over the projection is shown in fig 10b again the extracted features from the ph resulted significantly more relevant than ph itself thus highlighting the importance of the feature engineering process to develop useful artificial intelligence solutions it should be highlighted that the developed soft sensor only uses the ph the extracted features from the ph and their interaction and exponential forms as input variables thus offering an inexpensive opportunity to extract primary information on the tan concentration the soft sensor works very well because during the nitrogen recovery process the ph of the feed solution decreases due to free ammonia stripping and increases when caustic soda is added to boost the amount of nitrogen present in the feed solution as free ammonia to enhance the nitrogen recovery rate the ph measurement carries information in its own value in its slope and in the variations it shows when naoh is added to raise its value this close and causal relationship between both variables allows to obtain these nice results the estimation of the tan concentration that can be carried out with the soft sensor presented in this study could be very useful for implementing this technology at full scale wwtps one of the main bottlenecks for hfmc process optimization is the development of a control system for determining the end of each n recovery cycle the acid solution should be replaced when the ph raises over neutrality and the feed solution should be replaced when nitrogen concentration reaches the desired value considering the drawbacks of on line ammonium sensors commented in the introduction section the soft sensor based on ph measurements could provide valuable information for control system development since during the recovery process there are also variations in the concentration of the ions present in the feed solution the conductivity which is another inexpensive process variable could also offer information related to the tan concentration and thus if this process variable is available it could be then tested as input variable of a soft sensor 4 conclusions in this work a data driven soft sensor solution based on pls has been proposed to extract primary information on the tan concentration evolution in the hfmc from the ph time evolution profile the main conclusions that can be drawn from this study are the hfmc process allows high n recovery efficiencies treating the supernatant of anaerobic digesters of municipal wwtps the ph is an inexpensive and easy to measure process variable that carries relevant information on tan concentration in the feed tank the developed pls based soft sensor is able to predict with high accuracy the tan concentration evolution in hollow fibre membrane contactors for nitrogen recovery this soft sensor uses the ph and extracted features its derivative and increments as input variables offering an inexpensive opportunity to extract primary information on the tan concentration the ph derivative and the ph increment after each reagent dosing were more relevant for tan concentration prediction than the ph value itself feature extraction based on technical knowledge of the process was key to make the development of a reliable data driven pls soft sensor possible this study highlighted the potential of the developed data driven soft sensor solution based on pls to unlock a new dynamic approach in optimization and control of the hfmc process as well as decision making in troubleshooting declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

13049,hollow fibre membrane contactors hfmc have emerged as a promising technology for nitrogen recovery that can be implemented in wastewater treatment plants wwtps to promote circular economy in this process a hydrophobic membrane allows the transference of free ammonia across the hollow fibres during its operation the ammonium concentration decreases and real time measurements would be of great value for process monitoring optimization and control ammonium probes exist but they are expensive and present noticeably maintenance costs in this work results from eight n recovery experiments performed at different ph values using real supernatant of a full scale anaerobic digester were analysed in terms of the time evolution profiles of ph and total ammonium nitrogen tan the ph revealed to carry relevant information related to the tan concentration as it decreased in the feed solution due to free ammonia stripping the ph is an inexpensive to measure process variable that can be routinely acquired in any wwtp therefore a data driven soft sensor has been developed it uses the ph its derivative and the ph increments after each reagent dosing as input signals to estimate the tan concentration via pls an extended pls model incorporating interaction terms quadratic and cubic forms of the three input variables improved the tan concentration estimation the developed soft sensor was able to accurately reproduce the evolution of tan concentration in the range 0 1000 mgnh4 n l with r2 0 97 and rmse 40 mg l during the hfmc process operation thus making it possible to monitor the process as well as enabling future development of different control and optimization strategies graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nitrogen recovery hollow fibre membrane contactor pls soft sensor 1 introduction the nitrogen present in wastewater has been traditionally considered a major pollutant which can cause different impacts to the receiving aquatic ecosystem such as toxicity oxygen depletion and eutrophication however currently with the paradigm shift towards the circular economy in the wastewater sector nitrogen has begun to be considered a valuable resource that it is worth recovering this nutrient is essential for many agricultural crops and for this reason it is a key element in many commercial fertilizers despite nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere its conversion into ammonium through the haber bosch process is very energy demanding moreover this process releases a significant amount of greenhouse gases and in terms of global warming potential the production of one year of ammonium can be considered equivalent to nearly 80 000 000 people 1 in order to recover nutrients from wastewater several technologies have been developed in the last decades among them the struvite crystallization has been widely studied at different process scales and even implemented in many full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps thus turning them into water resource recovery facilities wrrfs however in this process the nitrogen recovery efficiency is limited due to the composition of the struvite note its equimolar stoichiometry mgnh4po4 6h2o robles et al 2 have reported recovery efficiencies ranging from 80 to 90 of the po4 3 present in the reject water from anaerobic digestion but only from 20 to 30 of the nh4 another technology with wide implementation at different process scales is air stripping in this process free ammonia is transferred from the waste stream i e the aqueous phase to a gas phase which is later circulated through an air cleaner where in the liquid phase usually sulphuric acid different processes mass transfer and absorption occur resulting in the formation of a solution of ammonium sulphate nh4 2so4 ams ams is an inorganic salt rich in macronutrients nitrogen and sulphur n and s which can act as substitute of traditional fertilizers chemically based produced from fossil resources the operation of air stripping units leads to high energy and chemical requirements as a result of the scaling and fouling problems that frequently occur within the packing material of the towers that are used in this technology 3 membrane based technologies have also been successfully used for nutrient recovery among them the hollow fibre membrane contactor hfmc has emerged as one of the most promising membrane technologies that is being explored for the recovery of nitrogen n in this process hydrophobic membranes are used to enable the transference of gaseous species such as free ammonia across the hollow fibres free ammonia is transferred from a n rich feed solution usually circulating by the lumen to an acid solution usually sulphuric acid pumped inside the hollow fibres the difference between free ammonia concentrations at both sides of the membranes is the driving force of the stripping process the ph in the n rich solution should be high enough to assure that free ammonia predominates see fig 1 the higher the ph the higher the percentage of ammonium nitrogen present as free ammonia and therefore the higher the n recovery rate temperature also affects the chemical equilibrium between ammonium and free ammonia fig 1 shows the percentage of ammonium nitrogen which is in the form of free ammonia at different ph and temperatures when free ammonia passes across the membrane it is transformed into ammonium consuming protons from the acid solution when the acid solution is exhausted the ph suddenly increases and should be replaced during the recovery process the ph of the feed solution decreases due to free ammonia stripping the ph drop will be more or less pronounced depending on the ammonium alkalinity ratio of the feed solution i e the n rich solution the alkalinity is due to the presence of ions mainly carbonates and bicarbonates that incorporate acid protons recall that the ph is the concentration of these acid protons into their molecules so that they are not available as a free acid that can lower the ph therefore the higher alkalinity i e lower ammonium alkalinity ratio the lower the ph variations when the ph drops below 8 5 the recovery process rate is greatly reduced therefore ph should be maintained over this value by adding chemical reagents usually naoh alkalinity of the feed solution also affects the economics of the hfmc process since it determines the amount of naoh that is needed to raise the ph to assure a high percentage of ammonium nitrogen present as free ammonia thus enabling high n recovery rates due to the addition of naoh required to keep high the percentage of nitrogen as free ammonia in the feed solution hfmcs are only applied for nitrogen rich streams such as the ones mentioned below diluted streams should be pre treated by means of zeolites exchange ion columns or electrodialysis prior to be fed to the hfmc however the economics of the process not only depends on the nitrogen content of feed solution but also on its alkalinity since alkalinity of the feed solution dampen the ph variations the higher the alkalinity the higher operational costs of the process in the case of the anaerobic digestion supernatant an economic and environmental study estimating costs and benefits of the hfmc technology implementation in full scale wwtps is presented in noriega hevia et al 4 the main advantages of hfmc technology are it is selective to free ammonia recovery its energy consumption is lower than other technologies such as air stripping and it is appropriate for recovery of ammonium nitrogen to really low concentration 5 high nitrogen recovery efficiencies between 80 and 99 have been obtained applying this technology to different streams such as chicken manure 6 reject water from anaerobic digestion 7 8 pig manure 9 or urine 10 although these studies were carried out at laboratory or pilot scale recently this technology has been implemented at the full scale munster wwtp 11 with recovery efficiencies close to those obtained at laboratory or pilot scale the acid solution usually sulphuric acid that circulates inside the membrane fibres reacts with free ammonia to form ams which is a marketable fertilizer it should be highlighted that recovering nitrogen from the reject water in wwtps produces several benefits such as the economic value of the produced ams the reduction in the energy consumption related to aeration system and the lower nox and n2o emissions as consequence of the lower n load entering the biological treatment aeration is the most energy demanding process in a wwtp and the nitrification process contributes to this consumption requiring over 5 kwh kg n hfmcs are usually operated in batch mode the nitrogen rich solution is pumped from a storage tank circulates by the lumen of the membrane module and is recycled to the storage tank when tan concentration of the feed solution decreases below the desired level the process should be stopped and the storage tank is emptied and filled again with nitrogen rich solution thus for monitoring optimization and process control purposes it would be of great importance to know the tan concentration in real time in the storage tank ammonium concentration is usually measured in wwtps and wrrfs by colorimeter procedures kits based on the nessler or salicylate methods or ion selective electrodes colorimeter procedures and kits are usually used for its determination in grab samples but there are not useful to provide continuous values of ammonium concentration although the ion selective electrodes for ammonium measurements can provide on line continuous data they present several drawbacks these electrodes are strongly affected by potassium and sodium ions the range of ammonium to be spanned in hfmcs is extremely wide and cannot be covered with the same electrode and the price and their maintenance costs are high 12 therefore for hfmc process monitoring optimization and control it would be extremely useful to be able to estimate the tan concentration in the feed tank during the experimentation indirectly the ph is an inexpensive easy to measure process variable that can be routinely acquired which is extremely relevant for the hfmc process operation since it decreases as nitrogen is being recovered a soft sensor is a computer software that maps the values from the input variables usually secondary variables i e process variables like conductivity ph temperature redox etc that are relatively cheap and easy to measure to predict the output variable s usually primary variables like nutrients and organic matter in the wastewater context note that primary variables mainly nutrient and organic concentration are traditionally measured in the laboratory thus are characterized by time delayed responses for example it takes 5 days to know the value of the bod5 concentration of a wastewater sample in the case of the cod concentration the required analytical procedure in laboratory makes that its value takes about 2 and a half hours to be known the sensors and analysers developed to on line measure primary variables are often associated with high capital

slp and the ph increment after each naoh dosing δph are highly correlated and that these variables are inversely correlated with the output variable the tan concentration nh4 variable importance in the projection vip plot is also included in fig 8b to show the most important variables over the pls model as a whole the vip parameter is a weighted summary of the loadings of all input variables across all the responses therefore the higher the importance of given variable in a fitted pls model the higher its vip value it is interesting to point out that the extracted features from the ph resulted significantly more relevant than ph itself for the prediction of the ammonia concentration in order to improve the pls model performance model complexity was increased by incorporating as input variables the interaction terms as well as the quadratic and cubic forms of the three input variables shown in fig 5 as a result the new pls model had 12 input variables fig 9 shows the measured tan concentration versus the predicted concentration by the extended pls model as can be seen in this figure accurate predictions were possible in the entire range of values from 0 to 980 mg nh4 n l with this model therefore this demonstrates that is possible to predict the tan concentration evolution in a hollow fibre membrane contactor for nitrogen recovery extracting primary information from the ph which is an easy to measure process variable the predictions exhibit enough accuracy rmse 37 67 to make decisions and actions on the process such as determining whether the desired nitrogen recovery level has been achieved thus the proposed data driven solution based on pls unlocks a new dynamic approach in the hfmc process for process control and optimization the loading plot shown in fig 10a provides a graphical summary of the correlation between all the variables of the pls extended model as can be seen in this figure the correlation structure among the main variables is the same as before the cubic terms are in the opposite quadrant to the other expanded terms interactions and quadratic forms to know and visualize the importance of each input variable in the extended data driven model the variable over the projection is shown in fig 10b again the extracted features from the ph resulted significantly more relevant than ph itself thus highlighting the importance of the feature engineering process to develop useful artificial intelligence solutions it should be highlighted that the developed soft sensor only uses the ph the extracted features from the ph and their interaction and exponential forms as input variables thus offering an inexpensive opportunity to extract primary information on the tan concentration the soft sensor works very well because during the nitrogen recovery process the ph of the feed solution decreases due to free ammonia stripping and increases when caustic soda is added to boost the amount of nitrogen present in the feed solution as free ammonia to enhance the nitrogen recovery rate the ph measurement carries information in its own value in its slope and in the variations it shows when naoh is added to raise its value this close and causal relationship between both variables allows to obtain these nice results the estimation of the tan concentration that can be carried out with the soft sensor presented in this study could be very useful for implementing this technology at full scale wwtps one of the main bottlenecks for hfmc process optimization is the development of a control system for determining the end of each n recovery cycle the acid solution should be replaced when the ph raises over neutrality and the feed solution should be replaced when nitrogen concentration reaches the desired value considering the drawbacks of on line ammonium sensors commented in the introduction section the soft sensor based on ph measurements could provide valuable information for control system development since during the recovery process there are also variations in the concentration of the ions present in the feed solution the conductivity which is another inexpensive process variable could also offer information related to the tan concentration and thus if this process variable is available it could be then tested as input variable of a soft sensor 4 conclusions in this work a data driven soft sensor solution based on pls has been proposed to extract primary information on the tan concentration evolution in the hfmc from the ph time evolution profile the main conclusions that can be drawn from this study are the hfmc process allows high n recovery efficiencies treating the supernatant of anaerobic digesters of municipal wwtps the ph is an inexpensive and easy to measure process variable that carries relevant information on tan concentration in the feed tank the developed pls based soft sensor is able to predict with high accuracy the tan concentration evolution in hollow fibre membrane contactors for nitrogen recovery this soft sensor uses the ph and extracted features its derivative and increments as input variables offering an inexpensive opportunity to extract primary information on the tan concentration the ph derivative and the ph increment after each reagent dosing were more relevant for tan concentration prediction than the ph value itself feature extraction based on technical knowledge of the process was key to make the development of a reliable data driven pls soft sensor possible this study highlighted the potential of the developed data driven soft sensor solution based on pls to unlock a new dynamic approach in optimization and control of the hfmc process as well as decision making in troubleshooting declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they
