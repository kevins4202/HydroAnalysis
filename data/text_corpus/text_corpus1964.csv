9820,due to the lack of stable irrigation water sources and low rainwater utilization efficiency soil water deficit has become the main factor restricting the sustainable development of the apple industry in the loess plateau the scientific and efficient use of rainwater for irrigation may provide a new solution to alleviate the regional soil water deficit rainwater is the only water source for the growth of apple trees and whether it can be used as a stable and sustainable irrigation water source should be quantitatively considered at present there is still a lack of quantitative data to support whether rainwater can meet the irrigation needs of apple orchards in this research rainwater harvesting technology is combined with a solar intelligent irrigation system equipped with soil moisture sensors to form a high efficiency rainwater irrigation hri mode suitable for dryland apple orchards through practical application this study found that hri mode can effectively improve the soil drought of 0 200 cm and keep the soil water content in a relatively stable range during the apple growth period compared with only using rainwater harvesting technology and combined with traditional irrigation methods sdi hri mode can increase apple yield by 56 2 and 22 0 wue by 40 4 and 12 6 respectively with the increase of apple yield hri mode has good economic feasibility and its economic recovery period is 2 years on the regional scale this study selected irrigation guarantee rate and solar energy resources as evaluation indicators to further divide the areas suitable for rainwater irrigation in apple cultivating region on the loess plateau the area where the irrigation guarantee rate of rainwater was greater than 75 is 1 22 107 m2 accounting for 47 6 of the total area this means that apple production in the loess plateau can increase by approximately 549 8 tons year save 1 5 104 m3 of irrigation water resources and increase wue by about 33 4 under the two different future climate scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 the area accounted for 49 7 and 57 2 respectively which was higher than the current situation the areas with high rainwater irrigation guarantee rates are mostly concentrated in the central and southern parts of the apple cultivating region to maintain the sustainable development of the orchard ecological environment areas with insufficient rainwater should assist other water management measures in conclusion high efficiency rainwater irrigation can effectively alleviate the water contradiction in apple cultivating region in future agricultural water management more attention should be paid to precision rainwater irrigation to ensure the coordinated development of agricultural economy and ecological environment keywords hri mode loess plateau apple cultivating region soil water deficit agricultural water management 1 introduction apples are among the most widely cultivated fruits in the world baldi et al 2013 li et al 2013 in order to ensure the quality of fruit apple trees are mostly planted in semi arid areas the loess plateau of china is one of the high quality apple producing areas in the world yang et al 2018 apple industry is the leading industry supporting the local economy shaanxi province is an example located in the central loess plateau the apple cultivating region reached 0 7 million hectares in 2016 and the total apple yield was as much as 11 million tons which accounted for 25 of the national total yield song et al 2017 however due to the rapid expansion of apple cultivating region the soil water deficit has become the most important bottleneck for the sustainable development of apple industry fu et al 2010 numerous studies have shown that dry soil layers in apple orchards are common gao et al 2018 wang et al 2015 the long term insufficient water storage capacity of soil reservoirs and the continuous increase of dry soil layers will reduce the water supply capacity of the soil and ultimately lead to the decline of soil fertility in the area and further affect the output and quality of apples thereby threatening the sustainable and healthy development of the local apple industry therefore reasonable and scientific supplementary irrigation is of great significance to ensure the sustainable development of the apple industry and maintain the ecological environment due to the lack of water resources there is generally no stable irrigation water source on the loess plateau liu et al 2016 rainwater is the only available water source for the growth of apple trees in the loess plateau the annual distribution of precipitation in this area is uneven and the growth period of apple trees does not match the distribution of precipitation li et al 2010 wan et al 2014 the utilization efficiency of rainfall under natural conditions is not good for the growth of apple trees zhao et al 2009 found that collecting and storing natural precipitation during the critical water demand period of fruit trees and using it for supplementary irrigation can solve the water shortage problem to a large extent rainwater collection technology can make full use of local precipitation resources jiang et al 2013 not only can effectively solve the problem of water shortage but also reduce soil erosion liu et al 2006 song et al 2016 yu et al 2011 rainwater harvesting technology makes it feasible to irrigate dryland orchards due to the scarcity of local rainwater resources efficient and reasonable irrigation must be carried out to ensure maximum rainwater utilization efficiency a lot of research has been conducted on the irrigation methods of apple trees kadayifci et al 2010 including surface drip irrigation capraro et al 2018 wang et al 2011 deficit border irrigation lo bianco and francaviglia 2012 alternate partial root zone irrigation villagrán deoses et al 2015 and subsurface drip irrigation chenafi et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 surface drip irrigation sdi has proven to be more effective than other irrigation methods raina et al 2013 however due to the great annual difference of meteorological conditions in apple cultivating region of the loess plateau it is difficult to formulate a unified and scientific irrigation schedule the efficiency of sdi is still low and the rainwater collection resources have not been fully utilized rainwater is a scarce and valuable resource for orchards in this area so improving the utilization rate of irrigation water is very important for the development of apple industry the combination of rainwater harvesting technology and precision irrigation technology may provide a new solution to the irrigation problem of dryland orchards rainwater harvesting technology can provide irrigation water resources for precision irrigation systems kamsu foguem and flammang 2014 the precision irrigation technology relies on soil moisture monitoring to provide real time layered and rapid soil moisture information for precision irrigation and water saving irrigation technology is used to achieve precision irrigation at the same time the utilization rate of rainwater is improved and the shortcomings of inconvenient power and water diversion in remote areas are overcome therefore the precision rainwater irrigation mode will fundamentally change the traditional agricultural water and production ways and promote the protection improvement and construction of the ecological environment at present the effect of full utilization of rainwater on the improvement of orchard soil drought and yield is still uncertain at the same time there is also a lack of quantitative data on a regional scale to support whether rainwater can be used as a large area of irrigation water source to meet the irrigation needs of apple orchards based on this this research innovatively combines rainwater harvesting technology with a solar intelligent irrigation system equipped with soil moisture sensors to form a hri mode suitable for arid and semi arid areas different from previous studies this study analyzes the advantages of this mode compared with other traditional methods through experiments and quantitatively determines the rainwater irrigation guarantee degree in apple cultivating region of the loess plateau to fully understand the impact of rainwater irrigation on regional apple production this study attempts to answer the following questions 1 how effective are the effects of high efficiency rainwater irrigation on soil drought and yield increase in dryland orchards 2 compared with traditional methods what are the advantages of this mode 3 what is the degree of rainwater irrigation guarantee in the apple cultivating region of the loess plateau the results of this study can provide data support for the application of rainwater irrigation and have important practical significance for the scientific management of dryland agricultural water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and field conditions this study area is one of the largest apple cultivating regions in the world mainly located in the central and southern part of the loess plateau the area ranges from 33 33 to 37 30 north latitude and 103 41 to 112 10 east longitude long hours of light and large temperature difference between day and night make this area an ideal location for apple tree cultivation the regional annual average temperature is 3 6 14 3 due to the influence of topography and climate there are also large differences in regional precipitation winter precipitation generally only accounts for about 5 the ecological environments for apple growth are generally consistent within the region and the cultivation area and yield of the main cultivar fuji apples malus pumila mill cv fuji exceeds 70 accounting for 29 3 of the apple cultivation areas in china translating to an annual yield of 9 880 100 tons li et al 2020 the soil type in the study area is mainly loessal soil the specific geographical location of the research area is shown in fig 1 the hri mode was tested in a typical mountain apple orchard in wanzhuang village hezhuangping town baoan district yan an city shaanxi province covers an area of 1 66 103 m2 the demonstration orchard is located at 36 40 25 n 109 22 10 e with a slope of 15 and an altitude of 1309 m a small weather station is set up in the orchard monitoring data shows that the annual average rainfall is about 500 mm and the average annual temperature is 9 4 c the soil type of the orchard is loessal soil the physical soil properties were measured using the method described by yang et al 2020 and are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design the experimental apple tree is 23a 2021 malus pumila mill and the planting density is 5 m 4 m fig 1 standard agronomic measures such as trimming girdling spraying insecticide and weed control were the same for all treatments to maintain relatively healthy crops and avoid unnecessary yield losses each year the apple trees received fertilizer applications of 600 kg ha 1 co nh2 2 250 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 200 kg ha 1 k2o the growing season of the apple trees was divided into five stages as shown in table 2 four treatments were established as follows t1 hri mode t2 rainwater harvesting technology with no water saving irrigation t3 rainwater harvesting with sdi and ck control no irrigation treatment each of the three treatments had three replicates in a row with four trees included in each replicate and a plot area of 20 m2 among them the rainwater storage cellar used in t2 is the same as t1 with a volume of 20 m³ t3 and t1 use the same surface drip irrigation equipment the difference is that t1 uses intelligent irrigation based on soil water content the working pressure head of the emitter was 1000 cm and the emitter discharge was 1 10 l h the experiments were carried out from march 2017 to october 2018 2 2 1 design structure of the hri mode the hri mode mainly includes three parts solar water pumping part rainwater harvesting irrigation part and intelligent precision irrigation decision part the basic principle is that the rainwater harvesting part is responsible for collecting the precipitation into the water cellars and then the intelligent precision irrigation decision part will drive the solar water pumping equipment to accurately irrigate the crops after making an irrigation decision the main structure of the hri mode is shown in fig 2 the rainwater harvesting and irrigation part is composed of water storage cellars and irrigation equipment the water storage cellars can adopt a variety of methods such as fish scale pits reservoirs and water buckets in this study concrete water cellars are used to collect rainwater the construction process is simple and suitable for the loess plateau it is important to note that the collected natural rainwater will inevitably be mixed with larger volumes of debris to collect as much rainwater as possible and avoid clogging of the irrigation system caused by sediment deposition a filter must be added to the upper part of the water storage cellar the photovoltaic water lift part is composed of solar panels and inverters the function of this part is mainly to convert solar energy into electric energy to provide energy for irrigation equipment the precision irrigation control system uses soil moisture sensors to collect soil moisture information and upload it to the irrigation monitor the irrigation monitor is passed to the computer for analysis and processing and the irrigation decision is made to control the start and stop of irrigation in this way not only can the roots of the crops have sufficient soil moisture content and meet the growth needs of plants but also can stabilize the soil moisture near a certain preset value avoiding the waste of water resources caused by excessive irrigation the hri mode can be configured according to the different applications and the instrument and equipment models used in this study are for reference the specific parameters are presented in table 3 2 2 2 irrigation schedule the irrigation schedules of t1 t2 and t3 are different t1 is continuous irrigation and the others are intermittent irrigation alternating watering and drying the water supply is continuous in t1 when the relative soil water content at each stage of the growth period is lower than the lower limit the system will automatically start irrigation the appropriate value in apple tree root concentrated distribution layer 0 60 cm is set as shown in table 4 song et al 2019 in t2 and t3 irrigation events occurred every 10 days in 2017 and 2018 respectively the irrigation amount of each event is determined by dividing the irrigation demand by the number of irrigation events for t2 and t3 the rhessys eco hydrological model tague and band 2004 was used to quantitatively estimate the irrigation water demand in each stage of the apple growth period it is generally estimated using the multi year average meteorological data of the region meteorological data of yan an station was used in this study the amount of water that can be absorbed by apple trees is mainly soil water while the water consumption is actual evapotranspiration gunduz et al 2011 therefore the irrigation demand can be calculated by using the following formula 1 m e t i where m is the total amount of

meteorological station was set up in the demonstration apple orchard data is recorded every 15 days to continuously monitor meteorological factors such as precipitation atmospheric temperature soil temperature wind speed wind direction atmospheric pressure relative humidity and solar radiation in the test area 2 3 2 soil water content swc transpiration t yield and water use efficiency wue transpiration mm was estimated using sap flux measurements in the experimental period transpiration of each treatment was taken as the average of 4 trees and also eight tdr315l soil moisture sensors are installed at the diagonal center of the four apple trees in each treatment the measurement error is 3 the sensors are connected to the cr1000 data collector campbell scientific usa to continuously monitor the soil moisture content of the 0 200 cm soil layer during the growth period march 2017 october 2017 and march 2018 october 2018 every 30 min the experimental setup is shown in the figure below fig 3 relative swc is defined as below 6 rswc i θ i fc where rswc i is the relative soil water content in the soil profile of i th measurement θ i is the average swc in the soil profile of i th

during 2017 and 2018 respectively the two means followed by different letters differed significantly from each other with a confidence of more than 95 origin software is used to analyze the correlation between the influencing factors and yield wue 2 3 4 economic feasibility analysis method economic profit is an important factor affecting the large scale promotion of solar rainwater

p t k n where p t represents the payback period k is the total amount of input capital n is the net profits obtained after system application 2 4 evaluation of applicable potential for rainwater harvesting irrigation 2 4 1 data used for model simulation there are four types of data collected for model simulation 1 meteorological data including the observation data of precipitation temperature air pressure sunshine time wind speed and relative humidity the data is download from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn the temporal resolution is 1 day 2 the projected climate change data in the fifth ipcc assessment report in 2014 researchers proposed four typical greenhouse gas concentration pathways rcps as scenario predictions for future climate rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 are used in this study to simulate the scenario that the global temperature will rise by 2 and 5 respectively by 2100 compared with that before industrialization the data period is from 2021 to 2050 the predicted climate data mainly include precipitation average temperature maximum and minimum temperature average relative humidity average solar radiation and average wind speed with daily resolution 3 digital elevation model dem data dem data is downloaded from national aeronautics and space administration https www nasa gov with a spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m the satellite data is downloaded from the google earth platform 2 4 2 calculation method of rainwater irrigation guarantee degree since the system used in this study uses collected rainwater as the irrigation water source it is necessary to collect enough rainwater for the irrigation of apple trees during the growth period various countries have issued national standards for project water supply guarantee rates china generally stipulates that the guarantee rate of agricultural irrigation should reach 75 85 according to the chinese industry standard rainwater harvesting and utilization engineering technical specification sl267 2001 the rainwater irrigation guarantee rate should be at least 75 department of water resources of inner mongolia autonomous region 2001 therefore in this study whether the guarantee rate of rainwater irrigation reaches 75 is used as the criterion of rainwater irrigation suitability considering that the apple tree is a perennial crop its ability to resist drought is stronger than that of short term crops therefore when estimating the irrigation guarantee rate the specific formula is as follows oron et al 1999 10 pi n m x t n m 1 100 where pi is the irrigation guarantee rate x t is the month of destruction that is the water supply in the current month does not meet the water demand in the current month n m is the total number of months for calculation it should be noted that the current month s water supply in this study is not only the collected rainwater that month but also the previously stored rainwater that has not been used for irrigation due to the issues such as land use rights the orchard area is the largest rainwater collection area under ideal conditions therefore the maximum harvesting amount of runoff that can be used for irrigation in the i month can be calculated with the following formula 11 w i p i i i et i a 0 78 among them w i is the maximum amount of rainwater harvesting for irrigation in the i th month mm p i is the precipitation in the i th month mm i i is the infiltration water in the i th month mm a is the orchard area et i is the evapotranspiration in the i th month mm if 1 i 1 w i 1 m i 1 m i which means the water supply in the current month can meet the irrigation demand in the current month otherwise cannot 2 4 3 assessment of solar energy richness and stability before the application of hri mode solar energy as the driving force of irrigation whether it can convert sufficient electric energy for equipment application should also be considered the feasibility of solar energy resources in apple cultivating region is evaluated according to the solar energy resource assessment method qx t89 2008 164 the measurement index mainly adopts the degree of solar energy resource richness and stability in this study the annual total solar radiation was used to evaluate the degree of solar energy resource richness and the levels are shown in table 5 the regional solar energy resources are divided into four levels when the amount of solar energy resources is more than 3780 it belongs to the area with abundant solar energy otherwise it means that solar water extraction technology is not suitable for this area the stability degree of solar energy resources is expressed by the ratio of the maximum and minimum sunshine hours of each month greater than 6 h the specific formula is shown in eq 1 12 k max day 1 day 2 day 12 min day 1 day 2 day 12 where k is the stability index of solar energy resources dimensionless constant day 1 day 2 day 12 refer to the number of days with sunshine duration greater than 6 h in each month from january to december day according to the calculation results of eq 1 the solar energy resource stability levels are shown in table 6 3 results 3 1 application performance of hri mode in demonstration orchard in this study the hri mode was applied to a typical mountain apple orchard and the application effect of the system was comprehensively evaluated 3 1 1 local solar energy conditions analysis before applying the hri mode it is necessary to analyze whether the local solar energy is sufficient and stable to ensure the sustainable operation of the system this study calculated 34 years of total solar radiation data from 1985 to 2018 to evaluate the solar energy resources of the demonstration orchard the specific results are shown in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 a that the solar energy resources in yan an city mainly belong to grade b and c levels among them only the solar energy resources in 2014 were poor but not far from the c level the results show that there are enough solar energy resources in the region to apply photovoltaic technology in addition the solar stability of all years from 1985 to 2018 was in a stable or relatively stable range therefore the local solar energy resources are abundant and stable which is suitable for hri mode application 3 1 2 hydrological conditions and irrigation demand the demonstration orchard is generally planted in middle to late march and the harvest is completed in middle to late october the hydrological conditions and irrigation demand at each stage of the apple growth period measured in 2017 and 2018 is shown in table 7 as shown in table 7 the rainfall of experimental orchard during apple growth period in 2017 and 2018 was 513 2 mm and 283 2 mm it can be seen from ck treatment that the soil water storage of orchard shows a continuous downward trend without irrigation the continuous consumption of soil water will make the apple industry unsustainable the irrigation amount of the three treatments t1 t3 was different t2 and t3 use irrigation quota for sub irrigation while t1 carries out real time irrigation according to the soil water content t1 irrigated 91 9 mm and 194 mm respectively in 2017 and 2018 t2 and t3 irrigated 94 6 mm per year according to the irrigation schedule in 2017 and 2018 3 1 3 effect of rainwater irrigation on soil drought the main source of water for apple tree growth is soil water therefore this study uses the relative soil water content as an agricultural drought indicator to measure the drought degree of apple orchards it is generally believed that when the relative soil water content is less than 30 it is a particularly severe drought when 30 40 it is a severe drought when it is 40 50 it is a moderate drought when it is 50 60 it is a mild drought when greater than 60 there is no drought li and zhou 2014 fig 5 shows the temporal dynamics of relative soil water content rswc and corresponding standard deviations in 2017 and 2018 compared to the control t1 t3 all significant improved the effect of soil drought p 0 05 but the effect of t2 and t3 were unstable in 2017 the average rswc of t2 and t3 were 51 7 and 58 2 respectively these values are close to t1 62 0 and higher than ck 46 5 however due to the decrease of precipitation the precipitation in 2018 has a strong impact on swc in 2018 the average rswc of ck t1 t2 and t3 were 44 2 60 6 49 6 and 56 4 respectively these values are much lower than those in 2017 due to the difficulty to predict the weather in the next year the irrigation schedule has a great influence on the irrigation effect of apple orchards generally speaking orchard in the stage iv and v do not need irrigation but there was too less precipitation in 2018 resulting in great water stress in treatments except t1 the overall drought improvement effect of t3 is slightly lower than that of t1 the changes in rswc σ θ of t1 t2 and t3 were calculated as 2 13 3 07 and 2 58 respectively all of which were higher than those of ck 1 64 in 2018 the σ θ of ck t1 t2 and t3 were 1 47 2 03 2 98 and 2 26 respectively it should be noted that both the σ θ in t2 and t3 is greater than t1 indicating that the rswc variation of t1 is more uniform this is mainly because t1 is a continuous irrigation method while t2 and t3 are intermittent irrigation methods so the swc variation between the three is different rainwater efficient irrigation mode allows soil moisture to be recharged in real time so in our experiment the swc treated by t1 remained relatively stable and its values spanned the appropriate range at various stages overall supplementary irrigation effectively alleviated the persistent drought trend of orchard there was only mid drought from march to june and no drought during the rest of growth period in t1 and t3 the drought improvement effect of t2 is limited and unstable so flood irrigation is not suitable for rainwater irrigation in orchards on the loess plateau in addition the monitoring results found that the relative soil water content at the stage i of 2018 was higher than that of 2017 and it showed the law of t1 t3 t2 ck due to the lack of rainfall during the growth period of the apple orchard in 2018 table 7 the soil moisture content in the ck control dropped rapidly however the high initial soil water content of t1 and t3 indicates that sufficient rainwater irrigation may be effective and sustainable to improve soil dry conditions to understand further the effect of irrigation on swc the soil water distribution of the four treatments at different stages in 2018 is shown in fig 6 the results in fig 6 showed that the soil moisture of 0 100 cm has a greater response to supplemental irrigation the treatment of t1 and t3 had more obvious improvement effect on deep soil drought the soil moisture at 100 200 cm only recovered significantly during the fruit swelling period and fruit ripening period it can also be seen that the surface soil of 0 20 cm before irrigation is basically not dry except for the flowering period this should be due to the continued lack of precipitation from october to april and the increase in water demand for apple trees during the flowering period after may precipitation increased and surface soil water content improved significantly during the whole growth period the deep soil water deficit is relatively serious all of which are moderate drought more supplemental irrigation water used for the growth of apple trees cannot alleviate the deep soil drought but it is significantly reduced after the fruit enlargement period overall the degree of drought in the 0 200 cm soil layer is significantly reduced after supplementary irrigation and continuous supplementary irrigation will further alleviate the degree of drought in the deep soil 3 1 4 effect of meteorological conditions and rainwater irrigation on apple yield and wue table 8 shows apple yield e t and wue for different treatments in 2017 and 2018 during the two growth periods 2017 and 2018 supplementary irrigation had a significant impact on apple production p 0 05 through irrigation apple production has increased significantly t1 processed the highest apple yields with significant increases of 14 9 t ha 1 and 15 3 t ha 1 than ck in 2017 and 2018 respectively in addition t1 showed a higher wue than t2 and t3 the et values of t1 t2 and t3 were 15 4 58 4 mm 12 1 45 7 mm and 15 1 57 4 mm higher than the controls respectively the wue of t1 t2 and t3 was 78 6 27 1 and 58 6 higher than the control respectively this is mainly due to the loss of more irrigation water from surface evaporation of t2 and t3 than t1 compared with t2 and t3 the proportion of transpiration effective evapotranspiration in t1 is much higher indicating that its irrigation water is absorbed better by apple trees fan et al 2019 also found that high frequency irrigation can achieve high yields and improve quality of organic melons also the σ θ of t1 was lower than other treatments except ck intelligent irrigation systems that continuously irrigate apple trees in real time through soil moisture content can better maintain swc within the range suitable for apple growth nam et al 2020 have found that keeping swc at constant levels promotes higher wue than fluctuating swc therefore maintaining a constant level of swc and high frequency irrigation can promote higher yields and wue under the same irrigation schedule drought and nitrogen deficiency are the main factors restricting apple production in the loess plateau of china wang et al 2019 in this study all treatments were fertilized to the same extent to ensure their nutrient adequacy precipitation and temperature are the main climatic factors affecting apple yield and water use efficiency fujisawa and kobayashi 2011 the correlation between rainfall irrigation water volume maximum temperature minimum temperature and yield wue are shown in fig 7 in our experiment it is observed that rainfall and irrigation are the main factors affecting fruit tree yield and wue and the correlation coefficients are 0 62 and 0 83 respectively fig 7 all impact factors were positively correlated with the yield wue the correlation of each factor from high to low is irrigation rainfall minimum temperature and maximum temperature the results showed that water stress was the main factor limiting apple yield and wue in arid and semi arid areas the average daily precipitation during the first 50 days of fruit tree growth in 2017 and 2018 is about 1 mm d at this level only relying on the precipitation at that stage to meet the water consumption of apple trees will lead to drought stress therefore appropriate soil moisture content is very important for apple production which also explains the small difference in t1 yield between 2017 and 2018 table 8 the key to achieve high wue is to increase the effective evaporation ratio of orchards no extreme weather events occurred during the experiment and the temperature fluctuated within the normal range which may be the reason why the temperature has little effect on the yield 3 2 economic feasibility analysis for the hri mode the economic feasibility of the mode was evaluated based on the increase of apple yield between ck and t1 the economic cost is presented in table 9 according to table 9 the total investment of the hri mode is 145 750 cny ha 1 we investigated the improvement of farmers income after the application of the system the average apple yield of the non irrigated apple trees in the demonstration orchard was 13 45 t ha 1 which reached 30 0 t ha 1 in the t1 treatment the price of apples in the local market is 7 5 cny kg consequently the annual income growth of the demonstration orchard from the increase in apple production was approximately 124 125 cny ha 1 since apples are annual crops the cost can only be recovered after the second year of harvest therefore the investment payback period of this hri mode is determined to be 2 years which has good economic feasibility 3 3 quantitatively evaluation of the high efficiency rainwater irrigation guarantee degree in the apple cultivating region the practical application of efficient rainwater irrigation model in demonstration orchards shows that it can effectively improve soil drought and significantly increase apple yield based on the highly efficient use of rainwater this study further quantitatively assessed the guarantee rate of rainwater irrigation in apple growing areas of loess plateau the richness and stability of solar energy as the driving condition for the operation of irrigation systems are also evaluated the results are shown in fig 8 it can be seen from the result of the fig 8 a that the average annual solar radiation in the apple cultivating region from 1990 to 2014 was above 1 104 mj m2 the overall abundance can reach a level indicating that there is sufficient solar energy to provide electric power to guarantee the sustainability of irrigation however the stability of solar energy in some areas such as xianyang and pingliang is not good when the irrigation system is used in the above areas it is necessary to increase the number of batteries to store more electric energy for long periods of insufficient sunshine fig 8 b shows that the area where the satisfaction degree of rainwater irrigation is greater than 75 is 1 22 107 m2 accounting for 47 6 of the total area which is mainly distributed in the central and southern part of the apple production area the unsatisfied areas are mainly distributed in dingxi tianshui yuncheng yan an and northern qingyang mainly due to the limited rainwater resources in suitable areas tongchuan xianyang and weinan have the highest satisfaction degrees rainfall as the main irrigation water source will be greatly affected by climate change uncertainty the guarantee degree of rainwater irrigation in apple cultivating region under different climate scenarios in the future has also been analyzed the results in fig 9 showed that the area where the rainwater irrigation guarantee degree is greater than 75 in the rcp2 6 scenario is 1 28 107 m2 accounting for 49 7 of the total area there is not much difference from the current situation in contrast in the rcp8 5 climate scenario the suitable application area of rainwater irrigation reached 1 48 107 m2 accounting for 57 2 of the total area which has been improved to a certain extent the above data show that in the context of climate change the highly efficient use of rainwater resources can effectively solve the problem of water deficit at about half of the apple cultivating region areas with low irrigation guarantee rate should take other agronomic measures such as enhanced seepage and surface mulch in time to alleviate the contradiction between water supply and demand 4 discussion 4 1 advantages and necessity of high efficiency rainwater irrigation in dryland agriculture making full use of rainwater for irrigation is of great significance to apple production in arid and semi arid areas gao et al 2009 this study explored the effect of hri mode on improving apple production wue and increasing effective irrigation area the results showed that hri mode could significantly alleviate the soil drought of 0 200 cm in apple orchards and the initial soil water content of the second growth period was higher than that of the previous year this indicates that the application of hri mode can improve the soil environment of the orchard and increase the sustainability of the apple industry compared with only using rainwater harvesting technology and combined with traditional irrigation methods sdi hri mode can increase apple yield by 56 2 and 22 0 wue by 40 4 and 12 6 respectively maintaining proper soil moisture is very important to increase apple yield nam et al 2020 the intelligent irrigation method continuously irrigates apple trees by controlling the soil water content so as to better maintain the swc within the range suitable for apple growth in traditional irrigation the irrigation schedule will generally formulate the irrigation amount of each stage on the multi year average scale and the irrigation will maintain a certain frequency the irrigation events will occur at a certain frequency such as 10 days time cai et al 2021 thus the irrigation effect of traditional methods is more affected by meteorological conditions this study found that increasing the ratio of t to et can improve the yield and wue together therefore some field management measures such as field film mulching and the application of rainwater infiltration promotion technology can effectively improve the yield and wue in this study high frequency irrigation also helps to increase this ratio table 8 due to the general lack of nitrogen in the soil of the loess plateau appropriate fertilization during the growth period of apple will also effectively promote the increase of yield fritschi et al 2003 found that appropriately increasing the amount of nitrogen application is also conducive to improving the water use efficiency of crops however considering that soil moisture is the limiting factor for the sustainability of apple industry in arid and semi arid areas all measures that can promote yield and wue should be carried out on the basis that soil moisture is not consumed excessively compared with traditional irrigation methods hri mode significantly improves the yield and wue of orchards and has a shorter economic recovery period therefore the hri mode is a viable alternative to traditional methods for irrigation in apple orchards of loess plateau the effective rainwater irrigation area is 1 22 107 m2 accounting for 47 6 of the total area this means that apple production in the loess plateau can increase by approximately 549 8 tons year save 1 5 104 m3 of irrigation water resources and increase wue by about 33 4 the rainfall in effective irrigation area is generally greater than 550 mm generally speaking apple trees consume more water than natural forests such as robinia pseudoacacia fan et al 2004 some studies have shown that forests are suitable for planting in areas with annual rainfall of 480 mm or more wang et al 2021 xu 2005 this also proves the accuracy of our research results to a certain extent under two different future climate scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 the suitable application range of rainwater irrigation is 49 7 and 57 2 which are higher than the current situation the study by zhao 2018 also showed that the degree of rainwater utilization in the loess plateau will be higher under future climatic conditions mainly due to the increase of regional precipitation it indicates that in the context of climate change rainwater resources can provide stable irrigation water for more regional apple orchards the application of high efficiency rainwater irrigation will gradually change the current situation of extensive agricultural management in the loess plateau scientific and reasonable water resources management can increase crop yields and improve the soil environment ensuring the sustainable development of agricultural production in arid and semi arid areas 4 2 novelty and limitations of this study this study combines intelligent irrigation technology with rainwater collection technology to form a new high efficiency rainwater irrigation model suitable for dryland apple orchard it reduces the high uncertainty of irrigation schedule and overcomes the disadvantage that intermittent irrigation alternating dry and wet is not conducive to crop growth on the basis of efficient utilization of rainwater this study further determined the effective rainwater irrigation area in apple cultivating region of loess plateau however the experiment only carried out the same fertilization and field management measures for all treatments and did not further determine the nutrient content so it was impossible to explore whether there was nitrogen stress in the significant increase of yield some studies have shown that drought stress will limit the absorption of nutrients by plant roots sardans and penuelas 2012 but when more nitrogen is available in the environment the negative impact of drought stress on apple trees will also be reduced huang et al 2018 therefore fully understanding the synergistic effect of water and fertilizer on apple production is the focus of future research there are also some uncertainties in the model input parameters when upscaling the orchard to regional scale the age and variety of apple trees in the region will correspond to different growth parameters which is difficult to be expressed in the model in this study fuji the fruit tree variety planted most 80 in this area was selected to ensure its accuracy as much as possible at the same time due to the change of meteorological conditions the division of apple growth stages in the region will also be about half a decade different therefore the effective irrigation area of rainwater irrigation in the region is calculated on an annual scale to avoid the influence of growth period of course orchard management involves field management operations such as grass coverage field film mulching flower thinning and fruit thinning which are difficult to reflect on the regional scale these will cause the deviation between the simulated value and the measured value so the model needs to be further improved and supplemented 5 conclusions hri mode can effectively improve the soil drought of 0 200 cm and keep the soil water content in a relatively stable range during the apple growth period compared with only using rainwater harvesting technology and combined with traditional irrigation methods sdi hri mode can increase apple yield by 56 2 and 22 0 wue by 40 4 and 12 6 respectively in the apple production area on the loess plateau almost half 47 6 of the area where the rainwater irrigation guarantee degree is greater than 75 this should be attributed to hri mode reducing the high uncertainty of irrigation plan and overcoming the disadvantage that intermittent irrigation alternating dry and wet is not conducive to crop growth moreover the application potential of rainwater irrigation is even higher than the current conditions under the two future climate scenarios this means that apple production in the loess plateau can increase by approximately 549 8 tons year save 1 5 104 m3 of irrigation water resources and increase wue by about 33 4 scientific and reasonable management of rainwater resources is of great significance to ensure the sustainable development of agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions further field experiments are needed to study whether hri mode combined with intelligent fertilization can further improve apple production credit authorship

9820,due to the lack of stable irrigation water sources and low rainwater utilization efficiency soil water deficit has become the main factor restricting the sustainable development of the apple industry in the loess plateau the scientific and efficient use of rainwater for irrigation may provide a new solution to alleviate the regional soil water deficit rainwater is the only water source for the growth of apple trees and whether it can be used as a stable and sustainable irrigation water source should be quantitatively considered at present there is still a lack of quantitative data to support whether rainwater can meet the irrigation needs of apple orchards in this research rainwater harvesting technology is combined with a solar intelligent irrigation system equipped with soil moisture sensors to form a high efficiency rainwater irrigation hri mode suitable for dryland apple orchards through practical application this study found that hri mode can effectively improve the soil drought of 0 200 cm and keep the soil water content in a relatively stable range during the apple growth period compared with only using rainwater harvesting technology and combined with traditional irrigation methods sdi hri mode can increase apple yield by 56 2 and 22 0 wue by 40 4 and 12 6 respectively with the increase of apple yield hri mode has good economic feasibility and its economic recovery period is 2 years on the regional scale this study selected irrigation guarantee rate and solar energy resources as evaluation indicators to further divide the areas suitable for rainwater irrigation in apple cultivating region on the loess plateau the area where the irrigation guarantee rate of rainwater was greater than 75 is 1 22 107 m2 accounting for 47 6 of the total area this means that apple production in the loess plateau can increase by approximately 549 8 tons year save 1 5 104 m3 of irrigation water resources and increase wue by about 33 4 under the two different future climate scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 the area accounted for 49 7 and 57 2 respectively which was higher than the current situation the areas with high rainwater irrigation guarantee rates are mostly concentrated in the central and southern parts of the apple cultivating region to maintain the sustainable development of the orchard ecological environment areas with insufficient rainwater should assist other water management measures in conclusion high efficiency rainwater irrigation can effectively alleviate the water contradiction in apple cultivating region in future agricultural water management more attention should be paid to precision rainwater irrigation to ensure the coordinated development of agricultural economy and ecological environment keywords hri mode loess plateau apple cultivating region soil water deficit agricultural water management 1 introduction apples are among the most widely cultivated fruits in the world baldi et al 2013 li et al 2013 in order to ensure the quality of fruit apple trees are mostly planted in semi arid areas the loess plateau of china is one of the high quality apple producing areas in the world yang et al 2018 apple industry is the leading industry supporting the local economy shaanxi province is an example located in the central loess plateau the apple cultivating region reached 0 7 million hectares in 2016 and the total apple yield was as much as 11 million tons which accounted for 25 of the national total yield song et al 2017 however due to the rapid expansion of apple cultivating region the soil water deficit has become the most important bottleneck for the sustainable development of apple industry fu et al 2010 numerous studies have shown that dry soil layers in apple orchards are common gao et al 2018 wang et al 2015 the long term insufficient water storage capacity of soil reservoirs and the continuous increase of dry soil layers will reduce the water supply capacity of the soil and ultimately lead to the decline of soil fertility in the area and further affect the output and quality of apples thereby threatening the sustainable and healthy development of the local apple industry therefore reasonable and scientific supplementary irrigation is of great significance to ensure the sustainable development of the apple industry and maintain the ecological environment due to the lack of water resources there is generally no stable irrigation water source on the loess plateau liu et al 2016 rainwater is the only available water source for the growth of apple trees in the loess plateau the annual distribution of precipitation in this area is uneven and the growth period of apple trees does not match the distribution of precipitation li et al 2010 wan et al 2014 the utilization efficiency of rainfall under natural conditions is not good for the growth of apple trees zhao et al 2009 found that collecting and storing natural precipitation during the critical water demand period of fruit trees and using it for supplementary irrigation can solve the water shortage problem to a large extent rainwater collection technology can make full use of local precipitation resources jiang et al 2013 not only can effectively solve the problem of water shortage but also reduce soil erosion liu et al 2006 song et al 2016 yu et al 2011 rainwater harvesting technology makes it feasible to irrigate dryland orchards due to the scarcity of local rainwater resources efficient and reasonable irrigation must be carried out to ensure maximum rainwater utilization efficiency a lot of research has been conducted on the irrigation methods of apple trees kadayifci et al 2010 including surface drip irrigation capraro et al 2018 wang et al 2011 deficit border irrigation lo bianco and francaviglia 2012 alternate partial root zone irrigation villagrán deoses et al 2015 and subsurface drip irrigation chenafi et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 surface drip irrigation sdi has proven to be more effective than other irrigation methods raina et al 2013 however due to the great annual difference of meteorological conditions in apple cultivating region of the loess plateau it is difficult to formulate a unified and scientific irrigation schedule the efficiency of sdi is still low and the rainwater collection resources have not been fully utilized rainwater is a scarce and valuable resource for orchards in this area so improving the utilization rate of irrigation water is very important for the development of apple industry the combination of rainwater harvesting technology and precision irrigation technology may provide a new solution to the irrigation problem of dryland orchards rainwater harvesting technology can provide irrigation water resources for precision irrigation systems kamsu foguem and flammang 2014 the precision irrigation technology relies on soil moisture monitoring to provide real time layered and rapid soil moisture information for precision irrigation and water saving irrigation technology is used to achieve precision irrigation at the same time the utilization rate of rainwater is improved and the shortcomings of inconvenient power and water diversion in remote areas are overcome therefore the precision rainwater irrigation mode will fundamentally change the traditional agricultural water and production ways and promote the protection improvement and construction of the ecological environment at present the effect of full utilization of rainwater on the improvement of orchard soil drought and yield is still uncertain at the same time there is also a lack of quantitative data on a regional scale to support whether rainwater can be used as a large area of irrigation water source to meet the irrigation needs of apple orchards based on this this research innovatively combines rainwater harvesting technology with a solar intelligent irrigation system equipped with soil moisture sensors to form a hri mode suitable for arid and semi arid areas different from previous studies this study analyzes the advantages of this mode compared with other traditional methods through experiments and quantitatively determines the rainwater irrigation guarantee degree in apple cultivating region of the loess plateau to fully understand the impact of rainwater irrigation on regional apple production this study attempts to answer the following questions 1 how effective are the effects of high efficiency rainwater irrigation on soil drought and yield increase in dryland orchards 2 compared with traditional methods what are the advantages of this mode 3 what is the degree of rainwater irrigation guarantee in the apple cultivating region of the loess plateau the results of this study can provide data support for the application of rainwater irrigation and have important practical significance for the scientific management of dryland agricultural water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and field conditions this study area is one of the largest apple cultivating regions in the world mainly located in the central and southern part of the loess plateau the area ranges from 33 33 to 37 30 north latitude and 103 41 to 112 10 east longitude long hours of light and large temperature difference between day and night make this area an ideal location for apple tree cultivation the regional annual average temperature is 3 6 14 3 due to the influence of topography and climate there are also large differences in regional precipitation winter precipitation generally only accounts for about 5 the ecological environments for apple growth are generally consistent within the region and the cultivation area and yield of the main cultivar fuji apples malus pumila mill cv fuji exceeds 70 accounting for 29 3 of the apple cultivation areas in china translating to an annual yield of 9 880 100 tons li et al 2020 the soil type in the study area is mainly loessal soil the specific geographical location of the research area is shown in fig 1 the hri mode was tested in a typical mountain apple orchard in wanzhuang village hezhuangping town baoan district yan an city shaanxi province covers an area of 1 66 103 m2 the demonstration orchard is located at 36 40 25 n 109 22 10 e with a slope of 15 and an altitude of 1309 m a small weather station is set up in the orchard monitoring data shows that the annual average rainfall is about 500 mm and the average annual temperature is 9 4 c the soil type of the orchard is loessal soil the physical soil properties were measured using the method described by yang et al 2020 and are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design the experimental apple tree is 23a 2021 malus pumila mill and the planting density is 5 m 4 m fig 1 standard agronomic measures such as trimming girdling spraying insecticide and weed control were the same for all treatments to maintain relatively healthy crops and avoid unnecessary yield losses each year the apple trees received fertilizer applications of 600 kg ha 1 co nh2 2 250 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 200 kg ha 1 k2o the growing season of the apple trees was divided into five stages as shown in table 2 four treatments were established as follows t1 hri mode t2 rainwater harvesting technology with no water saving irrigation t3 rainwater harvesting with sdi and ck control no irrigation treatment each of the three treatments had three replicates in a row with four trees included in each replicate and a plot area of 20 m2 among them the rainwater storage cellar used in t2 is the same as t1 with a volume of 20 m³ t3 and t1 use the same surface drip irrigation equipment the difference is that t1 uses intelligent irrigation based on soil water content the working pressure head of the emitter was 1000 cm and the emitter discharge was 1 10 l h the experiments were carried out from march 2017 to october 2018 2 2 1 design structure of the hri mode the hri mode mainly includes three parts solar water pumping part rainwater harvesting irrigation part and intelligent precision irrigation decision part the basic principle is that the rainwater harvesting part is responsible for collecting the precipitation into the water cellars and then the intelligent precision irrigation decision part will drive the solar water pumping equipment to accurately irrigate the crops after making an irrigation decision the main structure of the hri mode is shown in fig 2 the rainwater harvesting and irrigation part is composed of water storage cellars and irrigation equipment the water storage cellars can adopt a variety of methods such as fish scale pits reservoirs and water buckets in this study concrete water cellars are used to collect rainwater the construction process is simple and suitable for the loess plateau it is important to note that the collected natural rainwater will inevitably be mixed with larger volumes of debris to collect as much rainwater as possible and avoid clogging of the irrigation system caused by sediment deposition a filter must be added to the upper part of the water storage cellar the photovoltaic water lift part is composed of solar panels and inverters the function of this part is mainly to convert solar energy into electric energy to provide energy for irrigation equipment the precision irrigation control system uses soil moisture sensors to collect soil moisture information and upload it to the irrigation monitor the irrigation monitor is passed to the computer for analysis and processing and the irrigation decision is made to control the start and stop of irrigation in this way not only can the roots of the crops have sufficient soil moisture content and meet the growth needs of plants but also can stabilize the soil moisture near a certain preset value avoiding the waste of water resources caused by excessive irrigation the hri mode can be configured according to the different applications and the instrument and equipment models used in this study are for reference the specific parameters are presented in table 3 2 2 2 irrigation schedule the irrigation schedules of t1 t2 and t3 are different t1 is continuous irrigation and the others are intermittent irrigation alternating watering and drying the water supply is continuous in t1 when the relative soil water content at each stage of the growth period is lower than the lower limit the system will automatically start irrigation the appropriate value in apple tree root concentrated distribution layer 0 60 cm is set as shown in table 4 song et al 2019 in t2 and t3 irrigation events occurred every 10 days in 2017 and 2018 respectively the irrigation amount of each event is determined by dividing the irrigation demand by the number of irrigation events for t2 and t3 the rhessys eco hydrological model tague and band 2004 was used to quantitatively estimate the irrigation water demand in each stage of the apple growth period it is generally estimated using the multi year average meteorological data of the region meteorological data of yan an station was used in this study the amount of water that can be absorbed by apple trees is mainly soil water

meteorological station was set up in the demonstration apple orchard data is recorded every 15 days to continuously monitor meteorological factors such as precipitation atmospheric temperature soil temperature wind speed wind direction atmospheric pressure relative humidity and solar radiation in the test area 2 3 2 soil water content swc transpiration t yield and water use efficiency wue transpiration mm was estimated using sap flux measurements in the experimental period transpiration of each treatment was taken as the average of 4 trees and also eight tdr315l soil moisture sensors are installed at the diagonal center of the four apple trees in each treatment the measurement error is 3 the sensors are connected to the cr1000 data collector campbell scientific usa to continuously monitor the soil moisture content of the 0 200 cm soil layer during the growth period march 2017 october 2017 and march 2018 october 2018 every 30 min the experimental setup is shown in the figure below fig 3 relative swc is defined as below 6 rswc i θ i fc where rswc i is the relative soil water content in the soil profile of i th measurement θ i is the average swc in the soil profile of i th

during 2017 and 2018 respectively the two means followed by different letters differed significantly from each other with a confidence of more than 95 origin software is used to analyze the correlation between the influencing factors and yield wue 2 3 4 economic feasibility analysis method economic profit is an important factor affecting the large scale promotion of solar rainwater

air pressure sunshine time wind speed and relative humidity the data is download from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn the temporal resolution is 1 day 2 the projected climate change data in the fifth ipcc assessment report in 2014 researchers proposed four typical greenhouse gas concentration pathways rcps as scenario predictions for future climate rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 are used in this study to simulate the scenario that the global temperature will rise by 2 and 5 respectively by 2100 compared with that before industrialization the data period is from 2021 to 2050 the predicted climate data mainly include precipitation average temperature maximum and minimum temperature average relative humidity average solar radiation and average wind speed with daily resolution 3 digital elevation model dem data dem data is downloaded from national aeronautics and space administration https www nasa gov with a spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m the satellite data is downloaded from the google earth platform 2 4 2 calculation method of rainwater irrigation guarantee degree since the system used in this study uses collected rainwater as the irrigation water source it is necessary to collect enough rainwater for the irrigation of apple trees during the growth period various countries have issued national standards for project water supply guarantee rates china generally stipulates that the guarantee rate of agricultural irrigation should reach 75 85 according to the chinese industry standard rainwater harvesting and utilization engineering technical specification sl267 2001 the rainwater irrigation guarantee rate should be at least 75 department of water resources of inner mongolia autonomous region 2001 therefore in this study whether the guarantee rate of rainwater irrigation reaches 75 is used as the criterion of rainwater irrigation suitability considering that the apple tree is a perennial crop its ability to resist drought is stronger than that of short term crops therefore when estimating the irrigation guarantee rate the specific formula is as follows oron et al 1999 10 pi n m x t n m 1 100 where pi is the irrigation guarantee rate x t is the month of destruction that is the water supply in the current month does not meet the water demand in the current month n m is the total number of months for calculation it should be noted that the current month s water supply in this study is not only the collected rainwater that month but also the previously stored rainwater that has not been used for irrigation due to the issues such as land use rights the orchard area is the largest rainwater collection area under ideal conditions therefore the maximum harvesting amount of runoff that can be used for irrigation in the i month can be calculated with the following formula 11 w i p i i i et i a 0 78 among them w i is the maximum amount of rainwater harvesting for irrigation in the i th month mm p i is the precipitation in the i th month mm i i is the infiltration water in the i th month mm a is the orchard area et i is the evapotranspiration in the i th month mm if 1 i 1 w i 1 m i 1 m i which means the water supply in the current month can meet the irrigation demand in the current month otherwise cannot 2 4 3 assessment of solar energy richness and stability before the application of hri mode solar energy as the driving force of irrigation whether it can convert sufficient electric energy for equipment application should also be considered the feasibility of solar energy resources in apple cultivating region is evaluated according to the solar energy resource assessment method qx t89 2008 164 the measurement index mainly adopts the degree of solar energy resource richness and stability in this study the annual total solar radiation was used to evaluate the degree of solar energy resource richness and the levels are shown in table 5 the regional solar energy resources are divided into four levels when the amount of solar energy resources is more than 3780 it belongs to the area with abundant solar energy otherwise it means that solar water extraction technology is not suitable for this area the stability degree of solar energy resources is expressed by the ratio of the maximum and minimum sunshine hours of each month greater than 6 h the specific formula is shown in eq 1 12 k max day 1 day 2 day 12 min day 1 day 2 day 12 where k is the stability index of solar energy resources dimensionless constant day 1 day 2 day 12 refer to the number of days with sunshine duration greater than 6 h in each month from january to december day according to the calculation results of eq 1 the solar energy resource stability levels are shown in table 6 3 results 3 1 application performance of hri mode in demonstration orchard in this study the hri mode was applied to a typical mountain apple orchard and the application effect of the system was comprehensively evaluated 3 1 1 local solar energy conditions analysis before applying the hri mode it is necessary to analyze whether the local solar energy is sufficient and stable to ensure the sustainable operation of the system this study calculated 34 years of total solar radiation data from 1985 to 2018 to evaluate the solar energy resources of the demonstration orchard the specific results are shown in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 a that the solar energy resources in yan an city mainly belong to grade b and c levels among them only the solar energy resources in 2014 were poor but not far from the c level the results show that there are enough solar energy resources in the region to apply photovoltaic technology in addition the solar stability of all years from 1985 to 2018 was in a stable or relatively stable range therefore the local solar energy resources are abundant and stable which is suitable for hri mode application 3 1 2 hydrological conditions and irrigation demand the demonstration orchard is generally planted in middle to late march and the harvest is completed in middle to late october the hydrological conditions and irrigation demand at each stage of the apple growth period measured in 2017 and 2018 is shown in table 7 as shown in table 7 the rainfall of experimental orchard during apple growth period in 2017 and 2018 was 513 2 mm and 283 2 mm it can be seen from ck treatment that the soil water storage of orchard shows a continuous downward trend without irrigation the continuous consumption of soil water will make the apple industry unsustainable the irrigation amount of the three treatments t1 t3 was different t2 and t3 use irrigation quota for sub irrigation while t1 carries out real time irrigation according to the soil water content t1 irrigated 91 9 mm and 194 mm respectively in 2017 and 2018 t2 and t3 irrigated 94 6 mm per year according to the irrigation schedule in 2017 and 2018 3 1 3 effect of rainwater irrigation on soil drought the main source of water for apple tree growth is soil water therefore this study uses the relative soil water content as an agricultural drought indicator to measure the drought degree of apple orchards it is generally believed that when the relative soil water content is less than 30 it is a particularly severe drought when 30 40 it is a severe drought when it is 40 50 it is a moderate drought when it is 50 60 it is a mild drought when greater than 60 there is no drought li and zhou 2014 fig 5 shows the temporal dynamics of relative soil water content rswc and corresponding standard deviations in 2017 and 2018 compared to the control t1 t3 all significant improved the effect of soil drought p 0 05 but the effect of t2 and t3 were unstable in 2017 the average rswc of t2 and t3 were 51 7 and 58 2 respectively these values are close to t1 62 0 and higher than ck 46 5 however due to the decrease of precipitation the precipitation in 2018 has a strong impact on swc in 2018 the average rswc of ck t1 t2 and t3 were 44 2 60 6 49 6 and 56 4 respectively these values are much lower than those in 2017 due to the difficulty to predict the weather in the next year the irrigation schedule has a great influence on the irrigation effect of apple orchards generally speaking orchard in the stage iv and v do not need irrigation but there was too less precipitation in 2018 resulting in great water stress in treatments except t1 the overall drought improvement effect of t3 is slightly lower than that of t1 the changes in rswc σ θ of t1 t2 and t3 were calculated as 2 13 3 07 and 2 58 respectively all of which were higher than those of ck 1 64 in 2018 the σ θ of ck t1 t2 and t3 were 1 47 2 03 2 98 and 2 26 respectively it should be noted that both the σ θ in t2 and t3 is greater than t1 indicating that the rswc variation of t1 is more uniform this is mainly because t1 is a continuous irrigation method while t2 and t3 are intermittent irrigation methods so the swc variation between the three is different rainwater efficient irrigation mode allows soil moisture to be recharged in real time so in our experiment the swc treated by t1 remained relatively stable and its values spanned the appropriate range at various stages overall supplementary irrigation effectively alleviated the persistent drought trend of orchard there was only mid drought from march to june and no drought during the rest of growth period in t1 and t3 the drought improvement effect of t2 is limited and unstable so flood irrigation is not suitable for rainwater irrigation in orchards on the loess plateau in addition the monitoring results found that the relative soil water content at the stage i of 2018 was higher than that of 2017 and it showed the law of t1 t3 t2 ck due to the lack of rainfall during the growth period of the apple orchard in 2018 table 7 the soil moisture content in the ck control dropped rapidly however the high initial soil water content of t1 and t3 indicates that sufficient rainwater irrigation may be effective and sustainable to improve soil dry conditions to understand further the effect of irrigation on swc the soil water distribution of the four treatments at different stages in 2018 is shown in fig 6 the results in fig 6 showed that the soil moisture of 0 100 cm has a greater response to supplemental irrigation the treatment of t1 and t3 had more obvious improvement effect on deep soil drought the soil moisture at 100 200 cm only recovered significantly during the fruit swelling period and fruit ripening period it can also be seen that the surface soil of 0 20 cm before irrigation is basically not dry except for the flowering period this should be due to the continued lack of precipitation from october to april and the increase in water demand for apple trees during the flowering period after may precipitation increased and surface soil water content improved significantly during the whole growth period the deep soil water deficit is relatively serious all of which are moderate drought more supplemental irrigation water used for the growth of apple trees cannot alleviate the deep soil drought but it is significantly reduced after the fruit enlargement period overall the degree of drought in the 0 200 cm soil layer is significantly reduced after supplementary irrigation and continuous supplementary irrigation will further alleviate the degree of drought in the deep soil 3 1 4 effect of meteorological conditions and rainwater irrigation on apple yield and wue table 8 shows apple yield e t and wue for different treatments in 2017 and 2018 during the two growth periods 2017 and 2018 supplementary irrigation had a significant impact on apple production p 0 05 through irrigation apple production has increased significantly t1 processed the highest apple yields with significant increases of 14 9 t ha 1 and 15 3 t ha 1 than ck in 2017 and 2018 respectively in addition t1 showed a higher wue than t2 and t3 the et values of t1 t2 and t3 were 15 4 58 4 mm 12 1 45 7 mm and 15 1 57 4 mm higher than the controls respectively the wue of t1 t2 and t3 was 78 6 27 1 and 58 6 higher than the control respectively this is mainly due to the loss of more irrigation water from surface evaporation of t2 and t3 than t1 compared with t2 and t3 the proportion of transpiration effective evapotranspiration in t1 is much higher indicating that its irrigation water is absorbed better by apple trees fan et al 2019 also found that high frequency irrigation can achieve high yields and improve quality of organic melons also the σ θ of t1 was lower than other treatments except ck intelligent irrigation systems that continuously irrigate apple trees in real time through soil moisture content can better maintain swc within the range suitable for apple growth nam et al 2020 have found that keeping swc at constant levels promotes higher wue than fluctuating swc therefore maintaining a constant level of swc and high frequency irrigation can promote higher yields and wue under the same irrigation schedule drought and nitrogen deficiency are the main factors restricting apple production in the loess plateau of china wang et al 2019 in this study all treatments were fertilized to the same extent to ensure their nutrient adequacy precipitation and temperature are the main climatic factors affecting apple yield and water use efficiency fujisawa and kobayashi 2011 the correlation between rainfall irrigation water volume maximum temperature minimum temperature and yield wue are shown in fig 7 in our experiment it is observed that rainfall and irrigation are the main factors affecting fruit tree yield and wue and the correlation coefficients are 0 62 and 0 83 respectively fig 7 all impact factors were positively correlated with the yield wue the correlation of each factor from high to low is irrigation rainfall minimum temperature and maximum temperature the results showed that water stress was the main factor limiting apple yield and wue in arid and semi arid areas the average daily precipitation during the first 50 days of fruit tree growth in 2017 and 2018 is about 1 mm d at this level only relying on the precipitation at that stage to meet the water consumption of apple trees will lead to drought stress therefore appropriate soil moisture content is very important for apple production which also explains the small difference in t1 yield between 2017 and 2018 table 8 the key to achieve high wue is to increase the effective evaporation ratio of orchards no extreme weather events occurred during the experiment and the temperature fluctuated within the normal range which may be the reason why the temperature has little effect on the yield 3 2 economic feasibility analysis for the hri mode the economic feasibility of the mode was evaluated based on the increase of apple yield between ck and t1 the economic cost is presented in table 9 according to table 9 the total investment of the hri mode is 145 750 cny ha 1 we investigated the improvement of farmers income after the application of the system the average apple yield of the non irrigated apple trees in the demonstration orchard was 13 45 t ha 1 which reached 30 0 t ha 1 in the t1 treatment the price of apples in the local market is 7 5 cny kg consequently the annual income growth of the demonstration orchard from the increase in apple production was approximately 124 125 cny ha 1 since apples are annual crops the cost can only be recovered after the second year of harvest therefore the investment payback period of this hri mode is determined to be 2 years which has good economic feasibility 3 3 quantitatively evaluation of the high efficiency rainwater irrigation guarantee degree in the apple cultivating region the practical application of efficient rainwater irrigation model in demonstration orchards shows that it can effectively improve soil drought and significantly increase apple yield based on the highly efficient use of rainwater this study further quantitatively assessed the guarantee rate of rainwater irrigation in apple growing areas of loess plateau the richness and stability of solar energy as the driving condition for the operation of irrigation systems are also evaluated the results are shown in fig 8 it can be seen from the result of the fig 8 a that the average annual solar radiation in the apple cultivating region from 1990 to 2014 was above 1 104 mj m2 the overall abundance can reach a level indicating that there is sufficient solar energy to provide electric power to guarantee the sustainability of irrigation however the stability of solar energy in some areas such as xianyang and pingliang is not good when the irrigation system is used in the above areas it is necessary to increase the number of batteries to store more electric energy for long periods of insufficient sunshine fig 8 b shows that the area where the satisfaction degree of rainwater irrigation is greater than 75 is 1 22 107 m2 accounting for 47 6 of the total area which is mainly distributed in the central and southern part of the apple production area the unsatisfied areas are mainly distributed in dingxi tianshui yuncheng yan an and northern qingyang mainly due to the limited rainwater resources in suitable areas tongchuan xianyang and weinan have the highest satisfaction degrees rainfall as the main irrigation water source will be greatly affected by climate change uncertainty the guarantee degree of rainwater irrigation in apple cultivating region under different climate scenarios in the future has also been analyzed the results in fig 9 showed that the area where the rainwater irrigation guarantee degree is greater than 75 in the rcp2 6 scenario is 1 28 107 m2 accounting for 49 7 of the total area there is not much difference from the current situation in contrast in the rcp8 5 climate scenario the suitable application area of rainwater irrigation reached 1 48 107 m2 accounting for 57 2 of the total area which has been improved to a certain extent the above data show that in the context of climate change the highly efficient use of rainwater resources can effectively solve the problem of water deficit at about half of the apple cultivating region areas with low irrigation guarantee rate should take other agronomic measures such as enhanced seepage and surface mulch in time to alleviate the contradiction between water supply and demand 4 discussion 4 1 advantages and necessity of high efficiency rainwater irrigation in dryland agriculture making full use of rainwater for irrigation is of great significance to apple production in arid and semi arid areas gao et al 2009 this study explored the effect of hri mode on improving apple production wue and increasing effective irrigation area the results showed that hri mode could significantly alleviate the soil drought of 0 200 cm in apple orchards and the initial soil water content of the second growth period was higher than that of the previous year this indicates that the application of hri mode can improve the soil environment of the orchard and increase the sustainability of the apple industry compared with only using rainwater harvesting technology and combined with traditional irrigation methods sdi hri mode can increase apple yield by 56 2 and 22 0 wue by 40 4 and 12 6 respectively maintaining proper soil moisture is very important to increase apple yield nam et al 2020 the intelligent irrigation method continuously irrigates apple trees by controlling the soil water content so as to better maintain the swc within the range suitable for apple growth in traditional irrigation the irrigation schedule will generally formulate the irrigation amount of each stage on the multi year average scale and the irrigation will maintain a certain frequency the irrigation events will occur at a certain frequency such as 10 days time cai et al 2021 thus the irrigation effect of traditional methods is more affected by meteorological conditions this study found that increasing the ratio of t to et can improve the yield and wue together therefore some field management measures such as field film mulching and the application of rainwater infiltration promotion technology can effectively improve the yield and wue in this study high frequency irrigation also helps to increase this ratio table 8 due to the general lack of nitrogen in the soil of the loess plateau appropriate fertilization during the growth period of apple will also effectively promote the increase of yield fritschi et al 2003 found that appropriately increasing the amount of nitrogen application is also conducive to improving the water use efficiency of crops however considering that soil moisture is the limiting factor for the sustainability of apple industry in arid and semi arid areas all measures that can promote yield and wue should be carried out on the basis that soil moisture is not consumed excessively compared with traditional irrigation methods hri mode significantly improves the yield and wue of orchards and has a shorter economic recovery period therefore the hri mode is a viable alternative to traditional methods for irrigation in apple orchards of loess plateau the effective rainwater irrigation area is 1 22 107 m2 accounting for 47 6 of the total area this means that apple production in the loess plateau can increase by approximately 549 8 tons year save 1 5 104 m3 of irrigation water resources and increase wue by about 33 4 the rainfall in effective irrigation area is generally greater than 550 mm generally speaking apple trees consume more water than natural forests such as robinia pseudoacacia fan et al 2004 some studies have shown that forests are suitable for planting in areas with annual rainfall of 480 mm or more wang et al 2021 xu 2005 this also proves the accuracy of our research results to a certain extent under two different future climate scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 the suitable application range of rainwater irrigation is 49 7 and 57 2 which are higher than the current situation the study by zhao 2018 also showed that the degree of rainwater utilization in the loess plateau will be higher under future climatic conditions mainly due to the increase of regional precipitation it indicates that in the context of climate change rainwater resources can provide stable irrigation water for more regional apple orchards the application of high efficiency rainwater irrigation will gradually change the current situation of extensive agricultural management in the loess plateau scientific and reasonable water resources management can increase crop yields and improve the soil environment ensuring the sustainable development of agricultural production in arid and semi arid areas 4 2 novelty and limitations of this study this study combines intelligent irrigation technology with rainwater collection technology to form a new high efficiency rainwater irrigation model suitable for dryland apple orchard it reduces the high uncertainty of irrigation schedule and overcomes the disadvantage that intermittent irrigation alternating dry and wet is not conducive to crop growth on the basis of efficient utilization of rainwater this study further determined the effective rainwater irrigation area in apple cultivating region of loess plateau however the experiment only carried out the same fertilization and field management measures for all treatments and did not further determine the nutrient content so it was impossible to explore whether there was nitrogen stress in the significant increase of yield some studies have shown that drought stress will limit the absorption of nutrients by plant roots sardans and penuelas 2012 but when more nitrogen is available in the environment the negative impact of drought stress on apple trees will also be reduced huang et al 2018 therefore fully understanding the synergistic effect of water and fertilizer on apple production is the focus of future research there are also some uncertainties in the model input parameters when upscaling the orchard to regional scale the age and variety of apple trees in the region will correspond to different growth parameters which is difficult to be expressed in the model in this study fuji the fruit tree variety planted most 80 in this area was selected to ensure its accuracy as much as possible at the same time due to the change of meteorological conditions the division of apple growth stages in the region will also be about half a decade different therefore the effective irrigation area of rainwater irrigation in the region is calculated on an annual scale to avoid the influence of growth period of course orchard management involves field management operations such as grass coverage field film mulching flower thinning and fruit thinning which are difficult to reflect on the regional scale these will cause the deviation between the simulated value and the measured value so the model needs to be further improved and supplemented 5 conclusions hri mode can effectively improve the soil drought of 0 200 cm and keep the soil water content in a relatively stable range during the apple growth period compared with only using rainwater harvesting technology and combined with traditional irrigation methods sdi hri mode can increase apple yield by 56 2 and 22 0 wue by 40 4 and 12 6 respectively in the apple production area on the loess plateau almost half 47 6 of the area where the rainwater irrigation guarantee degree is greater than 75 this should be attributed to hri mode reducing the high uncertainty of irrigation plan and overcoming the disadvantage that intermittent irrigation alternating dry and wet is not conducive to crop growth moreover the application potential of rainwater irrigation is even higher than the current conditions under the two future climate scenarios this means that apple production in the loess plateau can increase by approximately 549 8 tons year save 1 5 104 m3 of irrigation water resources and increase wue by about 33 4 scientific and reasonable management of rainwater resources is of great significance to ensure the sustainable development of agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions further field experiments are needed to study whether hri mode combined with intelligent fertilization can further improve apple production credit authorship

9821,the transfer of successful water market governance between international settings is increasingly attractive to policy makers under globalization this paper tests lesson drawing approaches to water market governance transfers using data from spain and the murray darling basin australia spain is the blueprint country for water market adoption in europe while australia is often presented as a world leader in innovative water market arrangements a preliminary comparative analysis framework linking water market governance principles to observed institutional arrangements and outcomes is provided finally some key lessons problems and policy transfer potential to stimulate and enhance spanish water markets from lesson drawing approaches are drawn with an emphasis on adaptive capacity as an institutional performance metric we find that spain s current water governance institutions and arrangements offer a solid platform for marketing reform where some key adaptive capacity constraints are able to be addressed the lessons drawn from this study highlight those areas of change which while challenging can be achieved in our view keywords water markets policy transfer lesson drawing spain and australia 1 introduction the impacts of future climate change and demand growth on water supplies are already present in our social ecological systems extreme weather events natural disasters biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse and water crises suggest a need for policy makers to redouble climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts world economic forum 2019 to address water crises through climate change mitigation and adaptation investment policy makers face two main choices supply side e g engineering instruments to expand water availability and demand side e g economic instruments to modulate demand while most suitable locations for additional large scale engineering infrastructure have already been exploited world bank 2010 there are also rising concerns about relationships between additional storage and increased consumption di baldassarre et al 2018 such concerns have also been raised in discussions surrounding the adoption of efficient irrigation technology as a means of saving water for applications elsewhere see for example adamson and loch 2014 gómez and pérez blanco 2014 thus while supply side instruments may be politically expedient and popular with policy makers development investors they may not be sufficient on their own to mitigate climate change impacts further common supply side instrument implementation within poor water accounting frameworks often with fixed site benefit characteristics suggest a lower likelihood of effective climate change adaptation better management of water demand is thus essential for adaptation to climate induced changes in water resources and water management challenges this intimates that prudent policy makers will explore and increasingly couple demand side with supply side arrangements in the management of scarce water resources demand side instruments include regulatory instruments such as quotas and security differentiated water rights and economic instruments such as pricing and charges user subsidies drought insurance non pecuniary cooperative agreements payment for ecosystem services and water markets all offer a range of investment choices for policy makers to achieve climate change mitigation and adaptation outcomes however the successful design and implementation of demand side instruments in water management contexts involves high transaction costs wide institutional change collective action at different levels and non trivial economic impacts on users gomez et al 2018 among economic instruments water markets are particularly costly to design and implement loch and mciver 2013 wheeler et al 2017 however over time water markets have proven their capacity to respond to water scarcity impacts see for example bauer 2010 connor et al 2011 saliba 1987 wheeler et al 2015 wittwer and griffith 2011 in europe spain has pioneered the adoption of economic instruments in general and water markets in particular becoming a blueprint nation for other member states who wish to employ economic instruments for over 20 years spain has implemented private private and public private i e buyback water markets in sites of high demand pressure using a wide array of institutional settings ranging from public tenders and clearinghouses to bilateral agreements among users however in comparison to other contexts with long term market structures spain s water market activity remains narrow immature and heavily linked to drought events montilla lópez et al 2018 palomo hierro et al 2015 in a context of increasing water scarcity competition and heightened supply uncertainty it may be prudent for spain s policy makers to re examine water markets as an economic instrument with a high probability of future usefulness however as a precursor to that re examination is there an existing governance context with sufficient conditions and institutional requirements to enable effective adoption lessons what might spanish policy makers learn from a governance context with mature water markets that could inform effective adoption policy transfer finally is there a targeted set of lessons that policy makers could focus on to help improve spain s water governance and expand the total set of management options for mitigating and adapting to future climate change the main aim of this paper is to develop and apply a policy transfer framework that can be used to draw lessons for spanish water marketing arrangements from alternative contexts where water markets are in more advanced stages of development the key innovation of this framework is its focus on transferability between contexts rather than on the examination of parallel independent cases that is typically found in the literature we test our framework using as a benchmark for the comparison lesson drawing and policy transfer from the murray darling basin water market in australia where water markets have been operating for over 30 years and now include sophisticated instruments such as forward contracting and extended leases bayer and loch 2017 the objective of the comparison is a set of governance lessons for spanish policy makers which identifies market barriers institutional investment opportunities and key focal points for progressing water marketing development we view these insights as critical for successful adaptation to growing water scarcity as spain continues to experience increasing demand diminishing and inelastic supply more frequent and intense droughts growing competition conflict and increasingly relevant economic costs of management 2 policy transfer theoretical framework policy transfer is defined as a process where the knowledge of policies administrative arrangements institutions and ideas of one political system past or present is applied to the development of similar features in another dolowitz 2000 policy transfer frameworks are concerned with how whether a governance procedure that is successful in one context can be positively transferred or provide lessons e g policy projects programs or best practice to another rose 1991 policy transfer is often linked implicitly to rational policy making however positive or negative impacts on policy success failure are less clear in the literature james and lodge 2003 that said increased complexity and uncertainty underpinning modern governance may motivate policy makers to engage in higher future policy transfer activity evans and davies 1999 recent globalising forces have also increased the scope and intensity of policy transfer activity which can occur via voluntary negotiated or coercive lesson drawing formats dolowitz and marsh 1996 2000 argue that policy transfer typically occurs via the free choices of political actors in the face of an emerging problem or because of dissatisfaction with the status quo more recently dolowitz and marsh 2012 describe the policy transfer framework as a heuristic method providing a basis for empirical investigation as such it is argued that policy transfer can both stimulate or guide policy transformation benson and jordan 2011 past studies appear to focus on soft forms of policy transfer among non state actors under globalisation conditions stone 2012 but significant scope is also suggested for constructivist approaches to policy transfer benson and jordan 2011 to identify what is known what needs to be known and for assessing effective performance and application in the pursuit of positive adaptive institutions to cope with risky and uncertain future water supply conditions we may therefore need to think about adaptive capacity as a key institutional performance metric within dynamic biophysical systems anderies and janssen 2013 in that respect applications of the policy transfer framework to an evaluation of successful economic instruments and their capacity to be adopted in other contexts through comparative analysis appears to have value however while comparative study is recommended for policy transfer in practice few studies adopt the methodology evans 2009 2 1 comparative water market studies comparison studies are evident in many analyses undertaken in the field of water resources research examples include water resource management and policy hurlbert and diaz 2013 poddar et al 2014 water institutions saleth and dinar 2005 water governance arrangements araral and david 2013 grafton et al 2013 heinmiller 2009 indigenous rights to water durette 2010 and river basin management approaches schlager and blomquist 2008 in the area of water market comparisons there are also examples in the literature for example shatanawi and al jayousi 1995 reviewed the options and possibilities for water markets in jordan by comparing cases from chile mexico and california to draw lessons about legislative change requirements institutional restructuring data challenges and water manager farmer reservations about market benefits these same contexts were used to inform water market adoption by developing countries as a means to address future water scarcity issues rosegrant and gazmuri 1995 other lesson drawing examples from comparative water market analyses have determined i key institutional function requirements bjornlund and mckay 2002 marino and kemper 1998 nieuwoudt 2000 ii that relatively few areas have the necessary conditions to support water markets levine et al 2007 iii there are many critical water market development requirements including the need to carefully manage possible third party impacts find common strong links between market approaches and sustainable water governance objectives and develop insights into market differences between contexts bauer 2010 grafton et al 2012 2011 iv the usefulness of water markets for addressing environmental flow needs in different contexts garrick et al 2009 v the importance of high quality economic scientific research and paying attention to the opportunities presented by crises in groundwater markets wheeler et al 2016 vi the relevance of transaction costs on achieving market objectives at both public institutional garrick et al 2013 and private transfer loch et al 2018 levels and vii the key steps needed to implement effective water marketing arrangements wheeler et al 2017 while these fields of research are very interesting and helpful in our understanding of water markets as economic instruments in the taxonomy of policy transfer these studies would be classed as common comparative analyses examining countries localities in simple terms as parallel independent cases rose and mackenzie 1991 as such they do not highlight how positive outcomes from one context e g australia might be applied to achieve similar outcomes in another e g spain as well as opportunities to learn from past failures or assess future outcomes in a policy transfer framework as described by rose 1991 the critical question of whether programs can be transferred between contexts requires more comprehensive analysis focused on water governance principles and water market outcomes 2 2 water governance principles and market outcomes as a basis for policy transfer rey et al 2019 offer a useful critique of the barriers to trade in spanish water markets which include information gaps high transaction costs temporal limitations of trade allowances e g linked to droughts uncertain property rights and unclear conditions under which interregional transfers can occur these barriers pose significant cultural challenges to the implementation of water market governance institutions and principles that adhere to international best practices however several high level organisations have identified opportunities for ex post analysis of policy processes and outcomes to inform governance principles for other contexts to adopt ex ante through partnerships and knowledge transfers global water partnership 2011 oecd 2002 2015 which may present opportunities for change most recently gruère and le böedec 2019 have stated that where countries are interested in navigating pathways to water reform in agriculture governments should continue to improve their water governance systems through relevant scientific and policy research and the setting of evidence based goals while reform pathways are not generalizable some guiding principles based on lessons from other jurisdictions may assist policy makers to increase the likelihood of adoption and implementation of necessary policy change gruère et al 2018 based on good water governance there are many definitions of good water governance the united nations development programme defines water governance as political social economic and administrative systems which regulate the development and management of water resources and service provisions at different levels as reported in baumgartner and pahl wostl 2013 alternatively water governance consists of the processes and institutions mechanisms by which decisions that affect water are made excluding routine management functions e g modelling and water resource outcomes lautze et al 2011 while some governance researchers similarly argue for a separation of water governance process and outcome functions rauschmayer et al 2009 others suggest that both must be analyzed to identify the relevant drivers of change and their positive negative results lópez gunn et al 2013 for the purposes of this paper it is most useful to draw on both these principles of good water governance to create important bases for assessing the state of water governance in a given location and opportunities for improvement lautze et al 2011 pg 3 and a process for evaluating whether the transfer may result in positive policy improvements this provides an analytical foundation for our policy transfer comparison and lesson drawing with respect to water governance market arrangements in spain and clarification of improvement needs under a constructivist approach to identify what is known what needs to be known and assessments of effective adaptation performance and application therefore we propose a framework based firstly on lautze et al s 2011 good water governance qualities which comprise openness and transparency broad participation rule of law predictability and ethics integrity control of corruption this is then linked to grafton et al s 2011 integrated water market framework to evaluate outcomes in the form of institutional foundation requirements economic efficiency and environmental sustainability governance arrangements that underpin water markets are important since they inform the way in which marketing and trade develop and change over time even though good governance does not always lead to good outcomes cleaver and hamada 2010 the combination of good water governance principles and adaptation performance assessment will allow us to identify i key lessons ii links via a constructivist approach to awareness assessment and application and iii future prospective policy evaluation if the mechanisms are transferred between our case study locations below we define and characterize each component of the combined framework and how they interact 3 methods the combined framework results in eight critical effective water governance principles that are grouped using two functions i transparency accountability adaptive capacity participation rule of law which as a group address governance as process gap issues to provide the base institutional foundations as discussed in grafton et al 2011 and ii efficiency environmental sustainability and equity which as a group address governance as outcome gao issues we expand on each of these functions below where markets are accepted by policy makers as an appropriate water demand governance mechanism attempts are often made to adopt existing exogenous institutional arrangements to provide a basis for structuring procedures in the new context the following function descriptors detail ideal governance processes systems to provide transparency information should flow freely within a society with processes and decisions open to scrutiny by the public in practice this requires a demonstrated willingness by governments to share information related to water sector policy legal and regulatory changes development plans water allocation decisions water resources status and uses to achieve accountability governments the private sector and civil society organizations should be answerable to the public or the interests they represent in practice governments and other organizations active in water governance should openly disclose their actions and the results of governance decision making and should practice subsidiarity mandating that decisions be taken at the lowest competent level governments should also undertake actions to reduce corruption and illicit personal gain in water sector decision making for governance mechanisms to achieve adaptive capacity or to assess how redesign might be needed there must be variety in the solutions proposed consistent with the multi level subsidiary participation discussed previously some capacity to learn and autonomously change as required sufficient resources financial human authority in support of objectives and visionary leadership coupled to fair governance practices that provide legitimacy gupta et al 2010 these characteristics will ensure that managers can provide the conditions and mechanisms necessary to reduce people s vulnerabilities to environmental change in terms of participation all relevant stakeholders governmental and non governmental alike should have a voice directly or through intermediate organizations representing their interests throughout the water governance policy formulation and decision making in practice this requires demonstrated willingness by water managers to solicit and consider input from stakeholders in civil society and elected legislators it also requires demonstrated willingness by government leaders to make changes and adjustments on the basis of received advice finally for an effective rule of law predictability all legal frameworks should be fair and enforced impartially in practice decisions should be made in conformity with specified laws practices and procedures with predictability across all stakeholders both internal and external to the process governance outcomes from effective water markets provide useful evaluation criteria following any policy transfer process this is analyzed in relation to three further functions markets are typically described as providing economically efficient re allocation of scarce resources under neoclassical assumptions however other potential efficiencies include political social environmental and cultural goals which need to be balanced against simple economic outcomes it is also essential that governance systems do not impede transfer activity for example minimizing transaction costs will go a long way toward political and economic efficiency and increasing market gains for those that participate loch et al 2018 further although there may be a range of objectives linked to the implementation of water markets one common objective in the literature is environmental sustainability if long term sustainability for water resources is the main objective current and projected water demand should be evaluated against future water use impacts relevant policies should be information and incentive based to manage inevitable social and or economic pressures this can come from accurate market data and research into costs benefits and transitions over time for all stakeholders together with an agreed mechanism for taking risk uncertainty into account see for example state contingent methods for risk assessments in loch et al 2019 finally policy makers typically seek to achieve equity between and among various water interest groups stakeholders and consumers with such trade offs in mind it will be necessary to carefully monitor market uptake and impacts throughout the policy development and implementation process as part of the institutional design process and modification where needed the complete combined comparative evaluation framework is illustrated in table 1 we adopt the above framework to enable our comparative evaluation of the two case study areas i e australia and spain and draw lessons evaluation and lesson drawing are inextricably linked and no lesson s can be drawn without previous comparative analysis a lesson includes judgement about a programme in effect elsewhere and the position of a potential user only if another country is doing better in handling a specific problem can a positive lesson be drawn on the contrary if it is evaluated as doing worse then any lesson will be about what not to do accordingly the dynamic question is whether a policy in effect in one country could work in another in the future rose 2005 where a starting point is an observation of differences between two cases at a given point in time to provide this starting point we benchmark and comparatively assess water market development and performance in the different contexts via a policy diffusion approach stone 1999 the policy diffusion approach takes different national circumstances between countries into account during comparative assessment based on an assumption that policy transfer may arise as a consequence of structural forces following this approach the comparative analysis for our case studies is conducted according to four key stages of lesson drawing defined by rose 1991 i searching for sources of lessons in our case australian markets serve as a source of inspiration for spain ii making a model of how the policy or practice works in situ see section 4 1 iii creating a lesson by assessing what can be extracted from the practice in the exporter jurisdiction to produce the desired results in the importer jurisdiction section 4 2 and iv prospective evaluation of the way in which the policy or practice is likely to work in the importer jurisdiction including any adaptions needed to make it work section 4 3 in this regard rose 1993 pg 118 notes that a major task in lesson drawing is to identify the prospect of whether policy lessons can be transferred from one place to another this is incorporated into the analytical framework by scoring each of the function criteria above for the spanish transfer context in terms of importance for effective market function and amenability to change for instance although changes to administrative capacity may be classified as a priority because they are relatively easy to accommodate in the governance process such changes may not be absolutely essential for the effective function of water markets and hence in the final scoring that may attract a medium importance rating we illustrate this model in fig 1 as a means of detailing the process involved and then introduce the two case study sites below 4 results 4 1 stage 2 modelling australia versus spain as case studies before the detailed comparison is undertaken it will be necessary to first describe the policy transfer contexts to make a model which will determine their broad comparability and suitability for further examination with respect to each evaluation item a complete set of data is provided in appendix a which should be read in conjunction with the paper to ensure a full set of data is appreciated as both a basis for the comparisons policy transfer contexts and scoring processes undertaken at the later stages of the methodology however for the purposes of the paper table 2 offers a summary of outcomes for the two countries the between country comparison shows areas of commonality and difference as expected importantly the two contexts are comparable across all of the evaluation criteria and in situ data can be extracted in every instance which enables a model to be constructed in turn this allows us to draw lessons for policy makers in the importer country i e spain as discussed below 4 2 stage 3 lesson drawing a comparison of conditions mechanisms instruments and ultimate outcomes between the exporter and importer countries enables lessons to be drawn for each evaluation criteria in the governance as a process gap and governance as an outcome gao sets the full data set for the two context assessments and criteria scoring are contained in appendix a online here we summarize the main lessons lesson gap1 existing use s should be recorded to ensure total water use is on the register and matched with renewable and accessible resources the register should be updated to account for dozers i e un under used rights in the system this is because once markets are implemented and the potential gains from trade revealed dozers water may be activated and transferred between users if sufficient matching resources cannot be identified regulators may have to cancel sleeper dozer rights ahead of marketization to ensure resource caps are not breached lesson gap2 online readily available and transparent information on trade prices and volumes is needed to know who s selling how much and at what price recent issues with poor data in australia have highlighted the opportunity for price manipulation and misleading conduct by brokers to the detriment of users loch et al 2021 ideally all data is centrally held checked and managed to avoid manipulative outcomes and provide confidence in price signals and trade movements e g avoid bubbles and limit speculation in this regard the spanish law helpfully allows for two alternative market settings spot markets and exchange centres the latter being a clearinghouse where all trade is centrally managed by the public sector and related information is made publicly available exchange centres would address the need for accessible and public trading information possibly after paying a fee to the public sector more transparency is also needed for spot markets for exchanges in spot markets river basin authorities are informed and they have two months to approve else the law of positive silence applies given the limited administrative capacity of river basin authorities it would be useful to make trading requests public including information on volumes traded and exchange prices thus allowing any interested party to be informed and heard prior to the formal approval this raises the question of what s preferable a public centralized trading clearinghouse that constrains every agent to trade through such clearinghouse gathering and offering timely information on prices and quantities at the relevant level irrigation district catchment basin or multiple local spot markets without the involvement of regulatory administration in the trades in either scenario providing all traders with a unique identifier available only to them and offered by a central regulatory body is instrumental to limiting market manipulation and price inflation deflation in the market lesson gap3 supervision of trading to prevent upstream consumption of return flows at the expense of downstream uses is necessary to avoid equity issues but may involve non trivial processing charges one option to reduce processing costs is to automatically reduce trading to the consumed fraction huffaker 2008 which may have considerable economic costs pérez blanco et al 2020 on the other hand hydrologic basin models that distinguish between recoverable committed and non recoverable uncommitted return flows could allow higher economic surplus what is critical for trade is a common ontology for water terms and conditions that are applied nationally and possibly wider where relevant for international catchments for example clear water accounting that distinguishes uncommitted non recoverable from committed recoverable return flows is needed to maximize benefits from trade this is not apparent in australia or spain and would improve outcomes significantly for administration user comprehension and discussions around reform clear accounting also allows capacity for centralized administration to effect better control processing and monitoring and achieve recognition and visibility of public interests lesson gap4 the law in both countries reflects best international practice and detection is improving with the use of remote sensing techniques and data the issue is not the law regulatory power or technical issues regarding detection it is enforcement on the ground via sufficient resources administrative capacity and well structured frameworks for prosecution and conviction in spain it is necessary to reduce water theft and informal water use non authorized uses that are known and tolerated by water authorities by establishing a clear limit to the overall amount of water that can be used in a given area to achieve more effective enforcement of existing entitlements in australia a future issue will be increased penalties for unlawful use loch et al 2020 lesson gap5 understanding nested systems and natural limits is key particularly in mature basins where supply is inelastic and cannot accommodate additional use recognizing and incorporating resource limits to accommodate high uncertainty randall 1981 will be key particularly with respect to water loch et al 2019 if supply risk uncertainty is not properly factored into market prices through supply system management arrangements and forward planning e g possible future restrictions on agricultural production growth and or perennial commodities which require water in all states extreme price fluctuations and speculation may occur as seen recently in australia these impacts can have significant negative effects on market confidence and outcomes lesson gap6 an environmental regulator or institution that supervises environmental impacts should have a role in the oversight evaluation of water trading the role of this institution could be further strengthened through recognition of legal rights of water bodies e g rivers as legal persons entitlements should also be periodically updated to account for changes in irrigation efficiency so that water consumption cannot be increased at the expense of third parties through the adoption of hi tech systems and equity does not decrease between users this would discourage investments in irrigation systems that expand consumption at the expense of other users through reduced recoverable return flows but needs not discourage investments that expand consumption at the expense of non recoverable return flows water flowing to a sink such as the sea or a saline aquifer or non beneficial consumption such as evapotranspiration by weeds as before this lesson is relevant for effective recognition of public interests lesson gap7 water trading options are dynamic and should be revised as the market progresses towards a mature state wheeler et al 2017 in early development stages market power by public agents monopsony monopoly setting can be exerted for arbitrage gains via monopolistic monopsonist practices gómez limón et al 2020 gutiérrez martín et al 2020 curbing market power enhances allocative efficiency while raising public revenue towards financing market setup e g restoring the balance in overallocated basins movement toward a mature market may see increased use of derivatives option contracts etc as confidence experience and trader expertise grows lesson gap8 water rights should be defined as shares over the available pool of resources instead of absolute entitlements as the pool of resources reduces increases in dry wet years the water entitlement changes accordingly adopting shares and security levels introduces certainty on the reliability of the supply being traded and can favour capitalization of the farm towards higher yield and profit high security or avoid unintended risky investments and capital loss low security lesson gap9 shares need to be clearly set with regards to an observable indicator e g water stored in a reservoir and not decided at the discretion of an institution as it is done at present in spain with drought management further users should be informed made aware of the relative shares that relate to each type of security on offer e g high reliability rights versus lower reliability rights if as happens in australia higher reliability rights require a majority of storage volume to achieve security e g 70 of dam volume then this will impact water availability equity for others and how they assess their future supply risk lesson gap10 water can be reallocated independent of land as long as resources are in the same hydrological unit and no third party impacts are predicted but where impacts are observed allocative choices should be rapidly reverted to ensure hydrological integrity lesson gap11 entitlement shares are similar in both countries although de jure all water in both countries belongs to the public and private uses can be cancelled where needed used rights are de facto granted in perpetuity with little evidence of cancellation while rights in perpetuity are useful for investment certainty it is advisable to hold some form of cancellation power in reserve as a means to ensuring compliance with regulations and change requirements especially with respect to future scarcity drivers and needs for climate change adjustment for the governance as an output gao set we can further observe lesson gao1a a wide and deep trading base e g high volume of trade volume and price variation is necessary to develop the economies of scale that lead to successful market outcomes price signalling and effective efficient transfers between users in australia although initially not supported by irrigators water markets are now a well entrenched risk management tool that most would want to retain that said recent price signalling has been non transparent due to the inclusion of unregulated brokers and unidentifiable trade activity these issues must be managed to ensure confidence and transparency in market activity for effective adaptation lesson gao1b breadth of trade enables two positives capital injections to agriculture and other industries from a variety of sources enabling greater risk spreading and greater efficiency in trade as values and prices attached to water are tested and enlarged if individually identifiable correct price signals will also enable analysis of trade sources and drivers to ensure accurate market understanding lesson gao2 good price signals come from central registries trade platforms that are overseen by strong regulation and independent authorities this enables ease of access to real price signals and avoids manipulative opportunities as discussed in lesson gao1a b lesson gao3 water markets can be used as a tool for raising revenue towards achieving public policy goals particularly during the transition to full fledged water markets in the case of spain water institutions can deploy water markets where the state buys water at low prices and sells at high prices this makes it possible to raise resources to increase environmental flows at a lower price than would be observed in full fledged water markets gómez limón et al 2020 in australia both environmental and commercial users pay water fees and this ensures the costs of water management continue to be met after the reallocation of resources between user groups lesson gao4 gains from trade including positive indirect impacts on third parties not involved in trading e g food sector should be periodically assessed and reported both to ensure greater engagement by non adopting users and identifying positives from regulator decision making it is also necessary to assess and report on the negative externalities of trade to ensure costs can be incorporated into prices i e improved equity lesson gao5 it is necessary to develop instruments that prevent mitigate negative third party impacts from trading e g impacts of reduced environmental flows on threatened species including exit fees to minimize negative impacts from stranded assets or compensation mechanisms that reallocate trade surpluses through taxes lesson gao6 address any remaining third party impacts ahead of full fledged market establishment this can be done through buyback programs and or early stage of market development benefiting from a monopoly monopsony setting to restore the balance in overallocated basins at low or even zero cost if any additional costs emerge charges or fees may be added to water trades to recover at least a part of the associated costs this process must be reassessed over time as new third party impacts are identified e g salinity in australia lesson gao7 environmental flows are protected in accordance to eu laws but often are not enforced market fees could be used to incorporate the costs of overallocation into the market price to limit recover the costs of over abstraction markets can also introduce flexibility to acquire sell environmental flows where there are punctual needs e g pulse flows to conserve restore critical ecosystems or in cases where regulated flows have been unrealized taking the lessons above into account we are now able to move to the final stage of our analysis which involves a scoring and evaluation of both their importance for effective implementation and continuation of water markets in the importer country i e spain and the potential amenability of that country to the changes required the score values partly based on data contained in the appendix materials inform our final view of the usefulness of lesson drawing and policy transfer in this case 4 3 stage 4 prospective evaluation table 3 summarizes our scoring evaluation of important market conditions and spanish amenability to change in support of water markets as shown most of the water governance criteria included in the assessment have a medium or high importance to effective water marketing only the number of options available in a market is assessed as having low importance where at a minimum seasonal spot or temporary and long term permanent rights transfers should be available options and futures trade products are of lesser relevance our assessment of spain s amenability to change in support of meeting those water market governance arrangements is more mixed among the gop elements the transparency criterion can be realistically met to support water markets leveraging on clearly defined and publicly available central registers which provide a sound basis for trading management and simplifies the gathering of trading data the accountability criterion can be also met in a relatively straightforward way building on a sound legislation body that clearly recognizes the priority of the public interest above all other private uses and makes public participation compulsory in every major policy reform further the rule of law criterion is mostly amenable to change towards supporting water markets although some challenges may arise including in the definition of security levels agricultural users a low priority after higher priority urban and environmental uses frequently experience water restrictions during droughts but these restrictions are based on a solidarity principle same percentage reduction in water use among irrigators within the same catchment establishing high or low security rights in a formal way based on seniority is likely to face considerable opposition among farmers who have planned ahead e g investments in irrigation modernization or permanent crops based on the pre existing legal doctrine different lower legal security levels could be adopted for newly granted rights although their role would be marginal given that spanish basins are closed or closing issuing water rights in perpetuity is also challenging since water users in spain are never granted the property right over water which ultimately belongs to the public but rather the right to use it in practice though the right to use water is automatically renewed provided effective use continues providing a sufficient degree of predictability to support market development achieving accountability also presents challenges notwithstanding exemplar and clearly established administrative and legal principles for example trade that negatively affects third parties should be banned according to the law but the rule of positive silence and limited administrative capacity to supervise all exchanges has often negatively affected the environmental quantitative and qualitative status of water bodies in addition infrastructure to enhance inter basin connectivity has bypassed traditional and centralized coordination exerted by river basin authorities creating non trivial and deeply embedded inter regional conflicts known as spanish water wars these wars have negatively affected coordination between central regional and basin administration and lowered equity among users all the above negatively affects the hydrological integrity of water bodies regarding adaptive capacity a major challenge for market adoption relates to the definition of entitlements as unit shares as discussed above for the security levels water use rights in spain are issued in absolute terms and although restrictions during droughts are common users particularly farmers typically perceive these as water storage and delivery system failures that can be addressed through additional better infrastructure rather than accepted and managed through economic and regulatory instruments changing this paradigm will be costly and arriving at a point where uncertainty is acknowledged through water right shares that can be adjusted to the vagaries of the water cycle and climate will take time among the gao elements we can see that water markets are likely to lead to a satisfactory performance in terms of equity in part due to some of the issues noted above lack of security levels solidarity based response to droughts improved third party outcomes etc sustainability performance is less satisfactory mainly due to the accountability issues that threaten hydrological integrity which may lead to non trivial third party impacts where upstream systems grow at the expense of downstream users notably the environment finally while efficiency from a neoclassical economics standpoint would be expected to increase sharply following market adoption due to a number of factors see table 3 institutional efficiency is rather low due to the manifold barriers to reform identified for the gop elements above priority use inter regional conflicts etc and as in australia may take time to fully emerge low institutional efficiency may also affect capacity to achieve balanced outcomes e g higher market gains at the expense of poor environmental performance thus if sustainability objectives are to be met institutional reform towards market adoption will involve in its early stages non trivial transaction costs including time although the australian case suggests transaction costs related to market adoption can be reduced over time loch et al 2018 ad hoc studies for the spanish case will be needed to monitor institutional efficiency effectiveness 5 discussion and conclusions this study has made a first attempt of testing lesson drawing approaches to water market reform in spain using information from the murray darling basin australia the results reported here provide a preliminary comparative analysis framework as well as some early findings about key lessons and policy transfer potential to stimulate and enhance spanish water markets with respect to our research questions we have determined that australia s mature water market does enable other contexts to draw effective adoption lessons particularly in the case of spain where several key similarities exist further after taking due account of relevant differences in time institutional and country characteristics it is considered that spain could certainly benefit from australia s experiences with water markets and lessons learned over the last 30 years in this regard policy transfer directions on market adoption and institutional reform are assessed as extremely valuable to spain as the blueprint country for other eu nations this suggests spain s water governors can draw insight from the australian cases to the benefit of improved future adaptive capacity in their national water resources spanish water governors will face challenges though including the provision of formal and perpetual water rights in support of effective transfers subsidiarity problems between different levels of administration which have caused hydrological uncertainty for future use users which in turn drives issues around costly and continuing preferences for infrastructure supply side solutions over demand side water marketing our study demonstrates that with respect to the key adaptive capacity evaluation criteria specified above spain could benefit from the wider adoption of market mechanisms in favour of increased future reallocation objectives that will be necessary as scarcity increases further as shown here future supply uncertainty regardless of infrastructure decisions taken today will continue to accumulate and must be successfully mitigated by spanish water governors for effective adaptive capacity outcomes this will require reform as detailed above but where considerable existing expertise competence and faculty are evident in current spanish arrangements see table 3 ultimately individual and sectoral adaptation to supply constraints are more readily achieved via market instruments than slow unwieldy central planning or governance arrangements especially when there is a need to address rapid or continuing supply shortages and a requirement to reallocate resources in response it is this motivation for change that will drive future consideration of water markets as an instrument for resource reallocation where as we have seen equity concerns can also be achieved as climate impacts increase this need will become more urgent in our view spain is therefore well placed to adopt water markets despite current political efforts to prohibit such institutions and could begin that transition on the basis of the lessons provided by this study for future adaptation gains a starting point for this change could involve the wider discussion of its findings and recommendations by all relevant stakeholders in the spanish context or at the very least a representative context with pressing scarcity reallocation requirements to achieve feedback on our suggestions for reform and to map a pathway forward as this research team involves members from both countries they would be willing to design that process and undertake it in a willing context that would answer our final research question related to targeted management options for addressing future scarcity and adaptation requirements nevertheless the framework is still in its early stages many questions must be addressed to support its further development as a basis for better understanding water governance in specific situations and as a diagnostic tool for interventions that support better outcomes from water markets

9821,the transfer of successful water market governance between international settings is increasingly attractive to policy makers under globalization this paper tests lesson drawing approaches to water market governance transfers using data from spain and the murray darling basin australia spain is the blueprint country for water market adoption in europe while australia is often presented as a world leader in innovative water market arrangements a preliminary comparative analysis framework linking water market governance principles to observed institutional arrangements and outcomes is provided finally some key lessons problems and policy transfer potential to stimulate and enhance spanish water markets from lesson drawing approaches are drawn with an emphasis on adaptive capacity as an institutional performance metric we find that spain s current water governance institutions and arrangements offer a solid platform for marketing reform where some key adaptive capacity constraints are able to be addressed the lessons drawn from this study highlight those areas of change which while challenging can be achieved in our view keywords water markets policy transfer lesson drawing spain and australia 1 introduction the impacts of future climate change and demand growth on water supplies are already present in our social ecological systems extreme weather events natural disasters biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse and water crises suggest a need for policy makers to redouble climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts world economic forum 2019 to address water crises through climate change mitigation and adaptation investment policy makers face two main choices supply side e g engineering instruments to expand water availability and demand side e g economic instruments to modulate demand while most suitable locations for additional large scale engineering infrastructure have already been exploited world bank 2010 there are also rising concerns about relationships between additional storage and increased consumption di baldassarre et al 2018 such concerns have also been raised in discussions surrounding the adoption of efficient irrigation technology as a means of saving water for applications elsewhere see for example adamson and loch 2014 gómez and pérez blanco 2014 thus while supply side instruments may be politically expedient and popular with policy makers development investors they may not be sufficient on their own to mitigate climate change impacts further common supply side instrument implementation within poor water accounting frameworks often with fixed site benefit characteristics suggest a lower likelihood of effective climate change adaptation better management of water demand is thus essential for adaptation to climate induced changes in water resources and water management challenges this intimates that prudent policy makers will explore and increasingly couple demand side with supply side arrangements in the management of scarce water resources demand side instruments include regulatory instruments such as quotas and security differentiated water rights and economic instruments such as pricing and charges user subsidies drought insurance non pecuniary cooperative agreements payment for ecosystem services and water markets all offer a range of investment choices for policy makers to achieve climate change mitigation and adaptation outcomes however the successful design and implementation of demand side instruments in water management contexts involves high transaction costs wide institutional change collective action at different levels and non trivial economic impacts on users gomez et al 2018 among economic instruments water markets are particularly costly to design and implement loch and mciver 2013 wheeler et al 2017 however over time water markets have proven their capacity to respond to water scarcity impacts see for example bauer 2010 connor et al 2011 saliba 1987 wheeler et al 2015 wittwer and griffith 2011 in europe spain has pioneered the adoption of economic instruments in general and water markets in particular becoming a blueprint nation for other member states who wish to employ economic instruments for over 20 years spain has implemented private private and public private i e buyback water markets in sites of high demand pressure using a wide array of institutional settings ranging from public tenders and clearinghouses to bilateral agreements among users however in comparison to other contexts with long term market structures spain s water market activity remains narrow immature and heavily linked to drought events montilla lópez et al 2018 palomo hierro et al 2015 in a context of increasing water scarcity competition and heightened supply uncertainty it may be prudent for spain s policy makers to re examine water markets as an economic instrument with a high probability of future usefulness however as a precursor to that re examination is there an existing governance context with sufficient conditions and institutional requirements to enable effective adoption lessons what might spanish policy makers learn from a governance context with mature water markets that could inform effective adoption policy transfer finally is there a targeted set of lessons that policy makers could focus on to help improve spain s water governance and expand the total set of management options for mitigating and adapting to future climate change the main aim of this paper is to develop and apply a policy transfer framework that can be used to draw lessons for spanish water marketing arrangements from alternative contexts where water markets are in more advanced stages of development the key innovation of this framework is its focus on transferability between contexts rather than on the examination of parallel independent cases that is typically found in the literature we test our framework using as a benchmark for the comparison lesson drawing and policy transfer from the murray darling basin water market in australia where water markets have been operating for over 30 years and now include sophisticated instruments such as forward contracting and extended leases bayer and loch 2017 the objective of the comparison is a set of governance lessons for spanish policy makers which identifies market barriers institutional investment opportunities and key focal points for progressing water marketing development we view these insights as critical for successful adaptation to growing water scarcity as spain continues to experience increasing demand diminishing and inelastic supply more frequent and intense droughts growing competition conflict and increasingly relevant economic costs of management 2 policy transfer theoretical framework policy transfer is defined as a process where the knowledge of policies administrative arrangements institutions and ideas of one political system past or present is applied to the development of similar features in another dolowitz 2000 policy transfer frameworks are concerned with how whether a governance procedure that is successful in one context can be positively transferred or provide lessons e g policy projects programs or best practice to another rose 1991 policy transfer is often linked implicitly to rational policy making however positive or negative impacts on policy success failure are less clear in the literature james and lodge 2003 that said increased complexity and uncertainty underpinning modern governance may motivate policy makers to engage in higher future policy transfer activity evans and davies 1999 recent globalising forces have also increased the scope and intensity of policy transfer activity which can occur via voluntary negotiated or coercive lesson drawing formats dolowitz and marsh 1996 2000 argue that policy transfer typically occurs via the free choices of political actors in the face of an emerging problem or because of dissatisfaction with the status quo more recently dolowitz and marsh 2012 describe the policy transfer framework as a heuristic method providing a basis for empirical investigation as such it is argued that policy transfer can both stimulate or guide policy transformation benson and jordan 2011 past studies appear to focus on soft forms of policy transfer among non state actors under globalisation conditions stone 2012 but significant scope is also suggested for constructivist approaches to policy transfer benson and jordan 2011 to identify what is known what needs to be known and for assessing effective performance and application in the pursuit of positive adaptive institutions to cope with risky and uncertain future water supply conditions we may therefore need to think about adaptive capacity as a key institutional performance metric within dynamic biophysical systems anderies and janssen 2013 in that respect applications of the policy transfer framework to an evaluation of successful economic instruments and their capacity to be adopted in other contexts through comparative analysis appears to have value however while comparative study is recommended for policy transfer in practice few studies adopt the methodology evans 2009 2 1 comparative water market studies comparison studies are evident in many analyses undertaken in the field of water resources research examples include water resource management and policy hurlbert and diaz 2013 poddar et al 2014 water institutions saleth and dinar 2005 water governance arrangements araral and david 2013 grafton et al 2013 heinmiller 2009 indigenous rights to water durette 2010 and river basin management approaches schlager and blomquist 2008 in the area of water market comparisons there are also examples in the literature for example shatanawi and al jayousi 1995 reviewed the options and possibilities for water markets in jordan by comparing cases from chile mexico and california to draw lessons about legislative change requirements institutional restructuring data challenges and water manager farmer reservations about market benefits these same contexts were used to inform water market adoption by developing countries as a means to address future water scarcity issues rosegrant and gazmuri 1995 other lesson drawing examples from comparative water market analyses have determined i key institutional function requirements bjornlund and mckay 2002 marino and kemper 1998 nieuwoudt 2000 ii that relatively few areas have the necessary conditions to support water markets levine et al 2007 iii there are many critical water market development requirements including the need to carefully manage possible third party impacts find common strong links between market approaches and sustainable water governance objectives and develop insights into market differences between contexts bauer 2010 grafton et al 2012 2011 iv the usefulness of water markets for addressing environmental flow needs in different contexts garrick et al 2009 v the importance of high quality economic scientific research and paying attention to the opportunities presented by crises in groundwater markets wheeler et al 2016 vi the relevance of transaction costs on achieving market objectives at both public institutional garrick et al 2013 and private transfer loch et al 2018 levels and vii the key steps needed to implement effective water marketing arrangements wheeler et al 2017 while these fields of research are very interesting and helpful in our understanding of water markets as economic instruments in the taxonomy of policy transfer these studies would be classed as common comparative analyses examining countries localities in simple terms as parallel independent cases rose and mackenzie 1991 as such they do not highlight how positive outcomes from one context e g australia might be applied to achieve similar outcomes in another e g spain as well as opportunities to learn from past failures or assess future outcomes in a policy transfer framework as described by rose 1991 the critical question of whether programs can be transferred between contexts requires more comprehensive analysis focused on water governance principles and water market outcomes 2 2 water governance principles and market outcomes as a basis for policy transfer rey et al 2019 offer a useful critique of the barriers to trade in spanish water markets which include information gaps high transaction costs temporal limitations of trade allowances e g linked to droughts uncertain property rights and unclear conditions under which interregional transfers can occur these barriers pose significant cultural challenges to the implementation of water market governance institutions and principles that adhere to international best practices however several high level organisations have identified opportunities for ex post analysis of policy processes and outcomes to inform governance principles for other contexts to adopt ex ante through partnerships and knowledge transfers global water partnership 2011 oecd 2002 2015 which may present opportunities for change most recently gruère and le böedec 2019 have stated that where countries are interested in navigating pathways to water reform in agriculture governments should continue to improve their water governance systems through relevant scientific and policy research and the setting of evidence based goals while reform pathways are not generalizable some guiding principles based on lessons from other jurisdictions may assist policy makers to increase the likelihood of adoption and implementation of necessary policy change gruère et al 2018 based on good water governance there are many definitions of good water governance the united nations development programme defines water governance as political social economic and administrative systems which regulate the development and management of water resources and service provisions at different levels as reported in baumgartner and pahl wostl 2013 alternatively water governance consists of the processes and institutions mechanisms by which decisions that affect water are made excluding routine management functions e g modelling and water resource outcomes lautze et al 2011 while some governance researchers similarly argue for a separation of water governance process and outcome functions rauschmayer et al 2009 others suggest that both must be analyzed to identify the relevant drivers of change and their positive negative results lópez gunn et al 2013 for the purposes of this paper it is most useful to draw on both these principles of good water governance to create important bases for assessing the state of water governance in a given location and opportunities for improvement lautze et al 2011 pg 3 and a process for evaluating whether the transfer may result in positive policy improvements this provides an analytical foundation for our policy transfer comparison and lesson drawing with respect to water governance market arrangements in spain and clarification of improvement needs under a constructivist approach to identify what is known what needs to be known and assessments of effective adaptation performance and application therefore we propose a framework based firstly on lautze et al s 2011 good water governance qualities which comprise openness and transparency broad participation rule of law predictability and ethics integrity control of corruption this is then linked to grafton et al s 2011 integrated water market framework to evaluate outcomes in the form of institutional foundation requirements economic efficiency and environmental sustainability governance arrangements that underpin water markets are important since they inform the way in which marketing and trade develop and change over time even though good governance does not always lead to good outcomes cleaver and hamada 2010 the combination of good water governance principles and adaptation performance assessment will allow us to identify i key lessons ii links via a constructivist approach to awareness assessment and application and iii future prospective policy evaluation if the mechanisms are transferred between our case study locations below we define and characterize each component of the combined framework and how they interact 3 methods the combined framework results in eight critical effective water governance principles that are grouped using two functions i transparency accountability adaptive capacity participation rule of law which as a group address governance as process gap issues to provide the base institutional foundations as discussed in grafton et al 2011 and ii efficiency environmental sustainability and equity which as a group address governance as outcome gao issues we expand on each of these functions below where markets are accepted by policy makers as an appropriate water demand governance mechanism attempts are often made to adopt existing exogenous institutional arrangements to provide a basis for structuring procedures in the new context the following function descriptors detail ideal governance processes systems to provide transparency information should flow freely within a society with processes and decisions open to scrutiny by the public in practice this requires a demonstrated willingness by governments to share information related to water sector policy legal and regulatory changes development plans water allocation decisions water resources status and uses to achieve accountability governments the private sector and civil society organizations should be answerable to the public or the interests they represent in practice governments and other organizations active in water governance should openly disclose their actions and the results of governance decision making and should practice subsidiarity mandating that decisions be taken at the lowest competent level governments should also undertake actions to reduce corruption and illicit personal gain in water sector decision making for governance mechanisms to achieve adaptive capacity or to assess how redesign might be needed there must be variety in the solutions proposed consistent with the multi level subsidiary participation discussed previously some capacity to learn and autonomously change as required sufficient resources financial human authority in support of objectives and visionary leadership coupled to fair governance practices that provide legitimacy gupta et al 2010 these characteristics will ensure that managers can provide the conditions and mechanisms necessary to reduce people s vulnerabilities to environmental change in terms of participation all relevant stakeholders governmental and non governmental alike should have a voice directly or through intermediate organizations representing their interests throughout the water governance policy formulation and decision making in practice this requires demonstrated willingness by water managers to solicit and consider input from stakeholders in civil society and elected legislators it also requires demonstrated willingness by government leaders to make changes and adjustments on the basis of received advice finally for an effective rule of law predictability all legal frameworks should be fair and enforced impartially in practice decisions should be made in conformity with specified laws practices and procedures with predictability across all stakeholders both internal and external to the process governance outcomes from effective water markets provide useful evaluation criteria following any policy transfer process this is analyzed in relation to three further functions markets are typically described as providing economically efficient re allocation of scarce resources under neoclassical assumptions however other potential efficiencies include political social environmental and cultural goals which need to be balanced against simple economic outcomes it is also essential that governance systems do not impede transfer activity for example minimizing transaction costs will go a long way toward political and economic efficiency and increasing market gains for those that participate loch et al 2018 further although there may be a range of objectives linked to the implementation of water markets one common objective in the literature is environmental sustainability if long term sustainability for water resources is the main objective current and projected water demand should be evaluated against future water use impacts relevant policies should be information and incentive based to manage inevitable social and or economic pressures this can come from accurate market data and research into costs benefits and transitions over time for all stakeholders together with an agreed mechanism for taking risk uncertainty into account see for example state contingent methods for risk assessments in loch et al 2019 finally policy makers typically seek to achieve equity between and among various water interest groups stakeholders and consumers with such trade offs in mind it will be necessary to carefully monitor market uptake and impacts throughout the policy development and implementation process as part of the institutional design process and modification where needed the complete combined comparative evaluation framework is illustrated in table 1 we adopt the above framework to enable our comparative evaluation of the two case study areas i e australia and spain and draw lessons evaluation and lesson drawing are inextricably linked and no lesson s can be drawn without previous comparative analysis a lesson includes judgement about a programme in effect elsewhere and the position of a potential user only if another country is doing better in handling a specific problem can a positive lesson be drawn on the contrary if it is evaluated as doing worse then any lesson will be about what not to do accordingly the dynamic question is whether a policy in effect in one country could work in another in the future rose 2005 where a starting point is an observation of differences between two cases at a given point in time to provide this starting point we benchmark and comparatively assess water market development and performance in the different contexts via a policy diffusion approach stone 1999 the policy diffusion approach takes different national circumstances between countries into account during comparative assessment based on an assumption that policy transfer may arise as a consequence of structural forces following this approach the comparative analysis for our case studies is conducted according to four key stages of lesson drawing defined by rose 1991 i searching for sources of lessons in our case australian markets serve as a source of inspiration for spain ii making a model of how the policy or practice works in situ see section 4 1 iii creating a lesson by assessing what can be extracted from the practice in the exporter jurisdiction to produce the desired results in the importer jurisdiction section 4 2 and iv prospective evaluation of the way in which the policy or practice is likely to work in the importer jurisdiction including any adaptions needed to make it work section 4 3 in this regard rose 1993 pg 118 notes that a major task in lesson drawing is to identify the prospect of whether policy lessons can be transferred from one place to another this is incorporated into the analytical framework by scoring each of the function criteria above for the spanish transfer context in terms of importance for effective market function and amenability to change for instance although changes to administrative capacity may be classified as a priority because they are relatively easy to accommodate in the governance process such changes may not be absolutely essential for the effective function of water markets and hence in the final scoring that may attract a medium importance rating we illustrate this model in fig 1 as a means of detailing the process involved and then introduce the two case study sites below 4 results 4 1 stage 2 modelling australia versus spain as case studies before the detailed comparison is undertaken it will be necessary to first describe the policy transfer contexts to make a model which will determine their broad comparability and suitability for further examination with respect to each evaluation item a complete set of data is provided in appendix a which should be read in conjunction with the paper to ensure a full set of data is appreciated as both a basis for the comparisons policy transfer contexts and scoring processes undertaken at the later stages of the methodology however for the purposes of the paper table 2 offers a summary of outcomes for the two countries the between country comparison shows areas of commonality and difference as expected importantly the two contexts are comparable across all of the evaluation criteria and in situ data can be extracted in every instance which enables a model to be constructed in turn this allows us to draw lessons for policy makers in the importer country i e spain as discussed below 4 2 stage 3 lesson drawing a comparison of conditions mechanisms instruments and ultimate outcomes between the exporter and importer countries enables lessons to be drawn for each evaluation criteria in the governance as a process gap and governance as an outcome gao sets the full data set for the two context assessments and criteria scoring are contained in appendix a online here we summarize the main lessons lesson gap1 existing use s should be recorded to ensure total water use is on the register and matched with renewable and accessible resources the register should be updated to account for dozers i e un under used rights in the system this is because once markets are implemented and the potential gains from trade revealed dozers water may be activated and transferred between users if sufficient matching resources cannot be identified regulators may have to cancel sleeper dozer rights ahead of marketization to ensure resource caps are not breached lesson gap2 online readily available and transparent information on trade prices and volumes is needed to know who s selling how much and at what price recent issues with poor data in australia have highlighted the opportunity for price manipulation and misleading conduct by brokers to the detriment of users loch et al 2021 ideally all data is centrally held checked and managed to avoid manipulative outcomes and provide confidence in price signals and trade movements e g avoid bubbles and limit speculation in this regard the spanish law helpfully allows for two alternative market settings spot markets and exchange centres the latter being a clearinghouse where all trade is centrally managed by the public sector and related information is made publicly available exchange centres would address the need for accessible and public trading information possibly after paying a fee to the public sector more transparency is also needed for spot markets for exchanges in spot markets river basin authorities are informed and they have two months to approve else the law of positive silence applies given the limited administrative capacity of river basin authorities it would be useful to make trading requests public including information on volumes traded and exchange prices thus allowing any interested party to be informed and heard prior to the formal approval this raises the question of what s preferable a public centralized trading clearinghouse that constrains every agent to trade through such clearinghouse gathering and offering timely information on prices and quantities at the relevant level irrigation district catchment basin or multiple local spot markets without the involvement of regulatory administration in the trades in either scenario providing all traders with a unique identifier available only to them and offered by a central regulatory body is instrumental to limiting market manipulation and price inflation deflation in the market lesson gap3 supervision of trading to prevent upstream consumption of return flows at the expense of downstream uses is necessary to avoid equity issues but may involve non trivial processing charges one option to reduce processing costs is to automatically reduce trading to the consumed fraction huffaker 2008 which may have considerable economic costs pérez blanco et al 2020 on the other hand hydrologic basin models that distinguish between recoverable committed and non recoverable uncommitted return flows could allow higher economic surplus what is critical for trade is a common ontology for water terms and conditions that are applied nationally and possibly wider where relevant for international catchments for example clear water accounting that distinguishes uncommitted non recoverable from committed recoverable return flows is needed to maximize benefits from trade this is not apparent in australia or spain and would improve outcomes significantly for administration user comprehension and discussions around reform clear accounting also allows capacity for centralized administration to effect better control processing and monitoring and achieve recognition and visibility of public interests lesson gap4 the law in both countries reflects best international practice and detection is improving with the use of remote sensing techniques and data the issue is not the law regulatory power or technical issues regarding detection it is enforcement on the ground via sufficient resources administrative capacity and well structured frameworks for prosecution and conviction in spain it is necessary to reduce water theft and informal water use non authorized uses that are known and tolerated by water authorities by establishing a clear limit to the overall amount of water that can be used in a given area to achieve more effective enforcement of existing entitlements in australia a future issue will be increased penalties for unlawful use loch et al 2020 lesson gap5 understanding nested systems and natural limits is key particularly in mature basins where supply is inelastic and cannot accommodate additional use recognizing and incorporating resource limits to accommodate high uncertainty randall 1981 will be key particularly with respect to water loch et al 2019 if supply risk uncertainty is not properly factored into market prices through supply system management arrangements and forward planning e g possible future restrictions on agricultural production growth and or perennial commodities which require water in all states extreme price fluctuations and speculation may occur as seen recently in australia these impacts can have significant negative effects on market confidence and outcomes lesson gap6 an environmental regulator or institution that supervises environmental impacts should have a role in the oversight evaluation of water trading the role of this institution could be further strengthened through recognition of legal rights of water bodies e g rivers as legal persons entitlements should also be periodically updated to account for changes in irrigation efficiency so that water consumption cannot be increased at the expense of third parties through the adoption of hi tech systems and equity does not decrease between users this would discourage investments in irrigation systems that expand consumption at the expense of other users through reduced recoverable return flows but needs not discourage investments that expand consumption at the expense of non recoverable return flows water flowing to a sink such as the sea or a saline aquifer or non beneficial consumption such as evapotranspiration by weeds as before this lesson is relevant for effective recognition of public interests lesson gap7 water trading options are dynamic and should be revised as the market progresses towards a mature state wheeler et al 2017 in early development stages market power by public agents monopsony monopoly setting can be exerted for arbitrage gains via monopolistic monopsonist practices gómez limón et al 2020 gutiérrez martín et al 2020 curbing market power enhances allocative efficiency while raising public revenue towards financing market setup e g restoring the balance in overallocated basins movement toward a mature market may see increased use of derivatives option contracts etc as confidence experience and trader expertise grows lesson gap8 water rights should be defined as shares over the available pool of resources instead of absolute entitlements as the pool of resources reduces increases in dry wet years the water entitlement changes accordingly adopting shares and security levels introduces certainty on the reliability of the supply being traded and can favour capitalization of the farm towards higher yield and profit high security or avoid unintended risky investments and capital loss low security lesson gap9 shares need to be clearly set with regards to an observable indicator e g water stored in a reservoir and not decided at the discretion of an institution as it is done at present in spain with drought management further users should be informed made aware of the relative shares that relate to each type of security on offer e g high reliability rights versus lower reliability rights if as happens in australia higher reliability rights require a majority of storage volume to achieve security e g 70 of dam volume then this will impact water availability equity for others and how they assess their future supply risk lesson gap10 water can be reallocated independent of land as long as resources are in the same hydrological unit and no third party impacts are predicted but where impacts are observed allocative choices should be rapidly reverted to ensure hydrological integrity lesson gap11 entitlement shares are similar in both countries although de jure all water in both countries belongs to the public and private uses can be cancelled where needed used rights are de facto granted in perpetuity with little evidence of cancellation while rights in perpetuity are useful for investment certainty it is advisable to hold some form of cancellation power in reserve as a means to ensuring compliance with regulations and change requirements especially with respect to future scarcity drivers and needs for climate change adjustment for the governance as an output gao set we can further observe lesson gao1a a wide and deep trading base e g high volume of trade volume and price variation is necessary to develop the economies of scale that lead to successful market outcomes price signalling and effective efficient transfers between users in australia although initially not supported by irrigators water markets are now a well entrenched risk management tool that most would want to retain that said recent price signalling has been non transparent due to the inclusion of unregulated brokers and unidentifiable trade activity these issues must be managed to ensure confidence and transparency in market activity for effective adaptation lesson gao1b breadth of trade enables two positives capital injections to agriculture and other industries from a variety of sources enabling greater risk spreading and greater efficiency in trade as values and prices attached to water are tested and enlarged if individually identifiable correct price signals will also enable analysis of trade sources and drivers to ensure accurate market understanding lesson gao2 good price signals come from central registries trade platforms that are overseen by strong regulation and independent authorities this enables ease of access to real price signals and avoids manipulative opportunities as discussed in lesson gao1a b lesson gao3 water markets can be used as a tool for raising revenue towards achieving public policy goals particularly during the transition to full fledged water markets in the case of spain water institutions can deploy water markets where the state buys water at low prices and sells at high prices this makes it possible to raise resources to increase environmental flows at a lower price than would be observed in full fledged water markets gómez limón et al 2020 in australia both environmental and commercial users pay water fees and this ensures the costs of water management continue to be met after the reallocation of resources between user groups lesson gao4 gains from trade including positive indirect impacts on third parties not involved in trading e g food sector should be periodically assessed and reported both to ensure greater engagement by non adopting users and identifying positives from regulator decision making it is also necessary to assess and report on the negative externalities of trade to ensure costs can be incorporated into prices i e improved equity lesson gao5 it is necessary to develop instruments that prevent mitigate negative third party impacts from trading e g impacts of reduced environmental flows on threatened species including exit fees to minimize negative impacts from stranded assets or compensation mechanisms that reallocate trade surpluses through taxes lesson gao6 address any remaining third party impacts ahead of full fledged market establishment this can be done through buyback programs and or early stage of market development benefiting from a monopoly monopsony setting to restore the balance in overallocated basins at low or even zero cost if any additional costs emerge charges or fees may be added to water trades to recover at least a part of the associated costs this process must be reassessed over time as new third party impacts are identified e g salinity in australia lesson gao7 environmental flows are protected in accordance to eu laws but often are not enforced market fees could be used to incorporate the costs of overallocation into the market price to limit recover the costs of over abstraction markets can also introduce flexibility to acquire sell environmental flows where there are punctual needs e g pulse flows to conserve restore critical ecosystems or in cases where regulated flows have been unrealized taking the lessons above into account we are now able to move to the final stage of our analysis which involves a scoring and evaluation of both their importance for effective implementation and continuation of water markets in the importer country i e spain and the potential amenability of that country to the changes required the score values partly based on data contained in the appendix materials inform our final view of the usefulness of lesson drawing and policy transfer in this case 4 3 stage 4 prospective evaluation table 3 summarizes our scoring evaluation of important market conditions and spanish amenability to change in support of water markets as shown most of the water governance criteria included in the assessment have a medium or high importance to effective water marketing only the number of options available in a market is assessed as having low importance where at a minimum seasonal spot or temporary and long term permanent rights transfers should be available options and futures trade products are of lesser relevance our assessment of spain s amenability to change in support of meeting those water market governance arrangements is more mixed among the gop elements the transparency criterion can be realistically met to support water markets leveraging on clearly defined and publicly available central registers which provide a sound basis for trading management and simplifies the gathering of trading data the accountability criterion can be also met in a relatively straightforward way building on a sound legislation body that clearly recognizes the priority of the public interest above all other private uses and makes public participation compulsory in every major policy reform further the rule of law criterion is mostly amenable to change towards supporting water markets although some challenges may arise including in the definition of security levels agricultural users a low priority after higher priority urban and environmental uses frequently experience water restrictions during droughts but these restrictions are based on a solidarity principle same percentage reduction in water use among irrigators within the same catchment establishing high or low security rights in a formal way based on seniority is likely to face considerable opposition among farmers who have planned ahead e g investments in irrigation modernization or permanent crops based on the pre existing legal doctrine different lower legal security levels could be adopted for newly granted rights although their role would be marginal given that spanish basins are closed or closing issuing water rights in perpetuity is also challenging since water users in spain are never granted the property right over water which ultimately belongs to the public but rather the right to use it in practice though the right to use water is automatically renewed provided effective use continues providing a sufficient degree of predictability to support market development achieving accountability also presents challenges notwithstanding exemplar and clearly established administrative and legal principles for example trade that negatively affects third parties should be banned according to the law but the rule of positive silence and limited administrative capacity to supervise all exchanges has often negatively affected the environmental quantitative and qualitative status of water bodies in addition infrastructure to enhance inter basin connectivity has bypassed traditional and centralized coordination exerted by river basin authorities creating non trivial and deeply embedded inter regional conflicts known as spanish water wars these wars have negatively affected coordination between central regional and basin administration and lowered equity among users all the above negatively affects the hydrological integrity of water bodies regarding adaptive capacity a major challenge for market adoption relates to the definition of entitlements as unit shares as discussed above for the security levels water use rights in spain are issued in absolute terms and although restrictions during droughts are common users particularly farmers typically perceive these as water storage and delivery system failures that can be addressed through additional better infrastructure rather than accepted and managed through economic and regulatory instruments changing this paradigm will be costly and arriving at a point where uncertainty is acknowledged through water right shares that can be adjusted to the vagaries of the water cycle and climate will take time among the gao elements we can see that water markets are likely to lead to a satisfactory performance in terms of equity in part due to some of the issues noted above lack of security levels solidarity based response to droughts improved third party outcomes etc sustainability performance is less satisfactory mainly due to the accountability issues that threaten hydrological integrity which may lead to non trivial third party impacts where upstream systems grow at the expense of downstream users notably the environment finally while efficiency from a neoclassical economics standpoint would be expected to increase sharply following market adoption due to a number of factors see table 3 institutional efficiency is rather low due to the manifold barriers to reform identified for the gop elements above priority use inter regional conflicts etc and as in australia may take time to fully emerge low institutional efficiency may also affect capacity to achieve balanced outcomes e g higher market gains at the expense of poor environmental performance thus if sustainability objectives are to be met institutional reform towards market adoption will involve in its early stages non trivial transaction costs including time although the australian case suggests transaction costs related to market adoption can be reduced over time loch et al 2018 ad hoc studies for the spanish case will be needed to monitor institutional efficiency effectiveness 5 discussion and conclusions this study has made a first attempt of testing lesson drawing approaches to water market reform in spain using information from the murray darling basin australia the results reported here provide a preliminary comparative analysis framework as well as some early findings about key lessons and policy transfer potential to stimulate and enhance spanish water markets with respect to our research questions we have determined that australia s mature water market does enable other contexts to draw effective adoption lessons particularly in the case of spain where several key similarities exist further after taking due account of relevant differences in time institutional and country characteristics it is considered that spain could certainly benefit from australia s experiences with water markets and lessons learned over the last 30 years in this regard policy transfer directions on market adoption and institutional reform are assessed as extremely valuable to spain as the blueprint country for other eu nations this suggests spain s water governors can draw insight from the australian cases to the benefit of improved future adaptive capacity in their national water resources spanish water governors will face challenges though including the provision of formal and perpetual water rights in support of effective transfers subsidiarity problems between different levels of administration which have caused hydrological uncertainty for future use users which in turn drives issues around costly and continuing preferences for infrastructure supply side solutions over demand side water marketing our study demonstrates that with respect to the key adaptive capacity evaluation criteria specified above spain could benefit from the wider adoption of market mechanisms in favour of increased future reallocation objectives that will be necessary as scarcity increases further as shown here future supply uncertainty regardless of infrastructure decisions taken today will continue to accumulate and must be successfully mitigated by spanish water governors for effective adaptive capacity outcomes this will require reform as detailed above but where considerable existing expertise competence and faculty are evident in current spanish arrangements see table 3 ultimately individual and sectoral adaptation to supply constraints are more readily achieved via market instruments than slow unwieldy central planning or governance arrangements especially when there is a need to address rapid or continuing supply shortages and a requirement to reallocate resources in response it is this motivation for change that will drive future consideration of water markets as an instrument for resource reallocation where as we have seen equity concerns can also be achieved as climate impacts increase this need will become more urgent in our view spain is therefore well placed to adopt water markets despite current political efforts to prohibit such institutions and could begin that transition on the basis of the lessons provided by this study for future adaptation gains a starting point for this change could involve the wider discussion of its findings and recommendations by all relevant stakeholders in the spanish context or at the very least a representative context with pressing scarcity reallocation requirements to achieve feedback on our suggestions for reform and to map a pathway forward as this research team involves members from both countries they would be willing to design that process and undertake it in a willing context that would answer our final research question related to targeted management options for addressing future scarcity and adaptation requirements nevertheless the framework is still in its early stages many questions must be addressed to support its further development as a basis for better understanding water governance in specific situations and as a diagnostic tool for interventions that support better outcomes from water markets

9822,fallow winter wheat triticum aestivum l f w is the major cropping system for wheat production on the loess plateau of china integrating forage crops into the summer fallow season could improve crop yield water productivity and rainwater use efficiency but this process is limited by the inter and intra annual variable precipitation a 3 year 2016 2019 field experiment was conducted on the loess plateau to investigate the effects of fallow winter wheat oat avena sativa winter wheat o w soybean glycine max winter wheat s w and vetch vicia sativa winter wheat v w systems on dry matter yield water use water productivity and precipitation use efficiency under three interannual rainfall scenarios a 30 decrease in rainfall r 30 normal rainfall ck and a 30 increase in rainfall r 30 by a rainfall collection redistribution device in 2017 2018 under the ck scenario the f w o w s w and v w system wheat yields were 3 39 3 63 4 30 and 3 24 t ha 1 respectively and the system yield values were 11 28 16 72 16 40 and 14 27 t ha 1 respectively compared to the ck scenario the f w o w s w and v w system yields increased by 22 9 34 5 20 4 and 33 8 in 2016 2017 under the r 30 scenario but the system water productivity decreased by 19 9 41 8 19 6 and 32 4 in 2017 2018 under the r 30 scenario compared to those of the f w system the o w s w and v w system yields significantly increased by 48 2 45 4 and 26 5 respectively and the system water productivity increased by 51 5 47 3 and 25 17 respectively in 2017 2018 under the ck scenario the system precipitation use efficiency also increased by 29 3 42 9 and 28 9 in 2018 2019 under the r 30 scenario across the three growing seasons the f w system had the highest wheat yield in the dry growing season the s w system had the highest dry matter yield water productivity and precipitation use efficiency in the normal and wet growing seasons therefore we recommend the f w system for local farmers when considering saving more soil water and maintaining wheat yield in the dry growing season in normal and wet growing seasons we recommend the s w system for local farmers considering that the system increases productivity and improves environmental sustainability keywords precipitation variability forage winter wheat system yield water productivity precipitation use efficiency 1 introduction the total world population will reach 9 5 billion in 2050 which means that there will be a substantial increase in the demand for food and animal products delgado et al 2021 tilman et al 2011 therefore farmers need to explore sustainable and efficient cropping systems to improve crop production from limited arable land the planting of forage cover crops in the fallow season is a potential alternative practice for maintaining grain production and increasing system productivity and this process is widely used in many arid and semiarid regions of the world delgado et al 2021 guillaume et al 2021 johnathon et al 2021 the loess plateau is one of the most vital cereal production regions in china it covers approximately 64 million hectares supports approximately 100 million people and plays an important role in ensuring regional food security chen et al 2015 winter wheat is the dominant grain crop occupying 44 of the cultivatable area summer fallow winter wheat is the most common cropping system in this area and more than 60 of precipitation occurs in the summer fallow season sun et al 2018a b xue et al 2019 therefore the primary factor limiting winter wheat production is unevenly distributed precipitation however another problem is the lower precipitation storage efficiency in the summer fallow period which is mainly due to the high temperature of the summer fallow season that causes soil water loss by evaporation jin et al 2018 the southern coast of china is feasible for desalination to produce supplementary water but this is not suitable for agricultural production in the loess plateau region panagopoulos and haralambous 2020 panagopoulos 2021 therefore an effective reduction of soil water evaporation and the storage of rainfall during the fallow season are crucial for winter production on the loess plateau the integration of forage cover crops into summer fallow winter wheat systems is an alternative practice for increasing soil surface coverage reducing soil water evaporation maintaining grain production and improving system productivity in many semiarid regions delgado et al 2021 nielsen et al 2017 holman et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the planting of pulse crops in the fallow season increased the winter wheat yield in the southern region of the loess plateau zhang et al 2015 however decreased wheat yields have been reported after soybean planting on the central loess plateau he et al 2016 these contradictory results are due to the variable and uneven distribution of precipitation in the summer fallow and wheat growing seasons therefore it is necessary to explore how the planting of forage crops in fallow seasons affects subsequent wheat yield under variable rainfall scenarios on the loess plateau there are many approaches to simulate rainfall variation in crop production such as crop models multiyear field experiments and rainfall simulations in the laboratory these methods simulate precipitation are not able to mimic the real distribution of precipitation frequency and intensity which leads to a lack of universality of the results under simulated rainfall conditions ali et al 2018 partson et al 2021 yang et al 2018 in recent years many scholars have used rainout shelters to simulate variable precipitation conditions which is the best way to achieve rainfall variation in terms of frequency and intensity in the field and this approach has been widely used to research grassland productivity plant diversity and soil respiration in ecosystems luo et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 thus we attempted to use rainout shelters to simulate three rainfall scenarios in each year to explore the effects of planting forage cover crops during the fallow season on wheat grain production under variable rainfall scenarios short season annual forage crops such as oat soybean and vetch have advantages such as fast growth and high quality and can be easily implemented in summer fallow seasons nielsen et al 2015 zhang et al 2018b therefore we conducted 3 yr field experiments to evaluate the productivity performance of the oat soybean and vetch forage winter wheat systems under three rainout shelter simulated rainfall scenarios this study aims to 1 evaluate the f w fallow winter wheat o w oat winter wheat s w soybean winter wheat and v w vetch winter wheat system productivity under three inter and intra annual rainfall scenarios and 2 evaluate the f w o w s w and v w system water use water productivity and precipitation use efficiency under three inter and intra annual rainfall scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the field experiment was carried out at the qingyang experimental station of lanzhou university 35 40 n 107 51 e altitude 1298 m from july 2016 to june 2019 the station is located in xifeng county gansu province on the western part of the loess plateau it has a warm temperate and continental monsoon climate where winter wheat is the major grain crop based on long term meteorological data 1961 2015 the average temperature is 9 5ºc the average annual precipitation is 535 mm and 58 3 of the precipitation falls during the summer fallow season july to september fig 1 shows the monthly precipitation and air temperature during the three experimental years the annual precipitation was 530 mm 714 mm and 652 mm in 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 respectively and the average air temperature was 11 3 10 3 and 9 7 respectively in the three growing seasons the soil type at the experimental site is sandy loam the average bulk density of the 0 200 cm soil layer was 1 35 g cm 3 the ph was 8 6 the total nitrogen was 0 85 g kg 1 the organic matter content was 10 28 g kg 1 and the field capacity was 28 6 at the beginning of the experiment 2 2 experimental design and management this experiment involved 12 treatments under a completely randomized design with three replicates the 12 treatments included two factors 1 four cropping systems and 2 three interannual rainfall scenarios the four cropping systems were 1 fallow winter wheat triticum aestivum f w local traditional cropping system 2 oat avena sativa winter wheat o w 3 soybean glycine max winter wheat s w and 4 vetch vicia sativa winter wheat v w fig 2 shows the four cropping systems across three growing seasons from july 2016 to june 2019 three interannual rainfall scenarios were a 30 decrease in rainfall r 30 normal rainfall ck and a 30 increase in rainfall r 30 using a rainfall collection redistribution device to achieve the three rainfall scenarios zhu and cui 2019 arredondo et al 2020 the r 30 scenario consisted of a metal frame with a 9 m2 3 m 3 m rainout shelter the top rainout shelter covering included 9 u shaped clear bands 3 m long 10 cm in diameter covering an area of 2 7 m2 to intercept 30 of the incoming rainfall thus the shelter bottom reduced natural rainfall by 30 a water storage tank 150 l was used to collect the intercepted incoming rainfall and then a water conduit was used to distribute the water to another plot the 30 increase in rainfall scenario the u shaped clear bands inevitably affected the solar radiation and soil temperature in the plots in our study compared to the bare plots there was no significant difference in soil and air temperature in the rainout shelter bottom however the rainout shelter bottom radiation at the noon was reduced 8 and this reduction radiation did not have a significant influence on crop growth li et al 2010 under good weather conditions we cleaned the rain trough dust once every 7 days after rain or sand we also immediately cleaned the rain trough dust during the summer fallow season july to september the three forage crops oat soybean and vetch were sown in july and harvested at the flowering stage the three forage crops were sown with a row spacing of 20 cm and the distance between soybean plants was 25 cm in late september winter wheat was seeded at 225 kg ha 1 with a row spacing of 20 cm the planting date harvest date fertilization rate and seeding rate for the forage crops and winter wheat are shown in table 1 2 3 data collection and measurements 2 3 1 precipitation type the drought index di was used to classify the system precipitation type as wet normal or dry based on the following equation guo et al 2012 1 d i p m σ where p is the system precipitation in the growing season m is the long term average precipitation and σ is the standard deviation of the long term precipitation the system dry normal and wet growing seasons were classified according to di 0 35 0 35 di 0 35 and di 0 35 respectively similarly the summer fallow season and winter wheat growing season precipitation types were also classified by the di 2 3 2 yield the yields of the three forage crops were determined from a 1 m2 area in the centre of the plots at the flowering stage winter wheat was harvested at maturity and five 1 m long rows of plants 0 75 m2 area were used to measure the grain and biomass yield all samples were oven dried for half an hour at 105 c to kill the fresh tissue and then dried at 75 c to a constant weight 2 3 3 soil water content during the forage crops and winter wheat growing seasons the soil water content 0 300 cm interval 20 cm was measured using an auger at sowing and harvesting the soil samples were oven dried at 105 c to a constant weight to determine the soil water content

precipitation variation on system productivity this study found that integrating forage crops into the summer fallow season significantly enhanced system productivity and the system yield was significantly affected by the yearly and monthly intra and interannual rainfall variations in the dry growing season of 2018 2019 under the r 30 scenario oat soybean and vetch planting in the fallow season significantly enhanced the system dry matter yield and the s w system had the highest dry matter yield similarly planting rape forage in the fallow season increased the system dry matter production by 28 3 in northwestern china deng et al 2020 therefore in terms of system dry matter yield s w had greater advantages in dry growing seasons however wheat yield is another aspect that should not be neglected in forage wheat systems compared to the f w system although the o w and v w systems enhanced the system dry matter yield they decreased the subsequent winter wheat grain yield the main reason was that oat and vetch depleted the amount of soil water in the fallow season thus wheat yield had an advantage in fallow wheat systems under dry climate conditions however the s w system not only produced forage but also did not influence the winter wheat grain yield therefore we recommend the s w system in dry growing seasons when considering both forage production and wheat yield in the normal growing season of 2016 2017 under the ck scenario integrating oat soybean and vetch into the fallow season enhanced the system dry matter yield and the s w system had the highest dry matter yield compared to the f w system the o w and v w systems decreased the subsequent winter wheat grain yield however the s w system not only increased the system dry matter yield but also did not influence the winter wheat grain yield therefore we also recommend the s w system in the normal growing season when considering both forage production and wheat yield however in another normal growing season the r 30 scenario in 2017 2018 compared to the f w system the o w s w and v w systems did not influence subsequent wheat production the main reason is the heavy rainfall in october and april similarly owing to heavy rains during the winter wheat growing season the planting of cover crops in the fallow season did not affect subsequent wheat yields he et al 2016 therefore variable precipitation and uneven distribution were the main factors influencing forage winter wheat system production on the loess plateau in the wet growing season of 2018 2019 under the ck scenario the s w system still had the highest dry matter yield therefore in terms of system dry matter yield s w was recommended as an alternate cropping system in the wet growing season in this study we also found that the o w system had the highest forage yield in the dry normal and wet growing seasons which means that the o w system had forage production advantages on the loess plateau of china komarek et al 2015 also found that the forage yield in the m w fo maize wheat forage oat system was higher than that in the m w fv maize wheat forage vetch and fs w forage soybean wheat fallow systems in semiarid regions other studies also showed that the cereal forage yield was higher than the pulse crop yield 4 2 impact of precipitation variation on water productivity and precipitation use efficiency integrating forage crops into the summer fallow season significantly enhanced system water productivity in the dry growing season of 2018 2019 under the r 30 scenario the o w and s w systems had the highest water productivity therefore in terms of system water productivity the o w and s w systems had greater advantages in dry growing seasons li et al 2000 found that the planting of cover crops in the fallow season also enhanced the system water productivity in the western region of the loess plateau however the summer fallow period is an important time to store more water for subsequent crop growth and production in many semiarid regions thus the planting of forage crops in the summer fallow season should be considered for storing more soil water in the present study integrating forage crops into the fallow season significantly decreased the soil water storage at the wheat planting stage nielsen et al 2017 also found that planting forage triticale during the fallow season decreased the soil water storage at wheat planting on the northern great plains the o w system had the lowest soil water storage at the wheat planting stage which means that oat depleted the amount of soil water in the fallow season therefore the s w and v w systems are more suitable when considering storing more soil water for subsequent crop growth therefore we recommend the s w system in the dry growing season when considering both forage water use and system water productivity in the normal growing season of 2016 2017 under the ck scenario integrating oat and soybean into the fallow season significantly enhanced the system water productivity and the s w system had the highest water productivity therefore we also recommend the s w system in the normal growing season however in another normal growing season the r 30 scenario in 2017 2018 the o w system had the highest system water productivity the main reason was that the system water use did not differ among the f w s w o w and v w systems similarly zhang and wang 2018 also found that the planting of pulse crops did not influence system water use but it did increase system water productivity in dryland areas in the wet growing season of 2018 2019 under the ck and r 30 scenarios the s w system still had the highest water productivity therefore we recommend the s w system in the wet growing season when considering system water productivity precipitation is the only water source during forage and winter wheat growing seasons and a higher precipitation use efficiency could have advantages for forage and winter wheat production on the loess plateau in the present study integrating forage crops into the fallow season significantly enhanced the fallow season and system precipitation use efficiency the s w system had the highest precipitation use efficiency in the dry the r 30 scenario in 2018 2019 normal the ck scenario in 2016 2017 and wet the ck scenario in 2018 2019 growing seasons therefore in terms of system precipitation use efficiency the s w system had greater advantages on the loess plateau of china deng et al 2020 also found that the planting of forage species in the fallow season significantly enhanced system precipitation use efficiency many scholars have also advocated integrating pulse crops into summer fallow seasons to enhance system precipitation use efficiency in semiarid regions 4 3 implications for climate change summer fallow winter wheat is one of the major cropping systems on the loess plateau and incorporating forage crops into the summer fallow period could enhance system productivity and water productivity however with climate change the intra and interannual precipitation are variable and the future precipitation shows an increasing trend on the loess plateau cui et al 2020 sun et al 2018a b in this study we conducted 3 year field experiments to evaluate the effects of integrating three forage crops into the fallow season on system productivity and water productivity under three simulated rainfall scenarios decreased normal and increased precipitation scenarios the s w o w and v w system dry matter yields were higher than those of the f w system but the f w and s w systems had the highest wheat yield advantages under dry growing seasons therefore we recommend the f w system to maintain a high wheat yield under dry conditions under normal and wet conditions the s w system not only increased wheat yield but also increased forage yield therefore the s w system had the yield advantages in normal and wet climates many scholars also agree with integrating pulse crops into grain production systems in semiarid regions gan et al 2015 liu et al 2020 therefore we recommend the s w system under normal and wet conditions when considering the maintenance of forage and wheat yields and an increase in environmental sustainability in a rainfed region nitrogen is another factor that determines crop yield and more experiments should be conducted to investigate forage wheat system yield under different fertilizer treatments and different rainfall conditions 5 conclusions a 3 year field experiment showed that integrating forage crops into the summer fallow season under continuous wheat cropping significantly enhanced system productivity water productivity and precipitation use efficiency in the loess plateau in 2017 2018 under the r 30 scenario the f w o w s w and v w system yields were 11 00 15 88 14 56 and 12 85 t ha 1 respectively and the system wheat yields were 3 14 3 46 3 71 and 3 00 t ha 1 respectively while the system forage yields were 0 00 4 70 3 18 and 2 07 t ha 1 respectively the system water use values were 349 366 345 and 350 mm in 2016 2017 under the r 30 scenario the s w system had the highest water productivity 2 22 kg m 3 and precipitation use efficiency 2 27 kg m 3 in 2018 2019 under the r 30 scenario across the three growing seasons the f w system had the highest wheat yield 2 43 t ha 1 and the s w system had the highest dry matter yield 7 80 t ha 1 water productivity 2 26 kg m 3 and precipitation use efficiency 2 10 kg m 3 in the dry growing seasons under dry conditions the o w system had higher forage yield 3 69 t ha 1 compared to f w system the o w system yield was increased by 18 0 but the system wheat yield decreased by 49 2 which was mainly due to the oat depleted amount of soil water in the summer fallow season therefore the s w system had the highest system yield water productivity and precipitation use efficiency in the dry growing seasons with climate change precipitation exhibits greater variability and future precipitation shows an increasing trend on the loess plateau cma climate change centre 2021 the s w system had greater advantages for winter wheat yield system productivity water productivity and precipitation use efficiency in normal and wet climates therefore we recommend the s w system for local farmers under normal and wet conditions

9822,fallow winter wheat triticum aestivum l f w is the major cropping system for wheat production on the loess plateau of china integrating forage crops into the summer fallow season could improve crop yield water productivity and rainwater use efficiency but this process is limited by the inter and intra annual variable precipitation a 3 year 2016 2019 field experiment was conducted on the

rainfall collection redistribution device in 2017 2018 under the ck scenario the f w o w s w and v w system wheat yields were 3 39 3 63 4 30 and 3 24 t ha 1 respectively and the system yield values were 11 28 16 72 16 40 and 14 27 t ha 1 respectively compared to the ck scenario the f w o w s w and v w system yields increased by 22 9 34 5 20 4 and 33 8 in 2016 2017 under the r 30 scenario but the system water productivity decreased by 19 9 41 8 19 6 and 32 4 in 2017 2018 under the r 30 scenario compared to those of the f w system the o w s w and v w system yields significantly increased by 48 2 45 4 and 26 5 respectively and the system water productivity increased by 51 5 47 3 and 25 17 respectively in 2017 2018 under the ck scenario the system precipitation use efficiency also increased by 29 3 42 9 and 28 9 in 2018 2019 under the r 30 scenario across the three growing seasons the f w system had the highest wheat yield in the dry growing season the s w system had the highest dry matter yield water productivity and precipitation use efficiency in the normal and wet growing seasons therefore we recommend the f w system for local farmers when considering saving more soil water and maintaining wheat yield in the dry growing season in normal and wet growing seasons we recommend the s w system for local farmers considering that the system increases productivity and improves environmental sustainability keywords precipitation variability forage winter wheat system yield water productivity precipitation use efficiency 1 introduction the total world population will reach 9 5 billion in 2050 which means that there will be a substantial increase in the demand for food and animal products delgado et al 2021 tilman et al 2011 therefore farmers need to explore sustainable and efficient cropping systems to improve crop production from limited arable land the planting of forage cover crops in the fallow season is a potential alternative practice for maintaining grain production and increasing system productivity and this process is widely used in many arid and semiarid regions of the world delgado et al 2021 guillaume et al 2021 johnathon et al 2021 the loess plateau is one of the most vital cereal production regions in china it covers approximately 64 million hectares supports approximately 100 million people and plays an important role in ensuring regional food security chen et al 2015 winter wheat is the dominant grain crop occupying 44 of the cultivatable area summer fallow winter wheat is the most common cropping system in this area and more than 60 of precipitation occurs in the summer fallow season sun et al 2018a b xue et al 2019 therefore the primary factor limiting winter wheat production is unevenly distributed precipitation however another problem is the lower precipitation storage efficiency in the summer fallow period which is mainly due to the high temperature of the summer fallow season that causes soil water loss by evaporation jin et al 2018 the southern coast of china is feasible for desalination to produce supplementary water but this is not suitable for agricultural production in the loess plateau region panagopoulos and haralambous 2020 panagopoulos 2021 therefore an effective reduction of soil water evaporation and the storage of rainfall during the fallow season are crucial for winter production on the loess plateau the integration of forage cover crops into summer fallow winter wheat systems is an alternative practice for increasing soil surface coverage reducing soil water evaporation maintaining grain production and improving system productivity in many semiarid regions delgado et al 2021 nielsen et al 2017 holman et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the planting of pulse crops in the fallow season increased the winter wheat yield in the southern region of the loess plateau zhang et al 2015 however decreased wheat yields have been reported after soybean planting on the central loess plateau he et al 2016 these contradictory results are due to the variable and uneven distribution of precipitation in the summer fallow and wheat growing seasons therefore it is necessary to explore how the planting of forage crops in fallow seasons affects subsequent wheat yield under variable rainfall scenarios on the loess plateau there are many approaches to simulate rainfall variation in crop production such as crop models multiyear field experiments and rainfall simulations in the laboratory these methods simulate precipitation are not able to mimic the real distribution of precipitation frequency and intensity which leads to a lack of universality of the results under simulated rainfall conditions ali et al 2018 partson et al 2021 yang et al 2018 in recent years many scholars have used rainout shelters to simulate variable precipitation conditions which is the best way to achieve rainfall variation in terms of frequency and intensity in the field and this approach has been widely used to research grassland productivity plant diversity and soil respiration in ecosystems luo et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 thus we attempted to use rainout shelters to simulate three rainfall scenarios in each year to explore the effects of planting forage cover crops during the fallow season on wheat grain production under variable rainfall scenarios short season annual forage crops such as oat soybean and vetch have advantages such as fast growth and high quality and can be easily implemented in summer fallow seasons nielsen et al 2015 zhang et al 2018b therefore we conducted 3 yr field experiments to evaluate the productivity performance of the oat soybean and vetch forage winter wheat systems under three rainout shelter simulated rainfall scenarios this study aims to 1 evaluate the f w fallow winter wheat o w oat winter wheat s w soybean winter wheat and v w vetch winter wheat system productivity under three inter and intra annual rainfall scenarios and 2 evaluate the f w o w s w and v w system water use water productivity and precipitation use efficiency under three inter and intra annual rainfall scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the field experiment was carried out at the qingyang experimental station of lanzhou university 35 40 n 107 51 e altitude 1298 m from july 2016 to june 2019 the station is located in xifeng county gansu province on the western part of the loess plateau it has a warm temperate and continental monsoon climate where winter wheat is the major grain crop based on long term meteorological data 1961 2015 the average temperature is 9 5ºc the average annual precipitation is 535 mm and 58 3 of the precipitation falls during the summer fallow season july to september fig 1 shows the monthly precipitation and air temperature during the three experimental years the annual precipitation was 530 mm 714 mm and 652 mm in 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 respectively and the average air temperature was 11 3 10 3 and 9 7 respectively in the three growing seasons the soil type at the experimental site is sandy loam the average bulk density of the 0 200 cm soil layer was 1 35 g cm 3 the ph was 8 6 the total nitrogen was 0 85 g kg 1 the organic matter content was 10 28 g kg 1 and the field capacity was 28 6 at the beginning of the experiment 2 2 experimental design and

rainfall r 30 normal rainfall ck and a 30 increase in rainfall r 30 using a rainfall collection redistribution device to achieve the three rainfall scenarios zhu and cui 2019 arredondo et al 2020 the r 30 scenario consisted of a metal frame with a 9 m2 3 m 3 m rainout shelter the top rainout shelter covering included 9 u shaped clear bands 3 m long 10 cm in diameter covering an area of 2 7 m2 to intercept 30 of the incoming rainfall thus the shelter bottom reduced natural rainfall by 30 a water storage tank 150 l was used to collect the intercepted incoming rainfall and then a water conduit was used to distribute the water to another plot the 30 increase in rainfall scenario the u shaped clear bands inevitably affected the solar radiation and soil temperature in the plots in our study compared to the bare plots there was no significant difference in soil and air temperature in the rainout shelter bottom however the rainout shelter bottom radiation at the noon was reduced 8 and this reduction radiation did not have a significant influence on crop growth li et al 2010 under good weather conditions we cleaned the rain trough dust once every 7 days after rain or sand we also immediately cleaned the rain trough dust during the summer fallow season july to september the three forage crops oat soybean and vetch were sown in july and harvested at the flowering stage the three forage crops were sown with a row spacing of 20 cm and the distance between soybean plants was 25 cm in late september winter wheat was seeded at 225 kg ha 1 with a row spacing of 20 cm the planting date harvest date fertilization rate and seeding rate for the forage crops and winter wheat are shown in table 1 2 3 data collection and measurements 2 3 1 precipitation type the drought index di was used to classify the system precipitation type as wet normal or dry based on the following equation guo et al 2012 1 d i p m σ where p is the system precipitation in the growing season m is the long term average precipitation and σ is the standard deviation of the long term precipitation the system dry normal and wet growing seasons were classified according to di 0 35 0 35 di 0 35 and di 0 35 respectively similarly the summer fallow season and winter wheat growing season precipitation types were also classified by the di 2 3 2 yield the yields of the three forage crops were determined from a 1 m2 area in the centre of the plots at the flowering stage winter wheat was harvested at maturity and five 1 m long rows of plants 0 75 m2 area were used to measure the grain and biomass yield all

scenario in 2018 2019 but the s w system wheat yields were significantly increased by 18 4 26 9 and 27 7 under the r 30 ck and r 30 scenarios in 2017 2018 fig 3 e increasing precipitation significantly improved the forage winter wheat and system yields compared to the ck scenario the o w s w and v w system forage yields increased by 13 2 26 3 and 26 4 respectively under the r 30 scenario in the 2016 2017 growing season fig 3 a 3 4 water use the water use values of the forage winter wheat and the systems were significantly affected by year and rainfall scenario but were not affected by the year rainfall scenario cropping system interaction table 4 the f w o w s w and v w system water uses were not different under the ck scenario in 2017 2018 fig 4 h compared to the f w

and system water use increased with increasing precipitation compared to the ck scenario the forage water use of the o w s w and v w systems increased by 32 9 48 0 and 41 0 respectively under the r 30 scenario in 2018 2019 fig 4 c 3 5 water productivity the water productivity values for forage wheat and the system were significantly affected by year rainfall scenario and cropping system with a significant effect of the year rainfall scenario cropping system interaction for winter wheat table 4 the o w system had the highest water productivity under the r 30 scenario in the 2017 2018 growing seasons fig 5 h compared to the f w system the wheat water productivity in the o w s w and v w systems was significantly increased by 64 9 50 1 and 27 2 under the r 30 scenario in the 2017 2018 growing season fig 5 e the forage water productivity decreased with increasing precipitation compared to the ck scenario the forage water productivity in the o w s w and v w systems increased by 21 1 34 7 and 12 4 respectively under the r 30 scenario in the 2017 2018 growing season fig 5 b 3 6 precipitation use efficiency the precipitation use efficiencies of forage wheat and the system were significantly affected by year rainfall scenario and cropping system with a significant effect of the year rainfall scenario cropping system interaction for winter wheat table 4 o w had the highest system water productivity under r 30 in the 2017 2018 growing season fig 6 h compared to the f w system the winter wheat precipitation use efficiency in the o w s w and v w systems significantly decreased by 28 0 16 6 and 17 3 respectively under the r 30 scenario in the 2016 2017 growing season fig 6 d the forage precipitation use efficiency decreased with increasing precipitation compared to the ck scenario the forage precipitation use efficiency in the o w s w and v w systems increased by 27 1 25 4 and 12 3 respectively in the 2017 2018 growing season fig 6 b 4 discussion 4 1 impact of precipitation variation on system productivity this study found that integrating forage crops into the summer fallow season significantly enhanced system productivity and the system yield was significantly affected by the yearly and monthly intra and interannual rainfall variations in the dry growing season of 2018 2019 under the r 30 scenario oat soybean and vetch planting in the fallow season significantly enhanced the system dry matter yield and the s w system had the highest dry matter yield similarly planting rape forage in the fallow season increased the system dry matter production by 28 3 in northwestern china deng et al 2020 therefore in terms of system dry matter yield s w had greater advantages in dry growing seasons however wheat yield is another aspect that should not be neglected in forage wheat systems compared to the f w system although the o w and v w systems enhanced the system dry matter yield they decreased the subsequent winter wheat grain yield the main reason was that oat and vetch depleted the amount of soil water in the fallow season thus wheat yield had an advantage in fallow wheat systems under dry climate conditions however the s w system not only produced forage but also did not influence the winter wheat grain yield therefore we recommend the s w system in dry growing seasons when considering both forage production and wheat yield in the normal growing season of 2016 2017 under the ck scenario integrating oat soybean and vetch into the fallow season enhanced the system dry matter yield and the s w system had the highest dry matter yield compared to the f w system the o w and v w systems decreased the subsequent winter wheat grain yield however the s w system not only increased the system dry matter yield but also did not influence the winter wheat grain yield therefore we also recommend the s w system in the normal growing season when considering both forage production and wheat yield however in another normal growing season the r 30 scenario in 2017 2018 compared to the f w system the o w s w and v w systems did not influence subsequent wheat production the main reason is the heavy rainfall in october and april similarly owing to heavy rains during the winter wheat growing season the planting of cover crops in the fallow season did not affect subsequent wheat yields he et al 2016 therefore variable precipitation and uneven distribution were the main factors influencing forage winter wheat system production on the loess plateau in the wet growing season of 2018 2019 under the ck scenario the s w system still had the highest dry matter yield therefore in terms of system dry matter yield s w was recommended as an alternate cropping system in the wet growing season in this study we also found that the o w system had the highest forage yield in the dry normal and wet growing seasons which means that the o w system had forage production advantages on the loess plateau of china komarek et al 2015 also found that the forage yield in the m w fo maize wheat forage oat system was higher than that in the m w fv maize wheat forage vetch and fs w forage soybean wheat fallow systems in semiarid regions other studies also showed that the cereal forage yield was higher than the pulse crop yield 4 2 impact of precipitation variation on water productivity and precipitation use efficiency integrating forage crops into the summer fallow season significantly enhanced system water productivity in the dry growing season of 2018 2019 under the r 30 scenario the o w and s w systems had the highest water productivity therefore in terms of system water productivity the o w and s w systems had greater advantages in dry growing seasons li et al 2000 found that the planting of cover crops in the fallow season also enhanced the system water productivity in the western region of the loess plateau however the summer fallow period is an important time to store more water for subsequent crop growth and production in many semiarid regions thus the planting of forage crops in the summer fallow season should be considered for storing more soil water in the present study integrating forage crops into the fallow season significantly decreased the soil water storage at the wheat planting stage nielsen et al 2017 also found that planting forage triticale during the fallow season decreased the soil water storage at wheat planting on the northern great plains the o w system had the lowest soil water storage at the wheat planting stage which means that oat depleted the amount of soil water in the fallow season therefore the s w and v w systems are more suitable when considering storing more soil water for subsequent crop growth therefore we recommend the s w system in the dry growing season when considering both forage water use and system water productivity in the normal growing season of 2016 2017 under the ck scenario integrating oat and soybean into the fallow season significantly enhanced the system water productivity and the s w system had the highest water productivity therefore we also recommend the s w system in the normal growing season however in another normal growing season the r 30 scenario in 2017 2018 the o w system had the highest system water productivity the main reason was that the system water use did not differ among the f w s w o w and v w systems similarly zhang and wang 2018 also found that the planting of pulse crops did not influence system water use but it did increase system water productivity in dryland areas in the wet growing season of 2018 2019 under the ck and r 30 scenarios the s w system still had the highest water productivity therefore we recommend the s w system in the wet growing season when considering system water productivity precipitation is the only water source during forage and winter wheat growing seasons and a higher precipitation use efficiency could have advantages for forage and winter wheat production on the loess plateau in the present study integrating forage crops into the fallow season significantly enhanced the fallow season and system precipitation use efficiency the s w system had the highest precipitation use efficiency in the dry the r 30 scenario in 2018 2019 normal the ck scenario in 2016 2017 and wet the ck scenario in 2018 2019 growing seasons therefore in terms of system precipitation use efficiency the s w system had greater advantages on the loess plateau of china deng et al 2020 also found that the planting of forage species in the fallow season significantly enhanced system precipitation use efficiency many scholars have also advocated integrating pulse crops into summer fallow seasons to enhance system precipitation use efficiency in semiarid regions 4 3 implications for climate change summer fallow winter wheat is one of the major cropping systems on the loess plateau and incorporating forage crops into the summer fallow period could enhance system productivity and water productivity however with climate change the intra and interannual precipitation are variable and the future precipitation shows an increasing trend on the loess plateau cui et al 2020 sun et al 2018a b in this study we conducted 3 year field experiments to evaluate the effects of integrating three forage crops into the fallow season on system productivity and water productivity under three simulated rainfall scenarios decreased normal and increased precipitation scenarios the s w o w and v w system dry matter yields were higher than those of the f w system but the f w and s w systems had the highest wheat yield advantages under dry growing seasons therefore we recommend the f w system to maintain a high wheat yield under dry conditions under normal and wet conditions the s w system not only increased wheat yield but also increased forage yield therefore the s w system had the yield advantages in normal and wet climates many scholars also agree with integrating pulse crops into grain production systems in semiarid regions gan et al 2015 liu et al 2020 therefore we recommend the s w system under normal and wet conditions when considering the maintenance of forage and wheat yields and an increase in environmental sustainability in a rainfed region nitrogen is another factor that determines crop yield and more experiments should be conducted to investigate forage wheat system yield under different fertilizer treatments and different rainfall conditions 5 conclusions a 3 year field experiment showed that integrating forage crops into the summer fallow season under continuous wheat cropping significantly enhanced system productivity water productivity and precipitation use efficiency in the loess plateau in 2017 2018 under the r 30 scenario the f w o w s w and v w system yields were 11 00 15 88 14 56 and 12 85 t ha 1 respectively and the system wheat yields were 3 14 3 46 3 71 and 3 00 t ha 1 respectively while the system forage yields were 0 00 4 70 3 18 and 2 07 t ha 1 respectively the system water use values were 349 366 345 and 350 mm in 2016 2017 under the r 30 scenario the s w system had the highest water productivity 2 22 kg m 3 and precipitation use efficiency 2 27 kg m 3 in 2018 2019 under the r 30 scenario across the three growing seasons the f w system had the highest wheat yield 2 43 t ha 1 and the s w system had the highest dry matter yield 7 80 t ha 1 water productivity 2 26 kg m 3 and precipitation use efficiency 2 10 kg m 3 in the dry growing seasons under dry conditions the o w system had higher forage yield 3 69 t ha 1 compared to f w system the o w system yield was increased by 18 0 but the system wheat yield decreased by 49 2 which was mainly due to the oat depleted amount of soil water in the summer fallow season therefore the s w system had the highest system yield water productivity and precipitation use efficiency in the dry growing seasons with climate change precipitation exhibits greater variability and future precipitation shows an increasing trend on the loess plateau cma climate change centre 2021 the s w system had greater advantages for winter wheat yield system productivity water productivity and precipitation use efficiency in normal and wet climates therefore we recommend the s w system for local farmers under normal and wet conditions

9823,evapotranspiration et is an important parameter for crop growth monitoring and land surface modeling this paper proposed a new workflow namely esvep rf to calculate et during the crop growing season using modis data by combining the advantages of the trapezoidal model and random forest rf algorithm in esvep rf the endmember based soil and vegetation energy partitioning esvep model was first used to calculate a series of parameters from modis and meteorological inputs and then all parameters derived from remote sensing data meteorological data and esvep models were used as inputs to the rf algorithm for latent heat flux le calculation in situ data of 12 years 2003 2012 2018 and 2019 from five flux towers located in nebraska ne and michigan mi were used to test the performance of esvep rf and results showed that esvep rf had great potential to accurately calculate et when the number of training samples was sufficient and representative in 2010 and 2011 r2 of le were around 0 8 and rmse were around 70 w m2 which outperformed original esvep model results this indicated that the rf algorithm could better describe the non linear correlation between in lst fvc space endmembers and le among all parameters lai plev and r vw had high contribution with percentage importance of 18 49 15 71 and 13 57 respectively furthermore all samples between 2003 and 2012 collected from the three ne sites were used to train rf models and then calculate le for both ne and mi sites in 2018 and 2019 in ne sites rmse was around 65 w m2 and r2 was around 0 8 in mi sites it was noted that no samples from these sites were included in the training data set and rmse was around 70 w m2 and r2 was higher than 0 7 these results showed the potential of esvep rf for providing up to date et information keywords et remote sensing esvep machine learning nebraska 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is the loss of water from the land surface to atmosphere which is a key component in water cycle and energy balance systems burt et al 2005 di 1991 farahani et al 2007 moran et al 1994 pereira et al 2015 additionally et is also a major hydrological variable in agricultural applications since accurate et calculation provides important information for crop growth monitoring and crop yield prediction allen et al 2007 anderson et al 2007 knipper et al 2020 usgs 2010 wang and dickinson 2012 remote sensing based methods have been widely used for cropland et calculation and monitoring from regional to global scale jéffersonde et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 knipper et al 2020 liu et al 2019 mu et al 2007 2011 xue et al 2020 yu et al 2019 and can be categorized into three groups based on their principles 1 surface energy balance methods 2 surface water balance methods and 3 land surface temperature lst fractional vegetation cover fvc feature space methods carlson 2007 li et al 2009 senay 2008 su 1988 among these methods lst fvc feature space methods are advantageous in et calculation because they avoid complex aerodynamic and land surface resistance parameterization required for other methods jiang et al 2009 kimball and running 2016 leng et al 2017 the hypothesis of the lst fvc feature space methods is that remotely sensed lst and fvc of all clear sky pixels in an image could be used to generate a two dimensional space and the envelope of these pixels could constitute a physically meaningful triangle or trapezoid carlson 2007 the edges of the triangle or trapezoid represent extreme wet dry situations in the image and the vertices are called dry wet endmembers consequently one challenge in using the lst fvc methods to calculate et is the determination of wet and dry edges an lst fvc feature space is only applicable in the same meteorological and terrain conditions therefore the methods are not suitable at a continental or global scale where meteorological and terrain conditions vary greatly and wet dry edges are difficult to determine from remote sensing data alone as there have been several regionally gridded meteorological products openly available such as the north american land data assimilation system nldas data at 0 125 spatial resolution xia et al 2015 it is possible to combine remote sensing data with meteorological data to determine the wet dry edges of lst fvc feature space for each pixel in a remote sensing image based on the surface energy balance theory with this combination the applicability of lst fvc methods could be extended to global scale another challenge of lst fvc feature space methods is how to separate soil evaporation ets and vegetation transpiration etv some conventional two source trapezoidal models have been proposed based on the assumption that vegetation temperature tv and soil temperature ts vary concurrently with soil moisture variation and etv and ets vary together with ts and tv variation in the lst fvc trapezoid long and singh 2012 sun 2015 yang et al 2015 therefore variation speed of etv and ets calculated from these conventional trapezoidal models are nearly equal jiang et al 2019 tang and li 2017 however the variation rate of etv and ets should be different because etv primarily uses water from the root zone layer while ets primarily uses water from the surface soil layer and the soil moisture of the two layers are different in the most cases to overcome this drawback tang and li 2017 proposed an end member based soil and vegetation energy partitioning esvep model which showed good potential for separating etv and ets by using a two stage trapezoid procedure first ets would drop from potential ets to zero if water content in the surface soil layer decreases from sufficiency to zero and etv would remain to be potential etv if the water content in the root zone layer remains sufficient second etv would drop from potential etv to zero if water content in the root zone layer decreases to wilting point and ets would keep at zero if soil water content in the surface soil layer remains at zero actual ets and etv of a pixel are calculated based on the linear ratio between the pixel location and endmembers in the lst fvc feature space the esvep model has shown good potential for calculating et using satellite observations jiang et al 2019 however the relationship between actual et etv and ets and potential et petv and pets may be not linear therefore a non linear approach should be tested in the end member based two source trapezoidal models for et calculation machine learning ml approaches provide new ways to deal with non linearity in the construction of models for classification and regression virnodkar et al 2020 and have been proved to be effective in agricultural remote sensing applications such as crop type classification plant biophysical and biochemical parameters estimation crop water stress detection and yield prediction filgueiras et al 2020 hao et al 2020b loozen et al 2020 oliveira et al 2020 rahman and di 2020 sun et al 2020a 2020b xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 as for ml based et estimation most studies used land surface parameters calculated from remote sensing data such as albedo land surface temperature vegetation indices etc and meteorological parameters such as wind speed vapor pressure deficit etc as inputs chia et al 2020 virnodkar et al 2020 but very few studies used parameters calculated from water cycle and energy balance mechanism as inputs for ml therefore objectives of this study are 1 using ml methods to fill the gap between parameters generated in two source trapezoidal models and actual et and 2 estimating the potential of using historical data as training samples to calculate corn and soybean et by combining esvep and ml approaches at five ameriflux cropland tower sites in nebraska and michigan the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses the materials and methods of this study section 3 presents research results section 4 analyzes and discusses the results and section 5 provides the conclusion of this study 2 data sets and methodology 2 1 study area and flux data the study area is located in nebraska ne and michigan mi both part of the u s corn belt with corn and soybean as the two dominant crops in situ data of five ameriflux tower cropland sites in nebraska and michigan namely us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 us kl1 and us km1 are used in this study the locations of these five sites are shown in fig 1 these sites have different crop rotation and irrigation conditions us ne1 us kl1 and us km1 are irrigated continuous corn sites us ne2 is an irrigated corn soybean rotation site and us ne3 is a rainfed corn soybean rotation site the mean annual precipitation of the nebraska and michigan sites are around 790 mm and 960 mm and the mean annual temperatures are around 10 c and 18 c respectively the hourly in situ data from 2003 to 2012 for the three nebraska sites were downloaded from the fluxnet data portal https fluxnet org the data sets were gap filled and passed the quality control checks pastorello et al 2020 the latent heat flux le corrected by the energy balance closure correction factor le corr corresponding to the satellite overpass time is used as in situ observed le in this study and only the data from doy 101 to doy 300 which cover the growing season of corn and soybean are used in addition hourly in situ data for year 2018 and 2019 are downloaded from ameriflux data portal https ameriflux lbl gov in situ flux data for 2018 and 2019 are the original observations which have not been corrected but these are the only datasets we can acquire in these two years we evaluated the energy balance closure of the ground truth data using the regression correlation of rn g and le h wilson et al 2002 and the results were shown in table 1 the in situ data for the three ne sites are available in both 2018 and 2019 and for the two mi sites the data were only available in 2018 as we use modis terra data to calculate le we only use in situ le observations at the satellite overpass time 10 30 am local time which is 16 30 utc time for the three ne sites and 15 30 utc time for the two mi sites the three ne sites provide hourly in situ data so that we used the data recorded for 10 00 11 00 am as in situ data mi sites provide half hourly data and we used the average value of records between 10 00 and 11 00 am furthermore all samples which were labeled as cloud covered in modis products were removed from sample dataset 2 2 earth observation and gridded meteorological data 2 2 1 modis data modis products used in this study include land surface reflectance mod09ga lst mod11a1 and leaf area index lai mod15a2 the temporal and spatial resolution of the three modis products and parameters derived from modis data are shown in table 2 broadband emissivity was calculated from spectral emissivity of modis bands 31 and 32 using method reported by liang 2004 land surface albedo was calculated from surface reflectance of modis bands 1 7 using method reported by liang 2001 ndvi was calculated from spectral reflectance of modis bands 1 and 2 rouse et al 1974 finally all modis data were resampled to 1 km using the gdal package for python the modis terra satellite overpasses land surface at 10 30 am local time daily so that in situ le corresponding to the satellite overpass time was used as ground truth le as some modis data were covered by clouds cloud covered samples were not included in the sample set because modis lst observation was not available as we focus on crop et calculation during the growing season all modis data between doy 101 and 300 between the years 2003 2012 and 2019 were collected in this study 2 2 2 meteorological data the hourly gridded meteorological data used in this study is nldas 2 file a data xia et al 2012 the dataset covers the conterminous us conus since 1979 at spatial resolution of 0 125 the hourly downwards longwave radiation downwards shortwave radiation surface pressure 2 m above ground specific humidity 2 m above ground temperature and wind speed between the years 2003 and 2012 were used in this study another data source of meteorological data is the national weather model service nwm https nomads ncep noaa gov pub data nccf com nwm prod which is an hourly analysis and forecast system running over the conterminous us noaa owp 2016 at 500 m spatial resolution in this study both nlads and nwm data were resampled to 1 km using the bi linear algorithms with the modis data as reference image the image resampling operation was implemented using the gdal package for python as the meteorological data used in this study are collected from different data sources nldas data between 2003 and 2012 and nwm data for 2018 and 2019 and the original spatial resolution of the two data sources are different the inconsistencies between the two meteorological datasets may slightly affect le calculation result in 2018 and 2019 2 3 flowchart of this study fig 2 shows the data processing flowchart of this study we selected random forest rf as the ml model in this study and then combined esvep and rf esvep rf to calculate et importance of individual features generated from remote sensing data meteorological data and esvep model were firstly estimated using the gini index calculated from rf next two experiments were designed to evaluate the performance of esvep rf for et calculation the first experiment was designed to evaluate the performance of esvep rf for et calculation with data between 2003 and 2012 and there were three scenarios using different training samples table 3 scenario a was designed to estimate the general performance of esvep rf method scenario b was designed to estimate the extendibility of esvep rf and scenario c was designed to generate different rf models for irrigation and rainfed sites and then effect of irrigation on esvep rf performance was evaluated the second experiment was using all samples acquired between in 2003 and 2012 as training samples to train rf models and then using these rf models to calculate et in 2018 and 2019 this experiment is designed to test the applicability of esvep rf for an up to date et calculation system finally all et were verified using the corresponding in situ data and total actual le was verified because in situ data do not provide etv and ets 2 4 esvep rf fig 3 showed the data processing flowchart of esvep rf remote sensing data and meteorological data were used as input in esvep model and then a series of parameters were generated from esvep model parameters from remote sensing data meteorological data and esvep model were combined with corresponding in situ observed data as training testing samples the training samples were then used to train rf models next remote sensing data meteorological data and esvep model outputs of the testing samples were collected and le of these testing samples were predicted using the rf models finally in situ le of the testing samples were used to verify the rf predicted le 2 5 esvep model the end member based soil and vegetation energy partitioning esvep model is based on the lst fvc feature trapezoid space models for the actual et calculation fig 4 in the trapezoid there are four end members end members a b c and d denotes dry soil dry vegetation wet vegetation and wet soil and the lst of these four end members are denoted as t sd t vd t vw and t sw the lst fvc feature trapezoid could be divided as two triangles the lower triangle triangle acd simulates the situation that root zone water is sufficient and soil evaporation varies and the upper triangle triangle abd simulates the situation that vegetation is water stressed generally et is composed by evaporation comes from soil evaporation ets and vegetation transpiration etv if the lst fvc of a pixel locates in triangle acd soil water content at the root zone almost remains sufficient so that the actual canopy transpiration is nearly equal to the potential canopy transpiration and the reduction of total et is due mainly to the decrease of soil evaporation if the lst fvc of a pixel is located in triangle abd soil evaporation remains zero and vegetation transpiration drops from potential vegetation transpiration to zero with less root zone water available jiang et al 2019 leng et al 2017 tang and li 2017 for a given pixel for example point x or x in fig 4 a critical surface temperature t is used to decide which triangle the pixels are located in eq 1 1 t t sd 4 1 f v t vw 4 f v 1 4 where f v is the fvc of given pixel which is calculated as 2 f v ndvi ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min 2 where ndvi is calculated from surface reflectance of red and near infrared bands of modis data band 01 and band 02 ndvi max and ndvi min are assigned to be 0 2 and 0 86 in this work according to prihodko and goward 1997 for a given pixel if the pixel is located in triangle acd for example point x in fig 4 ets and etv and be calculated as 3 et s ox op e s p et v e v p where e s p and e v p are potential soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration respectively and ox and op are lengths of the lines between points o and x and points o and p respectively if the pixel is located in triangle abd for example point x in fig 4 ets and etv and be calculated as 4 et s 0 et v o x o p e v p where o x and o p are lengths of the lines between points o and x and points o and p respectively then the ox op and o x o p can be calculated as 5 ox op 1 f v t sd f v t vw t s 1 f t sd t vw o x o p 1 f v t sd

parameters of esvep model both remote sensing data and meteorological data were firstly combined to generate lst fvc trapezoid space for each pixel lst were then used to estimate which triangle the pixel is located in and le of vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation are calculated using corresponding methodology and end members table 4 showed the input and output parameters for esvep model 2 6 random forest the random forest rf algorithm proposed by breiman 2001 is an ensemble machine learning method for regression and classification each random forest model contains multiple classification regression trees the training procedure for the rf algorithm is to construct all classification regression trees in this procedure each tree is constructed from root to leaf nodes using two third of the training samples randomly selected from training sample data set and only a part of features every time a split of a node is made on a feature the gini impurity criterion for descendent nodes is less than that of the parent node the important metric for fit is that the sum of gini impurity decreases for each individual variable over all trees in the classification regression forest leaf node denotes that the node cannot be further split and all samples in the node belongs to the same class after the construction of each tree the remaining one third training samples are used for testing where the test error is referred to as out of bag error feature importance could be estimated during the training procedure of rf with the sum of the reduction in gini impurity criterion when using random forest model to predict the prediction data set should contain the same features to training samples for a classification prediction the output will be mode of the classes of individual trees whereas for a regression prediction the output will be the average of all the individual trees the rf algorithm have several advantages 1 it can model complex interactions among input features 2 it runs efficiently on large datasets and not sensitive to noise or over fitting and 3 it automatically uses the optimal features to construct rf model therefore rf classification algorithm has been widely used in many remote sensing domains such as land cover classification and quantitative land surface parameters regression belgiu and drăguţ 2016 in this study the feature importance for the et calculation are estimated using rf all features in table 4 are used as input features the calculations were repeated 10 times and the average percentage gini score for each feature was used to generate feature importance next the rf algorithm was also used for et calculation for each experiment the rf model was trained with training samples all features were included in the training procedure as rf could automatically selected the optimal features finally rf models were then used to predict et for the testing samples the rf algorithm was implemented using the randomforest package for r liaw and wiener 2014 the number of trees in the ensemble was set to 1000 to allow convergence of the error statistic and the number of features to split the nodes in trees was set to the square root of the total number of input features loosvelt et al 2012 2 7 accuracies evaluation metrics we used bias error root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 between the esvep rf and in situ le although the esvep model could separate radiation and heat flux of soil part from the vegetation part in situ data did not provide these data separately so that we just verified total actual le of esvep rf the equations used for calculating bias rmse and r2 are as follows 9 b ias 1 n 1 n z f z 0 10 rmse 1 n z f z 0 2 n 11 r 2 1 y i y i ˆ 2 y i y i 2 where n is the size of sample size z f z 0 is the difference of each pair of in situ and predicted le y i y ˆ l 2 is the sum of residuals squared and y i y l 2 is the sum of the distance the data is away from the mean all squared the esvep can be used to divide soil evaporation from vegetation transpiration but the in situ data does not provide the parameters for vegetation and soil separately so that we only verified the total le of the two parts together 3 results and discussion 3 1 feature importance we used all samples between 2003 and 2012 to calculate feature importance fig 5 shows the top ten most important features among all features used in this study and percentage importance sum of the top ten features was 85 57 among all remote sensing meteorological and esvep model features lai was the most important feature the average percentage importance of lai for et calculation was 18 49 which indicated that vegetation growth was closely related to crop et this is because higher leaf area of the plant creates more opportunity for water vapor to leave from plant as transpiration monteith 1981 in addition higher vegetation cover means the plants absorb more solar photons and then convert more energy by transpiration pereira et al 2020 although ndvi and fvc were also proxies for the vegetation greenness condition average percentage importance of ndvi and fvc were just 8 22 and 4 76 respectively this maybe because ndvi is more sensitive at low greenness time phases and when vegetation greenness is high ndvi is saturated and cannot describe vegetation growth precisely hao et al 2020a wardlow et al 2007 furthermore the fvc calculation is highly dependent on ndvi in this study the ndvi saturation at high biomass level also led to the uncertainty of fvc for other features plev and r vw had high contribution for et calculation as the average percentage importance of the two features were 15 71 and 13 57 respectively plev and r vw were used to describe energy balance situation when the crop was not water stressed and determined the potential le of the given sample this indicated that the samples used in this study was not under water stress condition which was consistent with the fact that us ne1 and us ne2 sites were water sufficient as they were irrigated sites furthermore lst and ta which describe plant water status were also amongst the most important features with an average percentage importance percentage of 10 11 and 4 81 respectively the other two high contribution features are agdd and veghgt which are used to describe crop growth stage 3 2 latent heat flux validation using in situ measurements we first generated le using esvep rf with training samples of the previous years from all three ne sites and then compared esvep rf le with in situ le measurement fig 6 showed that esvep rf le had high uncertainty before 2008 with yearly rmse were higher than 80 w m2 and r2 were lower than 0 8 in the most cases table 5 the reason for high uncertainty was that the number of training samples was low it is notable that le prediction accuracies increased with training sample number table 5 for example when we only acquired 234 training samples from all three ne sites in 2003 the yearly rmse of us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 were 108 09 w m2 110 48 w m2 and 97 45 w m2 in 2004 and the yearly r2 of the three sites were 0 64 0 69 and 0 53 respectively however when we calculated le in 2011 we used all samples between 2003 and 2010 with a total of 3062 samples acquired the yearly rmse of esvep rf le for us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 were 73 50 w m2 65 41 w m2 and 69 78 w m2 and yearly r2 of the three sites were 0 84 0 85 and 0 86 respectively table 5 also showed that when the number of training samples was more than 3000 rmse and r2 remained stable which indicated that 3000 training samples could be sufficient for training rf models esvep result for site us ne1 in 2012 was not accurate since the le in 2012 was higher than all the training samples we have collected between 2003 and 2011 indicating that when le status of the given pixel is not included in the training samples sets esvep rf may not calculate le accurately finally when considering all samples between 2003 and 2012 r2 for the three sites were 0 73 0 75 and 0 69 fig 7 and table 5 to further compare le derived from esvep model and esvep rf we also used the esvep model to calculate le between 2003 and 2012 fig 8 and found that le calculated from the esvep model was not as accurate as the calculation from esvep rf in addition when training samples are sufficient esvep rf outperformed esvep model le for example in 2012 the rmse and r2 of esvep le were 87 41 w m2 and 0 75 for us ne1 table 6 and rmse and r2 of esvep rf le for us ne1 were 62 88 w m2 and 0 87 and table 5 we then collected all samples between 2004 and 2012 le derived from esvep rf also had lower rmse and higher r2 than esvep model le for all three sites table 6 and the bias estimation results of esvep le and esvep rf le are similar the fitted lines of the calculated le and in situ le showed that esvep rf le were closer to 1 1 line as the fitted lines of esvep rf le and in situ le had higher slope and lower intercept figs 7 and 9 although we have used independent training and test samples to estimate the potential of esvep rf of et calculation the generalizability of rf models trained from training samples in other regions is not clear therefore we used training and test samples from different sites to test the generalizability of rf models scenario b similar to the esvep rf calculation results with training samples from all three sites le calculation accuracies were low with high bias and rmse when number of training samples was not sufficient fig 10 although le calculated in scenario b were not so accurate as the le generated in scenario a the accuracies were still acceptable when the training sample number was sufficient for example when training samples were collected from us ne2 and us ne3 between 2003 and 2011 rmse and r2 of us ne1 in 2012 were 70 41 w m2 and 0 81 table 7 which showed that the le could be accurately calculated even although samples of test site were not used during the training procedure we further compared the le of scenario b calculated among the three sites and found that accuracies of us ne1 and us ne2 were better than us ne3 with higher yearly r2 and lower rmse table 7 for example in year 2012 r2 of esvep rf and in situ le for us ne1 and us ne2 were higher than 0 8 but r2 for us ne3 was only around 0 74 when considering samples of all nine years between 2004 and 2012 fitted lines of the le calculated from the esvep rf with scenario b were not close to 1 1 lines as the fitted lines of le calculated from esvep rf with scenario a as shown in fig 11 c slope and bias of the fitted line were 0 64 and 101 42 w m2 respectively furthermore le calculated for us ne3 had the lowest accuracy among the three sites the relatively low accuracies of us ne3 le with scenario b was probably because the sites us ne1 and us ne2 are irrigation sites but us ne3 was a rainfed site when calculating le for us ne1 the training samples of ne2 which was also an irrigation site were also used but when calculating le of us ne3 a rainfed site all training samples were collected from irrigation sites and an rf model trained on irrigation sites might not be used to calculate the le of a rainfed site accurately to further test whether the relatively low le calculation accuracies of us ne3 was caused by the mismatch between training and test samples we divided the training set into rainfed and irrigation scenario c and then generated rf model for irrigation and rainfed samples separately compared with scenario a and scenario b the le predicted in scenario c were more consistent with in situ le fig 12 table 8 also showed that for all three ne sites rmse of scenario c were lower than the other two scenarios in 2010 2011 and 2012 when the number of training samples were sufficient as a result r2 of scenario c were also higher for example rmse and r2 of us ne3 for scenario c were 74 83 w m2 and 0 82 in 2010 which were significantly better than those for scenario a in table 5 81 33 w m2 and 0 81 and b in table 7 84 25 w m2 and 0 78 when considering all the samples together scatter plots fig 13 also showed that the fitted lines of scenario c were closer to 1 1 lines the bias of fitted lines for us ne3 was around 80 w m2 fig 13c which was more than 20 w m2 lower than that of scenario b fig 11c this result indicated that when training samples and test samples were for the same irrigation the performance of esvep rf model improved which was consistent with the relatively low accuracies of scenario b 3 3 applicability of esvep rf in 2018 and 2019 to further test the applicability of the esvep rf we used all samples collected between 2003 and 2012 to train the rf models and calculated le in 2018 and 2019 training samples collected from us ne1 and us ne2 were used to calculate le for us ne1 us ne2 us kl1 and us km1 and training samples collected from us ne3 were used to calculate le for us ne3 fig 14 showed that le calculated from esvep rf had good consistency with in situ data and described the yearly le trend in both ne and mi sites the scatter plots fig 15 also showed that for the three ne sites esvep rf le and in situ le had good linear correlation as the r2 of the three sites were between 0 8 and 0 85 and rmse were between 55 w m2 and 65 w m2 in the most cases furthermore the le calculation accuracies of the two mi sites were slightly worse than the three ne sites the r2 of us kl1 and us km1 were 0 76 and 0 74 and the rmse were 69 34 w m2 and 71 69 w m2 respectively the uncertainty of the le calculated from esvep rf was mainly caused by the le overestimation at the low le time phases mainly around doy 101 130 and 260 300 when the in situ le was lower than 100 w m2 and the yearly bias of the esvep rf le ranged from 20 w m2 to 40 w m2 fig 15 it is notable that no training samples were collected for the sites us kl1 and us km1 this indicated that the esvep rf model trained with from nebraska sites had the potential to be used in other regions with similar cropland particularly in the corn belt 3 4 advantages and limitations in this study we proposed a practical workflow using the output of the esvep model as input features in rf model for et calculation the advantage of the esvep model is that the model divides soil evaporation from vegetation transpiration and then provides more parameters which could describe the energy balance more precisely the limitation of the original esvep model is that only a linear method is used to calculate the correlation between the le of the given pixel and the two triangles in the lst fvc space fig 4 so that we use rf regression to improve the drawback of the original esvep model because rf regression has shown potential for describing nonlinear correlation from the perspective of rf most existing studies only use features which are available from the remote sensing land surface products such as ndvi lai and par etc carter and liang 2019 chia et al 2020 filgueiras et al 2020 but no parameters generated from the lst based physical models are considered this study showed that some esvep model derived parameters such as plev and r vw are selected as high importance features which indicates the contribution of esvep model for the esvep rf model however there are still some drawbacks of the esvep rf workflow the most important issue for the esvep rf method is collecting training sample as the final procedure of the et calculation is based on machine learning algorithms our results have shown that training sample data size affect the esvep rf calculation accuracies which is consistent with carter and liang 2019 that small training samples size cannot calculate le accurately another issue related to the training samples collection is the representative of the training samples set dou and yang 2018 found that the same training data set have different performance for multiple ecosystems type which is similar to the scenario b results in this study as the rf models trained by samples of irrigation field samples cannot be used to calculate the le of rainfed fields accurately therefore the study region should be carefully cataloged based on the characters of the land cover and training samples need to be selected with large quantity and cover each catalog to ensure both the sample set size and representative another limitation of esvep rf is that the esvep model needs crop type and planting date as inputs to calculate several parameters such as agdd height and aerodynamic resistance however gridded up to date crop type and planting information are not available for practical et monitoring for crop type data existing crop type maps such as cdl data are not available before the crop harvest boryan et al 2011 and the accurate early season crop type map are not available before july hao et al 2020a hao et al 2015 although the predicted crop type maps can be generated before the start of the growing season zhang et al 2019 this data contain large uncertainties that may seriously affect the le calculation accuracy for planting date information although suggested planting dates are provided shroyer et al 1996 the gridded actual planting date information of the target year is still not available before growing season begins therefore a practical solution is to collect the crop type and planting data information from the farmers report but this would limit the up to date application of esvep rf to certain fields with all necessary input information 4 conclusion this present paper proposed a new workflow for et calculation by combining the advantages of esvep model and rf remote sensing and meteorological data were used as inputs for the esvep rf method which was tested using all available in situ data from five flux tower sites of 12 years 2003 2012 2018 and 2019 the main conclusions are as follows 1 esvep rf showed good potential for calculating et when the number of training samples is sufficient and representative in 2010 and 2011 r2 of le calculated by esvep rf were around 0 8 and rmse were around 70 w m2 which outperformed the original esvep model the uncertainty in esvep rf is mainly caused by the overestimation of le at low le level time phases 2 among all remote sensing meteorological and esvep model output features lai was selected as the most important feature as the percentage importance of lai calculated from rf was 18 49 in addition the percentage importance of plev and r vw were 15 71 and 13 57 respectively these parameters were used to describe vegetation transpiration in case that the plant is non water stressed 3 esvep rf had good extendibility as the method achieved r2 higher than 0 7 when training and validation samples were from independent sites in addition the esvep rf model generated from samples between 2003 and 2012 achieved good accuracy for le calculation in 2018 and 2019 rmse were between 55 w m2 and 70 w m2 and r2 were around 0 8 for the five test sites as esvep rf driven by 2003 2012 training samples showed good potential for calculating et in 2018 and 2019 we have used the method to calculate grided instantaneous le of satellite overpass time under cloud free condition with predicted crop type map and suggested planting date information as input this le data are then used to generate cloud free condition daily et which is a part of the all weather up to date et data product in ne the product is accessible at watersmart data information portal as machine learning et https geobrain csiss gmu edu watersmartport web as the limitations of training samples and input information affect the accuracy of esvep rf seriously more attention should be paid to ensure the sample size and representative as well as the early season crop type and planting data information when applying the esvep rf to generate up to date le data declaration of competing

9823,evapotranspiration et is an important parameter for crop growth monitoring and land surface modeling this paper proposed a new workflow namely esvep rf to calculate et during the crop growing season using modis data by combining the advantages of the trapezoidal model and random forest rf algorithm in esvep rf the endmember based soil and vegetation energy partitioning esvep model was first used to calculate a series of parameters from modis and meteorological inputs and then all parameters derived from remote sensing data meteorological data and esvep models were used as inputs to the rf algorithm for latent heat flux le calculation in situ data of 12 years 2003 2012 2018 and 2019 from five flux towers located in nebraska ne and michigan mi were used to test the performance of esvep rf and results showed that esvep rf had great potential to accurately calculate et when the number of training samples was sufficient and representative in 2010 and 2011 r2 of le were around 0 8 and rmse were around 70 w m2 which outperformed original esvep model results this indicated that the rf algorithm could better describe the non linear correlation between in lst fvc space endmembers and le among all parameters lai plev and r vw had high contribution with percentage importance of 18 49 15 71 and 13 57 respectively furthermore all samples between 2003 and 2012 collected from the three ne sites were used to train rf models and then calculate le for both ne and mi sites in 2018 and 2019 in ne sites rmse was around 65 w m2 and r2 was around 0 8 in mi sites it was noted that no samples from these sites were included in the training data set and rmse was around 70 w m2 and r2 was higher than 0 7 these results showed the potential of esvep rf for providing up to date et information keywords et remote sensing esvep machine learning nebraska 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is the loss of water from the land surface to atmosphere which is a key component in water cycle and energy balance systems burt et al 2005 di 1991 farahani et al 2007 moran et al 1994 pereira et al 2015 additionally et is also a major hydrological variable in agricultural applications since accurate et calculation provides important information for crop growth monitoring and crop yield prediction allen et al 2007 anderson et al 2007 knipper et al 2020 usgs 2010 wang and dickinson 2012 remote sensing based methods have been widely used for cropland et calculation and monitoring from regional to global scale jéffersonde et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 knipper et al 2020 liu et al 2019 mu et al 2007 2011 xue et al 2020 yu et al 2019 and can be categorized into three groups based on their principles 1 surface energy balance methods 2 surface water balance methods and 3 land surface temperature lst fractional vegetation cover fvc feature space methods carlson 2007 li et al 2009 senay 2008 su 1988 among these methods lst fvc feature space methods are advantageous in et calculation because they avoid complex aerodynamic and land surface resistance parameterization required for other methods jiang et al 2009 kimball and running 2016 leng et al 2017 the hypothesis of the lst fvc feature space methods is that remotely sensed lst and fvc of all clear sky pixels in an image could be used to generate a two dimensional space and the envelope of these pixels could constitute a physically meaningful triangle or trapezoid carlson 2007 the edges of the triangle or trapezoid represent extreme wet dry situations in the image and the vertices are called dry wet endmembers consequently one challenge in using the lst fvc methods to calculate et is the determination of wet and dry edges an lst fvc feature space is only applicable in the same meteorological and terrain conditions therefore the methods are not suitable at a continental or global scale where meteorological and terrain conditions vary greatly and wet dry edges are difficult to determine from remote sensing data alone as there have been several regionally gridded meteorological products openly available such as the north american land data assimilation system nldas data at 0 125 spatial resolution xia et al 2015 it is possible to combine remote sensing data with meteorological data to determine the wet dry edges of lst fvc feature space for each pixel in a remote sensing image based on the surface energy balance theory with this combination the applicability of lst fvc methods could be extended to global scale another challenge of lst fvc feature space methods is how to separate soil evaporation ets and vegetation transpiration etv some conventional two source trapezoidal models have been proposed based on the assumption that vegetation temperature tv and soil temperature ts vary concurrently with soil moisture variation and etv and ets vary together with ts and tv variation in the lst fvc trapezoid long and singh 2012 sun 2015 yang et al 2015 therefore variation speed of etv and ets calculated from these conventional trapezoidal models are nearly equal jiang et al 2019 tang and li 2017 however the variation rate of etv and ets should be different because etv primarily uses water from the root zone layer while ets primarily uses water from the surface soil layer and the soil moisture of the two layers are different in the most cases to overcome this drawback tang and li 2017 proposed an end member based soil and vegetation energy partitioning esvep model which showed good potential for separating etv and ets by using a two stage trapezoid procedure first ets would drop from potential ets to zero if water content in the surface soil layer decreases from sufficiency to zero and etv would remain to be potential etv if the water content in the root zone layer remains sufficient second etv would drop from potential etv to zero if water content in the root zone layer decreases to wilting point and ets would keep at zero if soil water content in the surface soil layer remains at zero actual ets and etv of a pixel are calculated based on the linear ratio between the pixel location and endmembers in the lst fvc feature space the esvep model has shown good potential for calculating et using satellite observations jiang et al 2019 however the relationship between actual et etv and ets and potential et petv and pets may be not linear therefore a non linear approach should be tested in the end member based two source trapezoidal models for et calculation machine learning ml approaches provide new ways to deal with non linearity in the construction of models for classification and regression virnodkar et al 2020 and have been proved to be effective in agricultural remote sensing applications such as crop type classification plant biophysical and biochemical parameters estimation crop water stress detection and yield prediction filgueiras et al 2020 hao et al 2020b loozen et al 2020 oliveira et al 2020 rahman and di 2020 sun et al 2020a 2020b xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 as for ml based et estimation most studies used land surface parameters calculated from remote sensing data such as albedo land surface temperature vegetation indices etc and meteorological parameters such as wind speed vapor pressure deficit etc as inputs chia et al 2020 virnodkar et al 2020 but very few studies used parameters calculated from water cycle and energy balance mechanism as inputs for ml therefore objectives of this study are 1 using ml methods to fill the gap between parameters generated in two source trapezoidal models and actual et and 2 estimating the potential of using historical data as training samples to calculate corn and soybean et by combining esvep and ml approaches at five ameriflux cropland tower sites in nebraska and michigan the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses the materials and methods of this study section 3 presents research results section 4 analyzes and discusses the results and section 5 provides the conclusion of this study 2 data sets and methodology 2 1 study area and flux data the study area is located in nebraska ne and michigan mi both part of the u s corn belt with corn and soybean as the two dominant crops in situ data of five ameriflux tower cropland sites in nebraska and michigan namely us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 us kl1 and us km1 are used in this study the locations of these five sites are shown in fig 1 these sites have different crop rotation and irrigation conditions us ne1 us kl1 and us km1 are irrigated continuous corn sites us ne2 is an irrigated corn soybean rotation site and us ne3 is a rainfed corn soybean rotation site the mean annual precipitation of the nebraska and michigan sites are around 790 mm and 960 mm and the mean annual temperatures are around 10 c and 18 c respectively the hourly in situ data from 2003 to 2012 for the three nebraska sites were downloaded from the fluxnet data portal https fluxnet org the data sets were gap filled and passed the quality control checks pastorello et al 2020 the latent heat flux le corrected by the energy balance closure correction factor le corr corresponding to the satellite overpass time is used as in situ observed le in this study and only the data from doy 101 to doy 300 which cover the growing season of corn and soybean are used in addition hourly in situ data for year 2018 and 2019 are downloaded from ameriflux data portal https ameriflux lbl gov in situ flux data for 2018 and 2019 are the original observations which have not been corrected but these are the only datasets we can acquire in these two years we evaluated the energy balance closure of the ground truth data using the regression correlation of rn g and le h wilson et al 2002 and the results were shown in table 1 the in situ data for the three ne sites are available in both 2018 and 2019 and for the two mi sites the data were only available in 2018 as we use modis terra data to calculate le we only use in situ le observations at the satellite overpass time 10 30 am local time which is 16 30 utc time for the three ne sites and 15 30 utc time for the two mi sites the three ne sites provide hourly in situ data so that we used the data recorded for 10 00 11 00 am as in situ data mi sites provide half hourly data and we used the average value of records between 10 00 and 11 00 am furthermore all samples which were labeled as cloud covered in modis products were removed from sample dataset 2 2 earth observation and gridded meteorological data 2 2 1 modis data modis products used in this study include land surface reflectance mod09ga lst mod11a1 and leaf area index lai mod15a2 the temporal and spatial resolution of the three modis products and parameters derived from modis data are shown in table 2 broadband emissivity was calculated from spectral emissivity of modis bands 31 and 32 using method reported by liang 2004 land surface albedo was calculated from surface reflectance of modis bands 1 7 using method reported by liang 2001 ndvi was calculated from spectral reflectance of modis bands 1 and 2 rouse et al 1974 finally all modis data were resampled to 1 km using the gdal package for python the modis terra satellite overpasses land surface at 10 30 am local time daily so that in situ le corresponding to the satellite overpass time was used as ground truth le as some modis data were covered by clouds cloud covered samples were not included in the sample set because modis lst observation was not available as we focus on crop et calculation during the growing season all modis data between doy 101 and 300 between the years 2003 2012 and 2019 were collected in this study 2 2 2 meteorological data the hourly gridded meteorological data used in this study is nldas 2 file a data xia et al 2012 the dataset covers the conterminous us conus since 1979 at spatial resolution of 0 125 the hourly downwards longwave radiation downwards shortwave radiation surface pressure 2 m above ground specific humidity 2 m above ground temperature and wind speed between the years 2003 and 2012 were used in this study another data source of meteorological data is the national weather model service nwm https nomads ncep noaa gov pub data nccf com nwm prod which is an hourly analysis and forecast system running over the conterminous us noaa owp 2016 at 500 m spatial resolution in this study both nlads and nwm data were resampled to 1 km using the bi linear algorithms with the modis data as reference image the image resampling operation was implemented using the gdal package for python as the meteorological data used in this study are collected from different data sources nldas data between 2003 and 2012 and nwm data for 2018 and 2019 and the original spatial resolution of the two data sources are different the inconsistencies between the two meteorological datasets may slightly affect le calculation result in 2018 and 2019 2 3 flowchart of this study fig 2 shows the data processing flowchart of this study we selected random forest rf as the ml model in this study and then combined esvep and rf esvep rf to calculate et importance of individual features generated from remote sensing data meteorological data and esvep model were firstly estimated using the gini index calculated from rf next two experiments were designed to evaluate the performance of esvep rf for et calculation the first experiment was designed to evaluate the performance of esvep rf for et calculation with data between 2003 and 2012 and there were three scenarios using different training samples table 3 scenario a was designed to estimate the general performance of esvep rf method scenario b was designed to estimate the extendibility of esvep rf and scenario c was designed to generate different rf models for irrigation and rainfed sites and then effect of irrigation on esvep rf performance was evaluated the second experiment was using all samples acquired between in 2003 and 2012 as training samples to train rf models and then using these rf models to calculate et in 2018 and 2019 this experiment is designed to test the applicability of esvep rf for an up to date et calculation system finally all et were verified using the corresponding in situ data and total actual le was verified because in situ data do not provide etv and ets 2 4 esvep rf fig 3 showed the data processing flowchart of esvep rf remote sensing data and meteorological data were used as input in esvep model and then a series of parameters were generated from esvep model parameters from remote sensing data meteorological data and esvep model were combined with corresponding in situ observed data as training testing samples the training samples were then used to train rf models next remote sensing data meteorological data and esvep model outputs of the testing samples were collected and le of these testing samples were predicted using the rf models finally in situ le of the testing samples were used to verify the rf predicted le 2 5 esvep model the end member based soil and vegetation energy partitioning esvep model is based on the lst fvc feature trapezoid space models for the actual et calculation fig 4 in the trapezoid there are four end members end members a b c and d denotes dry soil dry vegetation wet vegetation and wet soil and the lst of these four end members are denoted as t sd t vd t vw and t sw the lst fvc feature trapezoid could be divided as two triangles the lower triangle triangle acd simulates the situation that root zone water is sufficient and soil evaporation varies and the upper triangle triangle abd simulates the situation that vegetation is water stressed generally et is composed by evaporation comes from soil evaporation ets and vegetation transpiration etv if the lst fvc of a pixel locates in triangle acd soil water content at the root zone almost remains sufficient so that the actual canopy transpiration is nearly equal to the potential canopy transpiration and the reduction of total et is due mainly to the decrease of soil evaporation if the lst fvc of a pixel is located in triangle abd soil evaporation remains zero and vegetation transpiration drops from potential vegetation transpiration to zero with less root zone water available jiang et al 2019 leng et al 2017 tang and li 2017 for a given pixel for example point x or x in fig 4 a critical surface temperature t is used to decide which triangle the pixels are located in eq 1 1 t t sd 4 1 f v t vw 4 f v 1 4

fig 4 ets and etv and be calculated as 3 et s ox op e s p et v e v p where e s p and e v p are potential soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration respectively and ox and op are lengths of the

pixel is located in and le of vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation are calculated using corresponding methodology and end members table 4 showed the input and output parameters for esvep model 2 6 random forest the random forest rf algorithm proposed by breiman 2001 is an ensemble machine learning method for regression and classification each random forest model contains multiple classification regression trees the training procedure for the rf algorithm is to construct all classification regression trees in this procedure each tree is constructed from root to leaf nodes using two third of the training samples randomly selected from training sample data set and only a part of features every time a split of a node is made on a feature the gini impurity criterion for descendent nodes is less than that of the parent node the important metric for fit is that the sum of gini impurity decreases for each individual variable over all trees in the classification regression forest leaf node denotes that the node cannot be further split and all samples in the node belongs to the same class after the construction of each tree the remaining one third training samples are used for testing where the test error is referred to as out of bag error feature importance could be estimated during the training procedure of rf with the sum of the reduction in gini impurity criterion when using random forest model to predict the prediction data set should contain the same features to training samples for a classification prediction the output will be mode of the classes of individual trees whereas for a regression prediction the output will be the average of all the individual trees the rf algorithm have several advantages 1 it can model complex interactions among input features 2 it runs efficiently on large datasets and not sensitive to noise or over fitting and 3 it automatically uses the optimal features to construct rf model therefore rf classification algorithm has been widely used in many remote sensing domains such as land cover classification and quantitative land surface parameters regression belgiu and drăguţ 2016 in this study the feature importance for the et calculation are estimated using rf all features in table 4 are used as input features the calculations were repeated 10 times and the average percentage gini score for each feature was used to generate feature importance next the rf algorithm was also used for et calculation for each experiment the rf model was trained with training samples all features were included in the training procedure as rf could automatically selected the optimal features finally rf models were then used to predict et for the testing samples the rf algorithm was implemented using the randomforest package for r liaw and wiener 2014 the number of trees in the ensemble was set to 1000 to allow convergence of the error statistic and the number of features to split the nodes in trees was set to the square root of the total number of input features loosvelt et al 2012 2 7 accuracies evaluation metrics we used bias error root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 between the esvep rf and in situ le although the esvep model could separate radiation and heat flux of soil part from the vegetation part in situ data did not provide these data separately so that we just verified total actual le of esvep rf the equations used for calculating bias rmse and r2 are as follows 9 b ias 1 n 1 n z f z 0 10 rmse 1 n z f z 0 2 n 11 r 2 1 y i y i ˆ 2 y i y i 2 where n is the size of sample size z f z 0 is the difference of each pair of in situ and predicted le y i y ˆ l 2 is the sum of residuals squared and y i y l 2 is the sum of the distance the data is away from the mean all squared the esvep can be used to divide soil evaporation from vegetation transpiration but the in situ data does not provide the parameters for vegetation and soil separately so that we only verified the total le of the two parts together 3 results and discussion 3 1 feature importance we used all samples between 2003 and 2012 to calculate feature importance fig 5 shows the top ten most important features among all features used in this study and percentage importance sum of the top ten features was 85 57 among all remote sensing meteorological and esvep model features lai was the most important feature the average percentage importance of lai for et calculation was 18 49 which indicated that vegetation growth was closely related to crop et this is because higher leaf area of the plant creates more opportunity for water vapor to leave from plant as transpiration monteith 1981 in addition higher vegetation cover means the plants absorb more solar photons and then convert more energy by transpiration pereira et al 2020 although ndvi and fvc were also proxies for the vegetation greenness condition average percentage importance of ndvi and fvc were just 8 22 and 4 76 respectively this maybe because ndvi is more sensitive at low greenness time phases and when vegetation greenness is high ndvi is saturated and cannot describe vegetation growth precisely hao et al 2020a wardlow et al 2007 furthermore the fvc calculation is highly dependent on ndvi in this study the ndvi saturation at high biomass level also led to the uncertainty of fvc for other features plev and r vw had high contribution for et calculation as the average percentage importance of the two features were 15 71 and 13 57 respectively plev and r vw were used to describe energy balance situation when the crop was not water stressed and determined the potential le of the given sample this indicated that the samples used in this study was not under water stress condition which was consistent with the fact that us ne1 and us ne2 sites were water sufficient as they were irrigated sites furthermore lst and ta which describe plant water status were also amongst the most important features with an average percentage importance percentage of 10 11 and 4 81 respectively the other two high contribution features are agdd and veghgt which are used to describe crop growth stage 3 2 latent heat flux validation using in situ measurements we first generated le using esvep rf with training samples of the previous years from all three ne sites and then compared esvep rf le with in situ le measurement fig 6 showed that esvep rf le had high uncertainty before 2008 with yearly rmse were higher than 80 w m2 and r2 were lower than 0 8 in the most cases table 5 the reason for high uncertainty was that the number of training samples was low it is notable that le prediction accuracies increased with training sample number table 5 for example when we only acquired 234 training samples from all three ne sites in 2003 the yearly rmse of us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 were 108 09 w m2 110 48 w m2 and 97 45 w m2 in 2004 and the yearly r2 of the three sites were 0 64 0 69 and 0 53 respectively however when we calculated le in 2011 we used all samples between 2003 and 2010 with a total of 3062 samples acquired the yearly rmse of esvep rf le for us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 were 73 50 w m2 65 41 w m2 and 69 78 w m2 and yearly r2 of the three sites were 0 84 0 85 and 0 86 respectively table 5 also showed that when the number of training samples was more than 3000 rmse and r2 remained stable which indicated that 3000 training samples could be sufficient for training rf models esvep result for site us ne1 in 2012 was not accurate since the le in 2012 was higher than all the training samples we have collected between 2003 and 2011 indicating that when le status of the given pixel is not included in the training samples sets esvep rf may not calculate le accurately finally when considering all samples between 2003 and 2012 r2 for the three sites were 0 73 0 75 and 0 69 fig 7 and table 5 to further compare le derived from esvep model and esvep rf we also used the esvep model to calculate le between 2003 and 2012 fig 8 and found that le calculated from the esvep model was not as accurate as the calculation from esvep rf in addition when training samples are sufficient esvep rf outperformed esvep model le for example in 2012 the rmse and r2 of esvep le were 87 41 w m2 and 0 75 for us ne1 table 6 and rmse and r2 of esvep rf le for us ne1 were 62 88 w m2 and 0 87 and table 5 we then collected all samples between 2004 and 2012 le derived from esvep rf also had lower rmse and higher r2 than esvep model le for all three sites table 6 and the bias estimation results of esvep le and esvep rf le are similar the fitted lines of the calculated le and in situ le showed that esvep rf le were closer to 1 1 line as the fitted lines of esvep rf le and in situ le had higher slope and lower intercept figs 7 and 9 although we have used independent training and test samples to estimate the potential of esvep rf of et calculation the generalizability of rf models trained from training samples in other regions is not clear therefore we used training and test samples from different sites to test the generalizability of rf models scenario b similar to the esvep rf calculation results with training samples from all three sites le calculation accuracies were low with high bias and rmse when number of training samples was not sufficient fig 10 although le calculated in scenario b were not so accurate as the le generated in scenario a the accuracies were still acceptable when the training sample number was sufficient for example when training samples were collected from us ne2 and us ne3 between 2003 and 2011 rmse and r2 of us ne1 in 2012 were 70 41 w m2 and 0 81 table 7 which showed that the le could be accurately calculated even although samples of test site were not used during the training procedure we further compared the le of scenario b calculated among the three sites and found that accuracies of us ne1 and us ne2 were better than us ne3 with higher yearly r2 and lower rmse table 7 for example in year 2012 r2 of esvep rf and in situ le for us ne1 and us ne2 were higher than 0 8 but r2 for us ne3 was only around 0 74 when considering samples of all nine years between 2004 and 2012 fitted lines of the le calculated from the esvep rf with scenario b were not close to 1 1 lines as the fitted lines of le calculated from esvep rf with scenario a as shown in fig 11 c slope and bias of the fitted line were 0 64 and 101 42 w m2 respectively furthermore le calculated for us ne3 had the lowest accuracy among the three sites the relatively low accuracies of us ne3 le with scenario b was probably because the sites us ne1 and us ne2 are irrigation sites but us ne3 was a rainfed site when calculating le for us ne1 the training samples of ne2 which was also an irrigation site were also used but when calculating le of us ne3 a rainfed site all training samples were collected from irrigation sites and an rf model trained on irrigation sites might not be used to calculate the le of a rainfed site accurately to further test whether the relatively low le calculation accuracies of us ne3 was caused by the mismatch between training and test samples we divided the training set into rainfed and irrigation scenario c and then generated rf model for irrigation and rainfed samples separately compared with scenario a and scenario b the le predicted in scenario c were more consistent with in situ le fig 12 table 8 also showed that for all three ne sites rmse of scenario c were lower than the other two scenarios in 2010 2011 and 2012 when the number of training samples were sufficient as a result r2 of scenario c were also higher for example rmse and r2 of us ne3 for scenario c were 74 83 w m2 and 0 82 in 2010 which were significantly better than those for scenario a in table 5 81 33 w m2 and 0 81 and b in table 7 84 25 w m2 and 0 78 when considering all the samples together scatter plots fig 13 also showed that the fitted lines of scenario c were closer to 1 1 lines the bias of fitted lines for us ne3 was around 80 w m2 fig 13c which was more than 20 w m2 lower than that of scenario b fig 11c this result indicated that when training samples and test samples were for the same irrigation the performance of esvep rf model improved which was consistent with the relatively low accuracies of scenario b 3 3 applicability of esvep rf in 2018 and 2019 to further test the applicability of the esvep rf we used all samples collected between 2003 and 2012 to train the rf models and calculated le in 2018 and 2019 training samples collected from us ne1 and us ne2 were used to calculate le for us ne1 us ne2 us kl1 and us km1 and training samples collected from us ne3 were used to calculate le for us ne3 fig 14 showed that le calculated from esvep rf had good consistency with in situ data and described the yearly le trend in both ne and mi sites the scatter plots fig 15 also showed that for the three ne sites esvep rf le and in situ le had good linear correlation as the r2 of the three sites were between 0 8 and 0 85 and rmse were between 55 w m2 and 65 w m2 in the most cases furthermore the le calculation accuracies of the two mi sites were slightly worse than the three ne sites the r2 of us kl1 and us km1 were 0 76 and 0 74 and the rmse were 69 34 w m2 and 71 69 w m2 respectively the uncertainty of the le calculated from esvep rf was mainly caused by the le overestimation at the low le time phases mainly around doy 101 130 and 260 300 when the in situ le was lower than 100 w m2 and the yearly bias of the esvep rf le ranged from 20 w m2 to 40 w m2 fig 15 it is notable that no training samples were collected for the sites us kl1 and us km1 this indicated that the esvep rf model trained with from nebraska sites had the potential to be used in other regions with similar cropland particularly in the corn belt 3 4 advantages and limitations in this study we proposed a practical workflow using the output of the esvep model as input features in rf model for et calculation the advantage of the esvep model is that the model divides soil evaporation from vegetation transpiration and then provides more parameters which could describe the energy balance more precisely the limitation of the original esvep model is that only a linear method is used to calculate the correlation between the le of the given pixel and the two triangles in the lst fvc space fig 4 so that we use rf regression to improve the drawback of the original esvep model because rf regression has shown potential for describing nonlinear correlation from the perspective of rf most existing studies only use features which are available from the remote sensing land surface products such as ndvi lai and par etc carter and liang 2019 chia et al 2020 filgueiras et al 2020 but no parameters generated from the lst based physical models are considered this study showed that some esvep model derived parameters such as plev and r vw are selected as high importance features which indicates the contribution of esvep model for the esvep rf model however there are still some drawbacks of the esvep rf workflow the most important issue for the esvep rf method is collecting training sample as the final procedure of the et calculation is based on machine learning algorithms our results have shown that training sample data size affect the esvep rf calculation accuracies which is consistent with carter and liang 2019 that small training samples size cannot calculate le accurately another issue related to the training samples collection is the representative of the training samples set dou and yang 2018 found that the same training data set have different performance for multiple ecosystems type which is similar to the scenario b results in this study as the rf models trained by samples of irrigation field samples cannot be used to calculate the le of rainfed fields accurately therefore the study region should be carefully cataloged based on the characters of the land cover and training samples need to be selected with large quantity and cover each catalog to ensure both the sample set size and representative another limitation of esvep rf is that the esvep model needs crop type and planting date as inputs to calculate several parameters such as agdd height and aerodynamic resistance however gridded up to date crop type and planting information are not available for practical et monitoring for crop type data existing crop type maps such as cdl data are not available before the crop harvest boryan et al 2011 and the accurate early season crop type map are not available before july hao et al 2020a hao et al 2015 although the predicted crop type maps can be generated before the start of the growing season zhang et al 2019 this data contain large uncertainties that may seriously affect the le calculation accuracy for planting date information although suggested planting dates are provided shroyer et al 1996 the gridded actual planting date information of the target year is still not available before growing season begins therefore a practical solution is to collect the crop type and planting data information from the farmers report but this would limit the up to date application of esvep rf to certain fields with all necessary input information 4 conclusion this present paper proposed a new workflow for et calculation by combining the advantages of esvep model and rf remote sensing and meteorological data were used as inputs for the esvep rf method which was tested using all available in situ data from five flux tower sites of 12 years 2003 2012 2018 and 2019 the main conclusions are as follows 1 esvep rf showed good potential for calculating et when the number of training samples is sufficient and representative in 2010 and 2011 r2 of le calculated by esvep rf were around 0 8 and rmse were around 70 w m2 which outperformed the original esvep model the uncertainty in esvep rf is mainly caused by the overestimation of le at low le level time phases 2 among all remote sensing meteorological and esvep model output features lai was selected as the most important feature as the percentage importance of lai calculated from rf was 18 49 in addition the percentage importance of plev and r vw were 15 71 and 13 57 respectively these parameters were used to describe vegetation transpiration in case that the plant is non water stressed 3 esvep rf had good extendibility as the method achieved r2 higher than 0 7 when training and validation samples were from independent sites in addition the esvep rf model generated from samples between 2003 and 2012 achieved good accuracy for le calculation in 2018 and 2019 rmse were between 55 w m2 and 70 w m2 and r2 were around 0 8 for the five test sites as esvep rf driven by 2003 2012 training samples showed good potential for calculating et in 2018 and 2019 we have used the method to calculate grided instantaneous le of satellite overpass time under cloud free condition with predicted crop type map and suggested planting date information as input this le data are then used to generate cloud free condition daily et which is a part of the all weather up to date et data product in ne the product is accessible at watersmart data information portal as machine learning et https geobrain csiss gmu edu watersmartport web as the limitations of training samples and input information affect the accuracy of esvep rf seriously more attention should be paid to ensure the sample size and representative as well as the early season crop type and planting data information when applying the esvep rf to generate up to date le data declaration of competing

9824,soil erosion poses serious challenge to the sustainable utilization of soil and water resources worldwide vegetation restoration can sufficiently improve the environment and reduce soil erosion it is important to evaluate the effects of vegetation coverage and position on surface runoff and sediment yield therefore this study simulated four vegetation coverage rates 0 20 40 and 60 and two vegetation distribution positions downslope and upslope to study the runoff and sediment yield under three rain intensities 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 the results showed that the runoff decreased as vegetation coverage increased 0 20 40 60 the minimum total runoff occurred at 60 vegetation coverage rate under 60 mm h 1 rain intensity 57 5 l and the maximum at 0 vegetation coverage rate under 120 mm h 1 rain intensity 172 2 l the process of sedimentation was similar to that of runoff as the rate of vegetation coverage increased the sediment yield decreased the total sediment yields under 40 and 60 vegetation coverage rates were significantly lower than that under 0 in addition the runoff volume and sediment yield of the upslope vegetation pattern were considerably higher than those of the downslope pattern under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity the total runoff volume and sediment yield of upslope pattern were 70 6 l and 261 1 g as opposed to 61 6 l and 174 9 g of downslope pattern respectively by analyzing the correlations of runoff and sediment yield with vegetation coverage the interception effect on runoff and sediment yield increased with the increase in vegetation coverage moreover the downslope pattern contributed more in reducing runoff and sediment yield than the upslope pattern the results can provide scientific basis for vegetation restoration on the loess plateau keywords vegetation coverage and position runoff sediment vegetation restoration suggestion 1 introduction the loess plateau region is subjected to the most severe soil erosion worldwide with an average soil erosion modulus of up to 10 000 kg km 2 year 1 fu et al 2017 long term soil erosion has resulted in the formation of ravines on the underlying surface and severe degradation of land quality shi et al 2021 zhao et al 2017 huge amount of sediment deposited in the river course causes the lower yellow river bed to rise thereby forming an overground river wang et al 2016 the effective alleviation of this soil erosion problem on the loess plateau is one of the major challenges china has to overcome vegetation restoration is the most effective measure for controlling soil erosion on the loess plateau shi et al 2019 since 1999 the chinese government has implemented a policy involving large scale vegetation restoration and has thus far restored a total area of 5 84 million hm2 of farmland to forest on the loess plateau shi et al 2020 vegetation restoration has significantly improved the regional environmental conditions over the past 20 years the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi on the loess plateau has increased from 0 30 to 0 45 feng et al 2016 the water and sediment conditions of the yellow river have undergone tremendous changes owing to the influence of factors such as vegetation restoration and climate change the measured sediment discharge at tongguan station on the yellow river has decreased from 1 6 billion tons per year to 200 300 million tons per year and the runoff has greatly reduced hou et al 2020 wang et al 2016 found that 57 of sediment reduction resulted from the increased vegetation coverage since 1999 vegetation restoration reduces runoff and sediment yield and its regulation effects on hydrological processes are primarily manifested in the following aspects fig 1 1 an increase in the rainfall intercepted by canopy absorbed by litter layer and infiltrated into the soil 2 an increase in surface roughness and reduction in runoff velocity 3 enhancement of plant roots to improve soil corrosion resistance 4 reduction in rainfall kinetic energy and 5 reduction in the volume and peaks of storm floods hou et al 2020 observation data of numerous runoffs show that vegetation can reduce surface runoff by more than 50 and soil erosion by over 90 compared with the levels recorded on bare slopes zhang et al 2018 yue et al 2020 reported that vegetation restoration could decrease more than 68 0 of runoff and 98 0 of soil erosion compared to the bare land on the loess plateau region vegetation coverage has great impact on soil erosion li and pan 2018 the ability of grasslands to reduce runoff and sediment yield decreases as rain intensity increases but increases as vegetation coverage increases hou et al 2020 during rainfall grasslands change the processes of runoff and sedimentation by impacting initial runoff generation time and increasing the initial loss of rainfall and water infiltration into the soil chen et al 2018 found that grassland with high ground cover had a lower runoff depth and soil loss on steep slopes on the loess plateau in the plot experiment liu et al 2012 discovered that vegetation cover dominates runoff before the rainfall threshold was crossed in the centre of the loess plateau nunes et al 2011 revealed that the soil erosion rate declined exponentially as the vegetation coverage rate increased zhou et al 2006 modeled the relationship between vegetation coverage and soil erosion in the loess plateau area and found that soil erosion was negative linearly correlated with vegetation coverage with a correlation coefficient of 0 99 zhang et al 2017 reported that the flow resistance water depth and reynolds number of slope runoff depended on the vegetation coverage the vegetation pattern includes the spatial distribution and structure of vegetation and these factors directly affect soil erosion feng et al 2020 the spatial distribution of vegetation directly affects the continuity of the soil erosion process leading to the dispersion of water flow and the gradual decrease in its sediment carrying capacity wang et al 2021 runoff and sediment accumulation are also affected by the position of vegetation by rainfall simulation experiments wei et al 2014 found that vegetation in the lower position had more powerful role in preventing runoff loss in the western part of the loess plateau zhang et al 2018 observed that vegetation distribution reduced runoff and sediment yield in descending order as follows mid slope lower slope upper slope and vegetation distributed in the middle of the slope reduced runoff and sediment yield by 7 35 and 62 93 respectively in addition the spatial distribution pattern of vegetation changed the connectivity of runoff and sediment transportation paths thereby affecting the soil erosion process zhao et al 2013 the total amount of runoff when vegetation was on the lower slope was larger than that in the middle and upper slopes moreover the middle slope and upper slope vegetation patterns exhibited better structural connectivity than that on the lower slope and their topography following the rainfall was more conducive to water system connectivity as well as runoff and sediment production ma et al 2018 vegetation restoration on the loess plateau has been widely confirmed to reduce soil erosion however existing research pays little attention to the relationship of vegetation coverage and position with and runoff and sediment yield in this study the process of soil erosion under different vegetation coverage rates and spatial locations is examined through in situ runoff plot simulation experiments we hypothesized that 1 a larger vegetation coverage rate has stronger soil and water conservation ability 2 different vegetation distribution positions have different runoff and sediment loads on the slope the purpose of this study is to determine the optimal vegetation coverage rate and distribution position based on the reduction in of surface runoff and sediment yield on the loess

series reflected the characteristics of runoff at intervals of 1 2 min fig 4 runoff varied significantly under different vcrs the runoff volume decreased with increasing vcr 0 20 40 60 under a rain intensity of 60 mm h 1 the runoff volume gradually increased and then stabilized in the first 10 min of rainfall fig 4 1 and 4 4 under a rain intensity of 90 mm h 1 the runoff volume increased in the first 6 min and then stabilized fig 4 2 and 4 5 under rain intensity of 120 mm h 1 the first 2 min was the time threshold for generating surface runoff fig 4 3 and 4 6 the variation trend of cumulative runoff volume in different time periods was consistent with the runoff process the higher the vcr the less the cumulative runoff volume fig 5 the total runoff volumes under different rain intensities were 60 90 120 mm h 1 table 1 the total runoff volume under 0 vcr was significantly p 0 05 higher than those under 20 40 and 60 coverage rates the total runoff volume was lowest 57 5 l under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity and 60 vcr and highest 172 2 l under 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity and 0 vcr the sediment process under different vegetation coverage was similar to the runoff process the sediment yield generated by bare slope 0 vcr was evidently higher than that generated by vegetation covered slopes fig 6 the sediment yield decreased as vcr increased exhibiting a trend of 20 40 60 the change trend of the cumulative sediment yield in different time periods corresponded with the sediment yield and followed 0 20 40 60 fig 7 the total sediment yield under different rain intensities followed 0 90 120 mm h 1 rain intensity table 1 the total sediment yield decreased as vcr increased and the total sediment yields under 40 and 60 vcrs were significantly lower than p 0 01 that under 0 vcr the maximum total sediment yield 832 3 g appeared at 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity of 0 vcr whereas the minimum 128 0 g appeared at 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity of 60 vcr 3 2 impact of vegetation distribution position on runoff and sediment the downslope vegetation pattern had a significantly greater reduction effect on runoff than the upslope vegetation pattern under a rainfall intensity of 60 mm h 1 the initial runoff of upslope patterns with 20 40 and 60 vcrs were 1 39 0 86 and 0 47 l min 1 respectively which increased to 2 71 2 57 and 2 63 l min 1 respectively after 30 min of rainfall fig 4 under the same rainfall intensity the initial runoffs of the downslope pattern with 20 40 and 60 vcrs were 0 59 0 71 and 0 32 l min 1 respectively which increased to 2 43 2 38 and 2 02 l min 1 after 30 min of rainfall fig 4 4 under 90 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensities the runoff of the downslope pattern was also lower than that of the upslope pattern fig 4 2 4 3 4 5 and 4 6 the runoff volume and sediment yield of different vegetation distribution patterns were similar under 60 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensities the total rainfall amount of the downslope pattern was significantly lower than that of the upslope pattern p 0 05 table 2 after 30 min of rainfall at 60 mm h 1 the total runoff volume of the upslope pattern with 20 vcr was 72 47 l whereas that of the downslope pattern with the same vcr was 64 11 l fig 5 1 and 5 4 when the vcr increased to 40 and 60 the corresponding cumulative runoff volume of the upslope pattern decreased to 69 34 and 69 93 l respectively whereas that of the downslope pattern decreased to 66 46 and 54 36 l respectively in addition under 90 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensities the cumulative sediment yields also followed upslope pattern downslope pattern fig 5 2 5 3 5 5 and 5 6 the sediment yield of the downslope vegetation pattern was lower than that of the upslope vegetation pattern under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity the initial sediment yields of upslope patterns with 20 40 and 60 vcrs were 4 94 3 71 and 3 52 g l 1 and the corresponding maximum sediment yields were 7 91 5 05 and 5 62 g l 1 fig 6 1 and 6 4 under the same rainfall intensity the initial sediment yields of downslope patterns with 20 40 and 60 vcrs were reduced to 3 90 3 02 and 2 13 g l 1 and their maximum sediment yields were 5 90 3 75 and 2 50 g l 1 respectively under 90 and 120 mm h 1 the sediment production rate exhibited similar variation and was larger in the upslope pattern fig 6 2 6 3 6 5 and 6 6 the total sediment yields of various vegetation distribution patterns were similar with sediment processes under 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensities the total sediment yield of the downslope pattern was significantly lower than that of the upslope pattern p 0 05 table 2 after 30 min of rainfall at 60 mm h 1 intensity the cumulative sediment yields of upslope patterns with 20 40 and 60 vcrs were 369 93 172 36 and 240 92 g fig 7 1 whereas those of the downslope patterns were 236 33 166 18 and 102 30 g respectively fig 7 4 under 90 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensities the cumulative sediment yields followed upslope pattern downslope pattern fig 7 2 7 3 7 5 and 7 6 3 3 correlation analysis of runoff and sediment yields fig 8 shows the correlation between the runoff yield rate and sediment yield rate under different vcrs and distribution patterns as the runoff yield rate increased the sediment yield rate exhibited a linear ascending trend and the growth slope exhibited a downward trend as the vcr increased for the upslope pattern with 20 vcr the slope was 5 18 however it decreased to 3 61 and 2 35 with 40 and 60 vcrs respectively conversely for the downslope pattern with 20 vcr the slope was 5 02 and decreased to 2 84 and 1 42 when the vcrs increased to 40 and 60 respectively the results showed that the linear correlation between runoff and sediment yield decreased as vcr increased that is the increase rate of runoff was higher than that of sediment yield the relationships among runoff sediment yield and vegetation coverage can be expressed as y a bx where the dependent variable y is runoff or sediment yield and the independent variable x is vcr table 3 the slope was negative indicating that additional runoff and sediment yield were intercepted as the vcr increased the downslope pattern had a relatively significant contribution to the reduction in runoff and sediment under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity the fitting equations of runoff and sediment with vcr for the upslope pattern can be expressed as y 78 89 0 27x and y 487 32 3 26x respectively and y 69 49 0 30x and y 289 55 3 48x respectively for the downslope pattern the slope b value of the fitting equation of the downslope pattern was larger than that of the upslope pattern similar results were observed when the rainfall intensities were 90 and 120 mm h 1 4 discussion 4 1 impact of vegetation coverage rates on runoff and sediment vegetation restoration could effectively reduce surface runoff and sediment yield previous studies have shown that runoff and sediment yield have a linear relationship with vcr garcia estringana et al 2010 gu et al 2019 vegetation reduced surface runoff by decreasing raindrop energy and increasing rainfall infiltration to the soil casermeiro et al 2004 feng et al 2020 in addition it reduced the surface exposure and enhanced surface roughness and root fixation thereby reducing the sediment yield due to soil erosion li and pan 2018 different vcrs exhibited evident differences in runoff and sediment control effects previous studies have shown that 30 vcr contributes 12 2 47 7 and 31 0 97 2 to the reduction in runoff and sediment yield respectively furthermore 60 vegetation coverage rate had a greater reduction effect on runoff and sediment with a maximum of 55 6 and 100 0 respectively table 4 similar conclusions were drawn in this study following the increase in vcr the runoff and sediment yields decreased significantly and the reduced effects by different vcrs followed the order of 0 20 40 60 evidently 60 vcr could best reduce runoff and sediment yield by a maximum of 14 13 and 73 88 respectively other studies have revealed that different vegetation coverage has a threshold effect on runoff and sediment yield chen et al 2019b the threshold of grassland coverage for controlling soil erosion is affected by various factors such as the studied area vegetation type topographical feature and rainfall intensity the effective vcr of grassland to maintain water and soil on the loess plateau is generally considered to approximately range from 20 to 60 rey 2004 revealed that a vcr exceeding 20 could effectively intercept the eroded sediment on the slope zhang et al 2010 reported that a 30 vcr reduced runoff and sediment yield by 22 compared to bare slopes whereas an 80 vcr decreased runoff and sediment yield by 32 and 61 respectively zhao et al 2014 compared the effects of 20 40 60 and 80 of grassland coverage rates on runoff and sediment yield and found that runoff and sediment yields were negatively correlated with vcr specifically the runoff volume was reduced by 7 1 13 8 16 3 and 17 5 whereas the sediment yield was reduced by 39 0 74 0 86 8 and 89 4 with vcrs of 20 40 60 and 80 liu et al 2020 found that when the vcr on the loess plateau was 60 the sediment yield and flood in the watershed were both at a low level although vegetation coverage can greatly reduce runoff and sediment yields it is also impacted by rainfall intensity han et al 2021 the changes in rainfall intensity cause changes in the splash intensity of raindrops for high rainfall intensity the diameter of raindrops is large and their kinetic and potential energies are relatively high thereby intensifying the splash erosion on the slope rainfall intensity also has significant influence on inducing and increasing runoff when the rainfall intensity increased the time for rainfall to exceed the infiltration amount to soil decreased and runoff occurred earlier the hydrological process on the slope is significantly affected by the variations in rainfall intensity and the amount of soil erosion increases with the increasing rainfall intensity in this study the 40 vcr under 60 mm h 1 rain intensity reduced runoff and sediment yield by 7 25 and 57 33 respectively and by 6 91 and 44 14 under 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity respectively following the intensification of global climate change the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events have recently been exhibiting an increasing trend accurate knowledge about the ecological benefits of vegetation measures is of great significance for setting a reasonable threshold of vcr under different rainfall conditions 4 2 impact of vegetation distribution positions on runoff and sediment the spatial distribution of vegetation changes the connectivity between runoff and sediment transportation pathways and is the important factor affecting soil erosion pan and shangguan 2006 mayor et al 2008 indicated that the longer of water flow path resulted in the stronger of the runoff connectivity and fasted of runoff speed and more runoff convergence increased the erosion and sediment transportation abilities the downslope pattern severely hindered the connection of runoff paths and therefore most water accumulated on the surface and the water conservation efficiency was optimal ma et al 2018 bare ground surface and vegetation patches serve as the source and confluence of runoff sediment yield and other factors in the hydrologic process respectively ludwig et al 2002 the distribution patterns of the two influence the runoff sediment generation and transportation processes on the slope the confluence vegetation patch was placed near the mouth of runoff to retain the water and sediment from the upper slope thereby reducing water and soil erosion in this study the runoff and sediment volumes of the downslope pattern were significantly lower than those of the upslope pattern this corresponds with the research results of zhang et al 2018 the grassland on the upper slope had the worst effect on runoff and sediment control rey 2004 reported that a small area of high density vegetation at the bottom of runoff plots could intercept most of the sediment chen et al 2019a established a source confluence landscape pattern index which considered vegetation cover as a confluence landscape distributed at the outlet of the basin for effectively reducing soil erosion the long term monitoring conducted by boix fayos et al 2010 in the semi arid region of spain revealed that the total sediment loss can vary by approximately nine times owing to the different vegetation coverage patterns 4 3 suggestions on vegetation restoration the restoration of existing vegetation on the loess plateau affected the runoff and erosion during rainfall as well as the evaporation and soil water storage water is the decisive factor restricting vegetation restoration on the loess plateau however the soil water carrying capacity should be considered in vegetation restoration as the loess plateau experiences an acute shortage of water resource introducing large scale and high density vegetation will inevitably cause additional consumption of soil water due to the transpiration of vegetation and water absorption by roots thereby aggravating soil desiccation moreover in severe cases it may even lead to severe dry soil layer severely restricting the growth of plants the chinese government plans to expand the scale of returning farmland to forests and grasslands considering this in the future vegetation restoration it is necessary to reasonably balance the relationship between the vegetation restoration ratio and the ecological water requirement to obtain optimal soil and water conservation benefits with the least soil water consumption a few studies suggest that a vcr between 40 and 60 can achieve effective soil and water conservation with moderate soil water consumption the vegetation at the lower slope can not only block the sediment through its own mechanical action but also can change the topography of the slope surface through sediment deposition and decrease slope gradient thereby reducing soil erosion thus the vegetation on the loess plateau should be distributed at the lower slope or near the outlet of the watershed to retain the water and sediment from the upper slope and thus the overall water and soil loss can be reduced during land utilization and development it is suggested that a certain area of land on the lower slope be first used as the land for planting perennial shrubs and grasses 5 conclusions vegetation restoration is an important measure for reducing soil erosion reasonable vegetation coverage rate and position are of great significance for maximizing their effects on runoff and sediment reduction the present results show that slope surface runoff and sediment yield gradually decreases as the vegetation coverage rate increases however the water carrying capacity of soil should be considered in vegetation restoration in arid and semi arid areas it is recommended that a vegetation coverage rate of 40 60 is more appropriate the runoff and sediment yields of the downslope pattern are lower than those of the upslope pattern thus vegetation is considered to be distributed at the lower part of the slope or near the outlet of the watershed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9824,soil erosion poses serious challenge to the sustainable utilization of soil and water resources worldwide vegetation restoration can sufficiently improve the environment and reduce soil erosion it is important to evaluate the effects of vegetation coverage and position on surface runoff and sediment yield therefore this study simulated four vegetation coverage rates 0 20 40 and 60 and two vegetation distribution positions downslope and upslope to study the runoff and sediment yield under three rain intensities 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 the results showed that the runoff decreased as vegetation coverage increased 0 20 40 60 the minimum total runoff occurred at 60 vegetation coverage rate under 60 mm h 1 rain intensity 57 5 l and the maximum at 0 vegetation coverage rate under 120 mm h 1 rain intensity 172 2 l the process of sedimentation was similar to that of runoff as the rate of vegetation coverage increased the sediment yield decreased the total sediment yields under 40 and 60 vegetation coverage rates were significantly lower than that under 0 in addition the runoff volume and sediment yield of the upslope vegetation pattern were considerably higher than those of the downslope pattern under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity the total runoff volume and sediment yield of upslope pattern were 70 6 l and 261 1 g as opposed to 61 6 l and 174 9 g of downslope pattern respectively by analyzing the correlations of runoff and sediment yield with vegetation coverage the interception effect on runoff and sediment yield increased with the increase in vegetation coverage moreover the downslope pattern contributed more in reducing runoff and sediment yield than the upslope pattern the results can provide scientific basis for vegetation restoration on the loess plateau keywords vegetation coverage and position runoff sediment vegetation restoration suggestion 1 introduction the loess plateau region is subjected to the most severe soil erosion worldwide with an average soil erosion modulus of up to 10 000 kg km 2 year 1 fu et al 2017 long term soil erosion has resulted in the formation of ravines on the underlying surface and severe degradation of land quality shi et al 2021 zhao et al 2017 huge amount of sediment deposited in the river course causes the lower yellow river bed to rise thereby forming an overground river wang et al 2016 the effective alleviation of this soil erosion problem on the loess plateau is one of the major challenges china has to overcome vegetation restoration is the most effective measure for controlling soil erosion on the loess plateau shi et al 2019 since 1999 the chinese government has implemented a policy involving large scale vegetation restoration and has thus far restored a total area of 5 84 million hm2 of farmland to forest on the loess plateau shi et al 2020 vegetation restoration has significantly improved the regional environmental conditions over the past 20 years the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi on the loess plateau has increased from 0 30 to 0 45 feng et al 2016 the water and sediment conditions of the yellow river have undergone tremendous changes owing to the influence of factors such as vegetation restoration and climate change the measured sediment discharge at tongguan station on the yellow river has decreased from 1 6 billion tons per year to 200 300 million tons per year and the runoff has greatly reduced hou et al 2020 wang et al 2016 found that 57 of sediment reduction resulted from the increased vegetation coverage since 1999 vegetation restoration reduces runoff and sediment yield and its regulation effects on hydrological processes are primarily manifested in the following aspects fig 1 1 an increase in the rainfall intercepted by canopy absorbed by litter layer and infiltrated into the soil 2 an increase in surface roughness and reduction in runoff velocity 3 enhancement of plant roots to improve soil corrosion resistance 4 reduction in rainfall kinetic energy and 5 reduction in the volume and peaks of storm floods hou et al 2020 observation data of numerous runoffs show that vegetation can reduce surface runoff by more than 50 and soil erosion by over 90 compared with the levels recorded on bare slopes zhang et al 2018 yue et al 2020 reported that vegetation restoration could decrease more than 68 0 of runoff and 98 0 of soil erosion compared to the bare land on the loess plateau region vegetation coverage has great impact on soil erosion li and pan 2018 the ability of grasslands to reduce runoff and sediment yield decreases as rain intensity increases but increases as vegetation coverage increases hou et al 2020 during rainfall grasslands change the processes of runoff and sedimentation by impacting initial runoff generation time and increasing the initial loss of rainfall and water infiltration into the soil chen et al 2018 found that grassland with high ground cover had a lower runoff depth and soil loss on steep slopes on the loess plateau in the plot experiment liu et al 2012 discovered that vegetation cover dominates runoff before the rainfall threshold was crossed in the centre of the loess plateau nunes et al 2011 revealed that the soil erosion rate declined exponentially as the vegetation coverage rate increased zhou et al 2006 modeled the relationship between vegetation coverage and soil erosion in the loess plateau area and found that soil erosion was negative linearly correlated with vegetation coverage with a correlation coefficient of 0 99 zhang et al 2017 reported that the flow resistance water depth and reynolds number of slope runoff depended on the vegetation coverage the vegetation pattern includes the spatial distribution and structure of vegetation and these factors directly affect soil erosion feng et al 2020 the spatial distribution of vegetation directly affects the continuity of the soil erosion process leading to the dispersion of water flow and the gradual decrease in its sediment carrying capacity wang et al 2021 runoff and sediment accumulation are also affected by the position of vegetation by rainfall simulation experiments wei et al 2014 found that vegetation in the lower position had more powerful role in preventing runoff loss in the western part of the loess plateau zhang et al 2018 observed that vegetation distribution reduced runoff and sediment yield in descending order as follows mid slope lower slope upper slope and vegetation distributed in the middle of the slope reduced runoff and sediment yield by 7 35 and 62 93 respectively in addition the spatial distribution pattern of vegetation changed the connectivity of runoff and sediment transportation paths thereby affecting the soil erosion process zhao et al 2013 the total amount of runoff when vegetation was on the lower slope was larger than that in the middle and upper slopes moreover the middle slope and upper slope vegetation patterns exhibited better structural connectivity than that on the lower slope and their topography following the rainfall was more conducive to water system connectivity as well as runoff and sediment production ma et al 2018 vegetation restoration on the loess plateau has been widely confirmed to reduce soil erosion however existing research pays little attention to the relationship of vegetation coverage and position with and runoff and sediment yield in this study the process of soil erosion under different vegetation coverage rates and spatial locations is examined through in situ runoff plot simulation experiments we hypothesized that 1 a larger vegetation coverage rate has stronger soil and water conservation ability 2 different vegetation distribution positions have different runoff and sediment loads on the slope the purpose of this study is to determine the optimal vegetation coverage rate and distribution position based on the reduction in of surface runoff and sediment yield on the loess

and 2 02 l min 1 after 30 min of rainfall fig 4 4 under 90 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensities the runoff of the downslope pattern was also lower than that of the upslope pattern fig 4 2 4 3 4 5 and 4 6 the runoff volume and sediment yield of different vegetation distribution patterns were similar under 60 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensities the total rainfall amount of the downslope pattern was significantly lower than that of the upslope pattern p 0 05 table 2 after 30 min of rainfall at 60 mm h 1 the total runoff volume of the upslope pattern with 20 vcr was 72 47 l whereas that of the downslope pattern with the same vcr was 64 11 l fig 5 1 and 5 4 when the vcr increased to 40 and 60 the corresponding cumulative runoff volume of the upslope pattern decreased to 69 34 and 69 93 l respectively whereas that of the downslope pattern decreased to 66 46 and 54 36 l respectively in addition under 90 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensities the cumulative sediment yields also followed upslope pattern downslope pattern fig 5 2 5 3 5 5 and 5 6 the sediment yield of the downslope vegetation pattern was lower than that of the upslope vegetation pattern under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity the initial sediment yields of upslope patterns with 20 40 and 60 vcrs were 4 94 3 71 and 3 52 g l 1 and the corresponding maximum sediment yields were 7 91 5 05 and 5 62 g l 1 fig 6 1 and 6 4 under the same rainfall intensity the initial sediment yields of downslope patterns with 20 40 and 60 vcrs were reduced to 3 90 3 02 and 2 13 g l 1 and their maximum sediment yields were 5 90 3 75 and 2 50 g l 1 respectively under 90 and 120 mm h 1 the sediment production rate exhibited similar variation and was larger in the upslope pattern fig 6 2 6 3 6 5 and 6 6 the total sediment yields of various vegetation distribution patterns were similar with sediment processes under 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensities the total sediment yield of the downslope pattern was significantly lower than that of the upslope pattern p 0 05 table 2 after 30 min of rainfall at 60 mm h 1 intensity the cumulative sediment yields of upslope patterns with 20 40 and 60 vcrs were 369 93 172 36 and 240 92 g fig 7 1 whereas those of the downslope patterns were 236 33 166 18 and 102 30 g respectively fig 7 4 under 90 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensities the cumulative sediment yields followed upslope pattern downslope pattern fig 7 2 7 3 7 5 and 7 6 3 3 correlation analysis of runoff and sediment yields fig 8 shows the correlation between the runoff yield rate and sediment yield rate under different vcrs and distribution patterns as the runoff yield rate increased the sediment yield rate exhibited a linear ascending trend and the growth slope exhibited a downward trend as the vcr increased for the upslope pattern with 20 vcr the slope was 5 18 however it decreased to 3 61 and 2 35 with 40 and 60 vcrs respectively conversely for the downslope pattern with 20 vcr the slope was 5 02 and decreased to 2 84 and 1 42 when the vcrs increased to 40 and 60 respectively the results showed that the linear correlation between runoff and sediment yield decreased as vcr increased that is the increase rate of runoff was higher than that of sediment yield the relationships among runoff sediment yield and vegetation coverage can be expressed as y a bx where the dependent variable y is runoff or sediment yield and the independent variable x is vcr table 3 the slope was negative indicating that additional runoff and sediment yield were intercepted as the vcr increased the downslope pattern had a relatively significant contribution to the reduction in runoff and sediment under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity the fitting equations of runoff and sediment with vcr for the upslope pattern can be expressed as y 78 89 0 27x and y 487 32 3 26x respectively and y 69 49 0 30x and y 289 55 3 48x respectively for the downslope pattern the slope b value of the fitting equation of the downslope pattern was larger than that of the upslope pattern similar results were observed when the rainfall intensities were 90 and 120 mm h 1 4 discussion 4 1 impact of vegetation coverage rates on runoff and sediment vegetation restoration could effectively reduce surface runoff and sediment yield previous studies have shown that runoff and sediment yield have a linear relationship with vcr garcia estringana et al 2010 gu et al 2019 vegetation reduced surface runoff by decreasing raindrop energy and increasing rainfall infiltration to the soil casermeiro et al 2004 feng et al 2020 in addition it reduced the surface exposure and enhanced surface roughness and root fixation thereby reducing the sediment yield due to soil erosion li and pan 2018 different vcrs exhibited evident differences in runoff and sediment control effects previous studies have shown that 30 vcr contributes 12 2 47 7 and 31 0 97 2 to the reduction in runoff and sediment yield respectively furthermore 60 vegetation coverage rate had a greater reduction effect on runoff and sediment with a maximum of 55 6 and 100 0 respectively table 4 similar conclusions were drawn in this study following the increase in vcr the runoff and sediment yields decreased significantly and the reduced effects by different vcrs followed the order of 0 20 40 60 evidently 60 vcr could best reduce runoff and sediment yield by a maximum of 14 13 and 73 88 respectively other studies have revealed that different vegetation coverage has a threshold effect on runoff and sediment yield chen et al 2019b the threshold of grassland coverage for controlling soil erosion is affected by various factors such as the studied area vegetation type topographical feature and rainfall intensity the effective vcr of grassland to maintain water and soil on the loess plateau is generally considered to approximately range from 20 to 60 rey 2004 revealed that a vcr exceeding 20 could effectively intercept the eroded sediment on the slope zhang et al 2010 reported that a 30 vcr reduced runoff and sediment yield by 22 compared to bare slopes whereas an 80 vcr decreased runoff and sediment yield by 32 and 61 respectively zhao et al 2014 compared the effects of 20 40 60 and 80 of grassland coverage rates on runoff and sediment yield and found that runoff and sediment yields were negatively correlated with vcr specifically the runoff volume was reduced by 7 1 13 8 16 3 and 17 5 whereas the sediment yield was reduced by 39 0 74 0 86 8 and 89 4 with vcrs of 20 40 60 and 80 liu et al 2020 found that when the vcr on the loess plateau was 60 the sediment yield and flood in the watershed were both at a low level although vegetation coverage can greatly reduce runoff and sediment yields it is also impacted by rainfall intensity han et al 2021 the changes in rainfall intensity cause changes in the splash intensity of raindrops for high rainfall intensity the diameter of raindrops is large and their kinetic and potential energies are relatively high thereby intensifying the splash erosion on the slope rainfall intensity also has significant influence on inducing and increasing runoff when the rainfall intensity increased the time for rainfall to exceed the infiltration amount to soil decreased and runoff occurred earlier the hydrological process on the slope is significantly affected by the variations in rainfall intensity and the amount of soil erosion increases with the increasing rainfall intensity in this study the 40 vcr under 60 mm h 1 rain intensity reduced runoff and sediment yield by 7 25 and 57 33 respectively and by 6 91 and 44 14 under 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity respectively following the intensification of global climate change the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events have recently been exhibiting an increasing trend accurate knowledge about the ecological benefits of vegetation measures is of great significance for setting a reasonable threshold of vcr under different rainfall conditions 4 2 impact of vegetation distribution positions on runoff and sediment the spatial distribution of vegetation changes the connectivity between runoff and sediment transportation pathways and is the important factor affecting soil erosion pan and shangguan 2006 mayor et al 2008 indicated that the longer of water flow path resulted in the stronger of the runoff connectivity and fasted of runoff speed and more runoff convergence increased the erosion and sediment transportation abilities the downslope pattern severely hindered the connection of runoff paths and therefore most water accumulated on the surface and the water conservation efficiency was optimal ma et al 2018 bare ground surface and vegetation patches serve as the source and confluence of runoff sediment yield and other factors in the hydrologic process respectively ludwig et al 2002 the distribution patterns of the two influence the runoff sediment generation and transportation processes on the slope the confluence vegetation patch was placed near the mouth of runoff to retain the water and sediment from the upper slope thereby reducing water and soil erosion in this study the runoff and sediment volumes of the downslope pattern were significantly lower than those of the upslope pattern this corresponds with the research results of zhang et al 2018 the grassland on the upper slope had the worst effect on runoff and sediment control rey 2004 reported that a small area of high density vegetation at the bottom of runoff plots could intercept most of the sediment chen et al 2019a established a source confluence landscape pattern index which considered vegetation cover as a confluence landscape distributed at the outlet of the basin for effectively reducing soil erosion the long term monitoring conducted by boix fayos et al 2010 in the semi arid region of spain revealed that the total sediment loss can vary by approximately nine times owing to the different vegetation coverage patterns 4 3 suggestions on vegetation restoration the restoration of existing vegetation on the loess plateau affected the runoff and erosion during rainfall as well as the evaporation and soil water storage water is the decisive factor restricting vegetation restoration on the loess plateau however the soil water carrying capacity should be considered in vegetation restoration as the loess plateau experiences an acute shortage of water resource introducing large scale and high density vegetation will inevitably cause additional consumption of soil water due to the transpiration of vegetation and water absorption by roots thereby aggravating soil desiccation moreover in severe cases it may even lead to severe dry soil layer severely restricting the growth of plants the chinese government plans to expand the scale of returning farmland to forests and grasslands considering this in the future vegetation restoration it is necessary to reasonably balance the relationship between the vegetation restoration ratio and the ecological water requirement to obtain optimal soil and water conservation benefits with the least soil water consumption a few studies suggest that a vcr between 40 and 60 can achieve effective soil and water conservation with moderate soil water consumption the vegetation at the lower slope can not only block the sediment through its own mechanical action but also can change the topography of the slope surface through sediment deposition and decrease slope gradient thereby reducing soil erosion thus the vegetation on the loess plateau should be distributed at the lower slope or near the outlet of the watershed to retain the water and sediment from the upper slope and thus the overall water and soil loss can be reduced during land utilization and development it is suggested that a certain area of land on the lower slope be first used as the land for planting perennial shrubs and grasses 5 conclusions vegetation restoration is an important measure for reducing soil erosion reasonable vegetation coverage rate and position are of great significance for maximizing their effects on runoff and sediment reduction the present results show that slope surface runoff and sediment yield gradually decreases as the vegetation coverage rate increases however the water carrying capacity of soil should be considered in vegetation restoration in arid and semi arid areas it is recommended that a vegetation coverage rate of 40 60 is more appropriate the runoff and sediment yields of the downslope pattern are lower than those of the upslope pattern thus vegetation is considered to be distributed at the lower part of the slope or near the outlet of the watershed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they
