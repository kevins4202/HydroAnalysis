12275,water access issues pose continual problems for villages in arid areas of rajasthan india and the common response has been technological solutions through water management projects qualitative participatory research can provide alternative approaches to these issues and this article examines role of grassroot activities to develop engagement ownership and vision for local groundwater problems and solutions in rural development projects the study used a participatory photography process to allow villagers to take and select photographs that represented what surface and ground waters meant to them in the present and future along with how they saw their own responsibilities for water security of their villages the visual and textual data was analysed using two different analytical approaches empirical and relational which provided complementary results as well as allowing for exploration of basic questions about what water means to villagers amongst themselves and provided them with an opportunity to make meaning of their water situation what they value the most and what they can do to improve their situation overall the study illustrates that participatory photography is an effective engagement process for understanding complex problems such as groundwater overexploitation and water scarcity from the perspective of villagers this also has the potential to create community awareness and facilitate collective action to address complex natural resources management issues and challenges graphical abstract photovoice for community engagement and collective action to facilitate village water security fx1 keywords participatory research groundwater visualisation sustainability and photography 1 introduction the state of rajasthan in the north west of india has arid conditions with high risks of crop failure associated with unpredictable rains in this context groundwater is particularly precious and has been used in exponentially increasing rates since the 1960s as new pumping technology has become available and accessible water scarcity and crop failure have contributed to decreasing poverty and food insecurity which can be ameliorated by the use of groundwater but only at the cost of depleting precious groundwater reserves shah 2008 in response the indian government is rolling out a large scale national program mnrega mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act which includes recharging groundwater using a range of local infrastructure interventions this study is a part of larger project called marvi managing aquifer recharge and sustaining groundwater use through village level intervention university of western sydney 2010 this study goes beyond technical aspects of groundwater management and examines how the beneficiaries of marvi project viz village communities view water management issues and challenges and possible situation improvement scenarios this study fits within the broad marvi project umbrella using qualitative participatory visual research to explore how villagers in the study area construct meanings of water the context of the inquiry can be thought of in terms of pratt s 1999 concept of a contact zone between the different intersecting knowledge systems following mosse s 2009 discussion of the limitations of the engineering management and indigenous knowledge paradigms with respect to human water relationships the study analyses different activities that take place between these intersecting knowledge systems with their differing relationships with water the mnrega program the marvi project the villagers to name a few each of which map onto different parts of a complex plane spanning modern and traditional ways of knowing as such the study draws on multiple analytic strategies as a way of approaching and illuminating this highly complex area of water management seeking to uncover new perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of each the main aim of this study was to use the photovoice technique to understand the meanings of water for villagers in in the study area and explore what implications exist for the sustainable usage of groundwater currently and in the future in particular the specific objectives of the study are to understand villagers i current local understandings of surface and groundwater supplies availability and security ii future hopes and aspirations regarding groundwater iii perceptions of their own ability to influence local groundwater sustainability 2 understanding the complexity of water issues the importance of water is multifaceted and knowing how water affects people s lives and how they can impact water management is important in any effective intervention to improve longer term water security the importance of the individuals and community articulating and managing shared responsibility for local water management needs to be considered as a complement to technical water management approaches an effective process of articulating water issues and solutions is critical to ensure the success or failure of management interventions diwakara 2005 and van steenbergen 2006 explore the process with respect to trust in local water management more specifically shah 2000 and de groot and tadepally 2008 focus on the ethical foundations of shared water responsibility the former through descriptively analysing groundwater recharge movements and the latter through empirically researching trust perceptions and ngo project success factors the importance of these social dimensions of water management need to be given due recognition alongside the technical in tackling complex water issues the material power of technologically driven development paradigms can shape the subjectivities of participants enrolled in its processes in exploring these processes previous studies have explored the construction of nature culture binaries that underpin dominant approaches to both water management and ecological sustainability tvedt and oestigaard 2010 white 2006 o reilly 2006 examines the shifting identities of women and water as constituted in a water sanitation project in rajasthan arguing that the project s activities construct a shift of value between free government supplied water presented as unhygienic and unreliable and user paid project supplied water presented as modern and safe this is supported by discursive practices that frame participating women as modern with the accompanying technological and social benefits that this gives to their families sultana 2012 continues this exploration of water technologies power to reframe social relations examining the changing role of the tubewell in the context of groundwater arsenic contamination in bangladesh the presence of toxicity and the subsequent classification of tubewells as good or bad marks them as either a continuation of the dominant technological progress narrative or as mal development which troubles the former and instead becomes a source of shame and anxiety for users birkenholtz 2009 focuses on the techno nature assemblage itself by using an actor network analysis of the emergent socio ecological relationships that formed with the expansion of the tubewell through rajasthan his analysis problematises a simple hierarchical causation of technological adaptation and shows the limitations of ascribing agency to humans alone in this case underpinned by social capital or tragedy of the commons approaches instead the paper highlights the importance of the complex and highly localised technical adaptations where agency is constructed of and through such tubewell land farmer assemblages these techno natures explorations are particularly important to consider for the marvi project due to its context in the contact zone between various knowledge systems by examining the relationships between various actors both human and non human we can attempt to get a glimpse of how these can be co constituted through project interventions and in turn how these can shape the interventions themselves taken together the above approaches map out some of the complex terrain in which the current study is situated the first two approaches water knowledge and social constitution of water frames the first section of empirical analysis below and the last approach techno natures frames the second section of relational materialist analysis 3 research approach the study is based on a participatory action research methodology chosen to provide an opportunity for participants to express themselves through photovoice technique keremane and mckay 2011 photovoice is a participatory action research method by which people are supported to take photographs related to a particular problematic situation of interest with these photographs then being used to identify issues and conceptualise what can be done to improve the situation with the intention to represent and eventually enhance their community participatory methods can provide a space and voice for those excluded and an opportunity for them to see themselves as active citizens lundy 2007 while reducing the divide between researcher and community hergenrather et al 2009 this approach relies on the willingness of the community to invest time and energy which is not assured and is a key limiting factor in community based projects carlson et al 2006 in the context of this study the marvi project had previously existing community relationships in the area which were essential on a practical level for fruitful engagement through pursuing novel participatory approaches this study extended and deepened the existing participatory methods in the marvi project maheshwari et al 2014 in this way the study s engagement spans both a vertical empirical approach asking what meanings villagers make from water as well as a horizontal relational materialist approach exploring how villagers and water relate to each other visual methodologies show a strong ability to engage across cultural difference de lange et al 2007 specifically with water issues there is evidence that they can provide insights into successfully engaging people with water bodies such as aquifers that are unseen beneath the surface larson and edsall 2010 photovoice itself encompasses a wide ranging field of image making practices for empowerment and advocacy participants document and co share aspects of their lives through photographs which become participatory sites for storytelling reflection and broader social or policy engagement with issues affecting them wang and burris 1997 participant discussion of images or photo elicitation allows a space for critical reflection wang 1999 from a research perspective it has the potential for the researcher to access glimpses into the community through the respondents eyes lópez et al 2005 further it entrusts cameras in the hands of people to enable them to act as recorders and potential catalysts for social action and change in their own communities while there has been an expansion in the use of photovoice in many areas including health gender place identity over the last two decades lal et al 2012 water and non human relations remains an emerging field for the practice with relevant studies briefly outlined here sajan virgi and mitchell 2011 used photovoice to explore girl s attitudes to water and sanitation in mozambique and highlights the importance of bridging the gap between the individual participant learnings and public policy through the selective dissemination of results levison et al 2012 used photovoice in conjunction with community mapping to analyse the relative importance of water and sanitation facilities in a kenyan community outlining the potential of photovoice for revealing social practices that may otherwise be missed using other techniques keremane and mckay s 2011 exploration of australian irrigators perspectives on water and sustainability fills this gap through using a related photo story technique that included specific participant journaling and workshop discussion these studies highlight the highly variable nature of photovoice projects the importance of reflective processes and underscore the crucial nature of sustained connection with the community photovoice projects that extensively embrace the principles of participatory action research typically feature collaborative research question development as well as photographic analysis such as the process shown below in fig 1 hom 2010 p 245 4 study area the study area was in the udaipur district of rajasthan fig 2 three villages hinta dharta and sundarpura were selected within this area based on the strength of existing relationships with the marvi local partners and proximity to the research base in udaipur city the local partners included the maharana pratap university of agriculture and technology mpuat the ngo vidya bhawan krishi vigyan kendra vbkvk and a network of bhujal jankaars bjs a hindi word meaning groundwater informed the bjs were trained as part of the marvi project to assist in groundwater monitoring and village engagement jadeja et al 2018a 2018b three research staff associated with the marvi project assisted in recruitment of participants workshop facilitation and data collection the participants language was hindi and the marvi staff assisted in the translation of photovoice text and interpretation of discussion during the workshops 5 methodology photovoice methods are flexible and are best adapted to the specific project and community it is recommended to have seven to ten participants per group for photovoice projects to encourage in depth discussions wang 1999 keeping this in mind during the recruitment of photovoice participants a target of 50 bhujal jankaars and 50 women was considered the staff from the marvi project organised for one bhujal jankaar in each village to host the workshops and assisted bjs in recruiting the other participants based on interest most of the males identified as farmers with most women identified as homemakers or students women were younger on average than men each village was engaged in the following photovoice data collection process i photography workshops this workshop introduced the project to the participants and provided a specific supported time for them to take pictures the key research questions each with a number of prompting questions were outlined table 1 together with a very basic overview of camera operations digital cameras were distributed and participants had approximately two hours of shooting time before the images were collected ii photograph analysis workshop the research team returned to the village with the printed photographs and conducted a workshop to facilitate feedback from participants about their photographs wang 1999 outlines a range of prompts that can be used in these workshops due to time constraints the research assistants used the simple prompts of describing i the direct or readily apparent meaning of their images ii any indirect or non obvious meanings and to write these as captions alongside their photographs iii selection of photographs ethics of representation is present in each stage of a photovoice project wang and burris 1997 so to ensure maximum participation in the selection process the following method was followed i participants take photographs ii participants submit their best 20 photographs for printing at conclusion of the first workshop iii at the second workshop participants are given their printed photographs and they make a selection of 10 for adding captions iv participants then choose their top 3 photographs from these 10 v participants select their favourite photograph to hold for a portrait photograph the selection process for photographs while adding time and complexity to the process was important to ensure greater confidence that the selected photographs actually reflected the participants concerns this was especially important given that many did not have any experience using cameras and needed space and time to practice taking pictures first before refining their images photographs were sorted using a combination of visual and textual captions the participants were told to nominate their favourite top three images while most did so a small number had more or less than three images the photovoice workshops ran for approximately two weeks and the findings from these workshops were collated incrementally after each workshop and reviewed at the end of the workshop period the workshops were run in the three locations largely according to the above process there were difficulties in achieving participant targets due to timing and other difficulties these targets were not met table 2 due to the time commitment involved in participation researchers in other studies have provided money photo albums food and gift cards as forms of compensation in photovoice projects hergenrather et al 2009 in this study a modest compensation in the form of books and pens was given which was also intended to facilitate written reflections on the project cornwall 2003 found that it was particularly difficult to recruit women due to cultural barriers to participation they are often excluded even when there are explicit participatory strategies around their involvement however in this study the level of women s participation did successively improve during the workshops which may be partly due to the increased confidence of the marvi staff in the recruitment process the photographs were collected and successively refined by the participants table 3 the final 74 images and their accompanying captions e g photographs 1 3 formed the basis for understanding the key insights related to questions posed to the participants 6 results and discussion 6 1 empirical analysis 6 1 1 key questions based analysis the captions were used to sort the photographs via the key questions outlined in table 4 present future role many photographs could be described as a combination of multiple questions based on semantic consistencies these combinations were grouped under the current understandings 53 future hopes 23 and roles 34 with the latter two categories exhibiting an overlap a further simplification related to current 53 future and role 47 was made to create mutually exclusive categories a number of key differences emerged while there was no significant age influence in choosing images related to future hopes younger participants tended to choose more photographs that emphasised personal or collective responsibility 48 compared to 18 younger participants also tended to emphasise either the future or their role in comparison to the current situation 58 42 for young compared to 35 65 for older a similar difference was found across gender with men tending to place more emphasis on current problems 62 rather than future or responsibility 38 the trend was the opposite with women 35 65 respectively 6 1 2 content based analysis for this second analysis the photographs were sorted visually by their content which represented a variety of built and living things which impacted on or were impacted by water availability the content categories included animals 12 crops 16 infrastructure 55 large scale water infrastructure such as tanks and hand pumps people 55 and domestic 15 small scale water equipment buckets and cups most photographs had combinations of multiple content categories infrastructure was by far the most commonly photographed singular feature 55 overall while there was negligible age difference there was a higher proportion of men 63 compared to women 37 people were the next largest but given the presence of people in many of the locations this could be assumed incidental to the subject while there was negligible gender difference younger participants tended to choose photographs with more people in them than older 68 41 while the number of domestic images was predictably larger for women than men 23 compared to 10 there was an unexpected difference in the number of crop images between men 13 and women 23 contradicting the dominant gender roles of farmer and housewife because of the small samples sizes there are considerable error margins in the above data 6 1 3 thematic analysis the last part of the empirical analysis examined combination of captions and photographs to discern emergent themes some of these themes were pre empted by the prompting questions others emerged independently the far right column represents how much a proportion of the key question response the theme represents while the total reflects of total photographs note that some photographs represent multiple themes and are therefore counted multiple in response to the first current situation key question lack of water has been the largest singular theme 64 with human behaviour predominantly wasting water 18 and problems with infrastructure mostly defective tanks and tubewells 15 being recurrent while there were few age differences women tended to represent these controllable problems behaviour and infrastructure more than men from the future hopes key question the hope for abundant water was the largest 41 followed by the concern of inadequate water 29 female and youth respondents showed a slightly greater proportion of hopeful images regarding the final question of people s responses the message of avoiding water wastage is the most popular 36 adaptations to the current situation straddled all the key questions with infrastructure adaptation most prominently tanks being the most popular 44 older participants had a much stronger preference for infrastructural adaptations 6 2 reflections on empirical analysis the range of data analysed included photographs photograph labels participant social and demographic data and field notes it was observed that the amount and complexity of this data meant there was considerable difficulty in narrowing the scope of what could actually be analysed simultaneously there was no clean and simple divide between data collection analysis and discussion rather we moved between these spaces dynamically and often without clear direction as shown through conklin 2006 analysis of designers responding to complex or wicked problems conklin 2006 quoted in ramos 2013 this presented challenges in adjusting this kind of non linear thinking and this study thus represents only a particular snapshot of the action research spiral that characterises the analysis of this type of complex embedded data hom 2010 from this empirical content based approach photographs are understood as evidence of external reality s dominant common sense view of images characterised by the common adage the camera never lies the power of this approach is in its documentary materiality for example shown by sajan virgi and mitchell 2011 whose project images powerfully show the difficulties that girls in mozambique face with water issues as allen 2011 768 writes of this view regarding youth sexuality data cannot simply be cast as an interpretation but are grounded in an essence that is difficult to refute it means that young people s viewpoints cannot be dismissed as just another perspective but are founded in material existence in the context of this study the photographs are a direct impression of the participant s viewpoint however this positivist perspective has been extensively critiqued as ignoring the social and cultural construction of the image piper and frankham 2007 allen 2011 and that of its reading as pink 2006 124 notes the reality the researcher him or herself sees in the image is framed by her or his own culturally and individually specific subjectivity in response we test an alternative relational analysis 6 3 relational materialist analysis 6 3 1 relational assemblages this analytic approach follows from the broad ontological and epistemological assumptions of the socio natures theoretical strand discussed above agency can be seen as a collective networked outcome performed through socio natural assemblages goodman 2001 in photographic analysis this means exploring ways in which the images imply or reveal these socio natural assemblages it invites us to view them with a non anthropocentric gaze hultman and lenz taguchi 2010 decentring discrete human perception agency and mental activity and looking instead for a relational perspective in which these are co constituted together with natural and technological actors with this approach we can take a different perspective to the following three images from a female participant in hinta village rather than reading with a view to access the participant s beliefs around water we can read them in terms of their relational assemblages in the above images the captions invite an entry point by speaking from a non human position they allow us to read the photograph s subject from multiple non anthropocentric viewpoints which can be seen as different perspectives on the connected assemblages of water crops people animals these multiple vantage points work to displace the i from either human animal crop or well and shift it to the assemblages themselves that are encompassing these different configurations thus opening up a more complex space around how agency acts in around and through the images agency in this view can be seen as an emerging effect of the interactions within and between these assemblages the act of giving or withholding water is only recognisable as such in relation to the actors that are subject to these actions 6 3 2 photographs and human nature perspectives this is a water supply tank and we use it when we need water the water in the tank is safe but the water on the road is a wastage taking a relational materialist reading of photograph 4 taken by a male participant of hinta village we can examine the dynamic effects of human nature assemblages firstly a simple visual inspection shows the clear dominance of the water infrastructure over the human subjects the latter takes most of the frame and regulates the bodily engagement of the latter with their water supply as birkenholtz 2009 demonstrates with the tubewell the engagement requirements of village scale water infrastructure physical access access times quotas and so forth imposes new bodily practices on its users and potentially reconfigures social relations for example to engage with young people who have technical knowledge may increase their social standing secondly the caption invites a particular way of seeing water as good water stored vs bad water wasted aside from the direct relationship that this statement has to the villager s experience we can also consider this in terms of the how the water in the water tank assemblage becomes privileged over wasted water that did not receive technological interventions or that is usable by non humans only development projects through their discursive processes can construct particular forms of water that benefits their interventions and distinguish it as modern vs traditional reliable vs unreliable and so forth as o reilly 2006 demonstrates with privatised vs publically supplied water table 5 at present this is a tubewell constructed by the local government the depth is 250 m deep but it is still dry so constructing more and more tubewells within less areas will result in the groundwater level decreasing the results are in low security of the common man small and medium farmers life will be more difficult the caption of photograph 5 taken by a male participant from hinta village highlights clearly the risks associated with uncoordinated technological development in the form of tubewell proliferation a view which the data in table 6 suggests stands in a minority in comparison to emphasising the lack of water availability itself not only is groundwater reduced but a range of other ecologically damaging effects such as soil alkalisation and fluoridation are also attributed to tubewell proliferation birkenholtz 2009 a basic visual analysis of this photograph shows the complete dominance of the concrete infrastructure associated with tubewells taking up almost the entire frame people and their activities nature and buildings are reduced to tiny objects in the background their absence serves to show mal development where the lauded technological intervention fails and instead becomes a source of shame or anxiety for its users sultana 2012 what differs here from sultana s analysis of arsenic based tubewells is that this mal development expresses itself across the entire assemblage through the natural dry aquifers the human over drilling of tubewells and the technological the failed tubewell itself as such it problematises both these technological interventions as well as their discursive framing such as the key assumption that these tubewells can operate and continually produce water for their users independently of other human or non human actors in such an assemblage plants are grave necessary for humans just like food clothing and houses when there were enough forests there was good rains but at present the requirements of humans are increasing day by day and they are not taking care of the forests we should imagine our future first before cutting the trees photograph 6 was taken by a male participant from dharta village the focal point of the image is on the act of connection between a human and plant in this case providing water simultaneously the second person s hand rests in connection with the diagonal branch from a positivist standpoint this image documents an act between two separate entities human and plant an act which could be seen as representing care from a discrete active participant to a discrete passive one from a relational materialist perspective we can see this in a different way it suggests a horizontal relational rather than a vertical hierarchal reading it is useful to consider here barad s 2007 concept of intra activity describing the dynamic relationship between an organism and matter human or non human which are understood not to have clearly defined boundaries but rather are always in a state of intra activity of becoming hultman and lenz taguchi 2010 the intra activity in the image describes the complex interconnections between the plant and human subjects water flows from human to plant but it is actually impossible to only water a single plant instead the water seeps and spreads across the whole forest via the groundwater table simultaneously transpiration and respiration from the forest absorbs carbon dioxide from humans while providing oxygen from this relational perspective there is no singular subject of the image rather it is capturing the complex assemblage of human plant bucket water flow what is normally seen as a singular act of water becomes diffracted as agency is rendered through the subtle becoming of each these components as they turn into each other in the act of the water flow 6 3 3 visual vs textual analysis initially the photographs by their sheer visual density were more engaging than the text however the latter captions subsequently provided context and meaning making this process was accelerated when it came to analysing multiple photographs for themes coding the images with tags and using spreadsheets for analysis caused the images to recede further into the background inversely it was tempting to privilege the photographs as the most direct representation of the participants given there was no translation involved however the captions although removed provided a participant centred lens in which to view the data giving greater insight than if the researcher alone attempted this with their radically different subject position 6 4 limitations of photographic analysis approaches empirical and relational approaches have different limitations and constraints the empirical analysis may suffer from causation attribution issues although it is clear what the current problems are through content and thematic analysis the combined nature of the future and role based images increases the difficulty of discerning participant intent a key assumption of many of the above conclusions secondly there are data collection issues for instance some of the above proportionally larger proportion of females responding for current infrastructure behaviour problems or representing crop content may be influenced by the women tending to stay together during their photographing in comparison to males who had more freedom to navigate space they can potentially influence each other to take similar images which was observed at times thirdly variable dependency issues for instance the unbalanced number of females from hinta village compared to the others could have enforced a location gender bias for this site finally there are data filtering issues such as the participants photograph selection process being influenced by the facilitators with their particular views on the key questions as this is a dynamic dialogic process with often a high degree of participant prompting aside from the above methodological issues there are broader limitations of the empirical analysis approach development discourse has traditionally been driven by the core emphasis on material based progress particularly focussing on the extent or lack thereof of this specific type of progress a critique of such views as precluding non instrumental ways of knowing has been steadily established over the last two decades of critical scholarship white 2006 tvedt and oestigaard 2010 in the context of this study this manifests through the focus and dominance of groundwater management with its implied assumptions of control and privileging of technological solutions mosse 2009 a number of the participants had been trained in groundwater management through the bhujal jankaars capacity building process and the marvi project staff and their partner organisations are focussed mainly in groundwater management and livelihood improvement the relational materialist approach has differing limitations firstly its resolving ability is constrained in what can be inferred directly regarding the key questions themselves which are framed in viewing what villagers think and feel about water themselves the non anthropocentric approach through broadening the analysis has difficulty addressing these questions directly it cannot approach the clarity of these specific claims that could be made in the positivist framework secondly the subjectivity of the analysis is another potential issue aside from the captions which have already gone through various stages of translations and interpretations the authors interpretations of the images themselves are very removed from their sites of production with only minimal contextual knowledge for guidance there are thus risks from attributing theories or conjectures that overlook the subtleties of the local context 7 concluding remarks this study has attempted to explore some basic questions regarding what water scarcity in general and groundwater over exploitation means to villagers through a participatory photography process as the adage goes a picture is worth a thousand words but this invites the question of which words in this participatory research project designed to explore villagers meanings around groundwater use we employed two different approaches to analyse photo stories taken by village participants to make sense of what participants were communicating through the photovoice process the positivist analysis approach used in the data analysis explored the key questions directly and produced a number of meaningful insights relating to thematic and issue based preferences striated across participant demographics age and gender the study indicated that women and youth tend to emphasise the future and personal responsibility while the men and older participants tend to focus more on current problems unsurprising the lack of water is seen as the overarching challenge alongside specific human behaviour and water infrastructure aspects in the relational materialist approach photo stories were explored using a non anthropomorphic lens resulting in a rich collection of insights into the dimensions of water human animal plant technology aspects by displacing the agency and speaking authority from human subject this approach revealed the interplay between the various actors stakeholders showing how water infrastructures can act to control human actors and how the former s breakdown can shift discursive relations this approach however is benefitted by being anchored by the positivist emphasis on participant voice what villagers think about water themselves the study reveals that both positivist analysis and relational analysis can be complementary to each other and by using both approaches we were able to allow the space for multiple meanings to emerge for current village water scarcity and groundwater exploitation as well as illuminating potential ways forward for future village water security in conclusion photovoice helped villagers to develop their own water meanings and provided opportunities for dialogue among themselves this shaped their overall perception of their water situation self perceptions of their own agency and what they tended to value the most overall the study illustrates that participatory photography is an effective engagement process for understanding complex and wicked problems such as groundwater overexploitation and water scarcity from the point of villagers this method also has the potential for creating community awareness and facilitating collective action to address water resources management issues and challenges in the longer term acknowledgements this research was conducted under the managing aquifer

12275,water access issues pose continual problems for villages in arid areas of rajasthan india and the common response has been technological solutions through water management projects qualitative participatory research can provide alternative approaches to these issues and this article examines role of grassroot activities to develop engagement ownership and vision for local groundwater problems and solutions in rural development projects the study used a participatory photography process to allow villagers to take and select photographs that represented what surface and ground waters meant to them in the present and future along with how they saw their own responsibilities for water security of their villages the visual and textual data was analysed using two different analytical approaches empirical and relational which provided complementary results as well as allowing for exploration of basic questions about what water means to villagers amongst themselves and provided them with an opportunity to make meaning of their water situation what they value the most and what they can do to improve their situation overall the study illustrates that participatory photography is an effective engagement process for understanding complex problems such as groundwater overexploitation and water scarcity from the perspective of villagers this also has the potential to create community awareness and facilitate collective action to address complex natural resources management issues and challenges graphical abstract photovoice for community engagement and collective action to facilitate village water security fx1 keywords participatory research groundwater visualisation sustainability and photography 1 introduction the state of rajasthan in the north west of india has arid conditions with high risks of crop failure associated with unpredictable rains in this context groundwater is particularly precious and has been used in exponentially increasing rates since the 1960s as new pumping technology has become available and accessible water scarcity and crop failure have contributed to decreasing poverty and food insecurity which can be ameliorated by the use of groundwater but only at the cost of depleting precious groundwater reserves shah 2008 in response the indian government is rolling out a large scale national program mnrega mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act which includes recharging groundwater using a range of local infrastructure interventions this study is a part of larger project called marvi managing aquifer recharge and sustaining groundwater use through village level intervention university of western sydney 2010 this study goes beyond technical aspects of groundwater management and examines how the beneficiaries of marvi project viz village communities view water management issues and challenges and possible situation improvement scenarios this study fits within the broad marvi project umbrella using qualitative participatory visual research to explore how villagers in the study area construct meanings of water the context of the inquiry can be thought of in terms of pratt s 1999 concept of a contact zone between the different intersecting knowledge systems following mosse s 2009 discussion of the limitations of the engineering management and indigenous knowledge paradigms with respect to human water relationships the study analyses different activities that take place between these intersecting knowledge systems with their differing relationships with water the mnrega program the marvi project the villagers to name a few each of which map onto different parts of a complex plane spanning modern and traditional ways of knowing as such the study draws on multiple analytic strategies as a way of approaching and illuminating this highly complex area of water management seeking to uncover new perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of each the main aim of this study was to use the photovoice technique to understand the meanings of water for villagers in in the study area and explore what implications exist for the sustainable usage of groundwater currently and in the future in particular the specific objectives of the study are to understand villagers i current local understandings of surface and groundwater supplies availability and security ii future hopes and aspirations regarding groundwater iii perceptions of their own ability to influence local groundwater sustainability 2 understanding the complexity of water issues the importance of water is multifaceted and knowing how water affects people s lives and how they can impact water management is important in any effective intervention to improve longer term water security the importance of the individuals and community articulating and managing shared responsibility for local water management needs to be considered as a complement to technical water management approaches an effective process of articulating water issues and solutions is critical to ensure the success or failure of management interventions diwakara 2005 and van steenbergen 2006 explore the process with respect to trust in local water management more specifically shah 2000 and de groot and tadepally 2008 focus on the ethical foundations of shared water responsibility the former through descriptively analysing groundwater recharge movements and the latter through empirically researching trust perceptions and ngo project success factors the importance of these social dimensions of water management need to be given due recognition alongside the technical in tackling complex water issues the material power of technologically driven development paradigms can shape the subjectivities of participants enrolled in its processes in exploring these processes previous studies have explored the construction of nature culture binaries that underpin dominant approaches to both water management and ecological sustainability tvedt and oestigaard 2010 white 2006 o reilly 2006 examines the shifting identities of women and water as constituted in a water sanitation project in rajasthan arguing that the project s activities construct a shift of value between free government supplied water presented as unhygienic and unreliable and user paid project supplied water presented as modern and safe this is supported by discursive practices that frame participating women as modern with the accompanying technological and social benefits that this gives to their families sultana 2012 continues this exploration of water technologies power to reframe social relations examining the changing role of the tubewell in the context of groundwater arsenic contamination in bangladesh the presence of toxicity and the subsequent classification of tubewells as good or bad marks them as either a continuation of the dominant technological progress narrative or as mal development which troubles the former and instead becomes a source of shame and anxiety for users birkenholtz 2009 focuses on the techno nature assemblage itself by using an actor network analysis of the emergent socio ecological relationships that formed with the expansion of the tubewell through rajasthan his analysis problematises a simple hierarchical causation of technological adaptation and shows the limitations of ascribing agency to humans alone in this case underpinned by social capital or tragedy of the commons approaches instead the paper highlights the importance of the complex and highly localised technical adaptations where agency is constructed of and through such tubewell land farmer assemblages these techno natures explorations are particularly important to consider for the marvi project due to its context in the contact zone between various knowledge systems by examining the relationships between various actors both human and non human we can attempt to get a glimpse of how these can be co constituted through project interventions and in turn how these can shape the interventions themselves taken together the above approaches map out some of the complex terrain in which the current study is situated the first two approaches water knowledge and social constitution of water frames the first section of empirical analysis below and the last approach techno natures frames the second section of relational materialist analysis 3 research approach the study is based on a participatory action research methodology chosen to provide an opportunity for participants to express themselves through photovoice technique keremane and mckay 2011 photovoice is a participatory action research method by which people are supported to take photographs related to a particular problematic situation of interest with these photographs then being used to identify issues and conceptualise what can be done to improve the situation with the intention to represent and eventually enhance their community participatory methods can provide a space and voice for those excluded and an opportunity for them to see themselves as active citizens lundy 2007 while reducing the divide between researcher and community hergenrather et al 2009 this approach relies on the willingness of the community to invest time and energy which is not assured and is a key limiting factor in community based projects carlson et al 2006 in the context of this study the marvi project had previously existing community relationships in the area which were essential on a practical level for fruitful engagement through pursuing novel participatory approaches this study extended and deepened the existing participatory methods in the marvi project maheshwari et al 2014 in this way the study s engagement spans both a vertical empirical approach asking what meanings villagers make from water as well as a horizontal relational materialist approach exploring how villagers and water relate to each other visual methodologies show a strong ability to engage across cultural difference de lange et al 2007 specifically with water issues there is evidence that they can provide insights into successfully engaging people with water bodies such as aquifers that are unseen beneath the surface larson and edsall 2010 photovoice itself encompasses a wide ranging field of image making practices for empowerment and advocacy participants document and co share aspects of their lives through photographs which become participatory sites for storytelling reflection and broader social or policy engagement with issues affecting them wang and burris 1997 participant discussion of images or photo elicitation allows a space for critical reflection wang 1999 from a research perspective it has the potential for the researcher to access glimpses into the community through the respondents eyes lópez et al 2005 further it entrusts cameras in the hands of people to enable them to act as recorders and potential catalysts for social action and change in their own communities while there has been an expansion in the use of photovoice in many areas including health gender place identity over the last two decades lal et al 2012 water and non human relations remains an emerging field for the practice with relevant studies briefly outlined here sajan virgi and mitchell 2011 used photovoice to explore girl s attitudes to water and sanitation in mozambique and highlights the importance of bridging the gap between the individual participant learnings and public policy through the selective dissemination of results levison et al 2012 used photovoice in conjunction with community mapping to analyse the relative importance of water and sanitation facilities in a kenyan community outlining the potential of photovoice for revealing social practices that may otherwise be missed using other techniques keremane and mckay s 2011 exploration of australian irrigators perspectives on water and sustainability fills this gap through using a related photo story technique that included specific participant journaling and workshop discussion these studies highlight the highly variable nature of photovoice projects the importance of reflective processes and underscore the crucial nature of sustained connection with the community photovoice projects that extensively embrace the principles of participatory action research typically feature collaborative research question development as well as photographic analysis such as the process shown below in fig 1 hom 2010 p 245 4 study area the study area was in the udaipur district of rajasthan fig 2 three villages hinta dharta and sundarpura were selected within this area based on the strength of existing relationships with the marvi local partners and proximity to the research base in udaipur city the local partners included the maharana pratap university of agriculture and technology mpuat the ngo vidya bhawan krishi vigyan kendra vbkvk and a network of bhujal jankaars bjs a hindi word meaning groundwater informed the bjs were trained as part of the marvi project to assist in groundwater monitoring and village engagement jadeja et al 2018a 2018b three research staff associated with the marvi project assisted in recruitment of participants workshop facilitation and data collection the participants language was hindi and the marvi staff assisted in the translation of photovoice text and interpretation of discussion during the workshops 5 methodology photovoice methods are flexible and are best adapted to the specific project and community it is recommended to have seven to ten participants per group for photovoice projects to encourage in depth discussions wang 1999 keeping this in mind during the recruitment of photovoice participants a target of 50 bhujal jankaars and 50 women was considered the staff from the marvi project organised for one bhujal jankaar in each village to host the workshops and assisted bjs in recruiting the other participants based on interest most of the males identified as farmers with most women identified as homemakers or students women were younger on average than men each village was engaged in the following photovoice data collection process i photography workshops this workshop introduced the project to the participants and provided a specific supported time for them to take pictures the key research questions each with a number of prompting questions were outlined table 1 together with a very basic overview of camera operations digital cameras were distributed and participants had approximately two hours of shooting time before the images were collected ii photograph analysis workshop the research team returned to the village with the printed photographs and conducted a workshop to facilitate feedback from participants about their photographs wang 1999 outlines a range of prompts that can be used in these workshops due to time constraints the research assistants used the simple prompts of describing i the direct or readily apparent meaning of their images ii any indirect or non obvious meanings and to write these as captions alongside their photographs iii selection of photographs ethics of representation is present in each stage of a photovoice project wang and burris 1997 so to ensure maximum participation in the selection process the following method was followed i participants take photographs ii participants submit their best 20 photographs for printing at conclusion of the first workshop iii at the second workshop participants are given their printed photographs and they make a selection of 10 for adding captions iv participants then choose their top 3 photographs from these 10 v participants select their favourite photograph to hold for a portrait photograph the selection process for photographs while adding time and complexity to the process was important to ensure greater confidence that the selected photographs actually reflected the participants concerns this was especially important given that many did not have any experience using cameras and needed space and time to practice taking pictures first before refining their images photographs were sorted using a combination of visual and textual captions the participants were told to nominate their favourite top three images while most did so a small number had more or less than three images the photovoice workshops ran for approximately two weeks and the findings from these workshops were collated incrementally after each workshop and reviewed at the end of the workshop period the workshops were run in the three locations largely according to the above process there were difficulties in achieving participant targets due to timing and other difficulties these targets were not met table 2 due to the time commitment involved in participation researchers in other studies have provided money photo albums food and gift cards as forms of compensation in photovoice projects hergenrather et al 2009 in this study a modest compensation in the form of books and pens was given which was also intended to facilitate written reflections on the project cornwall 2003 found that it was particularly difficult to recruit women due to cultural barriers to participation they are often excluded even when there are explicit participatory strategies around their involvement however in this study the level of women s participation did successively improve during the workshops which may be partly due to the increased confidence of the marvi staff in the recruitment process the photographs were collected and successively refined by the participants table 3 the final 74 images and their accompanying captions e g photographs 1 3 formed the basis for understanding the key insights related to questions posed to the participants 6 results and discussion 6 1 empirical analysis 6 1 1 key questions based analysis the captions were used to sort the photographs via the key questions outlined in table 4 present future role many photographs could be described as a combination of multiple questions based on semantic consistencies these combinations were grouped under the current understandings 53 future hopes 23 and roles 34 with the latter two categories exhibiting an overlap a further simplification related to current 53 future and role 47 was made to create mutually exclusive categories a number of key differences emerged while there was no significant age influence in choosing images related to future hopes younger participants tended to choose more photographs that emphasised personal or collective responsibility 48 compared to 18 younger participants also tended to emphasise either the future or their role in comparison to the current situation 58 42 for young compared to 35 65 for older a similar difference was found across gender with men tending to place more emphasis on current problems 62 rather than future or responsibility 38 the trend was the opposite with women 35 65 respectively 6 1 2 content based analysis for this second analysis the photographs were sorted visually by their content which represented a variety of built and living things which impacted on or were impacted by water availability the content categories included animals 12 crops 16 infrastructure 55 large scale water infrastructure such as tanks and hand pumps people 55 and domestic 15 small scale water equipment buckets and cups most photographs had combinations of multiple content categories infrastructure was by far the most commonly photographed singular feature 55 overall while there was negligible age difference there was a higher proportion of men 63 compared to women 37 people were the next largest but given the presence of people in many of the locations this could be assumed incidental to the subject while there was negligible gender difference younger participants tended to choose photographs with more people in them than older 68 41 while the number of domestic images was predictably larger for women than men 23 compared to 10 there was an unexpected difference in the number of crop images between men 13 and women 23 contradicting the dominant gender roles of farmer and housewife because of the small samples sizes there are considerable error margins in the above data 6 1 3 thematic analysis the last part of the empirical analysis examined combination of captions and photographs to discern emergent themes some of these themes were pre empted by the prompting questions others emerged independently the far right column represents how much a proportion of the key question response the theme represents while the total reflects of total photographs note that some photographs represent multiple themes and are therefore counted multiple in response to the first current situation key question lack of water has been the largest singular theme 64 with human behaviour predominantly wasting water 18 and problems with infrastructure mostly defective tanks and tubewells 15 being recurrent while there were few age differences women tended to represent these controllable problems behaviour and infrastructure more than men from the future hopes key question the hope for abundant water was the largest 41 followed by the concern of inadequate water 29 female and youth respondents showed a slightly greater proportion of hopeful images regarding the final question of people s responses the message of avoiding water wastage is the most popular 36 adaptations to the current situation straddled all the key questions with infrastructure adaptation most prominently tanks being the most popular 44 older participants had a much stronger preference for infrastructural adaptations 6 2 reflections on empirical analysis the range of data analysed included photographs photograph labels participant social and demographic data and field notes it was observed that the amount and complexity of this data meant there was considerable difficulty in narrowing the scope of what could actually be analysed simultaneously there was no clean and simple divide between data collection analysis and discussion rather we moved between these spaces dynamically and often without clear direction as shown through conklin 2006 analysis of designers responding to complex or wicked problems conklin 2006 quoted in ramos 2013 this presented challenges in adjusting this kind of non linear thinking and this study thus represents only a particular snapshot of the action research spiral that characterises the analysis of this type of complex embedded data hom 2010 from this empirical content based approach photographs are understood as evidence of external reality s dominant common sense view of images characterised by the common adage the camera never lies the power of this approach is in its documentary materiality for example shown by sajan virgi and mitchell 2011 whose project images powerfully show the difficulties that girls in mozambique face with water issues as allen 2011 768 writes of this view regarding youth sexuality data cannot simply be cast as an interpretation but are grounded in an essence that is difficult to refute it means that young people s viewpoints cannot be dismissed as just another perspective but are founded in material existence in the context of this study the photographs are a direct impression of the participant s viewpoint however this positivist perspective has been extensively critiqued as ignoring the social and cultural construction of the image piper and frankham 2007 allen 2011 and that of its reading as pink 2006 124 notes the reality the researcher him or herself sees in the image is framed by her or his own culturally and individually specific subjectivity in response we test an alternative relational analysis 6 3 relational materialist analysis 6 3 1 relational assemblages this analytic approach follows from the broad ontological and epistemological assumptions of the socio natures theoretical strand discussed above agency can be seen as a collective networked outcome performed through socio natural assemblages goodman 2001 in photographic analysis this means exploring ways in which the images imply or reveal these socio natural assemblages it invites us to view them with a non anthropocentric gaze hultman and lenz taguchi 2010 decentring discrete human perception agency and mental activity and looking instead for a relational perspective in which these are co constituted together with natural and technological actors with this approach we can take a different perspective to the following three images from a female participant in hinta village rather than reading with a view to access the participant s beliefs around water we can read them in terms of their relational assemblages in the above images the captions invite an entry point by speaking from a non human position they allow us to read the photograph s subject from multiple non anthropocentric viewpoints which can be seen as different perspectives on the connected assemblages of water crops people animals these multiple vantage points work to displace the i from either human animal crop or well and shift it to the assemblages themselves that are encompassing these different configurations thus opening up a more complex space around how agency acts in around and through the images agency in this view can be seen as an emerging effect of the interactions within and between these assemblages the act of giving or withholding water is only recognisable as such in relation to the actors that are subject to these actions 6 3 2 photographs and human nature perspectives this is a water supply tank and we use it when we need water the water in the tank is safe but the water on the road is a wastage taking a relational materialist reading of photograph 4 taken by a male participant of hinta village we can examine the dynamic effects of human nature assemblages firstly a simple visual inspection shows the clear dominance of the water infrastructure over the human subjects the latter takes most of the frame and regulates the bodily engagement of the latter with their water supply as birkenholtz 2009 demonstrates with the tubewell the engagement requirements of village scale water infrastructure physical access access times quotas and so forth imposes new bodily practices on its users and potentially reconfigures social relations for example to engage with young people who have technical knowledge may increase their social standing secondly the caption invites a particular way of seeing water as good water stored vs bad water wasted aside from the direct relationship that this statement has to the villager s experience we can also consider this in terms of the how the water in the water tank assemblage becomes privileged over wasted water that did not receive technological interventions or that is usable by non humans only development projects through their discursive processes can construct particular forms of water that benefits their interventions and distinguish it as modern vs traditional reliable vs unreliable and so forth as o reilly 2006 demonstrates with privatised vs publically supplied water table 5 at present this is a tubewell constructed by the local government the depth is 250 m deep but it is still dry so constructing more and more tubewells within less areas will result in the groundwater level decreasing the results are in low security of the common man small and medium farmers life will be more difficult the caption of photograph 5 taken by a male participant from hinta village highlights clearly the risks associated with uncoordinated technological development in the form of tubewell proliferation a view which the data in table 6 suggests stands in a minority in comparison to emphasising the lack of water availability itself not only is groundwater reduced but a range of other ecologically damaging effects such as soil alkalisation and fluoridation are also attributed to tubewell proliferation birkenholtz 2009 a basic visual analysis of this photograph shows the complete dominance of the concrete infrastructure associated with tubewells taking up almost the entire frame people and their activities nature and buildings are reduced to tiny objects in the background their absence serves to show mal development where the lauded technological intervention fails and instead becomes a source of shame or anxiety for its users sultana 2012 what differs here from sultana s analysis of arsenic based tubewells is that this mal development expresses itself across the entire assemblage through the natural dry aquifers the human over drilling of tubewells and the technological the failed tubewell itself as such it problematises both these technological interventions as well as their discursive framing such as the key assumption that these tubewells can operate and continually produce water for their users independently of other human or non human actors in such an assemblage plants are grave necessary for humans just like food clothing and houses when there were enough forests there was good rains but at present the requirements of humans are increasing day by day and they are not taking care of the forests we should imagine our future first before cutting the trees photograph 6 was taken by a male participant from dharta village the focal point of the image is on the act of connection between a human and plant in this case providing water simultaneously the second person s hand rests in connection with the diagonal branch from a positivist standpoint this image documents an act between two separate entities human and plant an act which could be seen as representing care from a discrete active participant to a discrete passive one from a relational materialist perspective we can see this in a different way it suggests a horizontal relational rather than a vertical hierarchal reading it is useful to consider here barad s 2007 concept of intra activity describing the dynamic relationship between an organism and matter human or non human which are understood not to have clearly defined boundaries but rather are always in a state of intra activity of becoming hultman and lenz taguchi 2010 the intra activity in the image describes the complex interconnections between the plant and human subjects water flows from human to plant but it is actually impossible to only water a single plant instead the water seeps and spreads across the whole forest via the groundwater table simultaneously transpiration and respiration from the forest absorbs carbon dioxide from humans while providing oxygen from this relational perspective there is no singular subject of the image rather it is capturing the complex assemblage of human plant bucket water flow what is normally seen as a singular act of water becomes diffracted as agency is rendered through the subtle becoming of each these components as they turn into each other in the act of the water flow 6 3 3 visual vs textual analysis initially the photographs by their sheer visual density were more engaging than the text however the latter captions subsequently provided context and meaning making this process was accelerated when it came to analysing multiple photographs for themes coding the images with tags and using spreadsheets for analysis caused the images to recede further into the background inversely it was tempting to privilege the photographs as the most direct representation of the participants given there was no translation involved however the captions although removed provided a participant centred lens in which to view the data giving greater insight than if the researcher alone attempted this with their radically different subject position 6 4 limitations of photographic analysis approaches empirical and relational approaches have different limitations and constraints the empirical analysis may suffer from causation attribution issues although it is clear what the current problems are through content and thematic analysis the combined nature of the future and role based images increases the difficulty of discerning participant intent a key assumption of many of the above conclusions secondly there are data collection issues for instance some of the above proportionally larger proportion of females responding for current infrastructure behaviour problems or representing crop content may be influenced by the women tending to stay together during their photographing in comparison to males who had more freedom to navigate space they can potentially influence each other to take similar images which was observed at times thirdly variable dependency issues for instance the unbalanced number of females from hinta village compared to the others could have enforced a location gender bias for this site finally there are data filtering issues such as the participants photograph selection process being influenced by the facilitators with their particular views on the key questions as this is a dynamic dialogic process with often a high degree of participant prompting aside from the above methodological issues there are broader limitations of the empirical analysis approach development discourse has traditionally been driven by the core emphasis on material based progress particularly focussing on the extent or lack thereof of this specific type of progress a critique of such views as precluding non instrumental ways of knowing has been steadily established over the last two decades of critical scholarship white 2006 tvedt and oestigaard 2010 in the context of this study this manifests through the focus and dominance of groundwater management with its implied assumptions of control and privileging of technological solutions mosse 2009 a number of the participants had been trained in groundwater management through the bhujal jankaars capacity building process and the marvi project staff and their partner organisations are focussed mainly in groundwater management and livelihood improvement the relational materialist approach has differing limitations firstly its resolving ability is constrained in what can be inferred directly regarding the key questions themselves which are framed in viewing what villagers think and feel about water themselves the non anthropocentric approach through broadening the analysis has difficulty addressing these questions directly it cannot approach the clarity of these specific claims that could be made in the positivist framework secondly the subjectivity of the analysis is another potential issue aside from the captions which have already gone through various stages of translations and interpretations the authors interpretations of the images themselves are very removed from their sites of production with only minimal contextual knowledge for guidance there are thus risks from attributing theories or conjectures that overlook the subtleties of the local context 7 concluding remarks this study has attempted to explore some basic questions regarding what water scarcity in general and groundwater over exploitation means to villagers through a participatory photography process as the adage goes a picture is worth a thousand words but this invites the question of which words in this participatory research project designed to explore villagers meanings around groundwater use we employed two different approaches to analyse photo stories taken by village participants to make sense of what participants were communicating through the photovoice process the positivist analysis approach used in the data analysis explored the key questions directly and produced a number of meaningful insights relating to thematic and issue based preferences striated across participant demographics age and gender the study indicated that women and youth tend to emphasise the future and personal responsibility while the men and older participants tend to focus more on current problems unsurprising the lack of water is seen as the overarching challenge alongside specific human behaviour and water infrastructure aspects in the relational materialist approach photo stories were explored using a non anthropomorphic lens resulting in a rich collection of insights into the dimensions of water human animal plant technology aspects by displacing the agency and speaking authority from human subject this approach revealed the interplay between the various actors stakeholders showing how water infrastructures can act to control human actors and how the former s breakdown can shift discursive relations this approach however is benefitted by being anchored by the positivist emphasis on participant voice what villagers think about water themselves the study reveals that both positivist analysis and relational analysis can be complementary to each other and by using both approaches we were able to allow the space for multiple meanings to emerge for current village water scarcity and groundwater exploitation as well as illuminating potential ways forward for future village water security in conclusion photovoice helped villagers to develop their own water meanings and provided opportunities for dialogue among themselves this shaped their overall perception of their water situation self perceptions of their own agency and what they tended to value the most overall the study illustrates that participatory photography is an effective engagement process for understanding complex and wicked problems such as groundwater overexploitation and water scarcity from the point of villagers this method also has the potential for creating community awareness and facilitating collective action to address water resources management issues and challenges in the longer term acknowledgements this research was conducted under the managing aquifer

12276,in this study chemically modified cystoseira indica brown algae by xanthation method was utilized to study the biosorption of la iii and ce iii ions from the aqueous solutions under batch mode the effects of four variables including ph 2 6 temperature 25 55 c biosorbent dosage 0 5 2 5 g l 1 and initial metal concentration 50 250 mg l 1 were evaluated and optimized using response surface methodology rsm based on the central composite design ccd a low p value and high coefficient of determination r2 implied the accuracy and validity of the proposed quadratic models the results showed that the xanthation improved the performance of c indica than the intact and ca pretreated ones performing experiments under optimal condition sets produced maximum biosorption capacities of 185 44 and 172 33 mg g 1 for la iii and ce iii respectively in order to characterize the provided biosorbents ftir analyses were carried out results revealed that the dominant functional groups in the binding process were hydroxyl carboxyl and amide in the intact algae while xanthation caused addition of sulfur groups that participated in binding process and increased the sorption capacities of both metal ions the equilibrium and kinetic studies revealed that the freundlich isotherm model and the double exponential kinetic model were in the better fitness with the la iii and ce iii experimental data moreover the results showed that the presence of th iv ions decreased the biosorption capacities of both metal ions in conclusion the present work showed that the xanthated c indica could be a proper biosorbent for la iii and ce iii biosorption from aqueous solutions graphical abstract fx1 keywords biosorption la iii ce iii cystoseira indica xanthation response surface methodology 1 introduction the lanthanides include the 15 elements from lanthanum to lutetium they have received increasing interest due to their correspondingly growth application in high tech industries such as nuclear energy ceramics green energy sector medicine defense industry super magnets and superconductors hosomomi 2016 they are member of the technology critical elements and owing to their distinct characteristics it is impossible to replace them by other elements in many key technologies naturally lanthanides occur mainly in the trivalent oxidation state and behave chemically quite similarly but not entirely blinova 2018 from the lanthanide elements lanthanum iii has received increasing uses as a pure element or in association with other compounds for new advanced materials in fluorescent devices super alloys catalysts and special ceramics and in organic synthesis fields due to its special physical and chemical properties das et al 2014 furthermore cerium iii element has some well established utilization in industries usually high purity of cerium is required for its usage for example control of sulfur content in steel control of pollution in cars and oil refineries catalyst immobilization ceramic and alloys preparation etc torab mostaedi 2015 lanthanides can enter the environment in large quantities and are known to accumulate in the human body when inhaled or digested from food chain chen 2010 so there is a continuous effort for the processing of aqueous solutions bearing rare earth elements and removal of them from industrial effluents is a hot topic in the environmental research field sohbatzadeh 2016 there are several methods including ion exchange adsorption solvent extraction precipitation reverse osmosis membrane separation and electrochemical to remove the metal ions from aqueous solutions torab mostaedi 2015 chen 2010 wang et al 2018 besides being high cost processes these technologies produce secondary problems by generating metal bearing sludge furthermore the efficiency of mentioned processes diminishes when the concentration of the metal ions in the solution is less than 100 mg m 3 vafajoo 2018 biosorption which employs various biological materials has been heralded as a promising alternative process for removing metal ions from polluted solutions sohbatzadeh 2016 it includes passive mechanisms of metal binding that are not driven by metabolism kumar et al 2016 the main preference for this technology is its abundant materials low cost high efficiency and potential of metal recovery removal zeraatkar 2016 among the various biosorbent materials non living algae have been utilized for the processing of the dilute effluents solutions with high efficiency due to low cost metal binding properties reusability and high specific surface area besides these materials are available in much higher quantities in comparison with other adsorbents such as activated carbon natural zeolite and ion exchange resins vafajoo 2018 algae s functionality is attributable to the presence of numerous functionalized groups amino carboxyl sulphate and hydroxyl in their cell walls which have an imperative role in the biosorption of heavy metals ali 2018 cystoseira indica is a marine brown alga in the gulf of oman along the coast of chabahar iran previous studies confirmed that it is able to adsorb radionuclides and toxic heavy metals such as thorium uranium chromium copper and nickel because of its special cell wall structure riazi et al 2016 ghasemi 2011 basha et al 2009 basha and murthy 2007 in order to improve the base biosorbents performance their modification becomes inevitable modification of biosorbent can be performed using physical and or chemical pretreatments sorbent physical pretreatments can be achieved through the cutting grinding thermal drying autoclaving steaming and lyophilization chemical modification includes pretreatment of sorbents with chemicals e g cacl2 koh nacl h2o2 and na2co3 rwiza 2018 it is confirmed that the sorbent containing sulfur bearing functional group shows a high affinity for metal ions various sulfur bearing compounds include sulfides thiols dithiocarbamates dithiophosphates and xanthates of them xanthation is especially excellent due to easy preparation from relatively inexpensive reagents high insolubility and formation of stable xanthate metal ions complex bediako 2015 xanthation of algae occurs through the reaction of an hydroxyl containing groups on the surface of algae with carbon disulfide in the presence of naoh janusa 2000 it goes without saying that this method is rarely used xanthated algae was first utilized for the removal of lead by undaria pinnatifida according to hsab hard and soft acids and bases classification system sulfur atom unlike the oxygen atom can be classified as a soft ligand that have strong affinity with the most heavy metals which are soft acids kim 1999 in recent years xanthate functionalized biosorbents have been utilized to sorb various metal ions from aqueous solutions for example biosorption of cd ii qu 2017 cu ii kostić 2016 pb ii torres blancas 2013 and cr vi

adsorption ability and chemical modification using surface functionalization technique capability it is a proper option to choose as the base biosorbent furthermore simplicity and significance of xanthation on biosorption ability caused to choose it as the chemical modification process in recent years utilization of statistical design of experiments has been increased for the process modeling identification of parameters interactions and optimization for example biosorption of pb ii wang et al 2018 u vi sohbatzadeh 2016 cu ii ni ii zn ii sarkar and majumdar 2011 and cr vi by celloluse

naoh were purchased from sigma aldrich the solutions of la iii and ce iii ions were prepared from lanthanum nitrate la no3 3 6h2o and cerium nitrate ce no3 3 6h2o salts sigma aldrich in deionized water respectively 2 2 preparation and chemical pre treatments of biosorbent brown alga of c indica was obtained from the chabahar coast iran the biomass was washed with distilled water several times to remove sand and other impurities and then dried in an oven for 18 h at 60 c after crushing in a mortar it was sorted by sieving using the standard test sieves the batch of biomass with particle size 1 2 mm was selected for subsequent pretreatments for preparation of the calcium pretreated biomass 10 g of sorted biomass was added in 1 l of 0 1 m cacl2 2h2o and then stirred in a rotary shaker 150 rpm at 25 c for 3 h keshtkar et al 2015 furthermore xanthation of c indica with naoh solution and carbon disulfide cs2 was carried out to prepare c indica xanthate for treatment 20 g of sorted biomass was mixed with 300 ml of 4 m naoh and stirred for 2 h at 30 c then 20 ml of cs2 was added and allowed to react for 3 h panda et al 2008 then the both treated algae were filtered from solutions the algae were washed with distilled water until the ph of washing effluents remained stable finally the algae were dried in an oven for 18 h at 60 c 2 3 batch biosorption experiment and the analysis the batch experiments were carried out in 100 ml flasks containing 50 ml la iii and ce iii solutions with the known initial concentration ph temperature and the dosage of biomass at 150 rpm in a shaker incubator it was seen no significant variation in the sorbate concentrations of solutions after 240 min except for kinetic studies therefore la iii and ce iii sorption reached equilibrium state until 8 h for all cases the ph of solution was adjusted with 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hno3 solutions after equilibrium attainment the samples were filtered and the concentration of the metals in the remaining solution was analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes perkin elmer optima 2100 and usa the biosorption capacities of the metals or the amounts of the metal ions adsorbed per unit of dry biosorbent mg g 1 in equilibrium were calculated using the following equation sohbatzadeh 2017 1 q e c 0 c e v m where c0 and ce mg l 1 are the initial and equilibrium metal ions concentrations respectively v l is the volume of the solution and m g is the dry weight of biosorbent all experiments were conducted in duplicate in order to identify the possible functional groups and binding sites existed in the surface of the biosorbents before and after of biosorption the samples were analyzed by fourier transform infrared ftir spectrophotometer ftir spectra were obtained via spectrometer bruker vector 22 and germany at a resolution of 4 cm 1 and wave numbers between 4000 and 400 cm 1 furthermore the zero point charge phzpc was performed to complete the biosorbents physicochemical characterization the phzpc of the xanthated algae was determined according to the our former study sohbatzadeh 2017 the initial ph value of 25 ml suspension of 0 1 m nacl containing 0 5 g l 1 sorbent was adjusted from 3 to 10 using either 0 1 m naoh or hno3 the solution was agitated at 25 c for 24 h and the final ph of the supernatant liquid was recorded the initial and final ph value differences δph were plotted against the initial ph values 2 4 preliminary evaluation a set of preliminary experiments was conducted to study the impact of different pretreatments on algae s sorption performance for this purpose the uptake capacities of la iii and ce iii on the intact algae ca pretreated algae and xanthated algae were investigated 2 5 experimental design with the aim of avoiding the traditional trials one factor at a time along with optimizing a process by means of individual and interactive effects of independent variables simultaneously the design of experiment doe can be applied for over their entire space and subsequently building a mathematical model sohbatzadeh 2016 among the most pertinent multivariate techniques rsm a combination of mathematical and statistical techniques has been broadly employed as a designing experiments technique the mathematical relation between a number of independent variables and one or more responses can be described using rsm which is commonly applied to investigate the response over the entire variables space and to discover where it achieves the optimum value ding and sartaj 2015 the four independent variables including ph a temperature b initial metal concentration c and biosorbent dosage d were studied at five levels labeled as 1 0 1 the ranges of variables were selected based on the previous studies varsihini et al 2014 a set of 30 experiments was performed using ccd table 1 for each metal 2k factorial 2k axial 6 center so that k was the number of independent variables k 4 with 16 factorial points 8 axial points and 6 central points the experimental error was estimated by the repeated center point özer 2008 a polynomial equation with higher degree such as quadratic model usually be used to describe the process according to the following equation ding and sartaj 2015 2 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β ii x i 2 i j k β ij x i x j ε where y is the predicated response β 0 is the constant coefficient β i β ij and β ii represent the interaction coefficients of linear second order and quadratic effects terms respectively x i and x j are the independent variables i 1 4 j 1 4 i j k is the number of independent variable and the final term ε shows the random error the analysis of variance anova was used for evaluating the accuracy and fitness of the model and identifying the significant variables mosleh 2018 jafari 2018 asfaram 2018 mosleh 2017 nasiri azad 2016 2 6 desorption studies for enhancement of industrial applications of any biosorbent the regeneration and subsequent reuse of the undiminished metal ions uptake biosorbent is an important issue the efficient desorption should yield the biosorbed metal ions completely in a concentrated form and regenerate the biosorbent close to the fresh form moreover a proper eluent must be effective cheap and without any damaging the biosorbent structure and binding sites to be able to reuse it ghasemi 2011 desorption experiments were carried out in a similar manner to the biosorption studies in five consecutive sorption desorption cycles after biosorption process la iii and ce iii loaded biosorbents were filtered dried weighted and shaken with 50 ml of 0 1 m hcl as elution agent in 100 ml flasks at optimal values of variables for maximum biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii table 3 after desorption the filtered biosorbent was washed with distilled water dried and used for next biosorption and the concentration of the metals in the supernatant solution was analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary evaluation as shown in fig 1 the intact c indica reveal high la iii and ce iii biosorption capacities moreover it was confirmed that pretreatments of biomass enhanced the algae sorption activity toward la iii and ce iii these results demonstrated that the c indica could be utilized as an elaborated biosorbent for la iii and ce iii biosorption using proper pretreatment as can be seen the larger value of biosorption capacity of the xanthated biomass compared with the ca pretreated one exhibited that the xanthated algae has higher affinity to la iii and ce iii than ca pretreated algae therefore the xanthated algae were used as the selected biosorbent for the rest of experiments 3 2 modeling using rsm the main and interactive effects of four independent variables including initial solution ph temperature initial metal ions concentration and biosorbent dosage on la iii and ce iii biosorption were studied with rsm according to the ccd the ccd proposed matrix of actual values for independent variables together with the experimental results are shown in table 1 with the purpose of developing a mathematical relationship between actual factors and response multiple regression analysis was applied and the best quadratic models for la iii and ce iii biosorption were attained as eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 q e la iii 47 37051 53 67458 ph 2 34013 temp 0

interaction factors the quadratic terms consist of a2 b2 c2 and d2 table 2 summarizes the results of analysis of variance anova to evaluate the adequacy and fitness of the proposed models which includes coefficient of determination r2 f value and p value generally the higher f value and the p value less than 0 05 in the anova results indicate that the independent variables are significant at 95 α 0 05 confidence level sohbatzadeh 2016 mousavinia 2016 mosleh 2016a 2016b jamshidi 2016 ghaedi 2016 nasiri azad 2015 jamshidi 2015a 2015b as shown in table 2 the f values 24 04 and 67 20 for la iii and ce iii along with a low probability values p 0 0001 demonstrate that the proposed models are significant the obtained f values of the both models in comparison to the critical f value f α df n df 1 f 0 05 14 15 2 42 were very large therefore the calculated fisher s variance ratio at this level confirms a very high degree of reliance of quadratic models singh 2011 according to the anova r2 were 0 9573 and 0 9843 for la iii and ce iii biosorption models respectively which implied that these models could establish appropriate correlation between the independent variables and responses moreover the values of r2 adj for la iii and ce iii were 0 9175 and 0 9697 respectively exhibiting that for la iii and ce iii only less than 9 and 4 of the variation could not be described by the models ding and sartaj 2015 the adequate precision which describes the signal to noise ratio were 16 688 and 29 136 for la iii and ce iii respectively while a value of greater than 4 indicates an adequate signal wang et al 2018 as indicated in table 2 it is inevitable that the both models were significantly affected by the three first orders of independent variables including ph initial concentration and biosorbent dosage p value 0 05 while the temperature had a little effect on the responses therefore it was identified as insignificant factor p value 0 1 similarly the quadratic terms ph ph2 for both models and initial concentration c0 2 for ce iii were significant furthermore all the interaction terms along with the remained quadratic terms were identified as insignificant terms based on the f value of first order of independent variables it was found that the main effects of independent variables on biosorption capacities for la iii and ce iii followed the below sequence initial concentration biosorbent dosage ph temperature 3 3 effects of process variables the rsm was used to assess the effects of independent variables as well as their interaction using 3d graphs the effects of ph and biosorbent dosage along with the interactive behavior of them are depicted in fig 2 a and b it was seen that the biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii were under the influence of the solution ph this behavior is due mainly to effect of the initial ph on the protonation state of functional groups existing in the biosorbent which can retain or release protons to the solution depending on its acidity constant pka as well as the solubility and distribution of metal ions species in the aqueous solution castro 2017 by adjusting the ph to 2 a little metal sorption for la iii and ce iii were occurred the explanation of this phenomenon is related to the presence of abundant h ions in the solutions that compete with la iii and ce iii ions which mainly consist of la 3 ponou 2014 and ce 3 nakada 2017 species respectively in addition characterization experiments confirmed that the xanthated algae has phpzc at 5 95 therefore the charge of the sorbent became positive at ph 2 causing the electrostatic repulsion between the protonated functional groups such as xanthate and cationic metal ions in acidic medium simultaneously wang et al 2018 liu 2013 as the ph rises the biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii increased up to 5 2 and 5 0 respectively because the net charge of biosorbent turns out to be less positive and deprotonated binding sites are prepared to stimulate electrostatic attraction with the metal ions roosta 2014 along with the reduction in the amount of h ions at the higher ph the uptake performance of biosorbent did not change significantly this behavior is due to the hydrolysis reaction of metals which produces ionic complexes of la oh 2 and ce oh 2 resulting in a decrease in la iii and ce iii ions this complex reduces the availability of the metal ions for biosorption ponou 2014 second sulfur groups are soft ligands and an acidic solution creates instability and separates them from alginic acid so biosorption capacity decreases by elimination of sulfur kim 1999 also it was observed that the biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii decreased by increasing the amount of biosorbent dosage from 0 5 to 2 5 g l 1 and vice versa it is confirmed that the higher biosorbent dosage leads to a decrease in metal uptake where the metal ions are distributed among larger amount of available binding sites leading some binding sites remain unsaturated at lower biosorbent dosage the available binding sites were rapidly saturated with the adsorbed metal ions due to the lower adsorbent binding site ratio leading to a larger amount of qe sohbatzadeh 2016 similar observations were obtained in studies on pb ii biosorption onto immobilized cells of pycnoporus sanguineus and biosorption of ni ii by leucobacter sp n 4 qu 2011 yus azila et al 2008 fig 3 illustrates the effects of initial metal ions concentration and biosorbent dosage along with the interaction between them it was observed that in spite of the increase in the initial la iii and ce iii ions concentration from 50 to 250 mg l 1 the biosorption capacity enhanced this behavior attributed to decrease in the mass transfer resistance via increase in driving force furthermore the binding sites of the biosorbent are surrounded by more metal ions in solution leads to occupying more available binding sites on the biosorbent therefore by establishing a chemical potential difference through enhancement of metal ions concentration between the solution and the biosorbent a better uptake performance can be achieved these results are similar to optimization of cadmium biosorption from an aqueous solution by saccharomyces cerevisiae ghorbani 2008 3 4 statistical optimization one of the main goals of current study was to achieve the maximum biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii with the aim of designing modeling and applying for a large scale process in current study the proposed second order polynomial models were employed to obtain optimal conditions in terms of the ph temperature initial metal concentration and biosorbent dosage table 3 shows the independent variable values that offer the highest biosorption capacity the experimental data results under the predicted optimal condition were compared with the predicted ones as can be seen the percentage error differences between the experimental and predicted values by the models were in the range of 2 477 3 25 which proves the adequacy of proposed models 3 5 ftir analysis ftir analysis was utilized to identify the possible functional groups present in the biomass surface which can contribute in metal ions binding ftir spectra in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 for the biosorbent in three different forms the c indica algae modified by xanthation method biosorbent before biosorption the la loaded biosorbent and the ce loaded biosorbent are depicted in fig 4 a b and c respectively as can be seen in fig 4 some bands of the functional groups have changed representing those groups are involved in the biosorption process the broad and strong band ranging from 3600 to 3300 cm 1 is related to the stretching and bending vibrations of the hydroxyl oh groups alcohols phenols and carboxylic acids on the biomass surface due to polysaccharide existence in the cell wall of algae the peaks observed at 2921 cm 1 and in the area around 1400 cm 1 in all of the samples can be attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric c h stretching vibrations of aliphatic acids such as ch ch2 and ch3 methyl groups sohbatzadeh 2016 amide functional group appears at 1636 cm 1 this peak indicates the presence of amide bonds in protein or other constituents of the cell wall of algae kim 1999 the peak at 1382 cm 1could be ascribed to symmetric stretch of coo farinella 2008 ftir spectrum showed the functional groups of sulfur at 582 796 and 1097 cm 1 came from c s s or and c s respectively due to the chemical modification of the biomass surface with carbon disulfide liang 2010 after la and ce biosorption the spectra of la loaded and ce loaded biomass showed subtle changes in wavenumber and intensity of some peaks fig 4 b and c the shifted peak of ch group for the biomass was saturated with lanthanum and cerium shows the group s participation in the biosorption of the metals furthermore the intensity and frequency of the peak for c s group shifted from 1097 to 1085 cm 1 when the biomass was saturated with lanthanum and cerium before the biosorption this group is occupied by sodium ions but after the biosorption sodium is expected to be replaced by lanthanum and cerium through ion exchange mechanism the peak related to coo shifted to 1378 cm 1 for the biomass saturated with lanthanum that shows participation of this functional group in the biosorption of lanthanum furthermore it was confirmed that the alginic acid in the cell wall of algae is composed of many carboxyl groups that are responsible for metal biosorption the structure of alginic acid in the cell wall of c indica and biosorption of la iii and ce iii onto xanthated algae are shown in fig 5 ahluwalia and goyal 2007 as a result the functional groups including hydroxyl carboxyl amide and sulfur compounds are responsible for the biosorption of la iii and ce iii by xanthated algae moreover it was found that the c indica algae modified by xanthation method could be a more efficient biosorbent than the intact c indica algae due to the containment of more functional group types participated in the biosorption process 3 6 desorption studies the equilibrium sorption capacities of la iii and ce iii are depicted in fig 6 a and b respectively as can be seen the sorption capacity of la iii and ce iii by xanthated c indica decreased from 179 43 and 168 06 mg g 1 for la iii and ce iii in the first cycle to 162 58 mg g 1 90 46 and 152 28 mg g 1 90 61 in the third cycle respectively furthermore the elution efficiencies of la iii and ce iii are shown in fig 6 a and b the performance of 0 1 m hcl in desorbing of la iii and ce iii from the xanthated biosorbents are superior due to recovery values over 90 for all metal ions therefore c indica could be reused several times without a significant decrease in sorption of la iii and ce iii capacities 3 7 kinetic studies biosorption kinetic is affected by the interaction between adsorbate biosorbent and on the operating conditions this is an important measure for evaluating the specific system suitability for practical utilizations to treat metal bearing aqueous solutions in general sequestration of adsorbate using sorption includes the subsequent four kinetic steps i bulk diffusion ii film diffusion iii intraparticle diffusion and iv surface interaction baraka 2015 kinetic study is beneficial to assess the uptake rate of the adsorbate and gives us useful information about the limiting step can be belonged to any of above steps or combination of them the two widely used models in which the physical or chemical interaction between the adsorbate and the binding sites of the biosorbent consist of pseudo first order model pfo and pseudo second order model pso the nonlinear pseudo first order kinetic model is written as follows torab mostaedi 2015 5 pseudo first order q t q e 1 exp k 1 t where k 1 min 1 is the pfo rate constant q t and q e mg g 1 are biosorption capacities at time t min and equilibrium state respectively also the nonlinear pseudo second order model was evaluated the equation is expressed as ho and ofomaja 2006 6 pseudo second order q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where k 2 g mg min 1 indicates the pso rate constant furthermore the intraparticle diffusion model is tested for diffusion mechanism of the biosorption for this purpose the double exponential kinetic model is evaluated this model involves of two steps the first one is a quick step in which the rate of biosorption is controlled by the external diffusion and the second one is a slow step as internal diffusion onto the biosorbent that controls the rate of process the double exponential kinetic equation is expressed as chiron et al 2003 7 double exponential q t q e d 1 m ads exp k d 1 t d 2 m ads exp k d 2 t d 1 and d 2 mg g 1 are the parameters of biosorption representing the rapid and slow steps of reaction in mg g respectively k d 1 and k d 2 min 1 are the parameters related to the controlling mechanism m ads g l 1 is the amount of biosorbent as can be seen in fig 7 a and b the biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii increased dramatically within first 40 min and slowly reached the equilibrium state after 240 min after that there were no noticeable variations in the biosorption capacities almost 90 of equilibrium biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii are achieved during 60 min at initial minutes the rapid biosorption process occurs due to the high metal ion concentration in the solution along with the abundant unfilled active sites on the biosorbent surface subsequently metal ion concentrations mass transfer driving force decreases and a few of active sites remain empty on the surface so the remaining vacant active sites are competitively occupied afterwards the metal ions diffuse into the interior of the biosorbents gradually and intraparticle biosorption occurs after 240 min the most of the active sites become saturated sohbatzadeh 2016 the kinetic parameters and the statistical data of various models are presents in table 4 as can be seen the three models data fit well but the double exponential kinetic has higher correlation coefficient and shows greater similarity between experimental and calculated qe these results indicate that both steps include external transfer of metal ions from the solution to the surface of the biosorbent transfer and internal transfer of the metal ions from the surface of the biosorbent to the interior sorption centers diffusion are active in la iii and ce iii biosorption onto xanthated algae the first step is taken quickly during 40 min and afterward equilibrium is achieved slowly 3 8 biosorption isotherms with regard to physical chemical or mathematical basis the isotherm models can provide essential information to comprehend the quantitative relation between the adsorbate adsorbent along with the mechanism of sorption process affinity and surface properties of the adsorbents at the equilibrium conditions sohbatzadeh 2016 liu 2015 therefore the biosorption isotherms of la iii and ce iii onto the xanthated algae were studied in various concentrations of la iii and ce iii from 50 to 250 mg l 1 moreover four most widely used isotherm models including langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r were employed to describe the isotherm data the langmuir model presumes monolayer sorption onto the surface of the biosorbent the langmuir isotherm is expressed as keshtkar et al 2015 8 q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e where q e and c e indicate the amount of metal ions adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent mg g 1 and equilibrium concentration of metal ions mg l 1 at equilibrium state respectively q m and k l are the langmuir constants attributed to the maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 and the degree of binding sites affinity l mg 1 which is a gauge of the adsorption energy respectively the freundlich isotherm unlike the langmuir isotherm assumes that sorption is multilayer onto heterogeneous surface this model is an empirical equation and is given by mirzabe and keshtkar 2015 9 q e k f c e 1 n where k f and n are freundlich constants related to biosorption capacity mg g l mg n and intensity respectively furthermore values of n larger than one demonstrate the favorable nature of process the temkin equation is expressed as rwiza 2018 10 q e rt b te ln a te c e where b te is the temkin constant related to the heat biosorption and expresses in j mol 1 a te r and t are temkin isotherm parameter the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and the absolute temperature k respectively dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm discusses the physically or chemically nature of adsorption the d r isotherm equation is given by dubinin et al 1947 11 q e q dr exp b dr ε dr 2 12 ε dr rt ln 1 1 c e where q dr mmol g 1 and b dr mol 2 j 2 are ascribed to the monolayer sorption capacity and activity coefficient inferred from adsorption mean free energy ε dr which indicates polanyi potential r is the universal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature k according to eq 13 the mean free energy e of biosorption is calculated by constant b dr using the equation below 13 e 1 2 b dr the e is useful parameter that can be used to estimate the type biosorption mechanism when the value is in the ranges of 1 8 and 8 16 kj mol 1 it shows that the mechanisms are physisorption and chemisorption respectively in this study to investigate the biosorption isotherm of la and ce the nonlinear langmuir freundlich temkin and d r isotherms were used in various concentrations of la iii and ce iii from 50 to 250 mg l 1 the results of the curve fitting are listed in table 5 and fig 8 all of isotherms are evaluated under optimized conditions based on the r2 values the freundlich isotherm showed the best fitted values r2 0 999 and r2 0 996 for the la and ce respectively these results indicated that multilayer sorption onto heterogeneous surface with unequal distribution of sorption energy the available sites are not spread uniformly onto the surface of xanthated algae furthermore values of 1 n 10 for both metal ions in freundlich equation indicated the favorable nature of adsorption along with a high affinity for biosorption of the selective metals by this biosorbent mirzabe and keshtkar 2015 additionally in order to specify the dominant sorption mechanism the d r model parameter e mean free energy were calculated to be 5 297 kj mol 1 and 5 409 kj mol 1 for the la iii and ce iii respectively table 5 as mentioned earlier in current section these data showed that the sorption of both elements occurred mainly through physisorption table 6 shows the summary of the adsorption of la iii and ce iii onto different adsorbents reported in the literature according to the condition of the adsorption in table 6 c indica algae modified by xanthation method exhibited comparable and noticeable potential for the removal of la iii and ce iii ions from aqueous solutions 3 9 effect of competitor ion actually industrial origin effluent often contains more than one metal ion therefore biosorption process becomes competitive wherein different metal ions with different affinities compete for a fixed number of biosorbent binding sites in addition to the lanthanides some other ions such as th iv which exist in the leaching solution zuo et al 2008 and cu ii and pb ii that present in wastewater that should be separated from the lanthanides abdolali 2015 for this purpose the la and ce biosorption were analyzed in the presence of th iv cu ii and pb ii ions at binary systems at each one metal concentration of 50 mg l 1 ph 5 biosorbent dosage 0 5 g l 1 and temperature 25 c was chosen in a batch system as shown in fig 9 the biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii decreased between 23 28 31 27 and 30 99 42 10 respectively in binary solution rather than la iii and ce iii single solutions these phenomena are due to the metal ions competition with another to occupy the fixed number of active sites on the surface of xanthated algae also the results indicated that the presence of th iv ion inhibits ce iii and la iii biosorption more than other competitor ions it is important remark that all binary systems biosorption capacities were increased as the total initial concentration of each binary system increased results not shown here these results provide evidence that the increase in initial concentration establishes an significant driving force to overcome all mass transfer resistance between the aqueous solution and sorbent surface martín lara 2016 4 conclusions the aim of current study was to assess the influence of xanthation process on the la iii and ce iii biosorption by cystoseira indica algae from aqueous solutions our finding proved that xanthated algae exhibited better sorption performance as an improved biosorbent than intact one with the aim of enhancing the knowledge about chemical modification impact on the biosorbent quantitative measurement of binding sites density change due to xanthation is suggested furthermore evaluation of xanthated cystoseira indica performance under continuous mode in the packed bed column and assessment of the prepared biosorbent ability to treat real wastewater can be planned for future studies the main conclusions of the current work are as follows the present investigation confirmed the successful modification of an algae cystoseira indica to prepare an efficient biosorbent for the la iii and ce iii biosorption from aqueous solutions statistical analysis showed that independent factor including ph initial concentration and biosorbent dosage were significant while the temperature identified as insignificant variable the correlation coefficient of determination for la iii and ce iii biosorption models were 0 9573 and 0 9843 respectively that indicated proposed quadratic models by rsm were able to predict the experimental data and to determine the optimal operating conditions adequately ftir analysis confirmed that the presence of sulfur groups on c indica algae due to xanthation method moreover the hydroxyl carboxyl amide along with sulfur functional groups were involved in the biosorption process therefore the xanthated algae could be a more efficient biosorbent than intact algae due to the containment of more functional groups equilibrium experiments data were well tuned to freundlich isotherm furthermore the double exponential model described the data kinetic well and indicated a two step mechanism the process may be controlled by internal and external diffusion mechanisms simultaneously the biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii diminished in bimetallic solutions due to the competition of th iv with la iii and ce iii to occupy the fixed number of active sites on the surface of xanthated algae 
12276,in this study chemically modified cystoseira indica brown algae by xanthation method was utilized to study the biosorption of la iii and ce iii ions from the aqueous solutions under batch mode the effects of four variables including ph 2 6 temperature 25 55 c biosorbent dosage 0 5 2 5 g l 1 and initial metal concentration 50 250 mg l 1 were evaluated and optimized using response surface methodology rsm based on the central composite design ccd a low p value and high coefficient of determination r2 implied the accuracy and validity of the proposed quadratic models the results showed that the xanthation improved the performance of c indica than the intact and ca pretreated ones performing experiments under optimal condition sets produced maximum biosorption capacities of 185 44 and 172 33 mg g 1 for la iii and ce iii respectively in order to characterize the provided biosorbents ftir analyses were carried out results revealed that the dominant functional groups in the binding process were hydroxyl carboxyl and amide in the intact algae while xanthation caused addition of sulfur groups that participated in binding process and increased the sorption capacities of both metal ions the equilibrium and kinetic studies revealed that the freundlich isotherm model and the double exponential kinetic model were in the better fitness with the la iii and ce iii experimental data moreover the results showed that the presence of th iv ions decreased the biosorption capacities of both metal ions in conclusion the present work showed that the xanthated c indica could be a proper biosorbent for la iii and ce iii biosorption from aqueous solutions graphical abstract fx1 keywords biosorption la iii ce iii cystoseira indica xanthation response surface

industries such as nuclear energy ceramics green energy sector medicine defense industry super magnets and superconductors hosomomi 2016 they are member of the technology critical elements and owing to their distinct characteristics it is impossible to replace them by other elements in many key technologies naturally lanthanides occur mainly in the trivalent oxidation state and behave chemically

refineries catalyst immobilization ceramic and alloys preparation etc torab mostaedi 2015 lanthanides can enter the environment in large quantities and are known to accumulate in the human body when inhaled or digested from food chain chen 2010 so there is a continuous effort for the processing of aqueous solutions bearing rare earth elements and removal of them from industrial effluents is a hot topic in the environmental research field sohbatzadeh 2016 there are several methods including ion exchange adsorption solvent extraction precipitation reverse osmosis membrane separation and electrochemical to remove the metal ions from aqueous solutions torab mostaedi 2015 chen 2010 wang et al 2018 besides being high cost processes these technologies produce secondary problems by generating metal bearing sludge furthermore the efficiency of mentioned processes diminishes when the concentration of the metal ions in the solution is less than 100 mg m 3 vafajoo 2018 biosorption which employs various biological materials has been heralded as a promising alternative process for removing metal ions from polluted solutions sohbatzadeh 2016 it includes passive mechanisms of metal binding that are not driven by metabolism kumar et al 2016 the main preference for this technology is its abundant materials low cost high efficiency and potential of metal recovery removal zeraatkar 2016 among the various biosorbent materials non living algae have been utilized for the processing of the dilute effluents solutions with high efficiency due to low cost metal binding properties reusability and high specific surface area besides these materials are available in much higher quantities in comparison with other adsorbents such as activated carbon natural zeolite and ion exchange resins vafajoo 2018 algae s functionality is attributable to the presence of numerous functionalized groups amino carboxyl sulphate and hydroxyl in their cell walls which have an imperative role in

radionuclides and toxic heavy metals such as thorium uranium chromium copper and nickel because of its special cell wall structure riazi et al 2016 ghasemi 2011 basha et al 2009 basha and murthy 2007 in order to improve the base biosorbents performance their modification becomes inevitable modification of biosorbent can be performed using physical and or chemical pretreatments sorbent physical pretreatments can be achieved through the cutting grinding thermal drying autoclaving steaming and lyophilization chemical modification includes pretreatment of sorbents with chemicals e g cacl2 koh nacl h2o2 and na2co3 rwiza 2018 it is confirmed that the sorbent containing sulfur bearing functional group shows a high affinity for metal ions various sulfur bearing compounds include sulfides thiols dithiocarbamates dithiophosphates and xanthates of them xanthation is especially excellent due to easy preparation from relatively inexpensive reagents high insolubility and formation of stable

2000 it goes without saying that this method is rarely used xanthated algae was first utilized for the removal of lead by undaria pinnatifida according to hsab hard and soft acids and bases classification system sulfur atom unlike the oxygen atom can be classified as a soft ligand that have strong affinity with the most heavy metals which are soft acids kim 1999 in recent years xanthate functionalized biosorbents have been utilized to sorb various metal ions from aqueous solutions for example biosorption of cd ii qu 2017 cu ii kostić 2016 pb ii torres blancas 2013 and cr vi sankararamakrishnan 2006 by rice husks lagenaria vulgaris shell de oiled allspice husk chitosan respectively were carried out due to c indica abundance well accessibility low cost metal ions adsorption ability and chemical modification using surface functionalization technique capability it is a proper option to choose as the base biosorbent furthermore simplicity and significance of xanthation on biosorption ability caused to choose it as the chemical modification process in recent years utilization of statistical design of experiments has been increased for the process modeling identification of parameters interactions and optimization for example biosorption of pb ii wang et al 2018 u vi sohbatzadeh 2016 cu ii ni ii zn ii sarkar and majumdar 2011 and cr vi by celloluse pseudomonas putida chitosan chitosan helianthus annuus respectively were optimized using response surface methodology rsm based on the central composite design ccd basically the major objectives of the current study are i chemical modification of the marine brown alga c indica by cs2 for the first time to improve the biosorption performance of la iii and ce iii by batch experiments in comparison to the intact biomass ii modeling of biosorption process using ccd in rsm for evaluation of parameters ph temperature initial concentration and biomass dosage on the biosorption predicting of experimental data determination of the optimal operating conditions and identification of the main functional groups involved in the metals biosorption iii exploration of the biosorption mechanism and iv evaluation of the regenerative ability of modified biosorbent 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials carbon disulfide cs2 calcium chloride dehydrate cacl2 2h2o nitric acid hno3 and sodium hydroxide naoh were purchased from sigma aldrich the solutions of la iii and ce iii ions were prepared from lanthanum nitrate la no3 3 6h2o and cerium nitrate ce no3 3 6h2o salts sigma aldrich in deionized water respectively 2 2 preparation and chemical pre treatments of biosorbent brown alga of c indica was obtained from the chabahar coast iran the biomass was washed with distilled water several times to remove sand and other impurities and then dried in an oven for 18 h at 60 c after crushing in a mortar it was sorted by sieving using the standard test sieves the batch of biomass with particle size 1 2 mm was selected for subsequent pretreatments for preparation of the calcium pretreated biomass 10 g of sorted biomass was added in 1 l of 0 1 m cacl2 2h2o and then stirred in a rotary shaker 150 rpm at 25 c for 3 h keshtkar et al 2015 furthermore xanthation of c indica with naoh solution and carbon disulfide cs2 was carried out to prepare c indica xanthate for treatment 20 g of sorted biomass was mixed with 300 ml of 4 m naoh and stirred for 2 h at 30 c then 20 ml of cs2 was added and allowed to react for 3 h panda et al 2008 then the both treated algae were filtered from solutions the algae were washed with distilled water until the ph of washing effluents remained stable finally the algae were dried in an oven for 18 h at 60 c 2 3 batch biosorption experiment and the analysis the batch experiments were carried out in 100 ml flasks containing 50 ml la iii and ce iii solutions with the known initial concentration ph temperature and the dosage of biomass at 150 rpm in a shaker incubator it was seen no significant variation in the sorbate concentrations of solutions after 240 min except for kinetic studies therefore la iii and ce iii sorption reached equilibrium state until 8 h for all cases the ph of solution was adjusted with 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hno3 solutions after equilibrium attainment the samples were filtered and the concentration of the metals in the remaining solution was analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes perkin elmer optima 2100 and usa the biosorption capacities of the metals or the amounts of the metal ions adsorbed per unit of dry biosorbent mg g 1 in equilibrium were calculated using the following equation sohbatzadeh 2017 1 q e c 0 c e v m where c0 and ce mg l 1 are the initial and equilibrium metal ions concentrations respectively v l is the volume of the solution and m g is the dry weight of biosorbent all experiments were conducted in duplicate in order to identify the possible functional groups and binding sites existed in the surface of the biosorbents before and after of biosorption the samples were analyzed by fourier transform infrared ftir spectrophotometer ftir spectra were obtained via spectrometer bruker vector 22 and germany at a resolution of 4 cm 1 and wave numbers between 4000 and 400 cm 1 furthermore the zero point charge phzpc was performed to complete the biosorbents physicochemical characterization the phzpc of the xanthated algae was determined according to the our former study sohbatzadeh 2017 the initial ph value of 25 ml suspension of 0 1 m nacl containing 0 5 g l 1 sorbent was adjusted from 3 to 10 using either 0 1 m naoh or hno3 the solution was agitated at 25 c for 24 h and the final ph of the supernatant liquid was recorded the initial and final ph value differences δph were plotted against the initial ph values 2 4 preliminary evaluation a set of preliminary experiments was conducted to study the impact of different pretreatments on algae s sorption performance for this purpose the uptake capacities of la iii and ce iii on the intact algae ca pretreated algae and xanthated algae were investigated 2 5 experimental design with the aim of avoiding the traditional trials one factor at a time along with optimizing a process by means of individual and interactive effects of independent variables simultaneously the design of experiment doe can be applied for over their entire space and subsequently building a mathematical model sohbatzadeh 2016 among the most pertinent multivariate techniques rsm a combination of mathematical and statistical techniques has been broadly employed as a designing experiments technique the mathematical relation between a number of independent variables and one or more responses can be described using rsm which is commonly applied to investigate the response over the entire variables space and to discover where it achieves the optimum value ding and sartaj 2015 the four independent variables including ph a temperature b initial metal concentration c and biosorbent dosage d were studied at five levels labeled as 1 0 1 the ranges of variables were selected based on the previous studies varsihini et al 2014 a set of 30 experiments was performed using ccd table 1 for each metal 2k factorial 2k axial 6 center so that k was the number of independent variables k 4 with 16 factorial points 8 axial points and 6 central points the experimental error was estimated by the repeated center point özer 2008 a polynomial equation with higher degree such as quadratic model usually be used to describe the process according to the following equation ding and sartaj 2015 2 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β ii x i 2 i j k β ij x i x j ε where y is the predicated response β 0 is the constant coefficient β i β ij and β ii represent the interaction coefficients of linear second order and quadratic effects terms respectively x i and x j are the independent variables i 1 4 j 1 4 i j k is the number of independent variable and the final term ε shows the random error the analysis of variance anova was used for evaluating the accuracy and fitness of the model and identifying the significant variables mosleh 2018 jafari 2018 asfaram 2018 mosleh 2017 nasiri azad 2016 2 6 desorption studies for enhancement of industrial applications of any biosorbent the regeneration and subsequent reuse of the undiminished metal ions uptake biosorbent is an important issue the efficient desorption should yield the biosorbed metal ions completely in a concentrated form and regenerate the biosorbent close to the fresh form moreover a proper eluent must be effective cheap and without any damaging the biosorbent structure and binding sites to be able to reuse it ghasemi 2011 desorption experiments were carried out in a similar manner to the biosorption studies in five consecutive sorption desorption cycles after biosorption process la iii and ce iii loaded biosorbents were filtered dried weighted and shaken with 50 ml of 0 1 m hcl as elution agent in 100 ml flasks at optimal values of variables for maximum biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii table 3 after desorption the filtered biosorbent was washed with distilled water dried and used for next biosorption and the concentration of the metals in the supernatant solution was analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary evaluation as shown in fig 1 the intact c indica reveal high la iii and ce iii biosorption capacities moreover it was confirmed that pretreatments of biomass enhanced the algae sorption activity toward la iii and ce iii these results demonstrated that the c indica could be utilized as an elaborated biosorbent for la iii and ce iii biosorption using proper pretreatment as can be seen the larger value of biosorption capacity of the xanthated biomass compared with the ca pretreated one exhibited that the xanthated algae has higher affinity to la iii and ce iii than ca pretreated algae therefore the xanthated algae were used as the selected biosorbent for the rest of experiments 3 2 modeling using rsm the main and interactive effects of four independent variables including initial solution ph temperature initial metal ions concentration and biosorbent dosage on la iii and ce iii biosorption were studied with rsm according to the ccd the ccd proposed matrix of actual values for independent variables together with the experimental results are shown in table 1 with the purpose of developing a mathematical relationship between actual factors and response multiple regression analysis was applied and the best quadratic models for la iii and ce iii biosorption were attained as eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 q e la iii 47 37051 53 67458 ph 2 34013 temp 0

interaction factors the quadratic terms consist of a2 b2 c2 and d2 table 2 summarizes the results of analysis of variance anova to evaluate the adequacy and fitness of the proposed models which includes coefficient of determination r2 f value and p value generally the higher f value and the p value less than 0 05 in the anova results indicate that the independent variables are significant at 95 α 0 05 confidence level sohbatzadeh 2016 mousavinia 2016 mosleh 2016a 2016b jamshidi 2016 ghaedi 2016 nasiri azad 2015 jamshidi 2015a 2015b as shown in table 2 the f values 24 04 and 67 20 for la iii and ce iii along with a low probability values p 0 0001 demonstrate that the proposed models are significant the obtained f values of the both models in comparison to the critical f value f α df n df 1 f 0 05 14 15 2 42 were very large therefore the calculated fisher s variance ratio at this level confirms a very high degree of reliance of quadratic models singh 2011 according to the anova r2 were 0 9573 and 0 9843 for la iii and ce iii biosorption models respectively which implied that these models could establish appropriate correlation between the independent variables and responses moreover the values of r2 adj for la iii and ce iii were 0 9175 and 0 9697 respectively exhibiting that for la iii and ce iii only less than 9 and 4 of the variation could not be described by the models ding and sartaj 2015 the adequate precision which describes the signal to noise ratio were 16 688 and 29 136 for la iii and ce iii respectively while a value of greater than 4 indicates an adequate signal wang et al 2018 as indicated in table 2 it is inevitable that the both models were significantly affected by the three first orders of independent variables including ph initial concentration and biosorbent dosage p value 0 05 while the temperature had a little effect on the responses therefore it was identified as insignificant factor p value 0 1 similarly the quadratic terms ph ph2 for both models and initial concentration c0 2 for ce iii were significant furthermore all the interaction terms along with the remained quadratic terms were identified as insignificant terms based on the f value of first order of independent variables it was found that the main effects of independent variables on biosorption capacities for la iii and ce iii followed the below sequence initial concentration biosorbent dosage ph temperature 3 3 effects of process variables the rsm was used to assess the effects of independent variables as well as their interaction using 3d graphs the effects of ph and biosorbent dosage along with the interactive behavior of them are depicted in fig 2 a and b it was seen that the biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii were under the influence of the solution ph this behavior is due mainly to effect of the initial ph on the protonation state of functional groups existing in the biosorbent which can retain or release protons to the solution depending on its acidity constant pka as well as the solubility and distribution of metal ions species in the aqueous solution castro 2017 by adjusting the ph to 2 a little metal sorption for la iii and ce iii were occurred the explanation of this phenomenon is related to the presence of abundant h ions in the solutions that compete with la iii and ce iii ions which mainly consist of la 3 ponou 2014 and ce 3 nakada 2017 species respectively in addition characterization experiments confirmed that the xanthated algae has phpzc at 5 95 therefore the charge of the sorbent became positive at ph 2 causing the electrostatic repulsion between the protonated functional groups such as xanthate and cationic metal ions in acidic medium simultaneously wang et al 2018 liu 2013 as the ph rises the biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii increased up to 5 2 and 5 0 respectively because the net charge of biosorbent turns out to be less positive and deprotonated binding sites are prepared to stimulate electrostatic attraction with the metal ions roosta 2014 along with the reduction in the amount of h ions at the higher ph the uptake performance of biosorbent did not change significantly this behavior is due to the hydrolysis reaction of metals which produces ionic complexes of la oh 2 and ce oh 2 resulting in a decrease in la iii and ce iii ions this complex reduces the availability of the metal ions for biosorption ponou 2014 second sulfur groups are soft ligands and an acidic solution creates instability and separates them from alginic acid so biosorption capacity decreases by elimination of sulfur kim 1999 also it was observed that the biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii decreased by increasing the amount of biosorbent dosage from 0 5 to 2 5 g l 1 and vice versa it is confirmed that the higher biosorbent dosage leads to a decrease in metal uptake where the metal ions are distributed among larger amount of available binding sites leading some binding sites remain unsaturated at lower biosorbent dosage the available binding sites were rapidly saturated with the adsorbed metal ions due to the lower adsorbent binding site ratio leading to a larger amount of qe sohbatzadeh 2016 similar observations were obtained in studies on pb ii biosorption onto immobilized cells of pycnoporus sanguineus and biosorption of ni ii by leucobacter sp n 4 qu 2011 yus azila et al 2008 fig 3 illustrates the effects of initial metal ions concentration and biosorbent dosage along with the interaction between them it was observed that in spite of the increase in the initial la iii and ce iii ions concentration from 50 to 250 mg l 1 the biosorption capacity enhanced this behavior attributed to decrease in the mass transfer resistance via increase in driving force furthermore the binding sites of the biosorbent are surrounded by more metal ions in solution leads to occupying more available binding sites on the biosorbent therefore by establishing a chemical potential difference through enhancement of metal ions concentration between the solution and the biosorbent a better uptake performance can be achieved these results are similar to optimization of cadmium biosorption from an aqueous solution by saccharomyces cerevisiae ghorbani 2008 3 4 statistical optimization one of the main goals of current study was to achieve the maximum biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii with the aim of designing modeling and applying for a large scale process in current study the proposed second order polynomial models were employed to obtain optimal conditions in terms of the ph temperature initial metal concentration and biosorbent dosage table 3 shows the independent variable values that offer the highest biosorption capacity the experimental data results under the predicted optimal condition were compared with the predicted ones as can be seen the percentage error differences between the experimental and predicted values by the models were in the range of 2 477 3 25 which proves the adequacy of proposed models 3 5 ftir analysis ftir analysis was utilized to identify the possible functional groups present in the biomass surface which can contribute in metal ions binding ftir spectra in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 for the biosorbent in three different forms the c indica algae modified by xanthation method biosorbent before biosorption the la loaded biosorbent and the ce loaded biosorbent are depicted in fig 4 a b and c respectively as can be seen in fig 4 some bands of the functional groups have changed representing those groups are involved in the biosorption process the broad and strong band ranging from 3600 to 3300 cm 1 is related to the stretching and bending vibrations of the hydroxyl oh groups alcohols phenols and carboxylic acids on the biomass surface due to polysaccharide existence in the cell wall of algae the peaks observed at 2921 cm 1 and in the area around 1400 cm 1 in all of the samples can be attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric c h stretching vibrations of aliphatic acids such as ch ch2 and ch3 methyl groups sohbatzadeh 2016 amide functional group appears at 1636 cm 1 this peak indicates the presence of amide bonds in protein or other constituents of the cell wall of algae kim 1999 the peak at 1382 cm 1could be ascribed to symmetric stretch of coo farinella 2008 ftir spectrum showed the functional groups of sulfur at 582 796 and 1097 cm 1 came from c s s or and c s respectively due to the chemical modification of the biomass surface with carbon disulfide liang 2010 after la and ce biosorption the spectra of la loaded and ce loaded biomass showed subtle changes in wavenumber and intensity of some peaks fig 4 b and c the shifted peak of ch group for the biomass was saturated with lanthanum and cerium shows the group s participation in the biosorption of the metals furthermore the intensity and frequency of the peak for c s group shifted from 1097 to 1085 cm 1 when the biomass was saturated with lanthanum and cerium before the biosorption this group is occupied by sodium ions but after the biosorption sodium is expected to be replaced by lanthanum and cerium through ion exchange mechanism the peak related to coo shifted to 1378 cm 1 for the biomass saturated with lanthanum that shows participation of this functional group in the biosorption of lanthanum furthermore it was confirmed that the alginic acid in the cell wall of algae is composed of many carboxyl groups that are responsible for metal biosorption the structure of alginic acid in the cell wall of c indica and biosorption of la iii and ce iii onto xanthated algae are shown in fig 5 ahluwalia and goyal 2007 as a result the functional groups including hydroxyl carboxyl amide and sulfur compounds are responsible for the biosorption of la iii and ce iii by xanthated algae moreover it was found that the c indica algae modified by xanthation method could be a more efficient biosorbent than the intact c indica algae due to the containment of more functional group types participated in the biosorption process 3 6 desorption studies the equilibrium sorption capacities of la iii and ce iii are depicted in fig 6 a and b respectively as can be seen the sorption capacity of la iii and ce iii by xanthated c indica decreased from 179 43 and 168 06 mg g 1 for la iii and ce iii in the first cycle to 162 58 mg g 1 90 46 and 152 28 mg g 1 90 61 in the third cycle respectively furthermore the elution efficiencies of la iii and ce iii are shown in fig 6 a and b the performance of 0 1 m hcl in desorbing of la iii and ce iii from the xanthated biosorbents are superior due to recovery values over 90 for all metal ions therefore c indica could be reused several times without a significant decrease in sorption of la iii and ce iii capacities 3 7 kinetic studies biosorption kinetic is affected by the interaction between adsorbate biosorbent and on the operating conditions this is an important measure for evaluating the specific system suitability for practical utilizations to treat metal bearing aqueous solutions in general sequestration of adsorbate using sorption includes the subsequent four kinetic steps i bulk diffusion ii film diffusion iii intraparticle diffusion and iv surface interaction baraka 2015 kinetic study is beneficial to assess the uptake rate of the adsorbate and gives us useful information about the limiting step can be belonged to any of above steps or combination of them the two widely used models in which the physical or chemical interaction between the adsorbate and the binding sites of the biosorbent consist of pseudo first order model pfo and pseudo second order model pso the nonlinear pseudo first order kinetic model is written as follows torab mostaedi 2015 5 pseudo first order q t q e 1 exp k 1 t where k 1 min 1 is the pfo rate constant q t and q e mg g 1 are biosorption capacities at time t min and equilibrium state respectively also the nonlinear pseudo second order model was evaluated the equation is expressed as ho and ofomaja 2006 6 pseudo second order q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where k 2 g mg min 1 indicates the pso rate constant furthermore the intraparticle diffusion model is tested for diffusion mechanism of the biosorption for this purpose the double exponential kinetic model is evaluated this model involves of two steps the first one is a quick step in which the rate of biosorption is controlled by the external diffusion and the second one is a slow step as internal diffusion onto the biosorbent that controls the rate of process the double exponential kinetic equation is expressed as chiron et al 2003 7 double exponential q t q e d 1 m ads exp k d 1 t d 2 m ads exp k d 2 t d 1 and d 2 mg g 1 are the parameters of biosorption representing the rapid and slow steps of reaction in mg g respectively k d 1 and k d 2 min 1 are the parameters related to the controlling mechanism m ads g l 1 is the amount of biosorbent as can be seen in fig 7 a and b the biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii increased dramatically within first 40 min and slowly reached the equilibrium state after 240 min after that there were no noticeable variations in the biosorption capacities almost 90 of equilibrium biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii are achieved during 60 min at initial minutes the rapid biosorption process occurs due to the high metal ion concentration in the solution along with the abundant unfilled active sites on the biosorbent surface subsequently metal ion concentrations mass transfer driving force decreases and a few of active sites remain empty on the surface so the remaining vacant active sites are competitively occupied afterwards the metal ions diffuse into the interior of the biosorbents gradually and intraparticle biosorption occurs after 240 min the most of the active sites become saturated sohbatzadeh 2016 the kinetic parameters and the statistical data of various models are presents in table 4 as can be seen the three models data fit well but the double exponential kinetic has higher correlation coefficient and shows greater similarity between experimental and calculated qe these results indicate that both steps include external transfer of metal ions from the solution to the surface of the biosorbent transfer and internal transfer of the metal ions from the surface of the biosorbent to the interior sorption centers diffusion are active in la iii and ce iii biosorption onto xanthated algae the first step is taken quickly during 40 min and afterward equilibrium is achieved slowly 3 8 biosorption isotherms with regard to physical chemical or mathematical basis the isotherm models can provide essential information to comprehend the quantitative relation between the adsorbate adsorbent along with the mechanism of sorption process affinity and surface properties of the adsorbents at the equilibrium conditions sohbatzadeh 2016 liu 2015 therefore the biosorption isotherms of la iii and ce iii onto the xanthated algae were studied in various concentrations of la iii and ce iii from 50 to 250 mg l 1 moreover four most widely used isotherm models including langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r were employed to describe the isotherm data the langmuir model presumes monolayer sorption onto the surface of the biosorbent the langmuir isotherm is expressed as keshtkar et al 2015 8 q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e where q e and c e indicate the amount of metal ions adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent mg g 1 and equilibrium concentration of metal ions mg l 1 at equilibrium state respectively q m and k l are the langmuir constants attributed to the maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 and the degree of binding sites affinity l mg 1 which is a gauge of the adsorption energy respectively the freundlich isotherm unlike the langmuir isotherm assumes that sorption is multilayer onto heterogeneous surface this model is an empirical equation and is given by mirzabe and keshtkar 2015 9 q e k f c e 1 n where k f and n are freundlich constants related to biosorption capacity mg g l mg n and intensity respectively furthermore values of n larger than one demonstrate the favorable nature of process the temkin equation is expressed as rwiza 2018 10 q e rt b te ln a te c e where b te is the temkin constant related to the heat biosorption and expresses in j mol 1 a te r and t are temkin isotherm parameter the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and the absolute temperature k respectively dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm discusses the physically or chemically nature of adsorption the d r isotherm equation is given by dubinin et al 1947 11 q e q dr exp b dr ε dr 2 12 ε dr rt ln 1 1 c e where q dr mmol g 1 and b dr mol 2 j 2 are ascribed to the monolayer sorption capacity and activity coefficient inferred from adsorption mean free energy ε dr which indicates polanyi potential r is the universal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature k according to eq 13 the mean free energy e of biosorption is calculated by constant b dr using the equation below 13 e 1 2 b dr the e is useful parameter that can be used to estimate the type biosorption mechanism when the value is in the ranges of 1 8 and 8 16 kj mol 1 it shows that the mechanisms are physisorption and chemisorption respectively in this study to investigate the biosorption isotherm of la and ce the nonlinear langmuir freundlich temkin and d r isotherms were used in various concentrations of la iii and ce iii from 50 to 250 mg l 1 the results of the curve fitting are listed in table 5 and fig 8 all of isotherms are evaluated under optimized conditions based on the r2 values the freundlich isotherm showed the best fitted values r2 0 999 and r2 0 996 for the la and ce respectively these results indicated that multilayer sorption onto heterogeneous surface with unequal distribution of sorption energy the available sites are not spread uniformly onto the surface of xanthated algae furthermore values of 1 n 10 for both metal ions in freundlich equation indicated the favorable nature of adsorption along with a high affinity for biosorption of the selective metals by this biosorbent mirzabe and keshtkar 2015 additionally in order to specify the dominant sorption mechanism the d r model parameter e mean free energy were calculated to be 5 297 kj mol 1 and 5 409 kj mol 1 for the la iii and ce iii respectively table 5 as mentioned earlier in current section these data showed that the sorption of both elements occurred mainly through physisorption table 6 shows the summary of the adsorption of la iii and ce iii onto different adsorbents reported in the literature according to the condition of the adsorption in table 6 c indica algae modified by xanthation method exhibited comparable and noticeable potential for the removal of la iii and ce iii ions from aqueous solutions 3 9 effect of competitor ion actually industrial origin effluent often contains more than one metal ion therefore biosorption process becomes competitive wherein different metal ions with different affinities compete for a fixed number of biosorbent binding sites in addition to the lanthanides some other ions such as th iv which exist in the leaching solution zuo et al 2008 and cu ii and pb ii that present in wastewater that should be separated from the lanthanides abdolali 2015 for this purpose the la and ce biosorption were analyzed in the presence of th iv cu ii and pb ii ions at binary systems at each one metal concentration of 50 mg l 1 ph 5 biosorbent dosage 0 5 g l 1 and temperature 25 c was chosen in a batch system as shown in fig 9 the biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii decreased between 23 28 31 27 and 30 99 42 10 respectively in binary solution rather than la iii and ce iii single solutions these phenomena are due to the metal ions competition with another to occupy the fixed number of active sites on the surface of xanthated algae also the results indicated that the presence of th iv ion inhibits ce iii and la iii biosorption more than other competitor ions it is important remark that all binary systems biosorption capacities were increased as the total initial concentration of each binary system increased results not shown here these results provide evidence that the increase in initial concentration establishes an significant driving force to overcome all mass transfer resistance between the aqueous solution and sorbent surface martín lara 2016 4 conclusions the aim of current study was to assess the influence of xanthation process on the la iii and ce iii biosorption by cystoseira indica algae from aqueous solutions our finding proved that xanthated algae exhibited better sorption performance as an improved biosorbent than intact one with the aim of enhancing the knowledge about chemical modification impact on the biosorbent quantitative measurement of binding sites density change due to xanthation is suggested furthermore evaluation of xanthated cystoseira indica performance under continuous mode in the packed bed column and assessment of the prepared biosorbent ability to treat real wastewater can be planned for future studies the main conclusions of the current work are as follows the present investigation confirmed the successful modification of an algae cystoseira indica to prepare an efficient biosorbent for the la iii and ce iii biosorption from aqueous solutions statistical analysis showed that independent factor including ph initial concentration and biosorbent dosage were significant while the temperature identified as insignificant variable the correlation coefficient of determination for la iii and ce iii biosorption models were 0 9573 and 0 9843 respectively that indicated proposed quadratic models by rsm were able to predict the experimental data and to determine the optimal operating conditions adequately ftir analysis confirmed that the presence of sulfur groups on c indica algae due to xanthation method moreover the hydroxyl carboxyl amide along with sulfur functional groups were involved in the biosorption process therefore the xanthated algae could be a more efficient biosorbent than intact algae due to the containment of more functional groups equilibrium experiments data were well tuned to freundlich isotherm furthermore the double exponential model described the data kinetic well and indicated a two step mechanism the process may be controlled by internal and external diffusion mechanisms simultaneously the biosorption capacities of la iii and ce iii diminished in bimetallic solutions due to the competition of th iv with la iii and ce iii to occupy the fixed number of active sites on the surface of xanthated algae

the evaluation of water quality therefore it is of great importance to investigate drinking groundwater about this case along with the physicochemical properties there are some other alarming parameters for groundwater quality the presence of toxic metals raised widespread concerns in different parts of the world and results reported by various agencies have been alarming heavy metals is a collective term which applies to the group of the metals and metalloids with atomic density greater than 4 g cm3 hutton and symon 1986 nriagu 1989 the main sources of heavy metal pollution are agricultural runoff sewage and discharges of untreated and semi treated effluents from metal related industries such as metal electroplating manufacturing of batteries circuit boards and car repair road is also one of the largest sources of heavy metals farmaki and thomaidis 2008 there are numerous health effects beyond presence of heavy metals in drinking water therefore the heavy metals

gibbs diagrams the spatial variations of the main parameters in water wells were also plotted by gis maps 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area malekan county is located in the southwest of east azerbaijan province fig 1 with the area of about 1006 km2 it is composed of 2 urban and 81 rural districts according to the census conducted in 2011 the population of urban and rural areas were 31 487 and 74 631 respectively more than 91 of the rural communities in the area were supplied by groundwater as their sole drinking water source shakerkhatibi et al 2014 2 2 sampling and analysis to investigate the spatial variations 77 groundwater samples 39 in spring and 38 in summer were taken from rural drinking water wells the detailed characteristics of the monitored water wells have been

physicochemical parameters such as ph electric conductivity ec hardness major cations ca2 mg2 na and k and major anions hco3 so4 2 cl f and no3 were measured based on the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater eaton et al 2005 in addition heavy metals including arsenic aluminum boron barium beryllium chromium copper mercury tin zinc cadmium cobalt iron manganese molybdenum nickel lead antimony selenium and vanadium were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icpoes method for the summer samples heavy metal samples were acidified using nitric acid and kept at 4 c until analysis 2 3 hydro geochemical analysis mapping and statistical survey to graphically represent the faces and nature of groundwater chemistry piper and gibbs diagrams were plotted using aqqa software to show the spatial variations inverse distance weighting idw technique was applied for interpolation of measured data in gis software it is assumed in idw interpolation that each point influences that diminishes with distance therefore high weights are given to the near points and small weights are given to the points at a far distance the following is the general formula of idw interpolation for 2 d problems w x y i 1 n ƛ i w i ƛ i 1 d i p i 1 n 1 d i p where w x y is the predicted value at location x y n is the number of nearest known points

the weighting of w i on w shekhar and xiong 2007 the idw method is intuitive and efficient that s why it is widely used in spatial interpolation of groundwater quality balakrishnan et al 2011 descriptive statistics including means maximum minimum and standard deviations logistic regression model correlation and analysis of variance anova tests were done to analyze water quality data and their relationships 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical analysis the physicochemical properties of groundwater samples the iranian national standard ins and who guideline values for drinking water are presented in table 1 as it can be seen in this table samples taken in the summer season have lower ph values 6 65 8 00 compared to that of spring 7 05 8 20 this difference could be due to the higher precipitation rates in spring in the study area mosaferi et al 2014 who 2011 it is reported that acidic water could lead to the dissolution of salts from the aquifer rocks and increase the metals and tds of the groundwater akhtar et al 2014 as it is shown in table 1 the tds values in summer samples are lower than spring ones this difference could also be attributed to the higher precipitation rates in spring season which is finally contributing to the higher dissolution of chemicals in groundwater and therefore higher tds values have been recorded in spring season in addition one of the other consequences of acidic water is the probability of corrosion in water mains and pipelines and therefore triggering gastrointestinal disorders taghipour et al 2012 based on the results 5 samples in spring and 4 samples in summer have tds values above the standard limits in fact the tds of groundwater is due to the presence of inorganic salts especially bicarbonate sulfate chloride calcium and sodium and partially dissolved organic matter these materials could have either geogenic origin which is depending on the characteristics of the bedrock or anthropogenic origin which is due to the urban runoffs municipal and industrial wastewaters etc raju et al 2015 according to the results of a study conducted on groundwater quality in tabriz county the capital of east azerbaijan province the average value of tds was found to be 364 mg l which is lower than the our findings indicating better groundwater quality in this area mosaferi et al 2014 the difference could be attributed to the dissimilar geological structures in addition agricultural activities in malekan county could be the other reason for deterioration of groundwater quality acceptable limit of fluoride in drinking water is 1 5 mg l as shown in table 1 fluoride concentrations in all samples were less than the guideline value fluoride is usually naturally occurring in groundwater which is released into the water table as a result of the rocks breakdown or weathering raj and shaji 2017 in addition it commonly derives from dissolution of fluorite fluor apatite silicates and volcanic ash fluoride could also be released into the groundwater due to the application of phosphorous fertilizers and steel manufacturing hudak and sanmanee 2003 tirkey et al 2017 it is also reported that ph bicarbonate and calcium are the main determining factors in releasing of the fluoride from rock minerals into the groundwater saxena and ahmed 2001 from the measurements shown in table 1 it has been observed that the chloride values in all samples were below the guideline values however the chloride concentrations in summer samples were higher than that of spring this is due to the more intrusion of water into the water table because of the higher precipitation in spring on the other hand the higher evaporation rates in summer season make the chloride to be concentrated in groundwater resources normally chloride ions in groundwater originate from chloride salts which are water soluble found in minerals however in the case of the study area anthropogenic sources such as agricultural products e g animal manure fertilizer and irrigation return flow oilfield brine household sewage landfill leachate industrial effluent deicing salt and pumping induced saltwater intrusion could be the other probable sources of chloride in the water wells feth 1981 as can be seen in table 1 majority of the samples have sulfate contents below the guideline value however higher sulfate concentrations were observed in 2 cases in each of spring and summer samples due to the underground reducing conditions sulfate concentration in groundwater is usually low which is inhibiting the sulfide oxidation to generate sulfate alam et al 2016 in the case of the present study sulfate concentrations were predominantly lower except for 2 samples which could be due to the geological structure in the area comparing the results with the similar study conducted in tabriz mosaferi et al 2014 shows that the average values of chloride and sulfate in this study are higher than those reported for tabriz county which has a volcanic origin it is also reported that chloride and sulfate are abundant in sedimentary rocks hudak and sanmanee 2003 on the other hand the geological structure of malekan county sedimentary rocks could be the reason for higher chloride and sulfate concentrations in this research the alkalinity of groundwater samples varied between 152 and 480 mg l as caco3 there is a little information about the health effects of alkalinity in drinking water however use of alkaline water for washing causes skin problems in addition coagulation of alkaline water in treatment process leads to excessive consumption of coagulants the other important effect attributed to alkaline water is the occurrence of scaling in pipelines millar et al 2017 taghipour et al 2012 from the results carbonate alkalinity phenolphthalein alkalinity was not observed in all groundwater samples which is in line with the findings of other similar studies ebrahimi et al 2016 mosaferi et al 2014 both carbonate and hydroxide alkalinity are present in alkaline water with ph values above 8 3 therefore it can be concluded that all of alkalinity present in water samples are in bicarbonate form carbone dioxide and carbonate dissolving organic matter oxidation and reaction of silicates with carbonic acid are the source of alkalinity intrusion into the aquifer jeong 2001 ranjan et al 2013 it is well known that nitrate presence in groundwater is a good indicator of anthropogenic pollution agricultural sources such as crop fertilizer crop residue animal waste and mineralization of soil organic nitrogen are the sources of nitrate in groundwater non agricultural sources also include septic systems lawn fertilizers discharges of nitrogen bearing effluents and atmospheric depositions aerated soils containing nitrogen compounds oxidize them to soluble nitrate and then intrusion of nitrate to the water takes place wang et al 2017 our results show that nitrate concentrations in all the collected samples were below the standard limits it is reported that nitrate concentration in natural water does not exceed 10 mg l cushing et al 1973 although nitrate contents in our samples are within the standard range some cases contain values above 10 mg l considering the point that the samples collected in this study were all from the rural areas with the dominant activity of farming higher nitrate concentrations could be due to the use of fertilizers in the agricultural fields sodium concentrations in the studied samples varied between 7 4 and 296 0 mg l so considering the ins only one of the samples exceeded the standard limits sodium in groundwater could be found in the forms of nacl and nahco3 sodium is released into the groundwater by water interaction in the cation exchange processes or anthropogenic sources such as wastewater and septic tanks on the whole total hardness is a parameter influencing the groundwater acceptability about the case of drinking purposes our results show the hardness values between 220 and 720 mg l as it is shown in table 1 the high value of standard deviation observed in measured hardness indicates the significant variations of this parameter in the study area as a result hardness is strongly affected by the geological structure which derived largely from the soil and rock formations in general hard waters originate in areas where the top soil is thick and limestone formations are present khan and jhariya 2017 although cations that cause water hardness are calcium and magnesium the results in the present study show that magnesium contribution is more than that of calcium hard water leads to the formation of scaling in pipeline reduces the efficiency of water treatment processes and increases the consumption of soap taghipour et al 2012 zhang and chen 2016 the results also indicate that potassium concentrations varied between 0 1 and 17 0 mg l bearing in mind the standard value of 12 mg l only one sample exceeds the corresponded guideline value comparing the concentrations of potassium with the other ions show that potassium is not playing a significant role in the chemical characteristics of sampled water this is in accordance with the findings of similar studies mosaferi et al 2014 zheng et al 2017 overall in view of the physicochemical quality of groundwater samples in this study the major cations and anions relative abundance based on the meq l values were in the order of mg2 na ca2 k and hco3 so4 2 cl no3 f respectively 3 2 heavy metals twenty species of heavy metals including arsenic aluminum boron barium beryllium chromium copper mercury tin zinc cadmium cobalt iron manganese molybdenum nickel lead antimony selenium and vanadium were monitored in groundwater samples table 2 provides the results of heavy metal analysis while some elements consist of arsenic beryllium copper mercury tin cadmium cobalt molybdenum nickel lead antimony selenium and vanadium were non detectable in all samples however contamination of groundwater with arsenic in other parts of the east azerbaijan province has previously been reported mosaferi et al 2017 2014 aluminum is an extremely abundant metal in the earth s crust and is often found in the form of silicates such as feldspar kalsi3o8 in fact aluminum concentrations above 0 1 mg l lead to the formation of its hydroxide floc on the surface of materials leading to consumer complaints there is no health based guideline value for aluminum in drinking water however aluminum concentration less than 0 1 mg l is usually acceptable who 2011 it is clear from table 2 24 out of 39 samples contain aluminum concentrations above 100 ppb this element can be selectively leached from rocks and soils to enter aquifer in the case of this area higher concentrations of aluminum in groundwater could be associated to the geological structures taking into account the extremely high reactivity of aluminum it quickly forms insoluble compounds and becomes partially safe that does not penetrate into the cells and tissues however under certain conditions in acidic water such as acid rains it changes to ionic state which can react with biological objects higher concentrations of aluminum in surface and groundwater have been reported in some cases which can be due to the geological structures or some other phenomena such as acid rains momot and synzynys 2005 boron is a micro component which is involved in the process of bone formation and prevents caries apart from its natural metabolic functions it can induce multiple pathological effects it has been reported that boron intoxication can lead to skin inflammation vomiting anemia diarrhea and convulsions central nervous system gastrointestinal tract skin and mucous membranes liver and kidneys are the organs which are effected by high concentrations of boron who 2011 the results of this study show that boron concentration is varying based on the sample location indicating that geological structure is playing an important role in boron content boron in groundwater may be adsorbed by soils and sediments adsorption desorption reactions are the sole significant mechanism influencing the fate of boron in an aquifer rai and zachara 1984 boron adsorption is strongly depended on the ph as well as concentration in the solution li et al 2017 higher concentrations of boron in groundwater have been reported in the literature for example in a study conducted in the northern greece it has been found that almost 60 of water samples have concentrations above 1000 µg l of boron voutsa et al 2009 iron and manganese are naturally occurring metals in soils rocks and minerals groundwater contacts with these solid materials in aquifer dissolving iron and manganese at concentrations higher than 300 ppb for iron and 100 ppb for manganese there may be metallic taste to the water and staining of plumbing fixtures may become a common problem du et al 2017 li et al 2016 iron and manganese concentrations in groundwater are influenced not only by the geological structures but also by the industrial wastes acid mine drainages wastewaters and landfill leachates they are highly dependent to the dissolved oxygen in groundwater iron for example has two forms in groundwater fe2 very soluble and fe3 not dissolve appreciably when levels of dissolved oxygen in groundwater are greater than 1 2 mg l iron occurs as fe3 while at lower dissolved oxygen levels it occurs as fe2 el araby et al 2009 the results of present study show that only 2 samples have iron concentrations higher than the standard value however 17 of the samples have manganese concentrations above the standard limit barium is present as a trace element in both igneous and sedimentary rocks it is most commonly occurred in the form of barium sulfate barite and to a lesser extent barium carbonate witherite therefore its presence in groundwater is inevitable the solubility of barium compounds in water is strongly depending on the ph in addition granite like igneous rocks alkaline igneous and volcanic rocks are the geological structures containing barium compounds giménez forcada and vega alegre 2015 saby et al 2016 in the present study barium concentrations were under the guideline value and therefore groundwater sources in the study area are safe with respect to this element the observed barium values in this study are comparable to that reported from the other studies in the neighbor areas mosaferi et al 2014 pourakbar et al 2015 anthropogenic sources of chromium as a contaminant in the environment are from the discharges of dye and paint pigments wood preservatives chrome plating liquid wastes and leaching from hazardous waste sites chromium is also found in natural deposits of ores containing other elements mostly as chrome iron ore it is also widely present in soils and plants naturally occurring chromium may be associated with serpentinite containing rocks or chromium containing geologic formations kazakis et al 2017 in the present study all the collected samples contain chromium levels less than the guideline value mosaferi et al 2014 reported chromium concentrations in drinking groundwater of tabriz county within the guideline value zinc is commonly available in the air water and soil industrial activities are also the source of zinc intrusion into the environment in natural surface water the concentration of zinc is less than 10 μg l while it is between 10 and 40 μg l in groundwater sources zinc imparts an undesirable astringent taste to water tests indicate that 5 of a population could distinguish between zinc free water and water containing zinc at a level of 4 mg l as zinc sulfate however the detection levels for other zinc salts were somewhat higher water containing zinc at concentrations in the range of 3 and 5 mg l also tends to appear opalescent and develops a greasy film when boiled zinc is an essential nutrient needed by the human body so the daily recommended dietary requirement of zinc for adults is 8 11 mg d who 2011 there is no guideline value for the concentration of zinc in drinking water however in groundwater samples the concentrations are lower than the taste threshold limits in our study area our results could be attributed to the fact that zinc as a constituent of roofing sheets has been washed down by rainfall into the soil before ending up in the underground water by leaching over decades of time stein et al 1995 however it is speculated that the zinc content of this study area could be attributed to natural causes rather than human activities 3 3 spatial variations to better understand the quality of groundwater resources in the study area gis based maps were developed based on the physicochemical parameters and heavy metals fig 2 shows the spatial variations of ec in monitored groundwater samples since the ec is dependent on the amount of the inorganic compounds dissolved in water therefore higher ec values are indicating higher salts dissolution in water which can be useful parameter to judge the overall quality of water as it is shown in this figure the ec values in the northern and southern parts of the study area are higher than that of other parts one of the other important parameters about the case of water quality is the hardness fig 3 displays the distribution of total hardness of groundwater in the study area as it is shown in the figure southern parts of the area have higher values of hardness generally in terms of hardness water is classified as soft 75 mg l caco3 medium hard 75 150 mg l caco3 hard 150 300 mg l caco3 and very hard 300 mg l caco3 the range and mean values of total hardness in monitored samples were 220 720 mg l and 373 100 mg l as caco3 respectively representing that the analyzed water samples could be grouped as hard water water hardness in most groundwater is naturally occurring from weathering of limestone sedimentary rocks and calcium bearing minerals gambolati and verri 2014 limestone and sedimentary rocks which are found in the study area could be speculated as the source of hardness in groundwater resources nitrate in drinking water is an important chemical which can cause serious health effects fig 4 shows the distribution of nitrate concentrations in the area as it is shown in this figure the highest nitrate contents are observed in the samples from the north east in spring season however southern parts of the area have the highest nitrate concentrations in summer multiple sources of nitrate in groundwater have been proposed due to the complex series of chemical and biochemical nitrogen compounds reactions in groundwater it is often impossible to ascertain the exact source of nitrate in groundwater septic tanks animal and human wastes and commercial fertilizers are the probable sources of nitrate in groundwater nakagawa et al 2017 considering the main activity in the study area the difference in the nitrate content could be attributed to the various kinds of fertilizers used in the agricultural fields about the case of heavy metals barium and manganese distribution show a logical pattern in the area fig 5 and fig 6 depict the distributions of barium and manganese respectively as it is shown in fig 5 the lowest and highest amounts of barium are observed in the southern and eastern parts of the study area respectively in view of fig 6 higher concentrations of manganese are observed in the western parts while moving toward the eastern parts the manganese content decreases in groundwater 3 4 hydro geochemical and statistical analysis in order to find out the hydro chemical faces of monitored groundwater samples piper diagram was developed fig 7 show the piper diagrams for spring and summer seasons as it is seen magnesium and calcium are the dominant cations and bicarbonate and chloride are the dominant anions in water samples consequently the major water types in the study area were ca hco3 and ca mg cl types the ca hco3 type represents fresh groundwater or freshwater that recently has been infiltrated while the ca mg cl type specifies saline water or mixing from surface contamination sources nagarajan et al 2010 to find out the natural mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry gibbs plot was also developed based on gibbs plot main mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry are rainfall dominance rock weathering dominance and evaporation participation dominance sheikhy narany et al 2014 fig 8 illustrates the gibbs plot for the monitored samples as it is shown in the plot majority of the samples fell into rock dominated group in addition some of the samples also fell in the evaporation precipitation group it sounds that the chemistry of groundwater in our study area is generally related to the carbonate and silicate weathering table 3 presents the correlation between physicochemical parameters and heavy metals in groundwater samples for summer season as it is shown in the table there is a high correlation between total hardness ec sulfate bicarbonate magnesium and sodium the findings in the present study are fully in line with the findings of the other similar studies mosaferi et al 2014 tirkey et al 2017 as mentioned before water hardness in the present study is highly dependent on the magnesium concentration than calcium however mosaferi et al 2014 reported that groundwater hardness in rural communities of tabriz county is dependent on both calcium and magnesium in which calcium is more significantly affecting than magnesium in another study it is also reported that total hardness of groundwater in an aquifer in india is highly dependent on the concentrations of both calcium and magnesium however calcium is playing more important role than magnesium samantara et al 2017 this difference between the results could be attributed to the geological structures of the study area which is containing higher magnesium concentrations than calcium 4 conclusion groundwater quality assessment was carried out in malekan county in the northwest of iran groundwater resources are the main drinking water sources in this region in the study area 77 groundwater samples from 39 water wells were drawn and analyzed for their physicochemical and heavy metals contents the analytical results of physicochemical parameters were compared with the standard guideline values recommended by the who and ins for drinking purposes in addition to physicochemical parameters heavy metals of concern twenty species were also measured in groundwater samples spatial distribution of groundwater quality parameters were produced by gis technique investigation of the spatial variations in groundwater quality reveals that southern and northern parts of the area have higher concentrations of dissolved solids and therefore relatively lower water quality presented thematic maps are clarifying the overall quality of groundwater in the study area which could be reliable for decision making in drinking water sources selection the major cations and anions relative abundance in the area are in the order of mg2 na ca2 k and hco3 so4 2 cl no3 f respectively based on the geochemical characteristics of groundwater and piper diagrams two major distinguished groundwater types were noticed the major water types were fresh ca hco3 and saline ca mg cl in the study area based on the gibbs plot chemistry of groundwater could be related to the carbonate and silicate weathering it was also found that total hardness of groundwater is highly dependent on magnesium concentration than calcium the results of present study could be used to reliably make decision on drilling new wells or selecting existing wells to supply drinking water acknowledgment the current work was supported by the east azerbaijan rural water and wastewater company no 4 9578 
12277,the suitability of rural groundwater quality for drinking purposes were investigated in the north west of iran major anions cations and heavy metals were measured in 39 water wells during the summer and spring seasons the spatial distribution of major parameters and hydro chemical faces were described by developing gis based maps and piper and gibbs diagrams according to the results the ec values were in the range of 461 and 2600 μs cm with the hardness contents between 220 and 720 mg l as caco3 it was found that the total hardness is highly correlated with the magnesium concentration than calcium in all samples the dominant cations and anions were in the order of mg2 na ca2 k and hco3 so4 2 cl no3 f respectively the major water types in the area were fresh ca hco3 and saline ca mg cl based on gibbs plot the main mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry were rainfall dominance rock weathering dominance and evaporation participation dominance the lower quality of water resources sited in the southern and northern parts of the area was observed according to the gis maps it was found that aluminum boron iron and manganese concentrations in some cases were higher than the guideline values however it can be concluded that groundwater quality in the study area apart from some cases is suitable for drinking purposes without any specific treatment processes the present study gives a comprehensive status of groundwater quality for proper management in the area graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater quality heavy metals hydro geochemical analysis piper diagram

attributed to the dissimilar geological structures in addition agricultural activities in malekan county could be the other reason for deterioration of groundwater quality acceptable limit of fluoride in drinking water is 1 5 mg l as shown in table 1 fluoride concentrations in all samples were less than the guideline value fluoride is usually naturally occurring in groundwater which is released into the water table as a result of the rocks breakdown or weathering raj and shaji 2017 in addition it commonly derives from dissolution of fluorite fluor apatite silicates and volcanic ash fluoride could also be released into the groundwater due to the application of phosphorous fertilizers and steel manufacturing hudak and sanmanee 2003 tirkey et al 2017 it is also reported that ph bicarbonate and calcium are the main determining factors in releasing of the fluoride from rock minerals into the groundwater saxena and ahmed 2001 from the measurements shown in table 1 it has been observed that the chloride values in all samples were below the guideline values however the chloride concentrations in summer samples were higher than that of spring this is due to the more intrusion of water into the water table because of the higher precipitation in spring on the other hand the higher evaporation rates in summer season make the chloride to be concentrated in groundwater resources normally chloride ions in groundwater originate from chloride salts which are water soluble found in minerals however in the case of the study area anthropogenic sources such as agricultural products e g animal manure fertilizer and irrigation return flow oilfield brine household sewage landfill leachate industrial effluent deicing salt and pumping induced saltwater intrusion could be the other probable sources of chloride in the water wells feth 1981 as can be seen in table 1 majority of the samples have sulfate contents below the guideline value however higher sulfate concentrations were observed in 2 cases in each of spring and summer samples due to the underground reducing conditions sulfate concentration in groundwater is usually low which is inhibiting the sulfide oxidation to generate sulfate alam et al 2016 in the case of the present study sulfate concentrations were predominantly lower except for 2 samples which could be due to the geological structure in the area comparing the results with the similar study conducted in tabriz mosaferi et al 2014 shows that the average values of chloride and sulfate in this study are higher than those reported for tabriz county which has a volcanic origin it is also reported that chloride and sulfate are abundant in sedimentary rocks hudak and sanmanee 2003 on the other hand the geological structure of malekan county sedimentary rocks could be the reason for higher chloride and sulfate concentrations in this research the alkalinity of groundwater samples varied between 152 and 480 mg l as caco3 there is a little information about the health effects of alkalinity in drinking water however use of alkaline water for washing causes skin problems in addition coagulation of alkaline water in treatment process leads to excessive consumption of coagulants the other important effect attributed to alkaline water is the occurrence of scaling in pipelines millar et al 2017 taghipour et al 2012 from the results carbonate alkalinity phenolphthalein alkalinity was not observed in all groundwater samples which is in line with the findings of other similar studies ebrahimi et al 2016 mosaferi et al 2014 both carbonate and hydroxide alkalinity are present in alkaline water with ph values above 8 3 therefore it can be concluded that all of alkalinity present in water samples are in bicarbonate form carbone dioxide and carbonate dissolving organic matter oxidation and reaction of silicates with carbonic acid are the source of alkalinity intrusion into the aquifer jeong 2001 ranjan et al 2013 it is well known that nitrate presence in groundwater is a good indicator of anthropogenic pollution agricultural sources such as crop fertilizer crop residue animal waste and mineralization of soil organic nitrogen are the sources of nitrate in groundwater non agricultural sources also include septic systems lawn fertilizers discharges of nitrogen bearing effluents and atmospheric depositions aerated soils containing nitrogen compounds oxidize them to soluble nitrate and then intrusion of nitrate to the water takes place wang et al 2017 our results show that nitrate concentrations in all the collected samples were below the standard limits it is reported that nitrate concentration in natural water does not exceed 10 mg l cushing et al 1973 although nitrate contents in our samples are within the standard range some cases contain values above 10 mg l considering the point that the samples collected in this study were all from the rural areas with the dominant activity of farming higher nitrate concentrations could be due to the use of fertilizers in the agricultural fields sodium concentrations in the studied samples varied between 7 4 and 296 0 mg l so considering the ins only one of the samples exceeded the standard limits sodium in groundwater could be found in the forms of nacl and nahco3 sodium is released into the groundwater by water interaction in the cation exchange processes or anthropogenic sources such as wastewater and septic tanks on the whole total hardness is a parameter influencing the groundwater acceptability about the case of drinking purposes our results show the hardness values between 220 and 720 mg l as it is shown in table 1 the high value of standard deviation observed in measured hardness indicates the significant variations of this parameter in the study area as a result hardness is strongly affected by the geological structure which derived largely from the soil and rock formations in general hard waters originate in areas where the top soil is thick and limestone formations are present khan and jhariya 2017 although cations that cause water hardness are calcium and magnesium the results in the present study show that magnesium contribution is more than that of calcium hard water leads to the formation of scaling in pipeline reduces the efficiency of water treatment processes and increases the consumption of soap taghipour et al 2012 zhang and chen 2016 the results also indicate that potassium concentrations varied between 0 1 and 17 0 mg l bearing in mind the standard value of 12 mg l only one sample exceeds the corresponded guideline value comparing the concentrations of potassium with the other ions show that potassium is not playing a significant role in the chemical characteristics of sampled water this is in accordance with the findings of similar studies mosaferi et al 2014 zheng et al 2017 overall in view of the physicochemical quality of groundwater samples in this study the major cations and anions relative abundance based on the meq l values were in the order of mg2 na ca2 k and hco3 so4 2 cl no3 f respectively 3 2 heavy metals twenty species of heavy metals including arsenic aluminum boron barium beryllium chromium copper mercury tin zinc cadmium cobalt iron manganese molybdenum nickel lead antimony selenium and vanadium were monitored in groundwater samples table 2 provides the results of heavy metal analysis while some elements consist of arsenic beryllium copper mercury tin cadmium cobalt molybdenum nickel lead antimony selenium and vanadium were non detectable in all samples however contamination of groundwater with arsenic in other parts of the east azerbaijan province has previously been reported mosaferi et al 2017 2014 aluminum is an extremely abundant metal in the earth s crust and is often found in the form of silicates such as feldspar kalsi3o8 in fact aluminum concentrations above 0 1 mg l lead to the formation of its hydroxide floc on the surface of materials leading to consumer complaints there is no health based guideline value for aluminum in drinking water however aluminum concentration less than 0 1 mg l is usually acceptable who 2011 it is clear from table 2 24 out of 39 samples contain aluminum concentrations above 100 ppb this element can be selectively leached from rocks and soils to enter aquifer in the case of this area higher concentrations of aluminum in groundwater could be associated to the geological structures taking into account the extremely high reactivity of aluminum it quickly forms insoluble compounds and becomes partially safe that does not penetrate into the cells and tissues however under certain conditions in acidic water such as acid rains it changes to ionic state which can react with biological objects higher concentrations of aluminum in surface and groundwater have been reported in some cases which can be due to the geological structures or some other phenomena such as acid rains momot and synzynys 2005 boron is a micro component which is involved in the process of bone formation and prevents caries apart from its natural metabolic functions it can induce multiple pathological effects it has been reported that boron intoxication can lead to skin inflammation vomiting anemia diarrhea and convulsions central nervous system gastrointestinal tract skin and mucous membranes liver and kidneys are the organs which are effected by high concentrations of boron who 2011 the results of this study show that boron concentration is varying based on the sample location indicating that geological structure is playing an important role in boron content boron in groundwater may be adsorbed by soils and sediments adsorption desorption reactions are the sole significant mechanism influencing the fate of boron in an aquifer rai and zachara 1984 boron adsorption is strongly depended on the ph as well as concentration in the solution li et al 2017 higher concentrations of boron in groundwater have been reported in the literature for example in a study conducted in the northern greece it has been found that almost 60 of water samples have concentrations above 1000 µg l of boron voutsa et al 2009 iron and manganese are naturally occurring metals in soils rocks and minerals groundwater contacts with these solid materials in aquifer dissolving iron and manganese at concentrations higher than 300 ppb for iron and 100 ppb for manganese there may be metallic taste to the water and staining of plumbing fixtures may become a common problem du et al 2017 li et al 2016 iron and manganese concentrations in groundwater are influenced not only by the geological structures but also by the industrial wastes acid mine drainages wastewaters and landfill leachates they are highly dependent to the dissolved oxygen in groundwater iron for example has two forms in groundwater fe2 very soluble and fe3 not dissolve appreciably when levels of dissolved oxygen in groundwater are greater than 1 2 mg l iron occurs as fe3 while at lower dissolved oxygen levels it occurs as fe2 el araby et al 2009 the results of present study show that only 2 samples have iron concentrations higher than the standard value however 17 of the samples have manganese concentrations above the standard limit barium is present as a trace element in both igneous and sedimentary rocks it is most commonly occurred in the form of barium sulfate barite and to a lesser extent barium carbonate witherite therefore its presence in groundwater is inevitable the solubility of barium compounds in water is strongly depending on the ph in addition granite like igneous rocks alkaline igneous and volcanic rocks are the geological structures containing barium compounds giménez forcada and vega alegre 2015 saby et al 2016 in the present study barium concentrations were under the guideline value and therefore groundwater sources in the study area are safe with respect to this element the observed barium values in this study are comparable to that reported from the other studies in the neighbor areas mosaferi et al 2014 pourakbar et al 2015 anthropogenic sources of chromium as a contaminant in the environment are from the discharges of dye and paint pigments wood preservatives chrome plating liquid wastes and leaching from hazardous waste sites chromium is also found in natural deposits of ores containing other elements mostly as chrome iron ore it is also widely present in soils and plants naturally occurring chromium may be associated with serpentinite containing rocks or chromium containing geologic formations kazakis et al 2017 in the present study all the collected samples contain chromium levels less than the guideline value mosaferi et al 2014 reported chromium concentrations in drinking groundwater of tabriz county within the guideline value zinc is commonly available in the air water and soil industrial activities are also the source of zinc intrusion into the environment in natural surface water the concentration of zinc is less than 10 μg l while it is between 10 and 40 μg l in groundwater sources zinc imparts an undesirable astringent taste to water tests indicate that 5 of a population could distinguish between zinc free water and water containing zinc at a level of 4 mg l as zinc sulfate however the detection levels for other zinc salts were somewhat higher water containing zinc at concentrations in the range of 3 and 5 mg l also tends to appear opalescent and develops a greasy film when boiled zinc is an essential nutrient needed by the human body so the daily recommended dietary requirement of zinc for adults is 8 11 mg d who 2011 there is no guideline value for the concentration of zinc in drinking water however in groundwater samples the concentrations are lower than the taste threshold limits in our study area our results could be attributed to the fact that zinc as a constituent of roofing sheets has been washed down by rainfall into the soil before ending up in the underground water by leaching over decades of time stein et al 1995 however it is speculated that the zinc content of this study area could be attributed to natural causes rather than human activities 3 3 spatial variations to better understand the quality of groundwater resources in the study area gis based maps were developed based on the physicochemical parameters and heavy metals fig 2 shows the spatial variations of ec in monitored groundwater samples since the ec is dependent on the amount of the inorganic compounds dissolved in water therefore higher ec values are indicating higher salts dissolution in water which can be useful parameter to judge the overall quality of water as it is shown in this figure the ec values in the northern and southern parts of the study area are higher than that of other parts one of the other important parameters about the case of water quality is the hardness fig 3 displays the distribution of total hardness of groundwater in the study area as it is shown in the figure southern parts of the area have higher values of hardness generally in terms of hardness water is classified as soft 75 mg l caco3 medium hard 75 150 mg l caco3 hard 150 300 mg l caco3 and very hard 300 mg l caco3 the range and mean values of total hardness in monitored samples were 220 720 mg l and 373 100 mg l as caco3 respectively representing that the analyzed water samples could be grouped as hard water water hardness in most groundwater is naturally occurring from weathering of limestone sedimentary rocks and calcium bearing minerals gambolati and verri 2014 limestone and sedimentary rocks which are found in the study area could be speculated as the source of hardness in groundwater resources nitrate in drinking water is an important chemical which can cause serious health effects fig 4 shows the distribution of nitrate concentrations in the area as it is shown in this figure the highest nitrate contents are observed in the samples from the north east in spring season however southern parts of the area have the highest nitrate concentrations in summer multiple sources of nitrate in groundwater have been proposed due to the complex series of chemical and biochemical nitrogen compounds reactions in groundwater it is often impossible to ascertain the exact source of nitrate in groundwater septic tanks animal and human wastes and commercial fertilizers are the probable sources of nitrate in groundwater nakagawa et al 2017 considering the main activity in the study area the difference in the nitrate content could be attributed to the various kinds of fertilizers used in the agricultural fields about the case of heavy metals barium and manganese distribution show a logical pattern in the area fig 5 and fig 6 depict the distributions of barium and manganese respectively as it is shown in fig 5 the lowest and highest amounts of barium are observed in the southern and eastern parts of the study area respectively in view of fig 6 higher concentrations of manganese are observed in the western parts while moving toward the eastern parts the manganese content decreases in groundwater 3 4 hydro geochemical and statistical analysis in order to find out the hydro chemical faces of monitored groundwater samples piper diagram was developed fig 7 show the piper diagrams for spring and summer seasons as it is seen magnesium and calcium are the dominant cations and bicarbonate and chloride are the dominant anions in water samples consequently the major water types in the study area were ca hco3 and ca mg cl types the ca hco3 type represents fresh groundwater or freshwater that recently has been infiltrated while the ca mg cl type specifies saline water or mixing from surface contamination sources nagarajan et al 2010 to find out the natural mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry gibbs plot was also developed based on gibbs plot main mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry are rainfall dominance rock weathering dominance and evaporation participation dominance sheikhy narany et al 2014 fig 8 illustrates the gibbs plot for the monitored samples as it is shown in the plot majority of the samples fell into rock dominated group in addition some of the samples also fell in the evaporation precipitation group it sounds that the chemistry of groundwater in our study area is generally related to the carbonate and silicate weathering table 3 presents the correlation between physicochemical parameters and heavy metals in groundwater samples for summer season as it is shown in the table there is a high correlation between total hardness ec sulfate bicarbonate magnesium and sodium the findings in the present study are fully in line with the findings of the other similar studies mosaferi et al 2014 tirkey et al 2017 as mentioned before water hardness in the present study is highly dependent on the magnesium concentration than calcium however mosaferi et al 2014 reported that groundwater hardness in rural communities of tabriz county is dependent on both calcium and magnesium in which calcium is more significantly affecting than magnesium in another study it is also reported that total hardness of groundwater in an aquifer in india is highly dependent on the concentrations of both calcium and magnesium however calcium is playing more important role than magnesium samantara et al 2017 this difference between the results could be attributed to the geological structures of the study area which is containing higher magnesium concentrations than calcium 4 conclusion groundwater quality assessment was carried out in malekan county in the northwest of iran groundwater resources are the main drinking water sources in this region in the study area 77 groundwater samples from 39 water wells were drawn and analyzed for their physicochemical and heavy metals contents the analytical results of physicochemical parameters were compared with the standard guideline values recommended by the who and ins for drinking purposes in addition to physicochemical parameters heavy metals of concern twenty species were also measured in groundwater samples spatial distribution of groundwater quality parameters were produced by gis technique investigation of the spatial variations in groundwater quality reveals that southern and northern parts of the area have higher concentrations of dissolved solids and therefore relatively lower water quality presented thematic maps are clarifying the overall quality of groundwater in the study area which could be reliable for decision making in drinking water sources selection the major cations and anions relative abundance in the area are in the order of mg2 na ca2 k and hco3 so4 2 cl no3 f respectively based on the geochemical characteristics of groundwater and piper diagrams two major distinguished groundwater types were noticed the major water types were fresh ca hco3 and saline ca mg cl in the study area based on the gibbs plot chemistry of groundwater could be related to the carbonate and silicate weathering it was also found that total hardness of groundwater is highly dependent on magnesium concentration than calcium the results of present study could be used to reliably make decision on drilling new wells or selecting existing wells to supply drinking water acknowledgment the current work was supported by the east azerbaijan rural water and wastewater

12278,textile dyes such as malachite green are common contaminants in wastewater which are persistent in environment and also toxic to living organisms in this study live growing cells of our patented bacterial strain bacillus cereus m1 16 were used for bioremediation of one representative textile dye malachite green first in batch process to standardize the environmental parameters for optimum bioremediation then bioremediation of the representative dye from synthetic dye solution along with subsequent cod removal in aerated stirred tank using activated sludge system containing b cereus m 1 16 as dominant species under standardized conditions from batch process finally the optimized activated sludge system was applied for bioremediation of dye and cod removal from simulated textile effluent the batch experiments provided the benchmark information regarding the environmental parameters that could influence the bioremediation of malachite green viz ph 7 0 2 v v 1 of inoculum most effective initial dye concentration of 50 mg l 1 minimum contact time of 20 h and incubation conditions 30 c under shaking 120 rpm the activated sludge system was acclimatized with cultured b cereus m1 16 broth cell concentration 1 6 g l 1 bioremediation of dye was carried out following acclimatization average mlss in the range 3520 4020 mg l 1 in the activated sludge system a maximum of 96 dye removal and 79 cod removal were recorded at 50 mg l 1 influent dye concentration and 0 014 h 1 dilution rate which provided a hydraulic retention time of 72 h the studied activated sludge system was also found efficient in bioremediation of malachite green 96 from simulated textile effluent along with removal of cod thus activated sludge system can be utilized as a cheap and efficient method of bioremediation for continuous treatment of large scale wastewaters graphical abstract fx1 keywords stirred tank reactor activated sludge malachite green simulated textile effluent growing cells dye removal 1 introduction water pollution is characterized by high biochemical oxygen demand bod high chemical oxygen demand cod suspended solids bad smell toxicity etc and especially color for which textile dyes are mostly responsible mahmoodi et al 2011 contamination of the natural aquatic bodies due to direct or indirect discharge of industrial effluents into water bodies without adequate treatment to remove harmful compounds is the most important reason of water pollution dyes are used in different industrial sectors among which textile industries are one of the most significant users in textile industries synthetic dyes are extensively used for dyeing process the textile industry is also one of the most water consuming industrial sectors spagni et al 2010 as a result of wide application of dyes these industrial pollutants are common contaminants in wastewater deniz and karaman 2011 bankole et al 2017 deniz and kepekci 2017 malachite green is a recalcitrant and environmentally persistent molecule which has been reported several times for acute toxicity to a wide range of living organisms the properties of textile dyes such as brightness visible color at low concentrations complex chemical structure and resistance to light and chemical attack make them fairly resistant to microbial degradation de souza et al 2008 due to tremendous industrialization and man s urge for color they are also produced on a large scale worldwide mohan et al 2002 malachite green is mainly used in textile industries which alone accounts for two third of the total production of dye containing wastewater the effluents from dye processing industries are highly colored with high bod and cod content liu et al 2016 rangabhashiyam et al 2018 many researchers have reported the activated sludge system as a superior biotreatment process and a cheap method for removal of different toxic compounds from industrial or agricultural wastewater which also reduces the bod and cod of the wastewater biotreatment of a toxic compound by activated sludge system may be a process of adsorption reported by many researchers sag et al 2003 bera et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 while other researchers have also studied the biodegradation of different toxic compounds in activated sludge systems miranda et al 2013 park et al 2017 boonnorat et al 2018 haddad et al 2018 bioremediation of malachite green has attained a lot of attention in past several years different biosorbents had been reported such as agricultural wastes aerobic granules microbes fungi algae and bacteria table 1 lists the studies of malachite green bioremediation with bacterial biosorbents different strains of bacillus cereus were also reported in batch removal of malachite green deng et al 2008 cheriaa and bakhrouf 2009 wanyonyi et al 2017 we also have reported bacillus cereus m1 16 mtcc 5521 dry cells and immobilized cells in our previous publications for efficient removal of malachite green in batch process nath and ray 2015 nath et al 2015 and in continuous flow packed bed columns nath et al 2016 however most of these studies were limited to laboratory conditions there is a need to transfer these techniques from laboratory to real field conditions for treatment of large scale wastewaters few studies such as mondal and ahmed 2009 have reported the adsorption of malachite green in open sequential batch reactor with aerator in the present study we considered that removal of malachite green in activated sludge system using our patented bacterial strain as dominant species in the sludge is highly essential for application of the strain for biotreatment of dyes present in industry effluents the main objective of the present study was to develop a cheap and suitable method for large scale removal of dyes from textile industry effluents the study deals with bioremediation of one representative textile dye malachite green by growing cells of bacillus cereus m1 16 mtcc 5521 from the fermentation medium under batch process at the beginning and then subsequently bioremediation of the dye and reduction of cod from synthetic and simulated textile wastewater by activated sludge system studies of the removal of malachite green by growing cells under batch process were done to optimize the common environmental parameters that are usually known to influence the process of bioremediation and subsequently to use them as a benchmark for further experiments with stirred tank reactor str in the experiments with str important parameters for determination of the kinetics of whole process and designing of str viz dilution rate flow rate hydraulic retention time dye concentration in mixed liquor effluent were studied and optimized changes in chemical oxygen demand cod and mixed liquor suspended solid mlss were studied for determination of the steady state conditions for operation of the system finally the optimized system was applied for removal of malachite green from simulated textile industry effluent thus the present study shows a process for development of a cheap and efficient method for applying the well known technique of bioremediation of dyes with microbes for large scale wastewater treatment this study may prove beneficial for transfer of a technology from laboratory to field scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 biomass and culture conditions bacillus cereus m1 16 mtcc 5521 isolated identified and mutated by bera et al 2007 was used in present study organism was maintained in modified nutrient agar medium having the composition g l 1 beef

fermentation medium were same as above except agar 2 2 chemicals malachite green oxalate and other chemicals including ingredients of the acclimatization media simulated wastewater and reagents for measurement of cod were obtained from merck india loba chemie and sd fine chemicals 2 3 preparation of dye containing wastewater synthetic dye solutions were prepared by dissolving malachite green c52h54n4o12 in ddw a dye stock solution of 5000 mg l 1 was maintained while desired proportion of stock solution was mixed with modified nutrient medium to get required dye concentrations during experiments 2 4 malachite green removal in batch process by growing bacillus cereus m1 16 for experiments with growing bacillus cereus m1 16 inoculum was prepared by aseptically transferring one loop full of cells from maintenance culture to 50 ml inoculum medium in 250 ml erlenmeyer flask and incubated at 30 c 120 rpm for 24 h then 1 ml inoculum was added to 50 ml fermentation medium containing desired amount of malachite green in 250 ml erlenmeyer flask the environmental parameters affecting biosorption of malachite green viz medium volume ph temperature inoculum volume initial dye concentration and incubation time were studied varying one parameter at a time supernatant was collected by centrifugation of fermentation broth at 5000 rpm for 10 min after completion of reaction the residual dye concentration in the supernatant was measured spectrophotometrically hitachi u 2000 at 617 nm and expressed as percentage dye removal 2 5 malachite green removal by activated sludge system 2 5 1 laboratory scale stirred tank reactor str the reactor was cuboid in shape 30 30 30 cm3 made of poly acrylic perplex sheet and divided into two chambers viz aeration chamber and settling chamber air was introduced into aeration chamber using two air pumps at fixed flow rate sufficient to meet the oxygen demand of the organism and also to keep the contents of this chamber in completely mixed condition synthetic dye solution was constantly fed to the aeration chamber from a feed reservoir there was a ½ inch opening at the bottom of partition wall between the aeration chamber and settling chamber the settling chamber was kept completely turbulence free to allow settling of the biomass other suspended solids at the bottom and to allow flow of effluent out of the chamber from top this settling chamber prevents possible washout of sludge along with the flow of effluent out of the reactor the sludge deposited at the bottom of the settling tank could be recycled if required the experimental setup of str is schematically shown in fig 1 2 5 2 acclimatization of seed culture 24 h cell suspension of bacillus cereus m1 16 bera et al 2007 having cell concentration 1 6 g l 1 was used as seed culture for removal of malachite green the capacity of str used for present study was 30 l 10 of seed culture was added to the total volume of str i e 3 l seed culture was mixed with acclimatization medium containing malachite green 10 mg l 1 composition of acclimatization medium containing growth nutrients for survival of the organism has been shown in table 2 growth nutrients were added every alternate day for keeping the organisms in growing condition mlss of the acclimatization medium was estimated daily following standard process after 8 10 days mlss value of str was sufficiently high indicating sufficient microbial population for the treatment of synthetic dye solutions simulated textile wastewater all the researchers who have studied activated sludge systems considered mlss as an important parameter he et al 2013 have studied and reported in details the importance of mlss in operation of activated sludge system 2 5 3 treatment of malachite green synthetic dye solution containing malachite green was treated in str after sufficient mlss value has been reached influent dye solution was allowed to flow to the aeration chamber from feed reservoir at dilution rates needed to obtain the desired residence time in str average cod of influent was maintained at 1120 mg l 1 air was sparged constantly to maintain aerobic condition and mixing of components in aeration chamber str was operated till attainment of steady state conditions i e when cod of effluent became stable for a particular concentration of dye at particular flow rate bera et al 2012 ph of the mixed liquor was maintained in range 6 5 7 0 using 1 0 n naoh and 1 0 n hcl concentration of malachite green in mixed liquor and in effluent was estimated daily mlss was estimated every alternate day and maintained at a constant range malachite green concentration in influent was varied in the range 10 200 mg l 1 whereas dilution rates were maintained at 0 014 h 1 0 021 h 1 and 0 042 h 1 percentage of cod removal specific substrate utilization rate q and food to microorganism ratio f m ratio day 1 were estimated at all dilution rates 2 5 4 treatment of simulated textile effluent efficiency of activated sludge system in removing malachite green from simulated wastewater was investigated under optimized conditions simulated wastewater was prepared by dissolving dye mineral components and organic components in tap water at room temperature talarposhti et al 2001 wallace 2001 nath and ray 2015 table 3 represents the composition of simulated textile wastewater dye concentration in wastewater varies from industry to industry wallace 2001 in present study malachite green concentrations were varied from 50 to 1000 mg l 1 in the simulated wastewater cod of simulated wastewater was kept in the experimental range activated sludge system after acclimatization was operated at optimized dilution rate until attainment of steady state conditions 2 6 analytical methods the concentration of malachite green was measured spectrophotometrically hitachi u 2000 after removing any suspended solids or biomass in the sample through centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min cod of the effluent coming out from str was measured daily by open reflux method moore et al 1949 pitwell 1983 dilution rate and hydraulic retention time of nutrients and biomass in the system were estimated from eqs 1 3 1 flow rate ml min 1 volume of influent ml time min 2 dilution rate h 1 flow rate l h 1 volume l 3 hydraulic retention time h volume of reactor ml flow rate ml h 1 mixed

bacillus cereus m1 16 is an aerobic organism thus medium volume and proper aeration is very important for organism s growth in batch studies for removal of malachite green using growing cells experiments were carried out using different volumes of fermentation medium ranging from 40 to 70 ml in 250 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 50 mg l 1 malachite green at ph 5 0 for 48 h at 30 c 120 rpm 24 h cell suspension 2 was used as inoculum dye removal was found to increase with increase in medium volume upto 50 ml and decreased gradually with further increase in medium volume fig 2a the low percentage removal at 40 ml medium volume was probably due to less growth of organism and biomass formation due to less availability of nutrients in the batch system while medium volume higher than 50 ml was probably detrimental to the growth of organism due to decreased aeration rate malik 2004 thus medium volume of 50 ml in 250 ml erlenmeyer flask 20 was optimum for growth of the organism and removal of malachite green medium volume higher than 20 had negative effect on malachite green removal 3 1 2 effect of ph the ph of the sorbate solution has been reported to be one of the most significant variables in adsorption of dyes by several researchers partially because hydrogen ions are strong competing ions and partially due to ionization dissociation of functional groups on sorbent surfaces and also of dye molecule aksu 2005 deniz and karaman 2011 yagub et al 2012 deniz and kepekci 2017 in our study with growing cells ph also influences the growth of organism and thus ph of the microenvironment of growing bacterial cells effects the bioaccumulation of dye on bacterial cell surface at lower ph cell surface possess an overall positive charge due to high proton concentration in the surroundings thereby attachment of positively charged dye molecules such as malachite green suffers columbic repulsion with increase in ph cell surface becomes more and more negatively charged and thus ionic attraction increases leading to increased binding of malachite green molecules removal of malachite green was analyzed by varying ph of the fermentation medium from 3 0 to 9 0 at 50 ml medium volume and 2 inoculum 24 h cell suspension other conditions remaining the same malachite green removal was found to increase with increase in ph maximum malachite green removal was observed at ph 7 0 fig 2b lesser dye removal at ph less than 7 0 was probably due to less biomass growth in acidic fermentation medium as it is known that majority of microbes are not able to cope up with variation in ph and their growth and activity are compromised at highly acidic or highly alkaline range mishra and malik 2013 3 1 3 effect of temperature temperature plays a vital role in metabolism dependent bioaccumulation removal of any sorbate as temperature is an important factor for growth of the organism and biomass formation deng et al 2008 had already reported in their study of malachite green and other related dye removal with live bacterial cells that temperature lower than 20 c was not favorable for the growth of organism and most suitable range is around 20 40 c das et al 2006 have reported maximum efficiency of biosorption in the range 20 40 c but a temperature above 40 c was reported to have negative effect on biosorption of rhodamine b by rhizopus oryzae caused distortion of active binding sites wanyonyi et al 2017 have also reported that temperature above 40 c had negative effect on malachite green removal by enzymes extracted from a species of bacillus cereus in the present study effect of temperature on removal of malachite green was studied in the range 20 40 c at ph 7 0 other conditions remaining the same optimum temperature was found to be 30 c fig 2c similar types of results were observed by different authors for the biosorption of malachite green and other cationic dyes at various temperatures ganguly et al 2011 yagub et al 2012 ogataa et al 2015 rangabhashiyam et al 2018 3 1 4 effect of inoculum volume the growth stage and concentration of inoculum is an important factor in studies with growing cells 24 h cell suspension of bacillus cereus m1 16 having cell concentration 1 6 g l 1 was added as inoculum at different concentrations 1 4 to malachite green solutions to study the optimum concentration of inoculum other conditions remaining the same removal of malachite green was found to increase upto inoculum volume 2 due to more production of biosorbent and attain a gradual saturation with further increase fig 2d thus biomass production probably was fast with higher dose of inoculum but upto a limit due to the limitation of nutrients present in the batch process ganguly et al 2011 3 1 5 effect of initial dye concentration initial dye concentration of the fermentation medium was varied from 10 to 200 mg l 1 during removal of dye with growing cells of bacillus cereus m1 16 using 2 inoculum other conditions remaining the same the process of dye removal was also found to increase with increase in initial dye concentration upto 50 mg l 1 further increase in initial dye concentration showed negative effect on removal of malachite green fig 2e probably due to less biomass production it has been reported by several authors that higher initial dye concentration provides a driving force for transfer of solute from aqueous to solid phase which consequently increases the probability of collision between the dye molecules and the binding site on biomass mishra and malik 2013 gündüz and bayrak 2017 rangabhashiyam et al 2018 however dye concentration higher than a limit exerts toxicity for the cell growth aksu 2001 mishra and malik 2013 3 1 6 effect of incubation time bioaccumulation is an interaction of adsorbate and adsorbent where time is an important factor for determining the rate of the process with increase in contact time more and more dye cations are transferred from solution to the solid cell surface which get attached chemically or physically for every reaction there is a saturation time thus for bioaccumulation of dye also a saturation is reached after all the attachment sites on the biosorbent surface get attached by the dye molecules batch dye removal experiments were carried out with fermentation medium containing 50 mg l 1 malachite green for upto 48 h other conditions remaining same adsorption process was slow initially upto 10 h and proceeded very fast between 10 and 20 h attaining a saturation with further lapse of time malik 2004 ganguly et al 2011 huang et al 2016 asfaram et al 2017 deniz and kepekci 2017 initial lapse of time can be attributed to the growth of organism to have a sufficient biomass in the system a minimum incubation time of 20 h was found to be optimum for removal of malachite green by growing cells of bacillus cereus m1 16 fig 2f 99 of malachite green was found to be removed from its solution by the organism when 50 ml medium volume at ph 6 0 containing 50 mg l 1 of malachite green was inoculated with 2 v v 1 inoculum and incubated at 30 c at 120 rpm for a minimum of 20 h 3 2 continuous removal of malachite green in stirred tank reactor 3 2 1 effect of influent dye concentration after the seed culture has acclimatized and average mlss value reached to the range of 3520 4020 mg l 1 dye solution at different concentrations 10 200 mg l 1 was fed to the activated stirred tank at dilution rate of 0 014 h 1 and average temperature was maintained at 28 30 c each experiment required 14 15 days to reach steady state condition cod removal efficiency and percentage removal of dye were estimated daily which became stable after 13th day and the same efficiency was observed upto 15th day of operation for all dye concentrations maximum 96 removal of malachite green was observed at influent dye concentration of 25 50 mg l 1 fig 3 since this study utilizes the efficiency of growing cells the growth condition of the microorganism plays an important role in dye removal efficiency based on our results from batch experiments discussed in section 3 1 the used organism is known to show optimum sorption of dye at 50 mg l 1 increase in influent dye concentration above 50 mg l 1 was found to have a negative effect on continuous removal of malachite green in str also the reason for such behavior is explained for removal of malachite green in batch process in section 3 1 5 3 2 2 effect of influent flow rate after stabilization of mlss within experimental range dye solution 50 mg l 1 was fed to activated stirred tank reactor at different flow rates 6 9 10 5 and 20 8 ml min 1 varied to achieve dilution rates 0 014 h 1 0 021 h 1 and 0 042 h 1 respectively each experiment at different dilution rate was carried out for 15 days during which the cod and percentage dye removal were estimated daily dye removal was found to be highly dependent on dilution rate fig 4 at the lowest dilution rate studied the removal of malachite green was found 98 96 for the studied duration of 15 days the higher dilution rates lead to lesser removal of dye as shown in fig 4 such behavior may be due to less retention time of dye molecules in the tank at higher dilution rates resulting in less contact between dye ions and microbial cells thus leading to lesser efficiency of dye removal the possible washout of more microbial cells out of the tank along with the effluent at higher flow rates also may be responsible for reduction in dye removal at higher dilution rates bera et al 2012 have also reported in their study that changed ion sorption properties and bio kinetic properties of microorganisms at higher dilution rates are responsible for lesser removal of adsorbate haddad et al 2018 have also reported that higher hydraulic retention time corresponding to lower dilution rates gives more efficiency of dye removal due to the above mentioned reasons 3 2 3 performance summary of activated sludge system in this study percentage removal of cod was found to increase with increase in hydraulic retention time fig 5a a maximum of 79 cod removal and 96 dye removal was possible at 50 mg l 1 influent dye concentration and 0 014 h 1 dilution rate having hydraulic retention time 72 h maximum substrate utilization capacity was found to be 0 219 mg day 1 at 0 014 h 1 dilution rate fig 5b the relationship of f m ratio and cod removal efficiency was also analyzed at 50 mg l 1 influent dye concentration fig 5c table 4 represents the overall summary of the operation of activated sludge system in the present study all the experiments of dye removal were carried out for 15 days only after acclimatization however the optimized activated sludge system may be used and reused for a long time for continuous removal of dye from its solution at the end of operation the sludge was stabilized for reducing the volume and offensive odor through self biological digestion in a covered tank sludge digestion is a biological process in which organic solids are decomposed into stable substances which makes it easier to dewater or dry vis photocatalysis using sunlight is widely used for the treatment of wastewater in developed countries and has been established as highly effective for sludge disintegration by anjum et al 2016 3 3 removal of malachite green from simulated textile effluent by activated sludge system the optimized method of activated sludge system was tested for its efficiency of dye removal in presence of different organic and inorganic matter in the solution along with dye which is the case in real wastewaters thus simulated textile wastewater was formulated according to published literature and fed to the activated sludge system after stabilization of mlss within the optimized experimental range malachite green 50 mg l 1 was the only dye added to the studied simulated textile wastewater that was fed to the activated stirred tank reactor at dilution rate 0 014 h 1 having hydraulic retention time 72 h cod removal efficiency and percentage dye removal were estimated daily upto 15 days which was found stable after 10th day and the same efficiency was observed upto 15th day of operation of activated stirred tank maximum 96 removal of malachite green was observed at influent dye concentration of 50 mg l 1 in this study the optimized activated sludge system showed equivalent removal of malachite green from both dye solution and simulated textile wastewater 4 conclusions in the batch biosorption experiments with growing cells of bacillus cereus m1 16 maximum removal of malachite green 99 was achieved with 50 ml medium volume in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks at ph 6 0 containing 50 mg l 1 of malachite green solution inoculated with 2 v v 1 inoculum and incubated at 30 c and 120 rpm for a minimum of 20 h the parameters standardized for optimum dye removal in batch process provided the benchmark for scaling up of activated sludge system for large scale bioremediation of malachite green for operation of activated sludge system following parameters were found optimum viz 3520 4020 mg l 1 of mlss at the time of treatment 0 014 h 1 of dilution rate which provides 72 h of hydraulic retention time and 50 mg l 1 of influent dye concentration under the optimized conditions 96 of dye removal and 79 cod removal were recorded from the studied synthetic dye solution and also from the simulated textile effluent thus the activated sludge system developed in this study was found efficient in continuous treatment of large scale wastewater containing malachite green along with efficient removal of cod the present study was carried out with only one representative dye in the simulated textile effluent which can be extended to study the removal of multiple dyes also from real wastewaters acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge university grants commission cas program government of india grant no f4 1 2006 bsr 5 46 2007

bioremediation then bioremediation of the representative dye from synthetic dye solution along with subsequent cod removal in aerated stirred tank using activated sludge system containing b cereus m 1 16 as dominant species under standardized conditions from batch process finally the optimized activated sludge system was applied for bioremediation of dye and cod removal from simulated textile effluent the batch experiments provided the benchmark information regarding the environmental parameters that could influence the bioremediation of malachite green viz ph 7 0 2 v v 1 of inoculum most effective initial dye concentration of 50 mg l 1 minimum contact time of 20 h and incubation conditions 30 c under shaking 120 rpm the activated sludge system was acclimatized with cultured b cereus

also found efficient in bioremediation of malachite green 96 from simulated textile effluent along with removal of cod thus activated sludge system can be utilized as a cheap and efficient method of bioremediation for continuous treatment of large scale wastewaters graphical abstract fx1 keywords stirred tank reactor activated sludge malachite green simulated textile effluent growing cells dye removal 1 introduction water pollution is characterized by high biochemical oxygen demand bod high chemical oxygen demand cod suspended solids bad smell toxicity etc and especially color for which textile dyes are mostly responsible mahmoodi et al 2011 contamination of the natural aquatic bodies due to direct or indirect discharge of industrial effluents into water bodies without adequate treatment to remove harmful compounds is the most important reason of water pollution dyes are used in different industrial sectors among which textile industries are one of the most significant users in textile industries synthetic dyes are extensively used for dyeing process the textile industry is also one of the most water consuming industrial sectors spagni et al 2010 as a result of wide application of dyes these industrial pollutants are common contaminants in wastewater deniz and karaman 2011 bankole et al 2017 deniz and kepekci 2017 malachite green is a recalcitrant and environmentally persistent molecule which has been reported several times for acute toxicity to a wide range of living organisms the properties of textile dyes such as brightness visible color at low concentrations complex chemical structure and resistance to light and chemical attack make them fairly resistant to microbial degradation de souza et al 2008 due to tremendous industrialization and man s urge for color they are also produced on a large scale worldwide mohan et al 2002 malachite green is mainly used in textile industries which alone accounts for two third of the total production of dye containing wastewater the effluents from dye processing industries are highly colored with high bod and cod content liu et al 2016 rangabhashiyam et al 2018 many researchers have reported the activated sludge system as a superior biotreatment process and a cheap method for removal of different toxic compounds from industrial or agricultural wastewater which also reduces the bod and cod of the wastewater biotreatment of a toxic compound by activated sludge system may be a process of adsorption reported by many researchers sag et al 2003 bera et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 while other researchers have also studied the biodegradation of different toxic compounds in activated sludge systems miranda et al 2013 park et al 2017 boonnorat et al 2018 haddad et al 2018 bioremediation of malachite green has attained a lot of attention in past several years different biosorbents had been reported such as agricultural wastes aerobic granules microbes fungi algae and bacteria table 1 lists the studies of malachite green bioremediation with bacterial biosorbents different strains of bacillus cereus were also reported in batch removal of malachite green deng et al 2008 cheriaa and bakhrouf 2009 wanyonyi et al 2017 we also have reported bacillus cereus m1 16 mtcc 5521 dry cells and immobilized cells in our previous publications for efficient removal of malachite green in batch process nath and ray 2015 nath et al 2015 and in continuous flow packed bed columns nath et al 2016 however most of these studies were limited to laboratory conditions there is a need to transfer these techniques from laboratory to real field conditions for treatment of large scale wastewaters few studies such as mondal and ahmed 2009 have reported the adsorption of malachite green in open sequential batch reactor with aerator in the present study we considered that removal of malachite green in activated sludge system using our patented bacterial strain as dominant species in the sludge is highly essential for application of the strain for biotreatment of dyes present in industry effluents the main objective of the present study was to develop a cheap and suitable method for large scale removal of dyes from textile industry effluents the study deals with bioremediation of one representative textile dye malachite green by growing cells of bacillus cereus m1 16 mtcc 5521 from the fermentation medium under batch process at the beginning and then subsequently bioremediation of the dye and reduction of cod from synthetic and simulated textile wastewater by activated sludge system studies of the removal of malachite green by growing cells under batch process were done to optimize the common environmental parameters that are usually known to influence the process of bioremediation and subsequently to use them as a benchmark for further experiments with stirred tank reactor str in the experiments with str important parameters for determination of the kinetics of whole process and designing of str viz dilution rate flow rate hydraulic retention time dye concentration in mixed liquor effluent were studied and optimized changes in chemical oxygen demand cod and mixed liquor suspended solid mlss were studied for determination of the steady state conditions for operation of the system finally the optimized system was applied for removal of malachite green from simulated textile industry effluent thus the present study shows a process for development of a cheap and efficient method for applying the well known technique of bioremediation of dyes with microbes for large scale wastewater treatment this study may prove beneficial for transfer of a technology from laboratory to field scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 biomass and culture conditions bacillus cereus m1 16 mtcc 5521 isolated identified and mutated by bera et al 2007 was used in present study organism was maintained in modified nutrient agar medium having the composition g l 1 beef

fermentation medium were same as above except agar 2 2 chemicals malachite green oxalate and other chemicals including ingredients of the acclimatization media simulated wastewater and reagents for measurement of cod were obtained from merck india loba chemie and sd fine chemicals 2 3 preparation of dye containing wastewater synthetic dye solutions were prepared by dissolving malachite green c52h54n4o12 in ddw a dye stock solution of 5000 mg l 1 was maintained while desired proportion of stock solution was mixed with modified nutrient medium to get required dye concentrations during experiments 2 4 malachite green removal in batch process by growing bacillus cereus m1 16 for experiments with growing bacillus cereus m1 16 inoculum was prepared by aseptically transferring one loop full of cells from maintenance culture to 50 ml inoculum medium in 250 ml erlenmeyer flask and incubated at 30 c 120 rpm for 24 h then 1 ml inoculum was added to 50 ml fermentation medium containing desired amount of malachite green in 250 ml erlenmeyer flask the environmental parameters affecting biosorption of malachite green viz medium volume ph temperature inoculum volume initial dye concentration and incubation time were studied varying one parameter at a time supernatant was collected by centrifugation of fermentation broth at 5000 rpm for 10 min after completion of reaction the residual dye concentration in the supernatant was measured spectrophotometrically hitachi u 2000 at 617 nm and expressed as percentage dye removal 2 5 malachite green removal by activated sludge system 2 5 1 laboratory scale stirred tank reactor str the reactor was cuboid in shape 30 30 30 cm3 made of poly acrylic perplex sheet and divided into two chambers viz aeration chamber and settling chamber air was introduced into aeration chamber using two air pumps at fixed flow rate sufficient to meet the oxygen demand of the organism and also to keep the contents of this chamber in completely mixed condition synthetic dye solution was constantly fed to the aeration chamber from a feed reservoir there was a ½ inch opening at the bottom of partition wall between the aeration chamber and settling chamber the settling chamber was kept completely turbulence free to allow settling of the biomass other suspended solids at the bottom and to allow flow of effluent out of the chamber from top this settling chamber prevents possible washout of sludge along with the flow of effluent out of the reactor the sludge deposited at the bottom of the settling tank could be recycled if required the experimental setup of str is schematically shown in fig 1 2 5 2 acclimatization of seed culture 24 h cell suspension of bacillus cereus m1 16 bera et al 2007 having cell concentration 1 6 g l 1 was used as seed culture for removal of malachite green the capacity of str used for present study was 30 l 10 of seed culture was added to the total volume of str i e 3 l seed culture was mixed with acclimatization medium containing malachite green 10 mg l 1 composition of acclimatization medium containing growth nutrients for survival of the organism has been shown in table 2 growth nutrients were added every alternate day for keeping the organisms in growing condition mlss of the acclimatization medium was estimated daily following standard process after 8 10 days mlss value of str was sufficiently high indicating sufficient microbial population for the treatment of synthetic dye solutions simulated textile wastewater all the researchers who have studied activated sludge systems considered mlss as an important parameter he et al 2013 have studied and reported in details the importance of mlss in operation of activated sludge system 2 5 3 treatment of malachite green synthetic dye solution containing malachite green was treated in str after sufficient mlss value has been reached influent dye solution was allowed to flow to the aeration chamber from feed reservoir at dilution rates needed to obtain the desired residence time in str average cod of influent was maintained at 1120 mg l 1 air was sparged constantly to maintain aerobic condition and mixing of components in aeration chamber str was operated till attainment of steady state conditions i e when cod of effluent became stable for a particular concentration of dye at particular flow rate bera et al 2012 ph of the mixed liquor was maintained in range 6 5 7 0 using 1 0 n naoh and 1 0 n hcl concentration of malachite green in mixed liquor and in effluent was estimated daily mlss was estimated every alternate day and maintained at a constant range malachite green concentration in influent was varied in the range 10 200 mg l 1 whereas dilution rates were maintained at 0 014 h 1 0 021 h 1 and 0 042 h 1 percentage of cod removal specific substrate utilization rate q and food to microorganism ratio f m ratio day 1 were estimated at all dilution rates 2 5 4 treatment of simulated textile effluent efficiency of activated sludge system in removing malachite green from simulated wastewater was investigated under optimized conditions simulated wastewater was prepared by dissolving dye mineral components and organic components in tap water at room temperature talarposhti et al 2001 wallace 2001 nath and ray 2015 table 3 represents the composition of simulated textile wastewater dye concentration in wastewater varies from industry to industry wallace 2001 in present study malachite green concentrations were varied from 50 to 1000 mg l 1 in the simulated wastewater cod of simulated wastewater was kept in the experimental range activated sludge system after acclimatization was operated at optimized dilution rate until attainment of steady state conditions 2 6 analytical methods the concentration of malachite green was measured spectrophotometrically hitachi u 2000 after removing any suspended solids or biomass in the sample through centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min cod of the effluent coming out from str was measured daily by open reflux method moore et al 1949 pitwell 1983 dilution rate and hydraulic retention time of nutrients and biomass in the system

bacillus cereus m1 16 is an aerobic organism thus medium volume and proper aeration is very important for organism s growth in batch studies for removal of malachite green using growing cells experiments were carried out using different volumes of fermentation medium ranging from 40 to 70 ml in 250 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 50 mg l 1 malachite green at ph 5 0 for 48 h at 30 c 120 rpm 24 h cell suspension 2 was used as inoculum dye removal was found to increase with increase in medium volume upto 50 ml and decreased gradually with further increase in medium volume fig 2a the low percentage removal at 40 ml medium volume was probably due to less growth of organism and biomass formation due to less availability of nutrients in the batch system while medium volume higher than 50 ml was probably detrimental to the growth of organism due to decreased aeration rate malik 2004 thus medium volume of 50 ml in 250 ml erlenmeyer flask 20 was optimum for growth of the organism and removal of malachite green medium volume higher than 20 had negative effect on malachite green removal 3 1 2 effect of ph the ph of the sorbate solution has been reported to be one of the most significant variables in adsorption of dyes by several researchers partially because hydrogen ions are strong competing ions and partially due to ionization dissociation of functional groups on sorbent surfaces and also of dye molecule aksu 2005 deniz and karaman 2011 yagub et al 2012 deniz and kepekci 2017 in our study with growing cells ph also influences the growth of organism and thus ph of the microenvironment of growing bacterial cells effects the bioaccumulation of dye on bacterial cell surface at lower ph cell surface possess an overall positive charge due to high proton concentration in the surroundings thereby attachment of positively charged dye molecules such as malachite green suffers columbic repulsion with increase in ph cell surface becomes more and more negatively charged and thus ionic attraction increases leading to increased binding of malachite green molecules removal of malachite green was analyzed by varying ph of the fermentation medium from 3 0 to 9 0 at 50 ml medium volume and 2 inoculum 24 h cell suspension other conditions remaining the same malachite green removal was found to increase with increase in ph maximum malachite green removal was observed at ph 7 0 fig 2b lesser dye removal at ph less than 7 0 was probably due to less biomass growth in acidic fermentation medium as it is known that majority of microbes are not able to cope up with variation in ph and their growth and activity are compromised at highly acidic or highly alkaline range mishra and malik 2013 3 1 3 effect of temperature temperature plays a vital role in metabolism dependent bioaccumulation removal of any sorbate as temperature is an important factor for growth of the organism and biomass formation deng et al 2008 had already reported in their study of malachite green and other related dye removal with live bacterial cells that temperature lower than 20 c was not favorable for the growth of organism and most suitable range is around 20 40 c das et al 2006 have reported maximum efficiency of biosorption in the range 20 40 c but a temperature above 40 c was reported to have negative effect on biosorption of rhodamine b by rhizopus oryzae caused distortion of active binding sites wanyonyi et al 2017 have also reported that temperature above 40 c had negative effect on malachite green removal by enzymes extracted from a species of bacillus cereus in the present study effect of temperature on removal of malachite green was studied in the range 20 40 c at ph 7 0 other conditions remaining the same optimum temperature was found to be 30 c fig 2c similar types of results were observed by different authors for the biosorption of malachite green and other cationic dyes at various temperatures ganguly et al 2011 yagub et al 2012 ogataa et al 2015 rangabhashiyam et al 2018 3 1 4 effect of inoculum volume the growth stage and concentration of inoculum is an important factor in studies with growing cells 24 h cell suspension of bacillus cereus m1 16 having cell concentration 1 6 g l 1 was added as inoculum at different concentrations 1 4 to malachite green solutions to study the optimum concentration of inoculum other conditions remaining the same removal of malachite green was found to increase upto inoculum volume 2 due to more production of biosorbent and attain a gradual saturation with further increase fig 2d thus biomass production probably was fast with higher dose of inoculum but upto a limit due to the limitation of nutrients present in the batch process ganguly et al 2011 3 1 5 effect of initial dye concentration initial dye concentration of the fermentation medium was varied from 10 to 200 mg l 1 during removal of dye with growing cells of bacillus cereus m1 16 using 2 inoculum other conditions remaining the same the process of dye removal was also found to increase with increase in initial dye concentration upto 50 mg l 1 further increase in initial dye concentration showed negative effect on removal of malachite green fig 2e probably due to less biomass production it has been reported by several authors that higher initial dye concentration provides a driving force for transfer of solute from aqueous to solid phase which consequently increases the probability of collision between the dye molecules and the binding site on biomass mishra and malik 2013 gündüz and bayrak 2017 rangabhashiyam et al 2018 however dye concentration higher than a limit exerts toxicity for the cell growth aksu 2001 mishra and malik 2013 3 1 6 effect of incubation time bioaccumulation is an interaction of adsorbate and adsorbent where time is an important factor for determining the rate of the process with increase in contact time more and more dye cations are transferred from solution to the solid cell surface which get attached chemically or physically for every reaction there is a saturation time thus for bioaccumulation of dye also a saturation is reached after all the attachment sites on the biosorbent surface get attached by the dye molecules batch dye removal experiments were carried out with fermentation medium containing 50 mg l 1 malachite green for upto 48 h other conditions remaining same adsorption process was slow initially upto 10 h and proceeded very fast between 10 and 20 h attaining a saturation with further lapse of time malik 2004 ganguly et al 2011 huang et al 2016 asfaram et al 2017 deniz and kepekci 2017 initial lapse of time can be attributed to the growth of organism to have a sufficient biomass in the system a minimum incubation time of 20 h was found to be optimum for removal of malachite green by growing cells of bacillus cereus m1 16 fig 2f 99 of malachite green was found to be removed from its solution by the organism when 50 ml medium volume at ph 6 0 containing 50 mg l 1 of malachite green was inoculated with 2 v v 1 inoculum and incubated at 30 c at 120 rpm for a minimum of 20 h 3 2 continuous removal of malachite green in stirred tank reactor 3 2 1 effect of influent dye concentration after the seed culture has acclimatized and average mlss value reached to the range of 3520 4020 mg l 1 dye solution at different concentrations 10 200 mg l 1 was fed to the activated stirred tank at dilution rate of 0 014 h 1 and average temperature was maintained at 28 30 c each experiment required 14 15 days to reach steady state condition cod removal efficiency and percentage removal of dye were estimated daily which became stable after 13th day and the same efficiency was observed upto 15th day of operation for all dye concentrations maximum 96 removal of malachite green was observed at influent dye concentration of 25 50 mg l 1 fig 3 since this study utilizes the efficiency of growing cells the growth condition of the microorganism plays an important role in dye removal efficiency based on our results from batch experiments discussed in section 3 1 the used organism is known to show optimum sorption of dye at 50 mg l 1 increase in influent dye concentration above 50 mg l 1 was found to have a negative effect on continuous removal of malachite green in str also the reason for such behavior is explained for removal of malachite green in batch process in section 3 1 5 3 2 2 effect of influent flow rate after stabilization of mlss within experimental range dye solution 50 mg l 1 was fed to activated stirred tank reactor at different flow rates 6 9 10 5 and 20 8 ml min 1 varied to achieve dilution rates 0 014 h 1 0 021 h 1 and 0 042 h 1 respectively each experiment at different dilution rate was carried out for 15 days during which the cod and percentage dye removal were estimated daily dye removal was found to be highly dependent on dilution rate fig 4 at the lowest dilution rate studied the removal of malachite green was found 98 96 for the studied duration of 15 days the higher dilution rates lead to lesser removal of dye as shown in fig 4 such behavior may be due to less retention time of dye molecules in the tank at higher dilution rates resulting in less contact between dye ions and microbial cells thus leading to lesser efficiency of dye removal the possible washout of more microbial cells out of the tank along with the effluent at higher flow rates also may be responsible for reduction in dye removal at higher dilution rates bera et al 2012 have also reported in their study that changed ion sorption properties and bio kinetic properties of microorganisms at higher dilution rates are responsible for lesser removal of adsorbate haddad et al 2018 have also reported that higher hydraulic retention time corresponding to lower dilution rates gives more efficiency of dye removal due to the above mentioned reasons 3 2 3 performance summary of activated sludge system in this study percentage removal of cod was found to increase with increase in hydraulic retention time fig 5a a maximum of 79 cod removal and 96 dye removal was possible at 50 mg l 1 influent dye concentration and 0 014 h 1 dilution rate having hydraulic retention time 72 h maximum substrate utilization capacity was found to be 0 219 mg day 1 at 0 014 h 1 dilution rate fig 5b the relationship of f m ratio and cod removal efficiency was also analyzed at 50 mg l 1 influent dye concentration fig 5c table 4 represents the overall summary of the operation of activated sludge system in the present study all the experiments of dye removal were carried out for 15 days only after acclimatization however the optimized activated sludge system may be used and reused for a long time for continuous removal of dye from its solution at the end of operation the sludge was stabilized for reducing the volume and offensive odor through self biological digestion in a covered tank sludge digestion is a biological process in which organic solids are decomposed into stable substances which makes it easier to dewater or dry vis photocatalysis using sunlight is widely used for the treatment of wastewater in developed countries and has been established as highly effective for sludge disintegration by anjum et al 2016 3 3 removal of malachite green from simulated textile effluent by activated sludge system the optimized method of activated sludge system was tested for its efficiency of dye removal in presence of different organic and inorganic matter in the solution along with dye which is the case in real wastewaters thus simulated textile wastewater was formulated according to published literature and fed to the activated sludge system after stabilization of mlss within the optimized experimental range malachite green 50 mg l 1 was the only dye added to the studied simulated textile wastewater that was fed to the activated stirred tank reactor at dilution rate 0 014 h 1 having hydraulic retention time 72 h cod removal efficiency and percentage dye removal were estimated daily upto 15 days which was found stable after 10th day and the same efficiency was observed upto 15th day of operation of activated stirred tank maximum 96 removal of malachite green was observed at influent dye concentration of 50 mg l 1 in this study the optimized activated sludge system showed equivalent removal of malachite green from both dye solution and simulated textile wastewater 4 conclusions in the batch biosorption experiments with growing cells of bacillus cereus m1 16 maximum removal of malachite green 99 was achieved with 50 ml medium volume in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks at ph 6 0 containing 50 mg l 1 of malachite green solution inoculated with 2 v v 1 inoculum and incubated at 30 c and 120 rpm for a minimum of 20 h the parameters standardized for optimum dye removal in batch process provided the benchmark for scaling up of activated sludge system for large scale bioremediation of malachite green for operation of activated sludge system following parameters were found optimum viz 3520 4020 mg l 1 of mlss at the time of treatment 0 014 h 1 of dilution rate which provides 72 h of hydraulic retention time and 50 mg l 1 of influent dye concentration under the optimized conditions 96 of dye removal and 79 cod removal were recorded from the studied synthetic dye solution and also from the simulated textile effluent thus the activated sludge system developed in this study was found efficient in continuous treatment of large scale wastewater containing malachite green along with efficient removal of cod the present study was carried out with only one representative dye in the simulated textile effluent which can be extended to study the removal of multiple dyes also from real wastewaters acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge university grants commission cas program government of india grant no f4 1 2006 bsr 5 46 2007

groundwater quality table 3 provides descriptive statistics for major ions ec and sar data in 2012 based on the mean values the order of major cations is ca2 mg2 na k and the order of major anions is hco3 cl so4 2 no3 the electrical conductivity ec values range between 0 5 and 3 01 m mhos cm and sodium adsorption ratio sar value vary between 0 36 and 4 09 the mentioned correlation values between ions can be used to determine the origin of the ions in groundwater the increase or the decrease in the ions in groundwater is indicative of minerals dissolution electrical conductivity ec mainly depends on the concentration of the major ions such as na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 sodium adsorption ratio sar depends on the concentration of the na ca2 and mg2 3 2 geostatistical analysis in this study three methods of interpolation kriging co kriging and inverse distance weighting for spatial analysis of sar and ec variables were evaluated in order to find the best method of spatial correlation 3 2 1 variogram analysis table 4 represents the suitable variogram parameters to the input data of both ec and sar after studying and analyzing various patterns of the three previous mentioned methods of interpolation kriging co kriging and idw we concluded that the co kriging method has a low rate of rmse which make it the more concrete and correct than the two other methods for that purpose it was picked out as the best qualified method for the obtained results in the studied area taghizadeh et al 2008 the variogram parameters fitted of the best method co kriging are given in table 5 the adjusted model is gaussian for the ec and spherical for the sar nugget effect than the sill c0 c0 c is an indicator of the strength of the spatial variables if this ratio is less than 0 25 which is indicative of strong spatial correlations and if this ratio is between 0 25 0 75 moderate spatial dependence can be represented as the ratio is more than 0 75 would be indicative of a weak spatial dependence cambardella et al 1994 in this study nugget effect than the sill is 0 17 0 24 for ec and sar respectively that shows a strong dependence on the spatial variable the adjusted model of the ec fig 3 is gaussian the equation of the variogram is 7 γ h 0 46 2 77 gaus 0 58 h and its range is 0 58 km the adjusted model of the sar fig 4 is of spherical type the equation of this variogram is 8 γ h 0 28 1 16 sph 1 38 h and its range is 1 38km 3 3 spatial distribution maps of ce and sar the spatial distribution of electrical conductivity ec in the alluvial aquifer of wadi nil fig 5 shows an increase in ec values from south to northward the ec values varies from 0 50 to 3 01 m mhos cm values are higher than 2 50 m mhos cm on the coastal band and reach on the seafront higher values of 3 01 m mhos cm the presence of salted bevel we notice that in some areas the southeast and the southwest area the value of the ec increases with the increasing amounts of sulphate and bicarbonate this increase may be due to the lithological formations composed of marls and gypsum respectively according to the result of spatial distribution the sodium absorption ratio sar values ranges from 0 36 to 4 09 it increases in the downstream part this increase is likely due to the dissolution of the minerals position near to the sea and the presence of the farmland in the area greenhouse gardening activity such as the presence of pesticides and fertilizers the spatial variation of sar is shown in fig 6 3 4 groundwater quality map for irrigation based on a weight of 1 the intersection of this spatial distribution maps ec and sar was used to create the final groundwater quality map by using gis fig 7 illustrates the quality map for irrigation purpose over wadi nil plain in this map the very good the good the mediocre and the unsuitable areas for irrigation have been defined as green yellow cyan and red colours respectively finally this study recommends the areas with very good and good groundwater quality for irrigation according to the obtained results 53 26 of the area of wadi nil plain is very good 31 70 is good 4 74 is mediocre and 10 31 is unsuitable for irrigation 4 conclusion in this study a geostatistical analysis of electrical conductivity ec and sodium adsorption ratio sar of groundwater for irrigation in wadi nil plain north east algeria is undertaken forty 40 groundwater samples were used to estimate the spatial variation of ec and sar parameters the objective was to investigate and map the groundwater quality for irrigation using geostatistics the analysis of the spatial coherence of the variables ec and sar was performed using the kriging the co kriging and the inverse distance weighting idw methods these methods were ultimately used to decipher the spatial distribution of the parameters the obtained results through these methods were compared by rmse and it is found that the co kriging model is the best model to study the spatial variation of groundwater quality parameters by applying and following the co kriging method the evaluation of the ec and sar will be totally logical and acceptable according to the new developed maps of ec and sar the water quality declines toward the north of the studied area thus the downstream land showed the largest percentage of contaminated groundwater anthropogenic contamination fertilizers salinity that is why in these areas using the groundwater for irrigation will cause damages for crops and minimize products the intersection of spatial distribution maps between ec and sar was used to create the groundwater quality map for irrigation this final map shows that 53 26 of the area is very good 31 70 is good 4 74 is mediocre and 10 30 is unsuitable for irrigation north of the study area finally our results can be useful and valuable in making decision progress like determining the appropriate lands for irrigation though forthcoming explorations of the quality of groundwater in the study area needs the amelioration of hydrogeological and hydrochemical control of data acknowledgements the authors are grateful to the authorities of jijel for providing data and permitting to pursue and publish the present work and wish to thank the anonymous reviewers for their suggestions and critical comments

bicarbonate this increase may be due to the lithological formations composed of marls and gypsum respectively according to the result of spatial distribution the sodium absorption ratio sar values ranges from 0 36 to 4 09 it increases in the downstream part this increase is likely due to the dissolution of the minerals position near to the sea and the presence of the farmland in the area greenhouse gardening activity such as the presence of pesticides and fertilizers the spatial variation of sar is shown in fig 6 3 4 groundwater quality map for irrigation based on a weight of 1 the intersection of this spatial distribution maps ec and sar was used to create the final groundwater quality map by using gis fig 7 illustrates the quality map for irrigation purpose over wadi nil plain in this map the very good the good the mediocre and the unsuitable areas for irrigation have been defined as green yellow cyan and red colours respectively finally this study recommends the areas with very good and good groundwater quality for irrigation according to the obtained results 53 26 of the area of wadi nil plain is very good 31 70 is good 4 74 is mediocre and 10 31 is unsuitable for irrigation 4 conclusion in this study a geostatistical analysis of electrical conductivity ec and sodium adsorption ratio sar of groundwater for irrigation in wadi nil plain north east algeria is undertaken forty 40 groundwater samples were used to estimate the spatial variation of ec and sar parameters the objective was to investigate and map the groundwater quality for irrigation using geostatistics the analysis of the spatial coherence of the variables ec and sar was performed using the kriging the co kriging and the inverse distance weighting idw methods these methods were ultimately used to decipher the spatial distribution of the parameters the obtained results through these methods were compared by rmse and it is found that the co kriging model is the best model to study the spatial variation of groundwater quality parameters by applying and following the co kriging method the evaluation of the ec and sar will be totally logical and acceptable according to the new developed maps of ec and sar the water quality declines toward the north of the studied area thus the downstream land showed the largest percentage of contaminated groundwater anthropogenic contamination fertilizers salinity that is why in these areas using the groundwater for irrigation will cause damages for crops and minimize products the intersection of spatial distribution maps between ec and sar was used to create the groundwater quality map for irrigation this final map shows that 53 26 of the area is very good 31 70 is good 4 74 is mediocre and 10 30 is unsuitable for irrigation north of the study area finally our results can be useful and valuable in making decision progress like determining the appropriate lands for irrigation though forthcoming explorations of the quality of groundwater in the study area needs the amelioration of hydrogeological and hydrochemical control of data acknowledgements the authors are grateful to the authorities of jijel for
