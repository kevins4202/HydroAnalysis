reduction mechanism the primary chemical sludge and saobr sludge were characterized using sem edx ft ir xrd tga and dsc analyses keywords bioreactor post tanning wastewater primary treatment sludge minimization microbial diversity 1 introduction leather manufacturing process includes soaking liming deliming tanning post tanning and finishing operations the generated wastewater from post tanning operations is regarded as complicated wastewater due to the presence of high total dissolved solids tds synthetic organic compounds ammonium compounds organic nitrogen and suspended solids besides specific pollutants such as chromium ions cr3 dyestuff residues fat liquoring agents and syntans 1 3 the tanning sector in india employs a relatively an in appropriate wastewater management practice the conventional technology followed for the treatment of tannery effluent consists of primary treatment to remove suspended and colloidal solids and secondary biological treatment removes dissolved organics and tertiary treatment eliminates total dissolved solids the primary treatment of tannery effluent aims at the removal of suspended solids by coagulation and flocculation 1 4 8 the coagulation flocculation followed by biological treatment secondary treatment has been practiced for the removal of suspended solids colloidal solids chemical oxygen demand cod and color of the wastewater 9 10 aluminium sulphate aluminium chloride calcium carbonate calcium chloride ferric chloride and ferrous sulphate are widely used as coagulants and flocculants for the removal of suspended and colloidal solids from tannery wastewater 1 4 6 8 11 the residual concentrations of al3 and fe3 in the primary treated tannery wastewater affect the oxygen transfer efficiency and there by the performance of biological treatment process is impaired there were evidences for the presence of heavy metal ions in the biological treated tannery wastewater the heavy metal ions affect the membrane separation process for instance the scale formation in ultrafiltration reverse osmosis membranes in post biological treatment processes 12 the application of chemical flocculants and coagulants generate huge quantity of sludge besides substantial increase in the cost of treatment process the disposal of the primary chemical sludge pcs generated from conventional treatment process becomes a confronting environmental challenges to the industries researchers developed the concept of processing metabolic uncouplers to reduce the sludge production in wastewater treatment process 13 16 metabolic uncouplers widen the energy difference of anabolism from catabolism so that a considerable decrease in microbial cell growth rate was envisaged while maintaining the substrate utilization rate without cell lysis the use of metabolic uncouplers in wastewater treatment process resulted in poor treatment efficiency 16 17 the bio solids reduction by the oxic settling anoxic osa process showed a potential impact 18 the osa system reduced sludge production by temporarily holding the activated sludge in external anoxic reactor before recirculating it to the main reactor the high sludge reduction values have not been realized in the full scale reactor 19 20 the global standards for wastewater management are made stringent on disposal of pcs for landfill application 21 22 this demands an efficient treatment technology with minimum foot print area requirement less electric energy consumption and minimum sludge generation thus it is necessary to develop more cost effective compact process for the removal of organics with low sludge generation development of efficient technology for the removal of different organics from wastewater with minimum sludge production is the hour of need there has been a constant research on cleaner economically as well as environmentally sustainable treatment technologies for tannery wastewater due to its complex nature 7 23 24 hence the present

wastewater the sludge collected from saobr was characterized by volatile solids 0 6106 g g 1 and fixed solids 0 3893 g g 1 of dry sludge indicating the sludge belongs to more of organic biological origin as in high rate anaerobic reactors 3 9 instrumental characterization of pcs and saobr sludge the sem edx images of the pcs and saobr sludge was shown in fig 8 the sem image of pcs fig 8a and b shows the uneven surface due to deposition of inorganic metal oxides the edx spectrum of pcs with elemental composition right inserts is shown in fig 8c the pcs shows al 5 46 and ca 3 20 is due to the addition of alum lime and poly electrolyte in primary treatment coagulation and flocculation of ptww the appearance of alkali alkaline earth metals such as na mg k si sand cr in pcs was due to use of sodium compounds and tanning chemicals such as sulphonated phenolic compounds and basic chromium sulphate in post tanning operations the sem micrograph of saobr sludge clearly depicts the extended microbial growth in saobr fig 8d and e and it confirms the sludge minimization in saobr was through biological reaction fig 8f shows the edx analysis of saobr sludge and it shows more amount of elemental carbon due to the presence of organic compounds and oxygen is the other dominant element in sludge the saobr showed the removal of cr 5 20 ca 2 28 si 2 71 and s 1 81 in the edx spectrum the metal ions from the ptww were trapped by the exopolysaccharides produced by the microorganism in saobr and aggregated along with the suspended and colloidal solids saobr may be considered for the removal of suspended and colloidal solids along with metal ions without addition of coagulants and flocculants the ftir spectra of pcs and saobr sludge are shown in fig 9 a the strong oh stretching frequency peak appeared at 3411 cm 1 in pcs was due to the moisture content and metal hydroxide used in the coagulation flocculation process calcium hydroxide the oh stretching peak at 3409 cm 1 in saobr sludge was due to the bound water molecules the less intense bands at 2925 cm 1 and 2854 cm 1 are attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching frequencies of methylene group present in the pcs medium stretching vibration peak at the same frequency for saobr sludge indicates the sludge contained trace concentration of aromatic compounds compared to the pcs in primary treatment process the addition of coagulants flocculants such as alum lime and poly electrolyte generate the charged particles and attached to the aromatic compounds in suspended colloidal solids to form pcs and thus pcs showed aromatic stretching skeletal peak at 1448 cm 1 42 the stretching peak at 1627 cm 1 in pcs is due to the presence of cc stretching of aromatic compounds the most characteristic vibration peak at 1098 cm 1 and 1036 cm 1 are due to the out of plane bending vibration of ch stretching in the organic compounds syntan 10 43 the characteristic ch bending vibrational peak at 1448 cm 1 in pcs may be attributed to aromatic compounds whereas in saobr sludge the decrease in intensity of peak at 1448 cm 1 may be due to degradation of aromatic compounds into aliphatic compounds the presence of aromatic compounds in pcs was further confirmed by c h in plane bending vibrational peak at 874 cm 1 this is the most characteristic peak of poly nuclear aromatic substituted compounds like naphthalene syntans the absence of peak at 874 cm 1 in saobr sludge further confirms the degradation of aromatic compounds into aliphatic compounds the metal oxides generally appear in the range of 600 400 cm 1 44 the intense peak at 541 cm 1 was may be due to presence of al ca na mg k si and cr oxides in pcs the vibrational peak at 541 cm 1 in saobr sludge was due to presence of ca si and cr oxides the presence of metal oxides in pcs and saobr sludge was confirmed and presented in edx analysis fig 9b shows the xrd spectra of the pcs and saobr sludge the xrd spectrum of pcs shows the metal oxide peaks at 2θ value 29 32 47 may be due to the presence of 100 101 102 planes in cao the cao binds with carbonate present in wastewater and from calcite it emits the spectrum with 2θ value at 29 36 48 57 and 62 and related planes are 104 110 116 104 1010 and 215 the peaks at 2θ value and the corresponding lattice planes were 39 101 43 113 57 116 60 211 they may be correlated to lattice planes in crystalline al oh 3 due to the addition of alum in primary treatment process the xrd spectrum of saobr sludge showed the absence of metal oxide peaks fig 9c shows the thermogravimetric analysis tga profiles for saobr sludge and pcs samples at heating rate 5 c min the thermal conversion of sludge under nitrogen atmosphere was associated with weight loss the higher rates of thermal decomposition were in the saobr compared to pcs there are three stages of pyrolysis occurred in saobr sludge and in pcs as shown in the thermogram fig 9c the first stage resulted with weight loss by 5 at 50 c may be attributed to the elimination of free water molecules and devolarisation of low molecular weight organic compounds present in the saobr and similar profile was observed in pcs the second stage is the main pyrolysis process occurred in the temperature range 200 580 c this is mainly attributed to the thermal decomposition of the protein ammonium compounds sulphonated organic compounds and poly syntan that typically decompose below 600 c in the saobr sludge the second stage of thermal decomposition in pcs showed a steady decrease in weight loss as a function of temperature the thermal decomposition in the temperature range 350 700 c is due to the non condensable gases like h2 h2o co2 and ch4 from pcs the final decomposition is not accompanied with significant weight loss observed at temperature above 650 c the residue left at 800 c for pcs was 39 and the same for saobr sludge was 31 this suggests that saobr sludge contained mostly volatile solids may be attributed to moisture with lower proportion of inorganic matrix while pcs contained higher proportion of inorganic matrix like metal oxide compared to saobr sludge fig 9d shows the differential scanning thermogram of the saobr sludge and pcs samples at heating rate 5 c min the endothermic peak observed in dsc spectrum of saobr sludge at 114 c and of pcs at 78 c the intensity of endothermic peak in dsc thermogram of pcs increased relatively more than in saobr sludge the increase in heat capacity of pcs indicates the aromaticity and complexity of the sludge 3 10 economics of the process the primary coagulation flocculation process for the treatment of ptww requires lime 500 g m3 alum 400 g m3and poly electrolyte 1 0 g m3 the cost of lime 0 17 usd kg alum 0 11 usd kg and poly electrolyte 3 50 usd kg for the removal of suspended and colloidal solids from ptww was found to be 0 14 usd m3 along with that the system requires the separate unit operation to clarify the primary chemical sludge the system also requires high foot print area high maintenance cost high electrical energy and high operational cost electrical energy chemical conservation and man power requirement and therefore the total cost for the primary coagulation flocculation was expected to be 0 36 usd m3 the total time required for the removal of suspended and colloidal solids from ptww in saobr process is only 9 h saobr technology does not require any chemicals as added during coagulation flocculation and thus cost maintenance in saobr technology is nil besides it has the advantages such as very low foot print requirement and less electro mechanical equipment low sludge production the technology produces only 5 10 of the tss applied load and thus sludge disposal cost is very less less electrical energy consumption the technology requires few electro mechanical equipments less operational cost considering the saving on electrical energy chemical conservation limited man power requirement in saobr system the operation cost for the treatment of unit volume of ptww is expected to be only 0 1 usd m3 4 conclusions the saobr was designed and operated under continuous mode of operation for the removal of suspended and colloidal solids from ptww without addition of coagulants flocculants the codtot coddis codsus and codcoll were removed by 35 7 1 9 20 2 3 5 84 4 5 and 82 4 4 7 respectively the ts tds and tss were removed from wastewater by 10 9 2 4 1 4 1 1 and 78 8 3 6 respectively under continuous mode of operation at hrt of 9 h the sludge generated in conventional primary chemical treatment of ptww was 5 27 0 15 kg m3 of wastewater using optimized dosage of lime 500 mg l 1 alum 400 mg l 1 and poly electrolyte 1 0 mg l 1 with cod removal of 40 9 1 4 and tss removal of 68 8 the pcs showed the presence of metals such as al ca na mg k si s and cr the sludge generation in saobr during the treatment of ptww was 0 293 0 11 kg m3 of wastewater this concludes that tss in ptww was digested by 68 9 in saobr through microbial digestion and it was confirmed by microbial community analysis thus the saobr system may be considered as a unit operation for the removal of suspended and colloidal solids

14070,the conventional primary treatment use coagulants flocculants to remove suspended and colloidal solids from post tanning wastewater ptww and it results in generation of huge quantity of primary chemical sludge the present investigation was focused on the removal of suspended and colloidal solids from ptww without addition of coagulants flocculants using sequential anoxic oxic bioreactor saobr the saobr was operated under continuous mode to investigate the removal of codtot coddis codsus codcoll ts tds tss by 35 7 1 9 20 2 3 5 84 4 5 82 4 4 7 10 9 2 4 1 4 1 1 and 78 8 3 6 at the

reduction mechanism the primary chemical sludge and saobr sludge were characterized using sem edx ft ir xrd tga and dsc analyses keywords bioreactor post tanning wastewater primary treatment sludge minimization microbial diversity 1 introduction leather manufacturing process includes soaking liming deliming tanning post tanning and finishing operations the generated wastewater from post tanning operations is regarded as complicated wastewater due to the presence of high total dissolved solids tds synthetic organic compounds ammonium compounds organic nitrogen and suspended solids besides specific pollutants such as chromium ions cr3 dyestuff residues fat liquoring agents and syntans 1 3 the tanning sector in india employs a relatively an in appropriate wastewater management practice the conventional technology followed for the treatment of tannery effluent consists of primary treatment to remove suspended and colloidal solids and secondary biological treatment removes dissolved organics and tertiary treatment eliminates total dissolved solids the primary treatment of tannery effluent aims at the removal of suspended solids by coagulation and flocculation 1 4 8 the coagulation flocculation followed by biological treatment secondary treatment has been practiced for the removal of suspended solids colloidal solids chemical oxygen demand cod and color of the wastewater 9 10 aluminium sulphate aluminium chloride calcium carbonate calcium chloride ferric chloride and ferrous sulphate are widely used as coagulants and flocculants for the removal of suspended and colloidal solids from tannery wastewater 1 4 6 8 11 the residual concentrations of al3 and fe3 in the primary treated tannery wastewater affect the oxygen transfer efficiency and there by the performance of biological treatment process is impaired there were evidences for the presence of heavy metal ions in the biological treated tannery wastewater the heavy metal ions affect the membrane separation process for instance the scale formation in ultrafiltration reverse osmosis membranes in post biological treatment processes 12 the application of chemical flocculants and coagulants generate huge quantity of sludge besides substantial increase in the cost of treatment process the disposal of the primary chemical sludge pcs generated from conventional treatment process becomes a confronting environmental challenges to the industries researchers developed the concept of processing metabolic uncouplers to reduce the sludge production in wastewater treatment process 13 16 metabolic uncouplers widen the energy difference of anabolism from catabolism so that a considerable decrease in microbial cell growth rate was envisaged while maintaining the substrate utilization rate without cell lysis the use of metabolic uncouplers in wastewater treatment process resulted in poor treatment efficiency 16 17 the bio solids reduction by the oxic settling anoxic osa process showed a potential impact 18 the osa system reduced sludge production by temporarily holding the activated sludge in external anoxic reactor before recirculating it to the main reactor the high sludge reduction values have not been realized in the full scale reactor 19 20 the global standards for wastewater management are made stringent on disposal of pcs for landfill application 21 22 this demands an efficient treatment technology with minimum foot print area requirement less electric energy consumption and minimum sludge generation thus it is necessary to develop more cost effective compact process for the removal of organics with low sludge generation development of efficient technology for the removal of different organics from wastewater with minimum sludge production is the hour of need there has been a constant research on cleaner economically as well as environmentally sustainable treatment technologies for tannery wastewater due to its complex nature 7 23 24 hence the present

centrifuged cod codcent the wastewater was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant were analyzed for centrifuged cod 2 2 chemical coagulation and flocculation the optimum concentration of coagulants and flocculants required for the removal of cod and suspended solids from post tanning wastewater was determined through extensive jar test studies the wastewater was treated under batch mode using coagulants and flocculants with dosages in the range of calcium hydroxide lime 200 700 mg l 1 aluminium sulphate alum 100 600 mg l 1 and poly electrolyte 0 4 1 4 mg l 1 in one litter glass jar the wastewater was thoroughly mixed to avoid settling of solids at 100 rpm and coagulant flocculent was added and followed by flash mixing at 120 rpm for 1 min and slow mixing at 40 rpm for 30 min and finally the flocs were allowed to settle for 120 min the supernatant resulted after settling for 120 min was characterized for codtot coddis codsus codcoll and suspended solids 2 3 reactor design and operation the lab scale saobr with working volume of 5 4 l 25 cm l 7 cm b 35 cm h was designed and fabricated using acrylic sheets and the schematic representation of

with the organic and inorganic compounds in the ptww the treatment efficiency of saobr for the removal of suspended solids and dissolved organics from ptww at different hrts was evaluated after acclimatization period of 15 days startup period 2 5 microbial community analysis the performance of saobr for the removal of suspended solids and sludge reduction the quantitative analysis of change in overall microbial community structures in saobr was studied at startup after 15 days and after continuous operation at the end of experiment the dna extraction from the sludge samples were carried out using ultra clean soil dna isolation kit mol bio the 16 s rrna genes were amplified in pcr using forward primer 27 f 5 agagtttgatcmtggctcag 3 and the reverse primer 1492r 5 tacggytaccttgttacgactt 3 the pcr reaction was performed by adding 5 μl of isolated dna in 25 μl of pcr reaction solution forward primer and reverse primer1 5 μl and deionized water 5 μl and taq master mix12 μl the pcr was

the initial characteristics of ptww collected from a common effluent treatment plant are presented in table 1 the ptww contained codtot 3555 179 mg l 1 coddis 2722 132 mg l 1 codsus 850 92 mg l 1 codcoll 385 48 mg l 1 bod 967 89 mg l 1 toc 655 33 mg l 1 ts 9479 541 mg l 1 tds 8329 498 mg l 1and tss 1149 297 mg l 1 the composition of wastewater fluctuated within a wide range and the values are reported in terms of mean standard deviation and number of samples analyzed in order to depict the wide fluctuation of the wastewater characteristics the wastewater characteristics of post tanning operations is attributed to the volume of water usage raw material characteristics and quantity of chemicals used in leather processing 3 1 effect of dosage of coagulant and flocculant on cod removal from ptww the effect of calcium hydroxide lime dosage as the coagulant on the removal of codtot coddis codsus and codcoll from the ptww was recorded and the results are presented in fig 2 a d the results reveal that the codtot coddis codsus and codcoll removal were 23 1 6 6 7 0 8 59 2 4 and 61 3 with lime at a dosage of 500 mg l 1 and there was no substantial increase in cod removal for further increase in lime dosage up to 700 mg l 1 the optimization of aluminum sulphate alum dosage as coagulant on the removal of codtot coddis codsus and codcoll was carried out at the optimized dosage of lime and the results are presented in fig 2e h the codtot coddis codsus and codcoll removal were found to be 33 4 1 1 8 0 4 67 2 4 and 71 2 38 at the optimum dosage of alum 400 mg l 1 thereafter there was no substantial increase in cod removal for further increase in alum dosage up to 600 mg l 1 this corroborates with the observations recorded by haydar and aziz 5 on the treatment of tannery wastewater through coagulant flocculation the results suggest that the primary clarification of ptww substantially removes suspended and colloidal solids and thereby it contributes to the removal of cod the codtot coddis codsus and codcoll removal was gradually increased with increase in poly electrolyte dosage up to 1 0 mg l 1 and thereafter it attained the saturation fig 2i l shows that the codtot coddis codsus and codcoll was removed by 42 1 9 5 0 6 72 2 and 79 2 and tss removal was 68 8 at the optimized dosages of alum 400 mg l 1 lime 500 mg l 1 and poly electrolyte 1 0 mg l 1 the primary treatment coagulation and flocculation of ptww was recorded the sludge generation was 123 5 ml l 1 5 17 0 21 g l 1 of wastewater and the ph orp were 7 04 0 14 and 249 32 mv the results corroborate with the research findings of song et al 4 lofrano et al 26 haydar and aziz 11 3 2 performance of saobr the saobr was designed and operated as primary treatment process to replace the

to 726 102 mg l 1 626 101 mg l 1 476 86 mg l 1 366 91 mg l 1 270 86 mg l 1 and 178 78 mg l 1 with removal efficiency of 15 2 27 5 44 6 57 8 69 8 and 80 7 in sequential anoxic anoxic zones respectively the codcoll of treated ptww were from 392 35 mg l 1 to 332 30 mg l 1 277 33 mg l 1 218 24 mg l 1 171 29 mg l 1 118 23 mg l 1 and 75 20 with removal efficiency of 15 2 29 3 44 3 56 5 70 4 and 80 4 in sequential anoxic oxic zones respectively fig 5d 3 6 characterization of treated ptww under continuous operation the characteristics of treated ptww collected from saobr under continuous mode of operation at 9 h hrt are shown in table 3 the treated ptww shows the codtot coddis codsus and codcoll was in the range of 2287 99 mg l 1 2099 96 mg l 1 129 35 mg l 1 and 58 18 mg l 1 the ts tds and tss of treated ptww were 8396 523 mg l 1 8176 522 mg l 1 and 220 46 mg l 1 the ph orp were 7 07 0 28 and 349 21 mv respectively when the saobr operated at different hrt the optimum hrt of 9 h showed the codtot coddis codsus codcoll was in the range of 2296 67 mg l 1 2155 72 mg l 1 140 44 mg l 1 and 68 18 mg l 1 the ts tds tss were 8452 533 mg l 1 8210 541 mg l 1 and 241 50 mg l 1 the slightly variation in the values of continuous operation and effect of hrt study at 9 h was due to the no of samples analyzed the higher negative value of orp suggests the organic compounds are in the reduced form the reduced form of organic compounds in wastewater is more amendable for further treatment in anaerobic reactors the change in ph orp values in saobr treated water compared to coagulation and flocculation suggests that the saobr treated effluent is more suitable for further treatment in anaerobic reactor the rise in tds concentration was observed to be 9022 438 mg l 1 after coagulation and flocculation with the addition of lime and alum the initial ptww contains sulphate 3943 385 mg l 1 and after the addition of alum the sulphate content was increased to 4218 216 mg l 1 and it also makes the non amenability to biological processes 3 7 change in microbial community structures in saobr in order to investigate the microbial diversity responsible for the minimization of sludge in saobr it was profiled during the reactor start up and after continuous operation the relative bacterial community abundance in saobr at reactor start up and after continuous operation on the phylum

comparison of dominant phyla down to the species level was conducted to reveal the more information about the microbial diversity in species level and it is shown in fig 7 the bacterial species noted under dominant phylum proteobacteria was propinivibrio sp with relative abundance of 6 4 denitratisoma sp with relative abundance of 3 3 dechloromonas aromatic with relative abundance of 2 7 and

with relative abundance of 0 8 desulfomicrobium sp with relative abundance of 0 4 and sulphur oxidizing bacteria thiofaba tepidiphila with relative abundance of 0 5 acidithiobacillus caldus with relative abundance of 0 4 were found in the microbial community it is due to the presence of high sulphate 3943 385 mg l 1 in the ptww and it utilizes acetate as the source for electron donor and sulphate as the terminal electron acceptor along with that the bacterium acidaminobacter hydrogenoformans with relative abundance of 0 4 and fusibacter fontis with relative abundance of 0 8 in the phylum firmicutes are reported to utilize sulphate as a electron acceptor the phylum synergistetes with relative abundance of 11 17 was the secondly dominant in the bacterial community and it contains

thiosulfate reducing and filamentous bacterium caldisericum exile with relative abundance of 2 37 in the phylum caldiserica helps to avoid the washout of microbial biomass in the reactor by forming microbial floc 40 amongst the studied phylum the taxonomically distinct genera within the proteobacteria subclass were shown to have an important fraction of active bacteria in the minimization of sludge in the saobr and the phylum proteobacteria has also been identified as the important one in the treatment of pharmaceutical petroleum refinery and coking wastewater 36 3 8 sludge reduction efficiency its characterization the pcs generated through the addition of coagulants and flocculants was found to be 5 27 0 15 kg m3of ptww and it was characterized by volatile solids 0 509 g g 1 and fixed solids 0 491 g g 1 of dry sludge the total suspended solids of ptww before and after treatment through saobr were found to be 1167 297 mg l 1 and 241 50 mg l 1 respectively and thus the tss removed through saobr was 925 261 mg l 1 the sludge dry collected from saobr was found to be 0 293 0 11 kg m3 of ptww against the anticipated mass of sludge generation should have been 0 925 0 261 kg m3 of ptww calculation showed in supplementary file this clearly illustrates that 68 9 of tss was digested in saobr through microorganisms the saobr produces only 5 10 of the applied tss load as sludge mahesh et al 29 reported that the sludge digestion was 94 9 using saobr process in the treatment of domestic sewage at hrt of 3 h the yobs values of saobr were 0 188 g ss g cod which were approached to greatly lower value then previous reports 16 22 41 guo et al 17 reported the sludge reduction about 22 5 and decrease in sludge yield about 14 7 using tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium sulfate thps as environmentally friendly metabolic uncoupler xiao et al 16 reported that the sludge digestion of 30 8 31 7 in laboratory scale anaerobic anoxic oxic process using thps metabolic uncoupler and it decreased the sludge yield about 16 1 16 5 thus the saobr technology may be regarded as the efficient primary treatment unit to replace the primary chemical treatment in post tanning wastewater the sludge collected from saobr was characterized by volatile solids 0 6106 g g 1 and fixed solids 0 3893 g g 1 of dry sludge indicating the sludge belongs to more of organic biological origin as in high rate anaerobic reactors 3 9 instrumental characterization of pcs and saobr sludge the sem edx images of the pcs and saobr sludge was shown in fig 8 the sem image of pcs fig 8a and b shows the uneven surface due to deposition of inorganic metal oxides the edx spectrum of pcs with elemental composition right inserts is shown in fig 8c the pcs shows al 5 46 and ca 3 20 is due to the addition of alum lime and poly electrolyte in primary treatment coagulation and flocculation of ptww the appearance of alkali alkaline earth metals such as na mg k si sand cr in pcs was due to use of sodium compounds and tanning chemicals such as sulphonated phenolic compounds and basic chromium sulphate in post tanning operations the sem micrograph of saobr sludge clearly depicts the extended microbial growth in saobr fig 8d and e and it confirms the sludge minimization in saobr was through biological reaction fig 8f shows the edx analysis of saobr sludge and it shows more amount of elemental carbon due to the presence of organic compounds and oxygen is the other dominant element in sludge the saobr showed the removal of cr 5 20 ca 2 28 si 2 71 and s 1 81 in the edx spectrum the metal ions from the ptww were trapped by the exopolysaccharides produced by the microorganism in saobr and aggregated along with the suspended and colloidal solids saobr may be considered for the removal of suspended and colloidal solids along with metal ions without addition of coagulants and flocculants the ftir spectra of pcs and saobr sludge are shown in fig 9 a the strong oh stretching frequency peak appeared at 3411 cm 1 in pcs was due to the moisture content and metal hydroxide used in the coagulation flocculation process calcium hydroxide the oh stretching peak at 3409 cm 1 in saobr sludge was due to the bound water molecules the less intense bands at 2925 cm 1 and 2854 cm 1 are attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching frequencies of methylene group present in the pcs medium stretching vibration peak at the same frequency for saobr sludge indicates the sludge contained trace concentration of aromatic compounds compared to the pcs in primary treatment process the addition of coagulants flocculants such as alum lime and poly electrolyte generate the charged particles and attached to the aromatic compounds in suspended colloidal solids to form pcs and thus pcs showed aromatic stretching skeletal peak at 1448 cm 1 42 the stretching peak at 1627 cm 1 in pcs is due to the presence of cc stretching of aromatic compounds the most characteristic vibration peak at 1098 cm 1 and 1036 cm 1 are due to the out of plane bending vibration of ch stretching in the organic compounds syntan 10 43 the characteristic ch bending vibrational peak at 1448 cm 1 in pcs may be attributed to aromatic compounds whereas in saobr sludge the decrease in intensity of peak at 1448 cm 1 may be due to degradation of aromatic compounds into aliphatic compounds the presence of aromatic compounds in pcs was further confirmed by c h in plane bending vibrational peak at 874 cm 1 this is the most characteristic peak of poly nuclear aromatic substituted compounds like naphthalene syntans the absence of peak at 874 cm 1 in saobr sludge further confirms the degradation of aromatic compounds into aliphatic compounds the metal oxides generally appear in the range of 600 400 cm 1 44 the intense peak at 541 cm 1 was may be due to presence of al ca na mg k si and cr oxides in pcs the vibrational peak at 541 cm 1 in saobr sludge was due to presence of ca si and cr oxides the presence of metal oxides in pcs and saobr sludge was confirmed and presented in edx analysis fig 9b shows the xrd spectra of the pcs and saobr sludge the xrd spectrum of pcs shows the metal oxide peaks at 2θ value 29 32 47 may be due to the presence of 100 101 102 planes in cao the cao binds with carbonate present in wastewater and from calcite it emits the spectrum with 2θ value at 29 36 48 57 and 62 and related planes are 104 110 116 104 1010 and 215 the peaks at 2θ value and the corresponding lattice planes were 39 101 43 113 57 116 60 211 they may be correlated to lattice planes in crystalline al oh 3 due to the addition of alum in primary treatment process the xrd spectrum of saobr sludge showed the absence of metal oxide peaks fig 9c shows the thermogravimetric analysis tga profiles for saobr sludge and pcs samples at heating rate 5 c min the thermal conversion of sludge under nitrogen atmosphere was associated with weight loss the higher rates of thermal decomposition were in the saobr compared to pcs there are three stages of pyrolysis occurred in saobr sludge and in pcs as shown in the thermogram fig 9c the first stage resulted with weight loss by 5 at 50 c may be attributed to the elimination of free water molecules and devolarisation of low molecular weight organic compounds present in the saobr and similar profile was observed in pcs the second stage is the main pyrolysis process occurred in the temperature range 200 580 c this is mainly attributed to the thermal decomposition of the protein ammonium compounds sulphonated organic compounds and poly syntan that typically decompose below 600 c in the saobr sludge the second stage of thermal decomposition in pcs showed a steady decrease in weight loss as a function of temperature the thermal decomposition in the temperature range 350 700 c is due to the non condensable gases like h2 h2o co2 and ch4 from pcs the final decomposition is not accompanied with significant weight loss observed at temperature above 650 c the residue left at 800 c for pcs was 39 and the same for saobr sludge was 31 this suggests that saobr sludge contained mostly volatile solids may be attributed to moisture with lower proportion of inorganic matrix while pcs contained higher proportion of inorganic matrix like metal oxide compared to saobr sludge fig 9d shows the differential scanning thermogram of the saobr sludge and pcs samples at heating rate 5 c min the endothermic peak observed in dsc spectrum of saobr sludge at 114 c and of pcs at 78 c the intensity of endothermic peak in dsc thermogram of pcs increased relatively more than in saobr sludge the increase in heat capacity of pcs indicates the aromaticity and complexity of the sludge 3 10 economics of the process the primary coagulation flocculation process for the treatment of ptww requires lime 500 g m3 alum 400 g m3and poly electrolyte 1 0 g m3 the cost of lime 0 17 usd kg alum 0 11 usd kg and poly electrolyte 3 50 usd kg for the removal of suspended and colloidal solids from ptww was found to be 0 14 usd m3 along with that the system requires the separate unit operation to clarify the primary chemical sludge the system also requires high foot print area high maintenance cost high electrical energy and high operational cost electrical energy chemical conservation and man power requirement and therefore the total cost for the primary coagulation flocculation was expected to be 0 36 usd m3 the total time required for the removal of suspended and colloidal solids from ptww in saobr process is only 9 h saobr technology does not require any chemicals as added during coagulation flocculation and thus cost maintenance in saobr technology is nil besides it has the advantages such as very low foot print requirement and less electro mechanical equipment low sludge production the technology produces only 5 10 of the tss applied load and thus sludge disposal cost is very less less electrical energy consumption the technology requires few electro mechanical equipments less operational cost considering the saving on electrical energy chemical conservation limited man power requirement in saobr system the operation cost for the treatment of unit volume of ptww is expected to be only 0 1 usd m3 4 conclusions the saobr was designed and operated under continuous mode of operation for the removal of suspended and colloidal solids from ptww without addition of coagulants flocculants the codtot coddis codsus and codcoll were removed by 35 7 1 9 20 2 3 5 84 4 5 and 82 4 4 7 respectively the ts tds and tss were removed from wastewater by 10 9 2 4 1 4 1 1 and 78 8 3 6 respectively under continuous mode of operation at hrt of 9 h the sludge generated in conventional primary chemical treatment of ptww was 5 27 0 15 kg m3 of wastewater using optimized dosage of lime 500 mg l 1 alum 400 mg l 1 and poly electrolyte 1 0 mg l 1 with cod removal of 40 9 1 4 and tss removal of 68 8 the pcs showed the presence of metals such as al ca na mg k si s and cr the sludge generation in saobr during the treatment of ptww was 0 293 0 11 kg m3 of wastewater this concludes that tss in ptww was digested by 68 9 in saobr through microbial digestion and it was confirmed by microbial community analysis thus the saobr system may be considered as a unit operation for the removal of suspended and colloidal solids in wastewater with minimum sludge production and without addition of coagulants and flocculants declaration of competing interest the author declare that they have no conflict of interest

14071,the in situ production of highly oxidizing species represents a sustainable approach for the treatment of unregulated emerging contaminants in this article we investigate the uv induced degradation and mineralization of paracetamol that represents one of the most frequently prescribed and sold drugs worldwide in particular this work compares two advanced oxidation processes based on photolysis of electrogenerated hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ozone o3 the h2o2 electrosynthesis has been performed via oxygen reduction on gas diffusion electrodes gde to maximize the efficiency of the treatments the effect of the main operative parameters such as reagent concentration ph current density and uv irradiance has been discussed the results show that due to the synergistic effect paracetamol undergoes rapid degradation and extensive mineralization the comparison of the cost effectiveness of the treatments in terms of energy consumption is also provided keywords ozone electrogenerated hydrogen peroxide uv light paracetamol gas diffusion cathode 1 introduction recently growing attention has been paid to the identification and monitoring of a wide class of compounds collectively referred as to emerging contaminants these chemicals can range from pharmaceuticals to newly registered pesticides from industrial plastic additives to personal care products major features are a rare or new occurrence recent identification lack of existing regulation and potential adverse effects on humans and the environment 1 it has been shown that emerging contaminants are recalcitrant to biological and physical chemical processes that are typically applied in sewage treatment plants 2 3 therefore these pollutants remain in the treated wastewater and are discharged into the receiving water basins 4 a particular concern arises since they are also characterized by bioaccumulation with deleterious effects on the endocrine system and possible mutagenic effect 1 to meet the environmental and sanitary requirements advanced options are necessary for the treatment of these effluents 5 among the drugs paracetamol pa also known as acetaminophen commonly used as a pain reliever and fever reducer for both adults and children formulations is one of the best selling over the counter products worldwide extensive metabolism of paracetamol occurs in the liver and only 2 5 of the unmodified product is excreted through the kidneys 6 despite its high metabolism rate due to its high prescription frequency in 2000 it was among the three most prescribed drugs in england and among the 200 most prescribed drugs in the usa and the fact that it is easily accessible even without a medical prescription a considerable concentration is frequently detected in wastewater 7 a wide range of methods have been so far tested for its treatment including adsorption 8 ozonation 9 10 hydrogen peroxide based oxidation 9 11 photocatalysis 12 13 sonolysis 14 electrochemical oxidation on stainless steel 15 graphite 16 and on bdd electrode 17 and electro fenton process 18 19 the results achieved so far indicate that a good degradation efficiency of the paracetamol can be achieved but uncomplete mineralization occurs probably due to the formation of persistent by products to obtain extensive removal the development of enhanced treatments is thus required it is widely accepted that the most powerful treatments currently available are those defined as advanced oxidation processes aops based on the fast and non selective action of highly oxidizing species such as the hydroxyl radical ho hydroperoxyl radical ho2 and superoxide radical o2 aops have been successfully tested for the treatment of a wide range of waters and wastewaters 20 the most common aops involve the decomposition of radical precursors mainly peroxides in combination with catalysts and or other activating agents such as uv radiation and ultrasound uv driven aops exhibit the potential for effective versatile and scalable removal of a variety of pollutants 21 23 although some papers prompt caution due to the likely formation of toxic by products 24 and to the high associated cost 25 the electrogeneration of hydrogen peroxide by cathodic reduction of dissolved molecular oxygen can be obtained on a variety of carbon based electrodes 26 due to their overpotential for hydrogen evolution however the best efficient electrosynthesis is provided by gas diffusion electrode gde 27 since these cathodes overcome the difficulty coming from the low solubility and the mass transport limitation of dissolved oxygen moreover the in situ production allows the achievement of significant advantages from an economic environmental and safety point of view in previous work we verified the interest in developing a combined system with electrogenerated hydrogen peroxide for the removal of paracetamol 28 the present article investigates the efficiency in degrading the paracetamol of two different systems based on the production of radicals through photodecomposition of in situ electrogenerated hydrogen peroxide and ozone to maximize the treatment efficiency we investigated and discussed the effect of the main process parameters such as reagent concentration ph current density and light intensity a comparative cost evaluation of the discussed treatments is reported 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials reagents all provided by sigma aldrich usa were of analytical grade and used as received unless differently specified sample solutions were prepared by dissolving in double deionized water milli q system millipore 50 mg l of pa c8h9no2 mw 151 17 g mol and 0 05 m na2so4 as the supporting electrolyte the initial toc value was around 30 2 mg l and the initial ph was 7 1 0 1 2 2 experiments photo degradation tests were performed in a cylindrical quartz reactor by using two different low pressure mercury lamps with a maximum emission at 254 nm the first was an 8 w lamp spectroline enf 260c fe spectronics corp usa while the second was a 2 15 w lamp vl 215 l biosigma ve italy respectively irradiance values of 1400 μw cm2 and 4800 μw cm2 were measured with accumax xr 1000 spectronics corp at the distance adopted for the experiments ozonation tests were conducted by using two different air fed corona discharge ozone generators the ino3max 04 with a max production capacity of 100 mg h provided a low flow rate of 17 4 mgo3 lh quantified by the indigo colorimetric method 29 the steril 500 sepra italy with a max production capacity of 500 mg h provided a higher flow rate of 260 mgo3 lh electrolyses were performed in a membrane free reactor under galvanostatic conditions using a potentiostat amel 2051 a gas diffusion electrode gde coated on the upper side with hydrophobic shawinigan acetylene black carbon sab and on the side towards the solution with hydrophilic vulcan xc 72 carbon industrie de nora milan italy was used as the cathode the gde cathode previously described 30 had a geometric area of about 5 cm2 and was fed with oxygen 100 ml min the anode was a commercial platinum coil their inter distance was about 1 cm the experiments were conducted at a current density of 100 a m2 at ambient temperature to obtain large amounts for ex situ experiments hydrogen peroxide was electrogenerated in a divided reactor separated by a cation exchange membrane nafion 324 the energy consumption ec was calculated according to the following equation 1 e c m 3 e n e r g y c o s t k w h p u v t p o 3 t e i t v where puv and po3 are the power w of uv lamp and ozone generator respectively e is the cell potential v and i the current intensity a for the treatment of a volume of wastewater v in a definite time t the energy cost adopted for this evaluation was 0 006 kw h all the experiments were conducted with 100 ml of the sample solution at a temperature of 22 2 ⁰c the reported data are the average of three different repetitions with coefficient variation less 5 2 3 analysis at different time intervals during the experiments samples were collected and analyzed for ph crison glp 421 pa concentration and total organic carbon toc content pa removal was monitored spectrophotometrically at 243 nm with a double beam uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2700 shimadzu co kyoto japan with quartz cells of 1 cm path length the mineralization of the molecule that is the conversion to co2 and h2o was monitored by the measure of toc concentration shimadzu toc l csh csn analyzer and reported as toc according to the following equations 2 t o c t o c 0 t o c t t o c 0 100 where toc0 and toct are the concentrations of total organic carbon at the beginning of the test and at a generic time t hydrogen peroxide concentration was determined by the merck reflectometric kit based on the use of a specific peroxidase reagent detection limit 0 5 mg l 3 results and discussion the uv vis spectrum of pa fig 1 exhibits two main bands in the uv region λ 200 nm and λ 243 nm attributed to π π transitions of the aromatic ring and to π π transitions of the carbonyl group respectively 16 the disappearance of the peaks has been correlated to the pa removal for the evaluation of mineralization extent in addition to the absorption spectrum we also monitored the toc values table 1 shows the effect of single treatments on the degradation of 50 mg l pa over a time of 2 h as can be seen uv irradiation alone commercial and electrogenerated h2o2 alone had a negligible effect on the initial pa content on the contrary the ozone promoted the removal process depending as known on the ph conditions free ph resulted in slow degradation 39 after 2 h and slight mineralization 5 while alkaline values ph 10 fastened pa degradation about 80 but without improving its mineralization significantly 25 after 2 h the enhanced treatment under alkaline condition was attributed to the presence of radical species produced by the ozone decomposition 31 to enhance the paracetamol degradation and mineralization we then tested the combined treatments uv h2o2 and uv o3 where uv c irradiation was used to catalyze the decomposition of oxidants into more powerful species mainly hydroxyl radicals e0 2 7 v vs she 3 1 uv and electrogenerated h2o2 the use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing species is very popular as this chemical is considered green and environmentally friendly being water and oxygen its only end products however due to its high reactivity some safety issues are related to transportation storage and handling a possible strategy to overcome this limitation is the application of an electrochemically driven process for in situ production the hydrogen peroxide electrogeneration is obtained on carbon based cathodes via reduction of dissolved oxygen according to the overall reaction 3 o2 2h3o 2e h2o2 2h2o in this work the electrogeneration of h2o2 was performed by adopting a gas diffusion electrode as the cathode the optimal conditions in term of paracetamol removal and mineralization were evaluated by studying the effect of uv radiation intensity fig 2 a current density fig 2b c and ph fig 2d the results in fig 2 referring to electrochemical tests conducted at 100 a m2 highlight the presence of an initial plateau common to all treatments that can be attributed to the initial absence of hydrogen peroxide resulting in a process delay considering that the reactor was an undivided electrolyzer the limited amount of hydrogen peroxide can be explained by considering the concomitant occurrence of different side reactions mainly anodic decomposition that prevented h2o2 from accumulation the degradation of pa was notably influenced by an increase in the light intensity fig 2a due to the enhanced formation of hydroxyl radicals according to the photolysis reaction 4 h2o2 hv 2 ho by working at 4800 μw cm2 it was possible to completely degrade the model compound within 2 h while at 1400 and 3100 μw cm2 pa removals less than 20 and 50 respectively were reached the adoption of the maximum uv irradiance was also beneficial to the mineralization that was extended to 61 after 2 h table 2 and almost 90 after 3 h because of the superior oxidation ability the uv irradiance value of 4800 μw cm2 has been adopted in all the following experiments when an electrochemical treatment is concerned the current density is a crucial parameter to investigate to this aim different experiments were conducted in the range of 50 200 a m2 fig 2b although a current increase implied a faster production of hydrogen peroxide and therefore a larger availability of hydroxyl radicals the results indicated that this parameter in the range investigated was not susceptible to improvement in terms of energy efficiency the best curve was 50 a m2 because a certain degree of degradation fig 2b was obtained with a smaller amount of charge fig 2c however the degradation rate was sufficiently slow to prevent removal completion at the end of the test on the other hand the adoption of a 200 a m2 current density resulted in a current waste as it favored the onset of parasitic reactions such as anodic decomposition reduction of oxygen to water and water discharge with the evolution of hydrogen furthermore higher currents accelerated the degradation of the cathode and aggravated the treatment costs as deducible from the cell potential values shown in table 2 for these reasons the value of 100 a m2 represented the best compromise between current efficiency and treatment time paracetamol with a pka1 value of 0 14 0 50 nh2 nh a pka2 value of 9 86 0 13 oh o and a pka3 value of 15 32 0 70 nh n 32 is little influenced by the ph conditions since in the investigated ph range results only limitedly dissociated 33 however since in an undivided electrochemical cell the ph conditions of the electrolyte can vary considerably and abruptly we monitored the variations in a solution treated at free ph and we extended the study also to solutions where the ph was kept constant at 3 and 10 fig 2d the effect of ph condition on pa removal and degradation was evaluated by adopting 100 a m2 of current density and 4800 μw cm2 irradiance fig 2d shows that during electrolysis conducted at 100 a m2 the initially circumneutral ph experienced a slight initial increase and then tended to steadily decrease after 120 min a value around 4 5 was detected presumably due to the formation of short chain carboxylic acids besides a further contribution to acidity may derive from anodic oxidation of hydrogen peroxide 34 the degradation of paracetamol was completed within 2 h in every adopted condition with similar trends and therefore it was unaffected by the ph conditions of the electrolyte however this parameter exhibited a more decisive role in the molecule mineralization table 2 where a detrimental constant over time effect was observed either at ph 3 about 15 if compared with the uncontrolled ph or and mostly at ph 10 about 25 if compared with the uncontrolled ph other authors found similar behavior and hypothesized that circumneutral ph conditions minimized the occurrence of side reactions involving the radical species thus improving the process efficiency 35 the detrimental effect of alkaline ph can be explained by considering that h2o2 electrogeneration according to eq 3 is favored by the abundance of protons 36 and that high ph values promote hydrogen peroxide decomposition into water and oxygen 37 instead of forming hydroxyl radicals this result is particularly appealing since the possibility of working without the need for ph adjustment also involves a simplification of the process operations and a saving in terms of reagents zero order kinetics well described the experimental results as can be seen table 3 the kinetic constants increased their value at higher uv light irradiance and by adopting current density up to 100 a m2 a particular feature of these curves was represented by the initial plateau determined by a limiting factor in the production of the oxidizing species responsible for the pa degradation surprisingly the delay was not dependent on the slow accumulation of hydrogen peroxide but rather on the insufficient uv irradiance in fact by providing a 4800 μw cm2 irradiance the delay was shortened to less than 1 s in the whole range of investigated current densities 3 2 uv and o3 finally we tested the degradation of pa by photo assisted ozonation many authors agree that photo induced decomposition of aqueous ozone results in the

two extremes were reported shows that complete depletion was achieved after about 60 min and that a change in the irradiation intensity unaffected the uv decay efficiency the mineralization extent was similar and less than 35 after 2 h treatments in all the tests due to the comparable performance 1400 μw cm2 was adopted as the irradiance value for the following tests aimed at exploring the effect of ph the study of initial ph effect was limited at free and alkaline values in fact ph when unadjusted quickly evolved to acidic values and therefore the results obtained under these conditions were comparable with those obtained in experiments starting with ph 3 instead a comparison with ph 10 was of interest since as already reported alkaline conditions promote the ozone decomposition via a chain reaction with formation of hydroxyl radicals 30 however no improvement was observed after ph modification the molecule oxidation followed a first order kinetic with a constant value of 0 042 min 1 r2 0 997 experiments extended at 3 h indicated that mineralization reached around 50 efficiency at both ph values table 4 the slight differences found in this set of experiments suggested the presence of a limiting factor and in particular that the oxidation was under ozone mass transfer control indeed the ozone generator used in this work allowed a low rate of ozone production as specified in the materials and methods moreover ozone exhibits low solubility in water 6 7 mg l at ambient conditions to clarify this aspect the same experiments were repeated at high ozone flow using the second more powerful generator while the operating parameters were varied within the same range of values fig 3b the increased flow rate significantly promoted the mass transfer rate of ozone in solution thus enhancing the production of oxidants as a result degradation of paracetamol was further accelerated and completed in 10 min the influence of operative factors such as ph and irradiance was not significant in the degradation rate thus suggesting also in this case the presence of a limiting factor presumably the concentration of paracetamol itself the increase in the ozone flow rate was particularly beneficial for the pa mineralization where contrary to what observed in the degradation tests a sharp effect of the operating parameters was found in particular higher uv irradiance fastened the pa mineralization especially at free ph by adopting a 4800 μw cm2 irradiance without adjusting the initial ph value the efficiency was 71 after one hour of reaction and 88 after 2 h the improvement obtained when the light radiation was enhanced is not surprising as it is related to the increased production of oxidants instead it is worth discussing the negative influence of alkaline ph conditions on mineralization on this point there are conflicting data that can often be explained considering the structure of the pollutant or the concomitant presence of other species matrix effect in this case however as already mentioned the molecule did not dissociate and therefore did not change its stability to the attack of electrophilic oxidants in the considered ph range and in solution there are no species other than sulfate the worst performance of the o3 uv system at alkaline ph values can be explained considering that these conditions promote the decomposition of ozone in a multi reaction mechanism 30 which presumably leads to the formation of hydroxyl radicals in amounts at most equimolar to ozone concentration for this reason the availability of ozone for the photolysis is reduced resulting in low mineralization efficiency on the contrary acid ph values guarantee the stability of molecular ozone which can undergo photodecomposition thus forming hydrogen peroxide which in turn when photolyzed produces hydroxyl radicals in a two fold concentration with respect to ozone eqs 4 and 5 40 moreover at alkaline ph values the hydroxyl radical exhibits a lower standard potential than under acidic ph values 1 9 v instead of 2 7 v vs she 41 and therefore behaves as a less powerful oxidant finally at high ph values hydroxyl radicals can recombine with

o2eq m3 for the organic carbon removal defined as oxygen equivalent chemical oxidation capacity occ in particular in such works the o3 contribution is expressed as o2eq by a conversion factor of 1 000 while in case of hydrogen peroxide this factor is equal to 0 471 the application of this equivalence to the best cases studied in this work makes it possible to obtain interesting results which however require some assumptions all processes were combined with uv light of 4800 μw cm2 irradiance as the presence of uv cannot be expressed in terms of kgo2eq m3 and considering that its contribution was equal in all the cases this factor was not taken into account considering the results presented in table 5 it is possible to compare the combinations studied in the present work taking into account the effectiveness and costs of the treatments in terms of both degradation and mineralization in the evaluation we considered the time necessary to achieve efficiency values of 60 τ60 and 90 τ90 all the combined processes reached complete pa degradation but a significantly faster removal occurred with ozone the low occ value compared to the h2o2 based process suggests that the o3 uv system is more effective than those based on hydrogen peroxide since a low oxidant demand is sufficient to remove the same amount of pollutant however the degradation alone is not exhaustive to establish a performance rank of the tested processes and similar considerations have to be extended also to mineralization where different performances were observed in particular the treatments using low rate of o3 failed to reach the prefixed 90 efficiency value moreover the treatment carried out with electro generated hydrogen peroxide exhibited an occ index value equal to half of that found for ozone thus resulting in the most appealing performance however its costs remain very high this can be explained considering that the price was mainly determined by the uv source 48 that in this treatment had been working for 3 h while in the ozone based treatment for only 120 min it is therefore clear that further considerations are possible when using a less expensive light source such as led lighting this solution would be particularly desirable since from a social and environmental point of view the hydrogen peroxide is considered and sensed as a more environmentally friendly and less harmful oxidant than ozone 4 conclusions the uv induced decomposition of ozone and electrogenerated hydrogen peroxide was successfully applied for the paracetamol oxidation the synergy between

14071,the in situ production of highly oxidizing species represents a sustainable approach for the treatment of unregulated emerging contaminants in this article we investigate the uv induced degradation and mineralization of paracetamol that represents one of the most frequently prescribed and sold drugs worldwide in particular this work compares two advanced oxidation processes based on photolysis of electrogenerated hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ozone o3 the h2o2 electrosynthesis has been performed via oxygen reduction on gas diffusion electrodes gde to maximize the efficiency of the treatments the effect of the main operative parameters such as reagent concentration ph current density and uv irradiance has been discussed the results show that due to the synergistic effect paracetamol undergoes rapid degradation and extensive mineralization the comparison of the cost effectiveness of the treatments in terms of energy consumption is also provided keywords ozone electrogenerated hydrogen peroxide uv light paracetamol gas diffusion cathode 1 introduction recently growing attention has been paid to the identification and monitoring of a wide class of compounds collectively referred as to emerging contaminants these chemicals can range from pharmaceuticals to newly registered pesticides from industrial plastic additives to personal care products major features are a rare or new occurrence recent identification lack of existing regulation and potential adverse effects on humans and the environment 1 it has been shown that emerging contaminants are recalcitrant to biological and physical chemical processes that are typically applied in sewage treatment plants 2 3 therefore these pollutants remain in the treated wastewater and are discharged into the receiving water basins 4 a particular concern arises since they are also characterized by bioaccumulation with deleterious effects on the endocrine system and possible mutagenic effect 1 to meet the environmental and sanitary requirements advanced options are necessary for the treatment of these effluents 5 among the drugs paracetamol pa also known as acetaminophen commonly used as a pain reliever and fever reducer for both adults and children formulations is one of the best selling over the counter products worldwide extensive metabolism of paracetamol occurs in the liver and only 2 5 of the unmodified product is excreted through the kidneys 6 despite its high metabolism rate due to its high prescription frequency in 2000 it was among the three most prescribed drugs in england and among the 200 most prescribed drugs in the usa and the fact that it is easily accessible even without a medical prescription a considerable concentration is frequently detected in wastewater 7 a wide range of methods have been so far tested for its treatment including adsorption 8 ozonation 9 10 hydrogen peroxide based oxidation 9 11 photocatalysis 12 13 sonolysis 14 electrochemical oxidation on stainless steel 15 graphite 16 and on bdd electrode 17 and electro fenton process 18 19 the results achieved so far indicate that a good degradation efficiency of the paracetamol can be achieved but uncomplete mineralization occurs probably due to the formation of persistent by products to obtain extensive removal the development of enhanced treatments is thus required it is widely accepted that the most powerful treatments currently available are those defined as advanced oxidation processes aops based on the fast and non selective action of highly oxidizing species such as the hydroxyl radical ho hydroperoxyl radical ho2 and superoxide radical o2 aops have been successfully tested for the treatment of a wide range of waters and wastewaters 20 the most common aops involve the decomposition of radical precursors mainly peroxides in combination with catalysts and or other activating agents such as uv radiation and ultrasound uv driven aops exhibit the potential for effective versatile and scalable removal of a variety of pollutants 21 23 although some papers prompt caution due to the likely formation of toxic by products 24 and to the high associated cost 25 the electrogeneration of hydrogen peroxide by cathodic reduction of dissolved molecular oxygen can be obtained on a variety of carbon based electrodes 26 due to their overpotential for hydrogen evolution however the best efficient electrosynthesis is provided by gas diffusion electrode gde 27 since these cathodes overcome the difficulty coming from the low solubility and the mass transport limitation of dissolved oxygen moreover the in situ production allows the achievement of significant advantages from an economic environmental and safety point of view in previous work we verified the interest in developing a combined system with electrogenerated hydrogen peroxide for the removal of paracetamol 28 the present article investigates the efficiency in degrading the paracetamol of two different systems based on the production of radicals through photodecomposition of in situ electrogenerated hydrogen peroxide and ozone to maximize the treatment efficiency we investigated and discussed the effect of the main process parameters such as reagent concentration ph current density and light intensity a comparative cost evaluation of the discussed treatments is reported 2 materials and methods

experiments photo degradation tests were performed in a cylindrical quartz reactor by using two different low pressure mercury lamps with a maximum emission at 254 nm the first was an 8 w lamp

with hydrophobic shawinigan acetylene black carbon sab and on the side towards the solution with hydrophilic vulcan xc 72 carbon industrie de nora milan italy was used as the cathode the gde cathode previously described 30 had a geometric area of about 5 cm2 and was fed with oxygen 100 ml min the anode was a commercial platinum coil their inter distance was about 1 cm the experiments were conducted at a current density of 100 a m2 at ambient temperature to obtain large amounts for ex situ experiments hydrogen peroxide was electrogenerated in a divided reactor separated by a cation

region λ 200 nm and λ 243 nm attributed to π π transitions of the aromatic ring and to π π transitions of the carbonyl group respectively 16 the disappearance of the peaks has been correlated to the pa removal for the evaluation of mineralization extent in addition to the absorption spectrum we also monitored the toc values table 1 shows the effect of single treatments on the degradation of 50 mg l pa over a time of 2 h as can be seen uv irradiation alone commercial and electrogenerated h2o2 alone had a negligible effect on the initial pa content on the contrary the ozone promoted the removal process depending as known on the ph conditions free ph resulted in slow degradation 39 after 2 h and slight mineralization 5 while alkaline values ph 10 fastened pa degradation about 80 but without improving its mineralization significantly 25 after 2 h the enhanced treatment under alkaline condition was attributed to the presence of radical species produced by the ozone decomposition 31 to enhance the paracetamol degradation and mineralization we then tested the combined treatments uv h2o2 and uv o3 where uv c irradiation was used to catalyze the decomposition of oxidants into more powerful species mainly hydroxyl radicals e0 2 7 v vs she 3 1 uv and electrogenerated h2o2 the use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing species is very popular as this chemical is considered green and environmentally friendly being water and oxygen its only end products however due to its high reactivity some safety issues are related to transportation storage and handling a possible strategy to overcome this limitation is the application of an electrochemically driven process for in situ production the hydrogen peroxide electrogeneration is obtained on carbon based cathodes via reduction of dissolved oxygen according to the overall reaction 3 o2 2h3o 2e h2o2 2h2o in this work the electrogeneration of h2o2 was performed by adopting a gas diffusion electrode as the cathode the optimal conditions in term of paracetamol removal and mineralization were evaluated by studying the effect of uv radiation intensity fig 2 a current density fig 2b c and ph fig 2d the results in fig 2 referring to electrochemical tests conducted at 100 a m2 highlight the presence of an initial plateau common to all treatments that can be attributed to the initial absence of hydrogen peroxide resulting in a process delay considering that the reactor was an undivided electrolyzer the limited amount of hydrogen peroxide can be explained by considering the concomitant occurrence of different side reactions mainly anodic decomposition that prevented h2o2 from accumulation the degradation of pa was notably influenced by an increase in the light intensity fig 2a due to the enhanced formation of hydroxyl radicals according to the photolysis reaction 4 h2o2 hv 2 ho by working at 4800 μw cm2 it was possible to completely degrade the model compound within 2 h while at 1400 and 3100 μw cm2 pa removals less than 20 and 50 respectively were reached the adoption of the maximum uv irradiance was also beneficial to the mineralization that was extended to 61 after 2 h table 2 and almost 90 after 3 h because of the superior oxidation ability the uv irradiance value of 4800 μw cm2 has been adopted in all the following experiments when an electrochemical treatment is concerned the current density is a crucial parameter to investigate to this aim different experiments were conducted in the range of 50 200 a m2 fig 2b although a current increase implied a faster production of hydrogen peroxide and therefore a larger availability of hydroxyl radicals the results indicated that this parameter in the range investigated was not susceptible to improvement in terms of energy efficiency the best curve was 50 a m2 because a certain degree of degradation fig 2b was obtained with a smaller amount of charge fig 2c however the degradation rate was sufficiently slow to prevent removal completion at the end of the test on the other hand the adoption of a 200 a m2 current density resulted in a current waste as it favored the onset of parasitic reactions such as anodic decomposition reduction of oxygen to water and water discharge with the evolution of hydrogen furthermore higher currents accelerated the degradation of the cathode and aggravated the treatment costs as deducible from the cell potential values shown in table 2 for these reasons the value of 100 a m2 represented the best compromise between current efficiency and treatment time paracetamol with a pka1 value of 0 14 0 50 nh2 nh a pka2 value of 9 86 0 13 oh o and a pka3 value of 15 32 0 70 nh n 32 is little influenced by the ph conditions since in the investigated ph range results only limitedly dissociated 33 however since in an undivided electrochemical cell the ph conditions of the electrolyte can vary considerably and abruptly we monitored the variations in a solution treated at free ph and we extended the study also to solutions where the ph was kept constant at 3 and 10 fig 2d the effect of ph condition on pa removal and degradation was evaluated by adopting 100 a m2 of current density and 4800 μw cm2 irradiance fig 2d shows that during electrolysis conducted at 100 a m2 the initially circumneutral ph experienced a slight initial increase and then tended to steadily decrease after 120 min a value around 4 5 was detected presumably due to the formation of short chain carboxylic acids besides a further contribution to acidity may derive from anodic oxidation of hydrogen peroxide 34 the degradation of paracetamol was completed within 2 h in every adopted condition with similar trends and therefore it was unaffected by the ph conditions of the electrolyte however this parameter

studies were carried out with the same it follows the second order kinetics model the intra particle diffusion model suggest pore diffusion to be a major contributor along with other processes which may be operating simultaneously the d r and temkin isotherm models reveal physical adsorption due to the electrostatic interaction between the opposite charges present in the adsorbate and adsorbent this has been illustrated through a mechanism and further supported by xps results the adsorbent could effectively remove fluoride to less than 0 4 ppm when the initial fluoride concentration in water was 10 ppm further the fluoride adsorbed aiac was successfully reused as effective filler in developing particle board material keywords activated carbon alumina impregnation fluoride d r isotherm temkin isotherm 1 introduction fluorine has the highest value of electronegativity nearly 3 98 among all the elements in the periodic table and therefore exists as fluoride in nature 1 according to who the permissible limit of fluoride in drinking water is 1 5 mg l 2 whereby it is beneficial for human teeth and bones however its excess ingestion causes severe health issues dental fluorosis due to overexposure especially during the initial growth years is a cosmetic phenomenon skeletal fluorosis due to accumulation of fluoride in bones may cause painful damage and deformation of bones and joints many stretches worldwide are suffering from this dreaded phenomenon including regions of iran kenya turkey iraq tanzania china south africa australia canada thailand saudi arabia new zealand syria egypt jordan and india nearly 20 states of india are affected from dental skeletal fluorosis in a few regions fluoride concentration is as high as 20 mg l 3 fluoride contamination in water occurs from natural and industrial sources naturally fluoride leaches by weathering of rocks into ground water excessive use of agrochemicals like pesticides and phosphatic fertilizers may also cause fluoride contamination by discharge through the soil profile in rural areas installation of deep bore wells for drinking purpose also leads to fluoride inclusions 4 wastes from industries like ceramic and glass industries electroplating mining semiconductor fabrication rubber and fertilizer manufacturing coal fired power station etc 5 6 further worsens the situation several hydrofluoric spills from petroleum refinery like marathan and citgo corpus christi refinery in texas u s and other accidents like the one at gumi city in korea have reportedly led to an accidental increase the fluoride concentration in soil and plants up to 9 79 mg l 7 several fluoride treatment techniques are available with their pros and cons coagulation and precipitation technique can be used for bulk treatments but removes only 18 33 of the fluoride moreover the disposal of the sludge formed creates another issue reverse osmosis and nano filteration techniques though efficient leads to wastage of water and removal of essential minerals electro dialysis technique uses anion exchange resin containing quaternary ammonium functional group for fluoride removal from water ion exchange technique is expensive requires maintenance of ph further the techniques are area specific with performance depending upon the environmental conditions therefore a single technique is not viable at all regions for complete fluoride elimination hence as compared to other techniques adsorption is feasible and cost effective for fluoride removal from drinking water and therefore widely accepted 8 9 different kinds of adsorbents are used in fluoride adsorption including oxide and hydroxide of metals 10 14 biosorbent 15 16 carbon based adsorbent 17 19 clay and layered double hydroxide 20 22 etc biomass based adsorbent are widely used because of their low cost and easy availability activated carbon prepared by chemical treatment such as h3po4 treated peach stone 23 h3po4 treated rice straw and water hyacinth 24 and koh treated cotton stalks 25 have also been used as an adsorbent for removal of toxic dyes activated carbons prepared from different biomass have been tested for de flouridation of water activated carbons prepared from biomass like banana peel 26 coffee husk 26 moringa indica 27 and coconut shell 28 have shown an adsorption capacity of less than 0 5 mg g although the adsorption capacity depends upon a number of parameters more or less the adsorption capacity is very low despite high surface area reported in some cases 28 it is only after impregnation with other metals like al 28 or zr 29 an increase in adsorption capacity is reported rice straw is a waste produced by many countries in asia the disposal of which is a big issue 30 rice husk ash has been widely studied for treating waste water 31 this however involves high temperature treatment with low yield hence activated carbon generated from rice straw has been used for fluoride removal by different research groups activation has been achieved using kmno4 1 koh and naoh 32 acetic acid 33 zncl2 and other salts and co2 34 etc alum is known for its high fluoride removal capacity 35 in nalgonda technique alum and lime are used to precipitate the aluminum fluoride complex 36 rice straw has large amount of silica but is in a bound state and therefore unable to form bonds with fluoride in the present study alumina has been impregnated onto the activated carbon derived from rice straw which creates positive polarity on the matrix mainly carbon along with some silica to enhance its fluoride removal capacity the adsorbent alumina impregnated activated carbon aiac so formed has been characterized for crystal structure morphology and elemental analysis by xrd sem and edx batch adsorption studies were conducted under different experimental condition like varying ph adsorbent doses contact time initial fluoride concentration temperature and interfering ions the adsorbent was found to be thermally stable and perform well from 13 c to 43 c which proves the thermodynamic compatibility of activated carbon and alumina the functionalities present on the surface of activated carbon helps to achieve this compatibility and the proposed mechanism for the attachment of alum on activated carbon has been illustrated chemical modifications functionalizations of the carbon surface have been known to increase their thermodynamic compatibility with other phases 37 different kinetics and isotherm models were applied to the experimental data to infer the most probable mechanism of the reaction further column studies were conducted with different flow rates and the study with the artificial water was compared with the field water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials waste rice straw was collected from sonepat haryana india nahco3 was purchased from merck purified aluminium sulphate al2so4 16h2o and anhydrous sodium carbonate from molychem and sodium hexametaphosphate sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide from fisher scientific standard sodium fluoride solution of 99 9 purity from sigma aldrich has been used for the preparation of fluoride stock solution 2 2 synthesis of the adsorbent materials rice straw was grinded into small pieces these were washed with de ionized water and dried in oven at 100 c these were further ground to pass through 50 100 bs mesh to obtain particles in size ranging from 150 to 300 μm it was then treated in three different ways to obtain three different adsorbents i rice straw was carbonized at 500 c in an inert atmosphere to obtain carbonized rice straw crs ii rice straw was treated with 3 m naoh solution with constant stirring for 8 h the process removes most of the hemi cellulose and silica that binds to the lignin and therefore helps in creating pores in the structure 38 it was then filtered and washed with de ionized water until the ph of the filtrate was neutral naoh treated rice straw was carbonized at 500 c in inert atmosphere to obtain activated carbon ac iii naoh treated rice straw was treated with a solution of 0 8 m alum al2so4 16h2o and 5 nahco3 the suspension was stirred for 6 h filtered and carbonized at 500 c in n2 atmosphere since amorphous alumina is a good adsorbent the carbonization temperature was restricted to avoid crystallization of the alumina it is then washed with di water until the ph value reaches to 6 5 and dried in oven at 80 c to obtain alumina impregnated activated carbon the schematic of the preparation processes is shown in fig 1 2 3 material characterization the adsorbent samples were subjected to various physico chemical characterizations xrd was performed on rikagu powder x ray diffractometer model xrg 2kw using cu kα radiation thermal stability and alum loading in samples were estimated by tga the measurements were carried out on mettler toledo tga dsc 1600 at a constant heating rate of 10 c min in air along with the analysis in the mentioned tga equipment the ash content of the adsorbent samples was determined by gravimetric method and further analyzed for the elemental composition by edax for determining the ash content the different carbon samples were burned in a current of air approximately 0 5 g weighed to nearest 0 01 mg of weighed samples was transferred to the weighed alumina crucible and the final weight of the crucible and adsorbent sample was taken on a calibrated balance after all the weighing the crucibles were kept in desiccators the crucibles without lid were placed in a calibrated muffle furnace with required air circulation taking into account that there was no possibility of sweeping away of the solid particles from the crucibles the furnace was heated under identical conditions as in the tga experiment the crucibles with ash were then removed from the furnace and allowed to cool in the desiccators and weighed the bet surface area was determined by automatic gas sorption system from quantachrome model autosorb iq the surface morphology of the samples was determined using sem model sem evo m 10 determination of point of zero charge was done by rapid titration method the adsorbent was stabilized in different electrolyte solution for 72 h the potentiometric titration was carried out with 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh the zeta potential of the adsorbent was determined by zeta sizer model nano zs90 from malvern instruments at neutral ph and 90 scattering angle to check the surface charge of the adsorbent x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps of samples was performed on xps multilab 2000 spectrometers thermo electron corporation england alkα was used as an x ray source with power of 1485 6 ev 2 4 fluoride adsorption studies fluoride stock solution 1000 mg l was prepared by taking 2 21 g of anhydrous naf in 1000 ml of de ionized water in poly propylene pp regent bottle fluoride solutions of different concentration were prepared by diluting the stock solution with de ionized water all the experiments were performed by taking 25 ml of fluoride solution in 50 ml pp bottle at a temperature of 25 2 c required amount of adsorbent was added to it with continues stirring residual fluoride concentration was detected by thermo scientific orion fluoride ion selective electrode connected to orion star a214 ise ph meter fluoride concentration was determined after mixing total ionic strength adjustment buffer tisab iii in fluoride contaminated water all the experiments were conducted four times and the mean values with standard deviations have been reported the initial fluoride concentration fo and contact time was optimized and fixed at 10 ppm and 3 h respectively it has been demonstrated later in the text section 3 3 3 that 3 h time is enough for reaching the equilibrium the effect of ph was studied at ph values nearly 3 4 5 6 0 7 5 and 9 5 the effect of adsorbent doses was studied in the range 0 5 g l 10 g l at nearly 6 ph kinetic study was conducted by varying the contact time from 1 min to 360 min the effect of temperature on the fluoride adsorption was studied at temperatures ranging from 13 c to 43 c further different kinetics and isotherm models were investigated to fit the experimental data the amount of fluoride adsorbed and fluoride removal efficiency were calculated by the following equations 1 f l u o r i d e a d s o r b e d m g g q e v c o c m 2 f l u o r i d e r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c o c c o 100 where v is the volume of fluoride contaminated water m is mass of adsorbent co and care initial and final fluoride concentration respectively at equilibration 2 5 column regeneration studies continuous flow column study was carried out with aiac as an adsorbent glass column having cross section area 7 cm2 and height 30 cm was used column was packed with 5 g of aiac to obtain a bed height of 3 cm and operated at temperature 27 1 c and ph 7 experiments were conducted to study the effect of flow rates 5 1 ml min 20 1 ml min and 35 1 ml min and also with field water obtained from sonepat haryana the field water had a fluoride content of 5 ppm hence the column studies were also carried out with the same initial fluoride concentration further regeneration studies of the fluoride adsorbed column was carried out using 250 ml of 0 2 m h2so4 solution and results are discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbent materials 3 1 1 thermo gravimetric analysis the tga and dtg curves of the three adsorbent samples are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively from fig 2a the residual content for the crs ac and aiac samples have been computed to be 32 16 and 39 respectively the weight of the ash obtained for the three samples crs ac and aiac with the gravimetric method was found to be 28 12 and 39 respectively which is in close proximity with the tga results as shown in table 1 the residue is mainly sio2 along with small amounts of trace elements in the ashes of crs and ac while the ash of aiac consists of aluminum oxide and small amounts of sio2 the reduction in the residue of ac is the result of treatment with naoh as mentioned in section 2 2 which removes most of the silica in the form of sodium silicate the dtg curve fig 2b shows the relative thermal decomposition in the given temperature range aiac shows higher thermal stability as compared to crs and ac samples the initial weight loss in aiac occurs at around 135 c which is probably due to loss of water molecules chemically bounded to the alum 39 it has been demonstrated that the water leaves the compound in different stages that overlaps beyond the heating rate of 8 c min the lower decomposition temperature of crs 588 c is probably due to the presence of silica which catalyzes the thermal decomposition reaction thus the thermal stability of the samples increases with decreasing silica content 3 1 2 x ray diffraction analysis the x ray diffraction curves of the different adsorbent samples are shown in fig 3 while the different lattice parameters are calculated and shown in table 2 the xrd curve of crs shows a broad peak at around 23 8 corresponding to 002 plane of carbon 40 41 sharp peaks corresponding to 111 and 220 plane of si are also clearly visible 42 the presence of si in the carbon sample probably leads to its large d spacing and crystallite size since a major part of si is removed as nasio3 upon the addition of naoh the peaks of si disappear in ac sample this is further accompanied by breaking down of the carbon structure that leads to a decrease in the crystallite size further addition of alum increases the d spacing of aiac probably due to its diffusion in between the layers of activated carbon however clear peaks of al2o3 are not visible due to its amorphous nature 19 the decrease in the crystallite size suggests that the impregnation process creates pores and breaks the crystallites as is also clear from the sem images fig 4 e f the decrease in crystallite size indicates that the activated carbon is in amorphous range which in turn is good for adsorption 3 1 3 surface morphology and surface area the surface morphology of the three samples crs ac and aiac were studied by sem as shown in fig 4 the natural structure of rice straw acts as a template for the crs sample the structure appears as grooved cylindrical bundles with a definite arrangement throughout the sample as shown in fig 4 a and b it has a low bet surface area of 20 m2 g the surface area of ac 33 m2 g increases only slightly as compared to crs which is due to the removal of silicon compounds by treatment with naoh the process opens up the cylindrical bundles as shown in fig 4 c and d no substantial porosity as such is visible at this stage which is also reflected from the low value of bet surface area further reaction with alum followed by heat treatment not only impregnates it with alumina which is visible as the shinning portion in fig 4 e and f but also creates porosity on the surface of activated carbon the surface area of aiac increases to 151 m2 g which indicates that the process of alum impregnation further activates the sample by creating pores and breaking down the material as also indicated by the lower crystallite size reflected by the xrd data nonetheless the surface area of ac and aiac is less owing to the fact that the treatment with naoh for silica removal creates macropores that do not contribute much to the increase in surface area 3 1 4 point of zero charge and zeta potential point of zero charge of the adsorbent aiac was determined by rapid titration method with 0 1 n nacl solution and titrated with 0 1 n hcl and 0 1 n naoh solution fig 5 shows the plot of final ph with the consumed acid and base in which two points of intersection are observed at ph values around 4 and 8 6 the phpzc at 4 is probably due to the activated carbon 43 whereas at higher side i e around 8 6 is due to the alumina impregnated onto the carbon hence during the adsorption process due to the strong influence of phpzc the ph of the solution seems to lie in between ph 4 and 8 6 and mostly set at around ph values 6 1 the zeta potential analysis result at neutral ph shows that the potential of the surface of the aiac adsorbent is positive i e 10 8 mv which further confirms that the adsorbent favors anion adsorption and is therefore feasible for fluoride adsorption 3 2 selection of suitable adsorbent the preliminary adsorption tests were conducted with all the three adsorbents with adsorbent dose 4 g l and fo 10 mg l table 3 shows that crs and ac samples did not show any activity towards fluoride removal this clearly shows that si present in the above samples is in bound state and unable to form bonds with fluoride aiac sample works effectively owing to the presence of alumina which is not only an effective fluoride adsorbent but also polarizes the carbon matrix and si present in it thus inducing it in fluoride adsorption detailed mechanism is shown later in the text the increase in porosity and surface area further assist the adsorption process 3 3 batch adsorption studies on the basis of above result the further batch adsorption studies were carried out with aiac samples 3 3 1 effect of ph effect of ph was observed on removal of fluoride from contaminated water having initial fluoride concentration 10 ppm by using adsorbent doses 4 g l contact time 3 h and temperature 26 1 c and is shown in fig 6 a variation of 0 25 in the ph values was obtained while adjusting the ph for the four different readings of a given sample which was done using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl the reduced fluoride adsorption capacity at lower ph was probably due to formation of weak hydrofluoric acid 35 fluoride adsorption reached maxima at ph 6 1 whereby nearly 94 fluoride removal was observed as ph was further increased fluoride removal decreased this is probably due to competition of hydroxide ion with fluoride for active sites of adsorbent 4 aiac hence proved to be a good adsorbent because there is no requirement of maintaining the ph of drinking water by using acids and bases 3 3 2 effect of adsorbent doses the effect of adsorbent doses on fluoride removal is shown in fig 7 with increase in adsorbent doses from 0 5 g l to 4 g l fluoride removal efficiency increases sharply from 40 to a maximum of 94 93 this was due to the increased availability of active sites for fluoride adsorption as the dosage is further increased to 10 g l the efficiency remains almost the same however the amount of fluoride adsorbed per unit adsorbent weight decreases with increasing adsorbent dose it occurs so because the adsorptive capacity of adsorbent available could not be fully exploited at higher adsorbent doses probably due to its aggregation in comparison to when lower doses are used there is also a possibility that the material has heterogeneous distribution of active sites as a consequence increasing mass does not give a proportional increase in the adsorption capacity fig 8 depicts the variation in the distribution coefficient kd with adsorbent doses kd is defined as the ratio of the equilibrium concentrations of a substance adsorbed onto a solid sorbent to that dissolved in a liquid phase the maximum value of kd at an adsorbent dosage of 4 6 g l signifies maximum removal efficiency at these doses the variation in kd with varying adsorbent doses signifies that the surface of aiac is heterogeneous for fluoride adsorption 3 3 3 kinetic study the kinetic study is important in determining the efficiency of adsorbent by providing the rate of adsorption and is also useful in determining the mechanism of adsorption the time required for reaching the adsorption equilibrium was determined by varying the contact time from 1 min to 6 h at fo 10 ppm ph 6 1 1 and temperature 26 1 c as shown in fig 9 a nearly 91 16 fluoride removal was achieved within 10 min different kinetic models were simulated with this experimental data the pseudo first order kinetic model did not fit the experimental data and was therefore nullified 3 3 3 1 pseudo second order kinetic model the pseudo second order kinetics model was used to fit the experimental data which is given by the following equation 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qt and qe are the adsorption capacities at time t and at equilibrium respectively k2 is second order rate constant the slope of the curve between t qt and t gives the adsorption capacity at equilibrium whereas the intercept gives the value of rate constant k2 pseudo second order equation fitted well with the experimental data with the correlation coefficient of 0 999 as shown in fig 9 b adsorption capacity at equilibrium and the rate constant was computed to be 2 386 mg g and 0 694 respectively hence the rate of adsorption is fast and adsorption depends on both the nature of adsorbent and the adsorbate the result further suggests that the adsorbed molecule is probably attached to two active sites of the adsorbent these sites may be the pores of the polarized ac and the alumina particles attached to it 3 3 3 2 intra particle diffusion model the overall adsorption process consists of different steps in a stirred batch the diffusive mass transfer can be correlated by a diffusion coefficient that can fit the experimental sorption rate data generally a process is diffusion controlled if its rate depends on the rate at which components diffuse towards one another the possibility of intra particle diffusion was explored by using the intra particle diffusion model 1 44 given by weber and morris according to which the amount adsorbed at time tis given by 4 q t k i d t 0 5 c where kid is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g min1 2 and c mg g is a constant related to the thickness of the boundary layer larger the value of c the greater is the boundary layer effect 45 if the weber morris 46 plot of qt versus t0 5 gives a straight line then the sorption process is controlled by intra particle diffusion only fig 9 c exhibits multi linear plots for the aiac sample which indicates that the adsorbent is heterogeneous in nature and apart from diffusion other processes also control the overall adsorption which may be operating simultaneously 47 the initial straight line depicts meso pore and macro pore diffusion the line passes close to the origin indicates that the macro and meso pore diffusion contributes significantly to the adsorption process the second straight line gives micropore diffusion 48 from the curve it is clear that microspore diffusion contributes scarcely to the adsorption process further the large deviation of straight line from the origin is probably due to the difference in rate of mass transfer in the initial and final stages of adsorption 45 the last step depicts gradual adsorption of fluoride on the adsorbent 49 hence adsorption takes place majorly by pore diffusion surface adsorption and electrostatic interactions being other contributors 50 this was further proved by energy dispersive x ray edx study carried out for the elemental analysis of as prepared aiac and fluoride adsorbed aiac fig 10 a b shows the sem of different part of aiac i e non porous and porous parts respectively along with their edx results edx of both parts of aiac revealed the presence of al c o si and s sem of the non porous and porous parts of fluoride adsorbed aiac aiac f is shown in fig 10 c d edx of porous part shows the presence of fluoride along with the principle element like al c o s and si while that of non pores part shows absence of fluoride this result further justifies that pore diffusion contributes majorly to the adsorption 3 3 3 3 elovich model the elovich equation is generally used for describing activated chemisorptions 51 and the amount adsorbed at any time t is given by the following equation 5 q t β ln α β l n t where α denotes the initial sorption rate mg g 1 min 1 and β denotes the desorption constant between any experiments it has also been used successfully to describe second order kinetics assuming that the actual solid surfaces are primarily energetically heterogeneous the equation however does not propose any definite mechanism for adsorbate adsorbent 52 54 the fitting of elovich model given in fig 9 d shows a correlation coefficient of 0 93 this although significant is much lower as compared to that obtained in case of pseudo second order kinetic model d r isotherm and temkin isotherm model as will be shown later 3 3 4 isotherm study the adsorption capacity of the composite sample aiac was studied by varying the concentration of fluoride in the adsorbate solution from 1 mg l to 50 mg l as shown in fig 11 a fluoride removal capacity of the adsorbent increases with increasing concentration of fluoride adsorption capacity of 10 mg g was obtained when the initial fluoride concentration is 50 mg l different theoretical isotherms models were used to simulate the experimental data the langmuir model and did not simulate with experimental data so the possibility of monolayer and homogenous adsorption of fluoride on adsorbent surface is ruled out further the inability of the freundlich model to fit the experimental data discards the possibility of multilayer and heterogeneous adsorption of adsorbate onto the adsorbent surface 3 3 4 1 dubinin radushkevich isotherm dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm provides information about adsorption energy and mechanism involved in adsorption the equation for which is written as 6 ln q e ln q s k d r ε 2 where qs is the adsorption capacity and kdr is the constant corresponds to the adsorption energy ε denotes the polanyi potential and calculated by the following equation 7 ε r t l n 1 1 c e where r t and ce represent gas constant temperature and equilibrium fluoride concentration respectively a linear plot between lnqe and ε2 was observed with correlation coefficient of 0 95 as shown in fig 11 b kdr and qs values calculated from the slope and intercept of curve are 2 96and 2 42 mg g respectively the free energy of adsorption is calculated by using equation given as follows 8 e 1 2 k d r the value of free energy was obtained in the range 8 16 kj mol and signifies ion exchange mechanism or chemisorption during the adsorption process it is generally observed that value of e 8 kj mol represent the physical adsorption because of the electrostatic interaction between the opposite charges present in the adsorbate and adsorbent 55 in the present study the free energy value was computed to be 0 40 kj mol which suggest that fluoride adsorption on aiac is physical in nature the maximum adsorption capacity obtained is 2 86 mg g on the basis of the above results the proposed adsorption mechanism is shown in fig 12 which depicts the probable mechanism of the addition of alum and corresponding attachment of fluoride ions on the positively charged al and si the mechanism was further confirmed by xps studies the xps scan for the entire range for sample aiac and aiac f is shown in fig 13 a the de convoluted xps curves by fitting to pure gaussian peaks of aiac for carbon 1s is shown in fig 13 b the peak of sp2 carbon is obtained at 284 6 ev additional shoulder peaks at 285 5 286 5 288 4 ev s corresponds to functionalized carbon species although the percentage of sp2 carbon is highest there is significant contribution from other species as well the de convoluted c 1s peak of aiac f sample fig 13c shows a marked decrease in the sp2 carbon and an additional peak at 289 5 ev corresponding to cf this further confirms the adsorption of fluoride onto the adsorbent the al 2p peak for aiac sample obtained at 75 4 ev corresponding to al2o3 as shown in fig 13d shows a slight shift in case of aiac f sample fig 13e finally the de convolution of f 1 s peak of aiac f sample fig 13f gives two peaks at 686 1 and 689 6 ev corresponding to m f al f in the present case and fluoride attached to an organic moiety respectively that can be c or si although ac as such does not adsorb f as depicted in table 3 the impregnation with alumina creates positive polarity and there is a strong probability of fluoride being attached to si which will be still present on the carbon in small amounts and has the tendency to form strong bonds with f 3 3 4 2 temkin isotherm temkin isotherm holds a factor that expresses the effect of indirect interaction of adsorbate and adsorbent on adsorption temkin isotherm assumes that heat of adsorption δhads of all molecule present in a layer decreases linearly rather than logarithmic as the surface coverage increases temkin isotherm is not valid for extremely lower and higher concentration 56 57 the equation of temkin isotherm model is given as follows 9 q e b l n a t b l n c e 10 b r t b t here at denotes the equilibrium binding constant l g and bt denotes the temkin isotherm constant r and t represent the universal gas constant and temperature respectively b represents the constant related to heat of sorption j mole fig 11 c shows that temkin model fits well with the experimental data with correlation coefficient value of 0 97 the slope and intercept of linear plot between qe and ln ce gives the value of constant related to heat of sorption b and temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant at and were computed to be 3 081 and 1 781 respectively heat of sorption indicates that adsorption is physical in nature 58 3 3 5 thermodynamic study effect of temperature on the adsorption of fluoride was studied in the temperature range 13 c 43 c as shown in fig 14 the adsorption capacity increases slightly nearly 5 8 with increase in temperature of 30 c this is probably because temperature assists in the diffusion of fluoride towards the adsorbent it has been reported that higher temperature also modified the surface activity of alumina which enhances the adsorption capacity for fluoride 59 thermodynamic parameters like gibbs free energy δg standard enthalpy δh and standard entropy change δs were calculated using the following equations and given in table 4 11 δ g r t l n k 12 l n k δ s r δ h r 1 t where k is the equilibrium constant ratio of the solid phase concentration of fluoride at equilibrium mg l to the equilibrium concentration in solution mg l 59 r is the gas constant and t is the absolute temperature the increase in fluoride adsorption capacity with temperature further reflects the heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface negative values of δg show the spontaneity of adsorption therefore higher the negative values of δg with increase in temperature the more energetically favorable the adsorption process is further positive value of δs represents the occurrence of structural changes in aiac adsorbent thus the adsorbent is active towards adsorption standard enthalpy δh value shows that the adsorption process is exothermic in nature and therefore increases with temperature 3 3 6 effect of interfering anions different anions like chloride nitrate sulphate phosphate and carbonate may also be present naturally along with fluoride in drinking water and may interfere with the working of the adsorbent hence a study was conducted to find out the effect of these ions on fluoride removal capacity of aiac fluoride concentration was fixed at 10 ppm and concentration of other anions was fixed at 100 ppm as shown in fig 15 the fluoride removal capacity was not affected by chloride and nitrate decreased slightly due to sulfate and phosphate and was affected the most reduced from 95 to 50 due to presence of carbonate this is probably because of competition of carbonate with fluoride for active sites of adsorbent thus fluoride adsorption onto the sorbent is selective in nature and depends upon polarizability size charge and electro negativity differences etc of the co ion 60 3 4 column study the column study is important to access the commercial viability of the adsorbent material as it helps in predicting the adsorption of fluoride other contaminants from contaminated water flowing over a fixed bed of adsorbent it also helps in acquiring certain data that can be used for engineering the commercial water purification columns the column was prepared as described in section 2 5 initially de ionized water was passed through the column to establish the equilibrium between adsorbent and water further the adsorption column was run to investigate the effect of flow rate 5 1 ml min 20 1 ml min and 35 1 ml min on the de fluoridation of water the breakthrough curve is plotted between c co c concentration of fluoride in effluent and co is concentration of fluoride in influent and the volume of water passing through the column 61 as shown in fig 16 a thomas model was applied to describe the adsorption of fluoride by fixed bead column 62 the rate constant and the total sorption capacity were determined and given in table 5 from the data it is clear that while the rate of adsorption is maximum in case of higher flow rates here 35 ml min due to the fast availability of fluoride ions to the adsorbent column the adsorption capacity is maximum at lower flow rates as the contact time between the adsorbent and adsorbate is more the column run with a flow rate of 20 ml min was subjected to regeneration by flowing 250 ml of 0 2 m h2so4 through it at the rate of 10 ml min washing of the column was carried out with de ionized water until its ph came in the range of 6 7 first cycle of the regenerated column gave 2 48 l water below fluoride concentration 1 5 ppm as shown in fig 17 whereas from the 2ndand 3rd cycle 0 52 and 0 47 l water was collected with fluoride within the permissible limit i e 1 5 ppm further column experiments were also conducted with field water obtained from sonepat city haryana india the ph of the water was 8 8 and fluoride concentration was 5 mg l column study was conducted with flow rate of 20 ml min and the fluoride removal capacity of adsorbent with synthetic water and natural water was compared as shown in fig 18 the reduced performance 0 04 mg g of the adsorbent is because at ph 8 8 its adsorption capacity decreases fig 6 further field water may contain other ions with interfere with the working of the adsorbent 3 5 reusability of fluoride adsorbed materials adsorption is one of the most cost effective and easy techniques for fluoride removal from drinking water however it produces a large amount of fluoride contaminated sludge whose disposal is a problem hence an attempt was made to reuse the sludge i e the fluoride adsorbed aiac as filler for developing particle board material to be used in furnishing applications for that a composite was prepared by compression molding of rh ground to obtain a particle size of less than 850 microns and resin mixture this was compared by preparing another sample wherein10 sludge was added to the mix at the cost of rh the process is depicted by a flowchart in fig 19 and the prepared composites are shown in fig 20 a few important properties of the developed particle board material were tested as per standard method is 3087 2005 although both the samples conform to the tests the board containing the carbon sludge showed slightly better properties as shown in table 6 4 conclusions activated carbon from rice husk as such is unable to remove fluoride from water however alumina impregnation not only breaks down the carbon structure thereby creating pores and increasing the overall surface area but also creates positive polarity on the matrix thus increasing the probability of fluoride being attached to si which will be still present on the carbon in small amounts the batch adsorption studies of the aiac adsorbent were conducted while varying the ph adsorbent doses contact time initial fluoride concentrations temperature and interfering ions it followed the second order kinetics model and the intra particle diffusion model supports macro and meso pore diffusion further the d r and temkin isotherm models reveal physical adsorption due to the electrostatic interaction between the opposite charges present in the adsorbate and adsorbent the study therefore reveals that the adsorbent is heterogeneous in nature and multiple processes control the overall adsorption that may be operating simultaneously thermodynamic parameters show spontaneity of reaction while interfering ions study demonstrates that its performance is least affected by other ions except carbonate the column study shows promising results whereby an optimum influent flow rate of 20 ml min demonstrates a high adsorption capacity and reasonable rate of reaction the aiac so formed is a novel material which can remove fluoride to less than 0 4 ppm when the initial concentration of the solution is 10 ppm and can be effectively used as a suitable adsorbent for the population residing in fluoride affected areas declaration of competing interest

14072,drinking water with excessive fluoride concentration 1 mg l has detrimental effect on bones and teeth out of the several de fluoridation methodologies the present study is focused on the adsorption technique rice straw was processed in different ways before converting it into carbon to enhance its fluoride adsorption capacity the adsorbents were subjected to various physico chemical characterizations and adsorption tests alumina impregnated activated carbon aiac was found to be the most efficient adsorbent and further batch adsorption studies column studies and regeneration studies were carried out with the same it follows the second order kinetics model the intra particle diffusion model suggest pore diffusion to be a major contributor along with other processes which may be operating simultaneously the d r and temkin isotherm models reveal physical adsorption due to the electrostatic interaction between the opposite charges present in the adsorbate and adsorbent this has been illustrated through a mechanism and further supported by xps results the adsorbent could effectively remove fluoride to less than 0 4 ppm when the initial fluoride concentration in water was 10 ppm further the fluoride adsorbed aiac was successfully reused as effective filler in developing particle board material keywords activated carbon alumina impregnation fluoride d r isotherm temkin isotherm 1 introduction fluorine has the highest value of electronegativity nearly 3 98 among all the elements in the periodic table and therefore exists as fluoride in nature 1 according to who the permissible limit of fluoride in drinking water is 1 5 mg l 2 whereby it is beneficial for human teeth and bones however its excess ingestion causes severe health issues dental fluorosis due to overexposure especially during the initial growth years is a cosmetic phenomenon skeletal fluorosis due to accumulation of fluoride in bones may cause painful damage and deformation of bones and joints many stretches worldwide are suffering from this dreaded phenomenon including regions of iran kenya turkey iraq tanzania china south africa australia canada thailand saudi arabia new zealand syria egypt jordan and india nearly 20 states of india are affected from dental skeletal fluorosis in a few regions fluoride concentration is as high as 20 mg l 3 fluoride contamination in water occurs from natural and industrial sources naturally fluoride leaches by weathering of rocks into ground water excessive use of agrochemicals like pesticides and phosphatic fertilizers may also cause fluoride contamination by discharge through the soil profile in rural areas installation of deep bore wells for drinking purpose also leads to fluoride inclusions 4 wastes from industries like ceramic and glass industries electroplating mining semiconductor fabrication rubber and fertilizer manufacturing coal fired power station etc 5 6 further worsens the situation several hydrofluoric spills from petroleum refinery like marathan and citgo corpus christi refinery in texas u s and other accidents like the one at gumi city in korea have reportedly led to an accidental increase the fluoride concentration in soil and plants up to 9 79 mg l 7 several fluoride treatment techniques are available with their pros and cons coagulation and precipitation technique can be used for bulk treatments but removes only 18 33 of the fluoride moreover the disposal of the sludge formed creates another issue reverse osmosis and nano filteration techniques though efficient leads to wastage of water and removal of essential minerals electro dialysis technique uses anion exchange resin containing quaternary ammonium functional group for fluoride removal from water ion exchange technique is expensive requires maintenance of ph further the techniques are area specific with performance depending upon the environmental conditions therefore a single technique is not viable at all regions for complete fluoride elimination hence as compared to other techniques adsorption is feasible and cost effective for fluoride removal from drinking water and therefore widely accepted 8 9 different kinds of adsorbents are used in fluoride adsorption including oxide and hydroxide of metals 10 14 biosorbent 15 16 carbon based adsorbent 17 19 clay and layered double hydroxide 20 22 etc biomass based adsorbent are widely used because of their low cost and easy availability activated carbon prepared by chemical treatment such as h3po4 treated peach stone 23 h3po4 treated rice straw and water hyacinth 24 and koh treated cotton stalks 25 have also been used as an adsorbent for removal of toxic dyes activated carbons prepared from different biomass have been tested for de flouridation of water activated carbons prepared from biomass like banana peel 26 coffee husk 26 moringa indica 27 and coconut shell 28 have shown an adsorption capacity of less than 0 5 mg g although the adsorption capacity depends upon a number of parameters more or less the adsorption capacity is very low despite high surface area reported in some cases 28 it is only after impregnation with other metals like al 28 or zr 29 an increase in adsorption capacity is reported rice straw is a waste produced by many countries in asia the disposal of which is a big issue 30 rice husk ash has been widely studied for treating waste water 31 this however involves high temperature treatment with low yield hence activated carbon generated from rice straw has been used for fluoride removal by different research groups activation has been achieved using kmno4 1 koh and naoh 32 acetic acid 33 zncl2 and other salts and co2 34 etc alum is known for its high fluoride removal capacity 35 in nalgonda technique alum and lime are used to precipitate the aluminum fluoride complex 36 rice straw has large amount of silica but is in a bound state and therefore unable to form bonds with fluoride in the present study alumina has been impregnated onto the activated carbon derived from rice straw which creates positive polarity on the matrix mainly carbon along with some silica to enhance its fluoride removal capacity the adsorbent alumina impregnated activated carbon aiac so formed has been characterized for crystal structure morphology and elemental analysis by xrd sem and edx batch adsorption studies were conducted under different experimental condition like varying ph adsorbent doses contact time initial fluoride concentration temperature and interfering ions the adsorbent was found to be thermally stable and perform well from 13 c to 43 c which proves the thermodynamic compatibility of activated carbon and alumina the functionalities present on the surface of activated carbon helps to achieve this compatibility and the proposed mechanism for the attachment of alum on activated carbon has been illustrated chemical modifications functionalizations of the carbon surface have been known to increase their thermodynamic compatibility with other phases 37 different kinetics and isotherm models were applied to the experimental data to infer the most probable mechanism of the reaction further column studies were conducted with different flow rates and the study with the artificial water was compared with the field water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials waste rice straw was collected from sonepat haryana india nahco3 was purchased from merck purified aluminium sulphate al2so4 16h2o and anhydrous sodium carbonate from molychem and sodium hexametaphosphate sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide from fisher scientific standard sodium fluoride solution of 99 9 purity from sigma aldrich has been used for the preparation of fluoride stock solution 2 2 synthesis of the adsorbent materials rice straw was grinded into small pieces these were washed with de ionized water and dried in oven at 100 c these were further ground to pass through 50 100 bs mesh to obtain particles in size ranging from 150 to 300 μm it was then treated in three different ways to obtain three different adsorbents i rice straw was carbonized at 500 c in an inert atmosphere to obtain carbonized rice straw crs ii rice straw was treated with 3 m naoh solution with constant stirring for 8 h the process removes most of the hemi cellulose and silica that binds to the lignin and therefore helps in creating pores in the structure 38 it was then filtered and washed with de ionized water until the ph of the filtrate was neutral naoh treated rice straw was carbonized at 500 c in inert atmosphere to obtain activated carbon ac iii naoh treated rice straw was treated with a solution of 0 8 m alum al2so4 16h2o and 5 nahco3 the suspension was stirred for 6 h filtered and carbonized at 500 c in n2 atmosphere since amorphous alumina is a good adsorbent the carbonization temperature was restricted to avoid crystallization of the alumina it is then washed with di water until the ph value reaches to 6 5 and dried in oven at 80 c to obtain alumina impregnated activated carbon the schematic of the preparation processes is shown in fig 1 2 3 material characterization the adsorbent samples were subjected to various physico chemical characterizations xrd was performed on rikagu powder x ray diffractometer model xrg 2kw using cu kα radiation thermal stability and alum loading in samples were estimated by tga the measurements were carried out on mettler toledo tga dsc 1600 at a constant heating rate of 10 c min in air along with the analysis in the mentioned tga equipment the ash content of the adsorbent samples was determined by gravimetric method and further analyzed for the elemental composition by edax for determining the ash content the different carbon samples were burned in a current of air approximately 0 5 g weighed to nearest 0 01 mg of weighed samples was transferred to the weighed alumina crucible and the final weight of the crucible and adsorbent sample was taken on a calibrated balance after all the weighing the crucibles were kept in desiccators the crucibles without lid were placed in a calibrated muffle furnace with required air circulation taking into account that there was no possibility of sweeping away of the solid particles from the crucibles the furnace was heated under identical conditions as in the tga experiment the crucibles with ash were then removed from the furnace and allowed to cool in the desiccators and weighed the bet surface area was determined by automatic gas sorption system from quantachrome model autosorb iq the surface morphology of the samples was determined using sem model sem evo m 10 determination of point of zero charge was done by rapid titration method the adsorbent was stabilized in different electrolyte solution for 72 h the potentiometric titration was carried out with 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh the zeta potential of the adsorbent was determined by zeta sizer model nano zs90 from malvern instruments at neutral ph and 90 scattering angle to check the surface charge of the adsorbent x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps of samples was performed on xps multilab 2000 spectrometers thermo electron corporation england alkα was used as an x ray source with power of 1485 6 ev 2 4 fluoride adsorption studies fluoride stock solution 1000 mg l was prepared by taking 2 21 g of anhydrous naf in 1000 ml of de ionized water in poly propylene pp regent bottle fluoride solutions of different concentration were prepared by diluting the stock solution with de ionized water all the experiments were performed by taking 25 ml of fluoride solution in 50 ml pp bottle at a temperature of 25 2 c required amount of adsorbent was added to it with continues stirring residual fluoride concentration was detected by thermo scientific orion fluoride ion selective electrode connected to orion star a214 ise ph meter fluoride concentration was determined after mixing total ionic strength adjustment buffer tisab iii in fluoride contaminated water all the experiments were conducted four times and the mean values with standard deviations have been reported the initial fluoride concentration fo and contact time was optimized and fixed at 10 ppm and 3 h respectively it has been demonstrated later in the text section 3 3 3 that 3 h time is enough for reaching the equilibrium the effect of ph was studied at ph values nearly 3 4 5 6 0 7 5 and 9 5 the effect of adsorbent doses was studied in the range 0 5 g l 10 g l at nearly 6 ph kinetic study was conducted by varying the contact time from 1 min to 360 min the effect of temperature on the fluoride adsorption was studied at temperatures ranging from 13 c to 43 c further different kinetics and isotherm models were investigated to fit the experimental data the amount of fluoride adsorbed and fluoride removal efficiency were calculated by the following equations 1 f l u o r i d e a d s o r b e d m g g q e v c o c m 2 f l u o r i d e r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c o c c o 100 where v is the volume of fluoride contaminated water m is mass of adsorbent co and care initial and final fluoride concentration respectively at equilibration 2 5 column regeneration studies continuous flow column study was carried out with aiac as an adsorbent glass column having cross section area 7 cm2 and height 30 cm was used column was packed with 5 g of aiac to obtain a bed height of 3 cm and operated at temperature 27 1 c and ph 7 experiments were conducted to study the effect of flow rates 5 1 ml min 20 1 ml min and 35 1 ml min and also with field water obtained from sonepat haryana the field water had a fluoride content of 5 ppm hence the column studies were also carried out with the same initial fluoride concentration further regeneration studies of the fluoride adsorbed column was carried out using 250 ml of 0 2 m h2so4 solution and results are discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbent materials 3 1 1 thermo gravimetric analysis the tga and dtg curves of the three adsorbent samples are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively from fig 2a the residual content for the crs ac and aiac samples have been computed to be 32 16 and 39 respectively the weight of the ash obtained for the three samples crs ac and aiac with the gravimetric method was found to be 28 12 and 39 respectively which is in close proximity with the tga results as shown in table 1 the residue is mainly sio2 along with small amounts of trace elements in the ashes of crs and ac while the ash of aiac consists of aluminum oxide and small amounts of sio2 the reduction in the residue of ac is the result of treatment with naoh as mentioned in section 2 2 which removes most of the silica in the form of sodium silicate the dtg curve fig 2b shows the relative thermal decomposition in the given temperature range aiac shows higher thermal stability as compared to crs and ac samples the initial weight loss in aiac occurs at around 135 c which is probably due to loss of water molecules chemically bounded to the alum 39 it has been demonstrated that the water leaves the compound in different stages that overlaps beyond the heating rate of 8 c min the lower decomposition temperature of crs 588 c is probably due to the presence of silica which catalyzes the thermal decomposition reaction thus the thermal stability of the samples increases with decreasing silica content 3 1 2 x ray diffraction analysis the x ray diffraction curves of the different adsorbent samples are shown in fig 3 while the different lattice parameters are calculated and shown in table 2 the xrd curve of crs shows a broad peak at around 23 8 corresponding to 002 plane of carbon 40 41 sharp peaks corresponding to 111 and 220 plane of si are also clearly visible 42 the presence of si in the carbon sample probably leads to its large d spacing and crystallite size since a major part of si is removed as nasio3 upon the addition of naoh the peaks of si disappear in ac sample this is further accompanied by breaking down of the carbon structure that leads to a decrease in the crystallite size further addition of alum increases the d spacing of aiac probably due to its diffusion in between the layers of activated carbon however clear peaks of al2o3 are not visible due to its amorphous nature 19 the decrease in the crystallite size suggests that the impregnation process creates pores and breaks the crystallites as is also clear from the sem images fig 4 e f the decrease in crystallite size indicates that the activated carbon is in amorphous range which in turn is good for adsorption 3 1 3 surface morphology and surface area the surface morphology of the three samples crs ac and aiac were studied by sem as shown in fig 4 the natural structure of rice straw acts as a template for the crs sample the structure appears as grooved cylindrical bundles with a definite arrangement throughout the sample as shown in fig 4 a and b it has a low bet surface area of 20 m2 g the surface area of ac 33 m2 g increases only slightly as compared to crs which is due to the removal of silicon compounds by treatment with naoh the process opens up the cylindrical bundles as shown in fig 4 c and d no substantial porosity as such is visible at this stage which is also reflected from the low value of bet surface area further reaction with alum followed by heat treatment not only impregnates it with alumina which is visible as the shinning portion in fig 4 e and f but also creates porosity on the surface of activated carbon the surface area of aiac increases to 151 m2 g which indicates that the process of alum impregnation further activates the sample by creating pores and breaking down the material as also indicated by the lower crystallite size reflected by the xrd data nonetheless the surface area of ac and aiac is less owing to the fact that the treatment with naoh for silica removal creates macropores that do not contribute much to the increase in surface area 3 1 4 point of zero charge and zeta potential point of zero charge of the adsorbent aiac was determined by rapid titration method with 0 1 n nacl solution and titrated with 0 1 n hcl and 0 1 n naoh solution fig 5 shows the plot of final ph with the consumed acid and base in which two points of intersection are observed at ph values around 4 and 8 6 the phpzc at 4 is probably due to the activated carbon 43 whereas at higher side i e around 8 6 is due to the alumina impregnated onto the carbon hence during the adsorption process due to the strong influence of phpzc the ph of the solution seems to lie in between ph 4 and 8 6 and mostly set at around ph values 6 1 the zeta potential analysis result at neutral ph shows that the potential of the surface of the aiac adsorbent is positive i e 10 8 mv which further confirms that the adsorbent favors anion adsorption and is therefore feasible for fluoride adsorption 3 2 selection of suitable adsorbent the preliminary adsorption tests were conducted with all the three adsorbents with adsorbent dose 4 g l and fo 10 mg l table 3 shows that crs and ac samples did not show any activity towards fluoride removal this clearly shows that si present in the above samples is in bound state and unable to form bonds with fluoride aiac sample works effectively owing to the presence of alumina which is not only an effective fluoride adsorbent but also polarizes the carbon matrix and si present in it thus inducing it in fluoride adsorption detailed mechanism is shown later in the text the increase in porosity and surface area further assist the adsorption process 3 3 batch adsorption studies on the basis of above result the further batch adsorption studies were carried out with aiac samples 3 3 1 effect of ph effect of ph was observed on removal of fluoride from contaminated water having initial fluoride concentration 10 ppm by using adsorbent doses 4 g l contact time 3 h and temperature 26 1 c and is shown in fig 6 a variation of 0 25 in the ph values was obtained while adjusting the ph for the four different readings of a given sample which was done using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl the reduced fluoride adsorption capacity at lower ph was probably due to formation of weak hydrofluoric acid 35 fluoride adsorption reached maxima at ph 6 1 whereby nearly 94 fluoride removal was observed as ph was further increased fluoride removal decreased this is probably due to competition of hydroxide ion with fluoride for active sites of adsorbent 4 aiac hence proved to be a good adsorbent because there is no requirement of maintaining the ph of drinking water by using acids and bases 3 3 2 effect of adsorbent doses the effect of adsorbent doses on fluoride removal is shown in fig 7 with increase in adsorbent doses from 0 5 g l to 4 g l fluoride removal efficiency increases sharply from 40 to a maximum of 94 93 this was due to the increased availability of active sites for fluoride adsorption as the dosage is further increased to 10 g l the efficiency remains almost the same however the amount of fluoride adsorbed per unit adsorbent weight decreases with increasing adsorbent dose it occurs so because the adsorptive capacity of adsorbent available could not be fully exploited at higher adsorbent doses probably due to its aggregation in comparison to when lower doses are used there is also a possibility that the material has heterogeneous distribution of active sites as a consequence increasing mass does not give a proportional increase in the adsorption capacity fig 8 depicts the variation in the distribution coefficient kd with adsorbent doses kd is defined as the ratio of the equilibrium concentrations of a substance adsorbed onto a solid sorbent to that dissolved in a liquid phase the maximum value of kd at an adsorbent dosage of 4 6 g l signifies maximum removal efficiency at these doses the variation in kd with varying adsorbent doses signifies that the surface of aiac is heterogeneous for fluoride adsorption 3 3 3 kinetic study the kinetic study is important in determining the efficiency of adsorbent by providing the rate of adsorption and is also useful in determining the mechanism of adsorption the time required for reaching the adsorption equilibrium was determined by varying the contact time from 1 min to 6 h at fo 10 ppm ph 6 1 1 and temperature 26 1 c as shown in fig 9 a nearly 91 16 fluoride removal was achieved within 10 min different kinetic models were simulated with this experimental data the pseudo first order kinetic model did not fit the experimental data and was therefore nullified 3 3 3 1 pseudo second order kinetic model the pseudo second order kinetics model was used to fit the experimental data which is given by the following equation 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qt and qe are the adsorption capacities at time t and at equilibrium respectively k2 is second order rate constant the slope of the curve between t qt and t gives the adsorption capacity at equilibrium whereas the intercept gives the value of rate constant k2 pseudo second order equation fitted well with the experimental data with the correlation coefficient of 0 999 as shown in fig 9 b adsorption capacity at equilibrium and the rate constant was computed to be 2 386 mg g and 0 694 respectively hence the rate of adsorption is fast and adsorption depends on both the nature of adsorbent and the adsorbate the result further suggests that the adsorbed molecule is probably attached to two active sites of the adsorbent these sites may be the pores of the polarized ac and the alumina particles attached to it 3 3 3 2 intra particle diffusion model the overall adsorption process consists of different steps in a stirred batch the diffusive mass transfer can be correlated by a diffusion coefficient that can fit the experimental sorption rate data generally a process is diffusion controlled if its rate depends on the rate at which components diffuse towards one another the possibility of intra particle diffusion was explored by using the intra particle diffusion model 1 44 given by weber and morris according to which the amount adsorbed at time tis given by 4 q t k i d t 0 5 c where kid is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g min1 2 and c mg g is a constant related to the thickness of the boundary layer larger the value of c the greater is the boundary layer effect 45 if the weber morris 46 plot of qt versus t0 5 gives a straight line then the sorption process is controlled by intra particle diffusion only fig 9 c exhibits multi linear plots for the aiac sample which indicates that the adsorbent is heterogeneous in nature and apart from diffusion other processes also control the overall adsorption which may be operating simultaneously 47 the initial straight line depicts meso pore and macro pore diffusion the line passes close to the origin indicates that the macro and meso pore diffusion contributes significantly to the adsorption process the second straight line gives micropore diffusion 48 from the curve it is clear that microspore diffusion contributes scarcely to the adsorption process further the large deviation of straight line from the origin is probably due to the difference in rate of mass transfer in the initial and final stages of adsorption 45 the last step depicts gradual adsorption of fluoride on the adsorbent 49 hence adsorption takes place majorly by pore diffusion surface adsorption and electrostatic interactions being other contributors 50 this was further proved by energy dispersive x ray edx study carried out for the elemental analysis of as prepared aiac and fluoride adsorbed aiac fig 10 a b shows the sem of different part of aiac i e non porous and porous parts respectively along with their edx results edx of both parts of aiac revealed the presence of al c o si and s sem of the non porous and porous parts of fluoride adsorbed aiac aiac f is shown in fig 10 c d edx of porous part shows the presence of fluoride along with the principle element like al c o s and si while that of non pores part shows absence of fluoride this result further justifies that pore diffusion contributes majorly to the adsorption 3 3 3 3 elovich model the elovich equation is generally used for describing activated chemisorptions 51 and the amount adsorbed at any time t is given by the following equation 5 q t β ln α β l n t where α denotes the initial sorption rate mg g 1 min 1 and β denotes the desorption constant between any experiments it has also been used successfully to describe second order kinetics assuming that the actual solid surfaces are primarily energetically heterogeneous the equation however does not propose any definite mechanism for adsorbate adsorbent 52 54 the fitting of elovich model given in fig 9 d shows a correlation coefficient of 0 93 this although significant is much lower as compared to that obtained in case of pseudo second order kinetic model d r isotherm and temkin isotherm model as will be shown later 3 3 4 isotherm study the adsorption capacity of the composite sample aiac was studied by varying the concentration of fluoride in the adsorbate solution from 1 mg l to 50 mg l as shown in fig 11 a fluoride removal capacity of the adsorbent increases with increasing concentration of fluoride adsorption capacity of 10 mg g was obtained when the initial fluoride concentration is 50 mg l different theoretical isotherms models were used to simulate the experimental data the langmuir model and did not simulate with experimental data so the possibility of monolayer and homogenous adsorption of fluoride on adsorbent surface is ruled out further the inability of the freundlich model to fit the experimental data discards the possibility of multilayer and heterogeneous adsorption of adsorbate onto the adsorbent surface 3 3 4 1 dubinin radushkevich isotherm dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm provides information about adsorption energy and mechanism involved in adsorption the equation for which is written as 6 ln q e ln q s k d r ε 2 where qs is the adsorption capacity and kdr is the constant corresponds to the adsorption energy ε denotes the polanyi potential and calculated by the following equation 7 ε r t l n 1 1 c e where r t and ce represent gas constant temperature and equilibrium fluoride concentration respectively a linear plot between lnqe and ε2 was observed with correlation coefficient of 0 95 as shown in fig 11 b kdr and qs values calculated from the slope and intercept of curve are 2 96and 2 42 mg g respectively the free energy of adsorption is calculated by using equation given as follows 8 e 1 2 k d r the value of free energy was obtained in the range 8 16 kj mol and signifies ion exchange mechanism or chemisorption during the adsorption process it is generally observed that value of e 8 kj mol represent the physical adsorption because of the electrostatic interaction between the opposite charges present in the adsorbate and adsorbent 55 in the present study the free energy value was computed to be 0 40 kj mol which suggest that fluoride adsorption on aiac is physical in nature the maximum adsorption capacity obtained is 2 86 mg g on the basis of the above results the proposed adsorption mechanism is shown in fig 12 which depicts the probable mechanism of the addition of alum and corresponding attachment of fluoride ions on the positively charged al and si the mechanism was further confirmed by xps studies the xps scan for the entire range for sample aiac and aiac f is shown in fig 13 a the de convoluted xps curves by fitting to pure gaussian peaks of aiac for carbon 1s is shown in fig 13 b the peak of sp2 carbon is obtained at 284 6 ev additional shoulder peaks at 285 5 286 5 288 4 ev s corresponds to functionalized carbon species although the percentage of sp2 carbon is highest there is significant contribution from other species as well the de convoluted c 1s peak of aiac f sample fig 13c shows a marked decrease in the sp2 carbon and an additional peak at 289 5 ev corresponding to cf this further confirms the adsorption of fluoride onto the adsorbent the al 2p peak for aiac sample obtained at 75 4 ev corresponding to al2o3 as shown in fig 13d shows a slight shift in case of aiac f sample fig 13e finally the de convolution of f 1 s peak of aiac f sample fig 13f gives two peaks at 686 1 and 689 6 ev corresponding to m f al f in the present case and fluoride attached to an organic moiety respectively that can be c or si although ac as such does not adsorb f as depicted in table 3 the impregnation with alumina creates positive polarity and there is a strong probability of fluoride being attached to si which will be still present on the carbon in small amounts and has the tendency to form strong bonds with f 3 3 4 2 temkin isotherm temkin isotherm holds a factor that expresses the effect of indirect interaction of adsorbate and adsorbent on adsorption temkin isotherm assumes that heat of adsorption δhads of all molecule present in a layer decreases linearly rather than logarithmic as the surface coverage increases temkin isotherm is not valid for extremely lower and higher concentration 56 57 the equation of temkin isotherm model is given as follows 9 q e b l n a t b l n c e 10 b r t b t here at denotes the equilibrium binding constant l g and bt denotes the temkin isotherm constant r and t represent the universal gas constant and temperature respectively b represents the constant related to heat of sorption j mole fig 11 c shows that temkin model fits well with the experimental data with correlation coefficient value of 0 97 the slope and intercept of linear plot between qe and ln ce gives the value of constant related to heat of sorption b and temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant at and were computed to be 3 081 and 1 781 respectively heat of sorption indicates that adsorption is physical in nature 58 3 3 5 thermodynamic study effect of temperature on the adsorption of fluoride was studied in the temperature range 13 c 43 c as shown in fig 14 the adsorption capacity increases slightly nearly 5 8 with increase in temperature of 30 c this is probably because temperature assists in the diffusion of fluoride towards the adsorbent it has been reported that higher temperature also modified the surface activity of alumina which enhances the adsorption capacity for fluoride 59 thermodynamic parameters like gibbs free energy δg standard enthalpy δh and standard entropy change δs were calculated using the following equations and given in table 4 11 δ g r t l n k 12 l n k δ s r δ h r 1 t where k is the equilibrium constant ratio of the solid phase concentration of fluoride at equilibrium mg l to the equilibrium concentration in solution mg l 59 r is the gas constant and t is the absolute temperature the increase in fluoride adsorption capacity with temperature further reflects the heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface negative values of δg show the spontaneity of adsorption therefore higher the negative values of δg with increase in temperature the more energetically favorable the adsorption process is further positive value of δs represents the occurrence of structural changes in aiac adsorbent thus the adsorbent is active towards adsorption standard enthalpy δh value shows that the adsorption process is exothermic in nature and therefore increases with temperature 3 3 6 effect of interfering anions different anions like chloride nitrate sulphate phosphate and carbonate may also be present naturally along with fluoride in drinking water and may interfere with the working of the adsorbent hence a study was conducted to find out the effect of these ions on fluoride removal capacity of aiac fluoride concentration was fixed at 10 ppm and concentration of other anions was fixed at 100 ppm as shown in fig 15 the fluoride removal capacity was not affected by chloride and nitrate decreased slightly due to sulfate and phosphate and was affected the most reduced from 95 to 50 due to presence of carbonate this is probably because of competition of carbonate with fluoride for active sites of adsorbent thus fluoride adsorption onto the sorbent is selective in nature and depends upon polarizability size charge and electro negativity differences etc of the co ion 60 3 4 column study the column study is important to access the commercial viability of the adsorbent material as it helps in predicting the adsorption of fluoride other contaminants from contaminated water flowing over a fixed bed of adsorbent it also helps in acquiring certain data that can be used for engineering the commercial water purification columns the column was prepared as described in section 2 5 initially de ionized water was passed through the column to establish the equilibrium between adsorbent and water further the adsorption column was run to investigate the effect of flow rate 5 1 ml min 20 1 ml min and 35 1 ml min on the de fluoridation of water the breakthrough curve is plotted between c co c concentration of fluoride in effluent and co is concentration of fluoride in influent and the volume of water passing through the column 61 as shown in fig 16 a thomas model was applied to describe the adsorption of fluoride by fixed bead column 62 the rate constant and the total sorption capacity were determined and given in table 5 from the data it is clear that while the rate of adsorption is maximum in case of higher flow rates here 35 ml min due to the fast availability of fluoride ions to the adsorbent column the adsorption capacity is maximum at lower flow rates as the contact time between the adsorbent and adsorbate is more the column run with a flow rate of 20 ml min was subjected to regeneration by flowing 250 ml of 0 2 m h2so4 through it at the rate of 10 ml min washing of the column was carried out with de ionized water until its ph came in the range of 6 7 first cycle of the regenerated column gave 2 48 l water below fluoride concentration 1 5 ppm as shown in fig 17 whereas from the 2ndand 3rd cycle 0 52 and 0 47 l water was collected with fluoride within the permissible limit i e 1 5 ppm further column experiments were also conducted with field water obtained from sonepat city haryana india the ph of the water was 8 8 and fluoride concentration was 5 mg l column study was conducted with flow rate of 20 ml min and the fluoride removal capacity of adsorbent with synthetic water and natural water was compared as shown in fig 18 the reduced performance 0 04 mg g of the adsorbent is because at ph 8 8 its adsorption capacity decreases fig 6 further field water may contain other ions with interfere with the working of the adsorbent 3 5 reusability of fluoride adsorbed materials adsorption is one of the most cost effective and easy techniques for fluoride removal from drinking water however it produces a large amount of fluoride contaminated sludge whose disposal is a problem hence an attempt was made to reuse the sludge i e the fluoride adsorbed aiac as filler for developing particle board material to be used in furnishing applications for that a composite was prepared by compression molding of rh ground to obtain a particle size of less than 850 microns and resin mixture this was compared by preparing another sample wherein10 sludge was added to the mix at the cost of rh the process is depicted by a flowchart in fig 19 and the prepared composites are shown in fig 20 a few important properties of the developed particle board material were tested as per standard method is 3087 2005 although both the samples conform to the tests the board containing the carbon sludge showed slightly better properties as shown in table 6 4 conclusions activated carbon from rice husk as such is unable to remove fluoride from water however alumina impregnation not only breaks down the carbon structure thereby creating pores and increasing the overall surface area but also creates positive polarity on the matrix thus increasing the probability of fluoride being attached to si which will be still present on the carbon in small amounts the batch adsorption studies of the aiac adsorbent were conducted while varying the ph adsorbent doses contact time initial fluoride concentrations temperature and interfering ions it followed the second order kinetics model and the intra particle diffusion model supports macro and meso pore diffusion further the d r and temkin isotherm models reveal physical adsorption due to the electrostatic interaction between the opposite charges present in the adsorbate and adsorbent the study therefore reveals that the adsorbent is heterogeneous in nature and multiple processes control the overall adsorption that may be operating simultaneously thermodynamic parameters show spontaneity of reaction while interfering ions study demonstrates that its performance is least affected by other ions except carbonate the column study shows promising results whereby an optimum influent flow rate of 20 ml min demonstrates a high adsorption capacity and reasonable rate of reaction the aiac so formed is a novel material which can remove fluoride to less than 0 4 ppm when the initial concentration of the solution is 10 ppm and can be effectively used as a suitable adsorbent for the population residing in fluoride affected areas declaration of competing interest

14073,in this study the effect of the addition of powdered activated carbon pac to sulfur based carrier for autotrophic denitrification was evaluated on the removal efficiency of nitrate in mbr process for advanced wastewater treatment without any external organic carbon source as a result of the comparative experiment with pac 0 and 15 carrier the removal efficiency of no3 n was enhanced up to 3 by adding pac to the carrier based on the results the carrier was injected every seven day with 10 of reactor volume during the operating period of 30 days the removal of t n was 72 7 and 31 8 for the operating condition with and without the carrier respectively in the long term mbr experiments which was operated with the addition of the carrier to anoxic tank day by day the tendency of t n removal was relatively stable the removal of t n was observed at 55 80 and 19 73 for with and without the carrier respectively based from the results it was obvious that the removal of t n was enhanced to around 40 by adding the sulfur based carrier into mbr system the present study exhibited relatively good efficiencies so that the sulfur based carrier will be applied for a pilot experiment keywords sulfur based carrier powdered activated carbon membrane bioreactor nitrogen removal denitrification 1 introduction as the water quality a standard of the nitrogen in the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant is getting continuously strengthened development of practical treatment technology for high quality treatment becomes increasingly important 1 the discharge of nitrogen containing sewage or waste water not only adversely affects aquatic ecosystems such as eutrophication dissolved oxygen depletion but also poses risks to human health and living environment such as methemoglobinemia epa defined the maximum contaminant level mcl of drinking water of nitrate as 10 mg l 2 the biological treatment processes for the removal of nitrogen from contaminated nitrate containing groundwater are considered to be environmentally friendly and economical processes because it utilizes microbial metabolism unlike the physicochemical treatment processes in which nitrogen are removed by injecting a chemical 3 4 several biological treatment processes for nitrogen removal have been studied including mle modified ludzack ettinger a2 o anaerobic anoxic oxic and uct university of cape town 5 7 such processes require a large area and particularly in the case of sewage having a low c n ratio it takes a lot of energy to supply oxygen necessary for nitrification and requires an external carbon source such as methanol to be added 8 recently to overcome these problems an advanced treatment processes using autotrophic denitrification which use hydrogen iron sulfur or the like as an electron donor is attracting attention among them sulfur s based autotrophic denitrifiers utilize sulfur as their electron donor inorganic carbon such as hco3 as a carbon source and nitrate as a final electron acceptor the stoichiometric formula is as shown in the following equation 9 1 no3 1 11s 0 4co2 0 76h2o 0 08nh4 0 5n2 1 1so4 2 1 28h 0 08c5h7o2n this process does not require an external carbon source such as methanol and can be economically and effectively denitrified due to a small amount of sludge generated thus researches on sulfur utilizing denitrification are actively under way 10 batchelor and lawrence 11 suggested that sulfur particles are more suitable than dissolved sulfur compounds in terms of economic efficiency ease of handling and low toxicity 12 however existing techniques using sulfur are difficult to attach denitrifying bacteria and weak in strength so new types of carriers and systems need to be developed 13 in this study we have tried to improve the nitrate removal rate by manufacturing sulfur based carrier and the effect of addition of powdered activated carbon pac having a large specific surface area on denitrification was investigated 2 materials methods 2 1 preparation of sulfur based carrier the sulfur based carrier was prepared by mixing powdered sulfur s to provide an electron donor calcium carbonate caco3 samchun chemicals republic of korea to supplement alkalinity and powdered activated carbon pac norit netherlands according to the mixing ratios shown in table 1 sodium silicate water glass young il chemical co ltd republic of korea was uniformly mixed with the sulfur mixture at a ratio of 1 1 dried at 105 c for 40 h and crushed to a size of 3 5 mm the figure of the prepared carrier is shown in fig 1 the pac was stirred for 24 h with distilled water prior to use and then dried at 105 c for 24 h 14 the ratio of pac to sulfur was set at 0 3 5 10 15 and 20 to investigate the effect of pac addition on denitrification efficiency of the carrier 2 2 optimization of pac concentration after mixing 1 l of liquid medium with activated sludge 1 4 g of each of the six carriers prepared above were put in the same amount so that the amount of sulfur was 0 84 g and the mixture was stirred at 40 rpm using jar tester 15 then no3 n ph and do were measured every 24 h to observe the removal rate of nitrate the sludge which was taken from a sewage treatment plant was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20 min before the experiment the concentration of mlss was adjusted to 2500 mg l the composition of the synthetic wastewater is shown in table 2 2 3 comparison of removal rates with and without pac after mixing 1 l of the liquid medium shown in table 2 and activated sludge 1 4 g of the carrier prepared with the optimum pac concentration and the carrier without pac were added and stirred at 40 rpm to compare the removal rate of nitrate likewise the activated sludge was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20 min and the mlss concentration was then measured at 2500 mg l no3 n no2 n nh3 n t n and so4 2 were measured by sampling every 24 h 2 4 set up of membrane bioreactor mbr the experimental setup used in this study is shown in fig 2 the mbr system was configured in the order of anoxic tank anaerobic tank and aerobic tank the capacity of the system was designed to treat wastewater of 0 01 m3 day the total volume of the reactors was 4 5 l including anoxic anaerobic and oxic basins of 1 l 1 l and 2 5 l respectively total hrt was 10 h each anoxic anaerobic and oxic tank of 2 h 2 h and 6 h the influent was introduced into the anoxic tank and discharged to the oxic tank and internal recycle ratio was 1 5q the membranes used in the mbr process are c pvc submersible membrane with membrane pores of 0 4 μm pure envitech the operation of the mbr process for this study was carried out under the following conditions the mlss of both reactors was maintained at about 3000 5000 mg l one cycle of mbr operation

90 mg l respectively influent properties of the synthetic wastewater are listed in table 3 in this study the sulfur carrier was used in mbr 1 and mbr 2 was used without using external carbon source

oxic tank were measured 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of pac concentration by batch experiments in fig 3 experimental results show that the removal of nitrate increases by addition of pac to the carrier the initial concentration of no3 n was 100 mg l which showed a removal rate of more than 10 after 5 days among them the removal rate was the highest at 13 6 when the ratio of pac to sulfur was 15 when the pac concentration was higher than 15 the removal rate of nitrate decreased compared to lower pac concentrations this is probably because the surface area of sulfur to which sulfur utilizing autotrophic denitrifying microorganisms adhered and grown decreased when pac was added above a certain ratio 18 using the results of batch experiments the optimum pac concentration was determined to be 15 3 2 efficiency of denitrification by the carriers under different conditions according to eq 1 sulfur utilizing autotrophic denitrification produces 1 28 mol of hydrogen ion per mole of nitrate consuming alkalinity and decreasing ph when the alkalinity is insufficient the optimum ph of the sulfur oxidizing denitrifying microorganism is deviated from 7 5 to 8 and the denitrification efficiency is remarkably decreased 19 however in this experiment alkalinity was sufficiently supplied by the dissociation of caco3 added during the preparation of the carrier so that the ph was maintained at an appropriate level fig 4 a the results of the batch experiment for 5 days to compare the denitrification efficiency of the sulfur based carrier with and without pac are shown in fig 4 b the initial concentration of no3 n was 96 5 mg l after 5 days no3 n was measured to be 89 2 mg l when pac was not added and the denitrification efficiency was 7 56 also when pac was added no3 n was measured to be 86 4 mg l and the denitrification efficiency was 10 47 therefore the denitrification efficiency was increased by 2 91 by the addition of pac according to eq 1 when 1 g of no3 n is removed during sulfur utilizing denitrification 7 54 g of so4 2 is generated however the amount of sulfate generated in this experiment was 6 25 g for the carrier without pac and 6 52 g for the carrier with pac which was smaller than the theoretical value of 7 54 g fig 4 c it is considered that the amount of nitrate removed by denitrification by other microorganisms existing in activated sludge is increased also as shown in the following equation eq 2 since a part of so4 2 was converted to caso4 which is an insoluble salt the amount of so4 2 is thought to be lower than the theoretical value 2 6kno3 5s 2caco3 3k2so4 2caso4 2co2 3n2 the reaction rate which is constant k was calculated assuming three types of denitrification reaction and so4 2 generation reaction as 0 1 2 and 1 st order reaction as a result the denitrification reaction was close to the first order reaction regardless of pac content and so4 2 generation reaction was also found to be closest to the zero order reaction regardless of pac thus as sikora and keeney have argued sulfur utilizing denitrification in this the experiment showed a first order reaction 20 according to eq 1 if the denitrification is the first order reaction the formation reaction of so4 2 should be the first reaction in accordance to eq 2 it is considered that the reaction is closer to the zero order reaction due to the effect of caso4 produced by the reaction of so4 2 and ca2 18 the k value of the denitrification reaction as the first order reaction was 0 0143 day when pac was not added and 0 0229 day when pac was added and the k value of generated so4 2 by the zero order reaction was 26 571 mg l day when pac was not added and 34 mg l day when pac was added 3 3 removal of nitrogen and organics by the sulfur based denitrification mbr process 3 3 1 nitrogen removal at the carrier disappearance cycle in this study mbr 1 with pac sulfur carrier and mbr 2 without pac sulfur carrier were operated for 30 days an average concentration of 38 mg t n l in the influent and an average concentration of 9 97 mg l and 26 5 mg l were observed in the effluent from mbr 1 and mbr 2 respectively in fig 5 the removal efficiency increased by about 40 from 31 8 to 72 7 due to the role of the sulfur carrier a possible reason of low t n removal rate at the mbr without the carrier seems to be the inhibition of denitrification rate due to the low c n ratio of artificial sewage it took about 11 days for the carrier to completely disappear after the first addition of the carrier into the reactor the nitrogen removal performance was evaluated 4 times at the addition interval of about 7 days before the carrier disappeared completely it was also observed that the concentration of t n increased as the carrier disappears by utilization 3 3 2 nitrogen removal at the feeding period of carrier for the comparison to the first experiment the addition interval of the carrier was changed from 7 days to everyday with a different dosage of the carrier in mbr 2 for a total experiment time of 62 days the mbr 2 was operated with no addition of the carrier for the first period of 31 days and then with the carrier of 10 v v volume of anoxic tank for the second period from 32th to 45th day and then with that of 20 for the last period from 46th to 62th day while the mbr 1 was operated without the carrier for the whole period average t n concentration 16 6 mg l and 30 2 mg l were observed in the effluent from mbr 1 and mbr 2 about 55 8 and 19 7 removal efficacy compared to average t n concentration of 37 3 mg l in the influent as shown in fig 6 the effluent t n concentration in the mbr 2 deceased as the addition of the carrier increased while the mbr 1 showed the stable concentration the results of t n nh3 n no2 n no3 n of the effluent have been also checked after 14 days of experiment time most of the t n was nitrified over 95 to no3 n and then denitrification occurred up to 60 as shown in figure s1 no3 n of the mbr 1 was lower concentration than that of the mbr 2 based on the results the sulfur based carrier was also helpful to remove no3 n 3 3 3 removal of organics by the sulfur based denitrification mbr process based from the results of the second experiment average concentration of cod was observed at 6 85 mg l and 4 85 mg l in the effluent from mbr 1 and mbr 2 about 95 6 and 95 9 removal efficacy respectively compared to average concentration of 150 mg l in the influent fig 7 a for doc average effluent concentration of 3 0 mg l was observed from both mbr 1 and mbr 2 about 96 removal efficacy for both mbr with an average concentration of 72 8 mg l in the influent fig 7 b based on the removal efficiency in cod and doc organic matter was well removed by the mbr system regardless of sulfur carrier which means that the sulfur carrier has no effect on the organic removal 3 4 variations of so4 2 concentration by the sulfur carrier in mbr process so4 2 was produced as a by product when nitrate nitrogen was treated with sulfur denitrification so4 2 concentration was measured to check whether sulfur denitrification was occurring smoothly compared to an average concentration of 20 2 mg so4 2 l in the influent an average concentration of 66 6 mg l in the effluent was observed from mbr 2 applied with the carrier of 10 volume of anoxic tank as shown in fig 8 moreover an average concentration of 96 3 mg l in the effluent was observed with the carrier of 20 on the other hand the mbr 1 showed the same level of concentration as in the influent according to the sulfur denitrification formula 7 54 g of so4 2 should be produced for 1 g of nitrate nitrogen however in actual experiments 4 18 g so4 2 was produced when 10 carrier was added to the anoxic tank and 4 6 g of so4 2 was generated when 20 carrier was added to the anoxic tank from the experimental results it was clear that nitrate consumption rate was higher than so4 2 production rate it can be thought that there will be another mechanism working in denitrification of nitrate other than sulfur denitrification reaction one of the constituent substances sodium alginate reacts with caco3 to form calcium alginate it seems that the nitrogen is removed by coagulated and precipitated through the chelate bonds of calcium alginate and no3 the structure of calcium nitro alginate is shown in fig 9 4 concluding remarks in the present study to improve the removal rate of nitrate carrier using sulfur utilizing autotrophic denitrification was prepared and the removal rate was evaluated additionally the effect of the sulfur based carrier was examined on the denitrification of nitrate in mbr process for advanced wastewater treatment the caco3 added in preparing the carriers was dissociated and the ph was stably maintained by supplementing the alkalinity the denitrification efficiency was increased by adding the pac having a large specific surface area at this time the ratio of pac to sulfur was found to be optimal at 15 the amount of so4 2 produced per no3 n removed is smaller than the stoichiometric value due to the denitrification of other microorganisms or the generation of caso4 an insoluble salt the denitrification was observed in the first order reaction the rate constant k was 0 0229 day when pac was added and 0 0143 day without pac the generation of so4 2 was close to the zero order reaction the rate constant k was 34 mg l day when pac was added and 26 571 mg l day without pac in the sulfur based denitrification mbr process the removal of t n was enhanced by around 40 in the mbr system with the carrier volume of 10 of oxic tank volume the removal efficiency of t n increased furthermore while the concentration of sulfate also increased in the effluent as the dosage of the carrier increased it was clear that autotrophic denitrification was successfully carried out by using the sulfur based carrier in mbr system without any additional carbon source from outside the use of carrier to the other biological wastewater treatment processes will be also helpful for the further treatment of nitrogen economically and efficiently the fact that the carrier completely disappeared within a certain period means that no other post treatment of disposal is needed when the role of carrier finished and it was meaningful that the carrier has an additional role other than the supplier of sulfur based on the result that the stoichiometric consumption rate of nitrate was higher than the production rate of sulfate further study including the enhancement of the configuration of the carrier and the application of the carrier to the various treatment processes is required for practical use of the carrier acknowledgement this research was

efficiency increased by about 40 from 31 8 to 72 7 due to the role of the sulfur carrier a possible reason of low t n removal rate at the mbr without the carrier seems to be the inhibition of denitrification rate due to the low c n ratio of artificial sewage it took about 11 days for the carrier to completely disappear after the first addition of the carrier into the reactor the nitrogen removal performance was evaluated 4 times at the addition interval of about 7 days before the carrier disappeared completely it was also observed that the concentration of t n increased as the carrier disappears by utilization 3 3 2 nitrogen removal at the feeding period of carrier for the comparison to the first experiment the addition interval of the carrier was changed from 7 days to everyday with a different dosage of the carrier in mbr 2 for a total experiment time of 62 days the mbr 2 was operated with no addition of the carrier for the first period of 31 days and then with the carrier of 10 v v volume of anoxic tank for the second period from 32th to 45th day and then with that of 20 for the last period from 46th to 62th day while the mbr 1 was operated without the carrier for the whole period average t n concentration 16 6 mg l and 30 2 mg l were observed in the effluent from mbr 1 and mbr 2 about 55 8 and 19 7 removal efficacy compared to average t n concentration of 37 3 mg l in the influent as shown in fig 6 the effluent t n concentration in the mbr 2 deceased as the addition of the carrier increased while the mbr 1 showed the stable concentration the results of t n nh3 n no2 n no3 n of the effluent have been also checked after 14 days of experiment time most of the t n was nitrified over 95 to no3 n and then denitrification occurred up to 60 as shown in figure s1 no3 n of the mbr 1 was lower concentration than that of the mbr 2 based on the results the sulfur based carrier was also helpful to remove no3 n 3 3 3 removal of organics by the sulfur based denitrification mbr process based from the results of the second experiment average concentration of cod was observed at 6 85 mg l and 4 85 mg l in the effluent from mbr 1 and mbr 2 about 95 6 and 95 9 removal efficacy respectively compared to average concentration of 150 mg l in the influent fig 7 a for doc average effluent concentration of 3 0 mg l was observed from both mbr 1 and mbr 2 about 96 removal efficacy for both mbr with an average concentration of 72 8 mg l in the influent fig 7 b based on the removal efficiency in cod and doc organic matter was well removed by the mbr system regardless of sulfur carrier which means that the sulfur carrier has no effect on the organic removal 3 4 variations of so4 2 concentration by the sulfur carrier in mbr process so4 2 was produced as a by product when nitrate nitrogen was treated with sulfur denitrification so4 2 concentration was measured to check whether sulfur denitrification was occurring smoothly compared to an average concentration of 20 2 mg so4 2 l in the influent an average concentration of 66 6 mg l in the effluent was observed from mbr 2 applied with the carrier of 10 volume of anoxic tank as shown in fig 8 moreover an average concentration of 96 3 mg l in the effluent was observed with the carrier of 20 on the other hand the mbr 1 showed the same level of concentration as in the influent according to the sulfur denitrification formula 7 54 g of so4 2 should be produced for 1 g of nitrate nitrogen however in actual experiments 4 18 g so4 2 was produced when 10 carrier was added to the anoxic tank and 4 6 g of so4 2 was generated when 20 carrier was added to the anoxic tank from the experimental results it was clear that nitrate consumption rate was higher than so4 2 production rate it can be thought that there will be another mechanism working in denitrification of nitrate other than sulfur denitrification reaction one of the constituent substances sodium alginate reacts with caco3 to form calcium alginate it seems that the nitrogen is removed by coagulated and precipitated through the chelate bonds of calcium alginate and no3 the structure of calcium nitro alginate is shown in fig 9 4 concluding remarks in the present study to improve the removal rate of nitrate carrier using sulfur utilizing autotrophic denitrification was prepared and the removal rate was evaluated additionally the effect of the sulfur based carrier was examined on the denitrification of nitrate in mbr process for advanced wastewater treatment the caco3 added in preparing the carriers was dissociated and the ph was stably maintained by supplementing the alkalinity the denitrification efficiency was increased by adding the pac having a large specific surface area at this time the ratio of pac to sulfur was found to be optimal at 15 the amount of so4 2 produced per no3 n removed is smaller than the stoichiometric value due to the denitrification of other microorganisms or the generation of caso4 an insoluble salt the denitrification was observed in the first order reaction the rate constant k was 0 0229 day when pac was added and 0 0143 day without pac the generation of so4 2 was close to the zero order reaction the rate constant k was 34 mg l day when pac was added and 26 571 mg l day without pac in the sulfur based denitrification mbr process the removal of t n was enhanced by around 40 in the mbr system with the carrier volume of 10 of oxic tank volume the removal efficiency of t n increased furthermore while the concentration of sulfate also increased in the effluent as the dosage of the carrier increased it was clear that autotrophic denitrification was successfully carried out by using the sulfur based carrier in mbr system without any additional carbon source from outside the use of carrier to the other biological wastewater treatment processes will be also helpful for the further treatment of nitrogen economically and efficiently the fact that the carrier completely disappeared within a certain period means that no other post treatment of disposal is needed when the role of carrier finished and it was meaningful that the carrier has an additional role other than the supplier of sulfur based on the result that the stoichiometric consumption rate of nitrate was higher than the production rate of sulfate further study including the enhancement of the configuration of the carrier and the application of the carrier to the various treatment processes is required for practical use of the carrier acknowledgement this research was

dihydroxybenzene rs are three dihydroxybenzene isomers belonging to the phenolic compounds family 3 ct hq and rs are absorbed into the human body through the skin digestive or respiratory systems irritating skin mucosa and even the central nervous system 4 due to their genotoxicity and carcinogenicity to the human body as well as difficulty in degradation dihydroxybenzene isomers were included in the list of priority pollutants by the us environmental protection agency epa and the european union eu therefore their quantitative determination is a major challenge for many scientists typically

oxidation of numerous organic and inorganic substrates such as amino phenols metoxy phenols as well as mono and polyphenols 18 the active centre of the laccase enzyme contains 4 cu atoms divided into 3 moieties where moiety t1 is responsible for the characteristic blue colour of the enzyme and moieties t2 and t3 take part in the catalytic cycle of laccase in determination of chemical pollutants by way of a redox reaction in the literature many procedures are described for the construction of laccase based biosensors using time consuming and complex wet methods 19 the basis of these methods is deposition of the bio recognition layer via biomolecule immobilization using long hours of conditioning of the conductive solid support in enzyme solution the complexity of current procedures limits application of the biosensors for determination of real environmental samples therefore there is a great interest in developing new methods of biosensors construction allowing significant fabrication procedure simplification reduction of biosensors time and costs of construction as well as preservation improvement of their analytical parameters recently plasma has become an innovative tool of biosensor construction based on biomolecule plasma polymerization pp to deposit the bio recognition layer pp has been a well known technique used to change the surface properties of a matrix support by deposition of non bioactive inorganic or organic chemical compounds as thin film coatings however application of plasma polymerization to the direct deposition of biologically active coatings has only recently been achieved in our previous papers we presented the use of room temperature atmospheric pressure plasma in the form of corona discharges with low specific energy j mm3 in a soft plasma polymerization spp technique for deposition of laccase bio recognition layers 20 and their application in biosensor construction for the determination of rutin 17 this corona spp technique is fast cheap eco friendly and allows for enzyme immobilization without additional reagents in this work a laccase based biosensor constructed by the corona spp technique was studied the bio electrode

potassium phthalate khc8h4o4 were obtained from sigma aldrich suprapur acetic acid ch3cooh and sodium hydroxide naoh were obtained from merck triton x 100 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab were purchased from fluka all chemicals were analytical grade and used in experiments without further purification for the preparation of solutions ultrapure water obtained from a milli q purification system was used ct hq and rc stock solutions at concentration 1 mm were prepared by dissolution of the appropriate amount of ct hq and rs in ultrapure water to obtain clear and homogenous solutions the working solutions of ct hq and rs of lower concentrations were prepared by dilution of the stock solution as required biological precursor in the form of laccase enzyme was isolated according to procedure presented in work 21 a working solution of laccase was prepared by 10 fold dilution of the laccase solution prepared by the dissolution of laccase liophylizate in 1 ml of deionized water with addition of a maximum 10 of ethyl alcohol the initial concentration of laccase liophylizate was claccase 178 mg ml and activity was 186 000 nkat l after lyophilizing the laccase activity dissolved in 1 ml of milliq water was 2 350 100 nkat l 141 u ml per mg of protein 2 2 laccase based biosensors construction the laccase based biosensor was constructed using the one step corona spp technique in deposition of the laccase bio recognition layer the spp technique applies low energy density corona discharge generated in a pin to plane type configuration from the points of two tungsten needle electrodes space around the electrodes was filled by a mixture of helium carrier gas and laccase solution vapour and micro droplets as our previous paper indicated 20 the plasma deposition process creates biologically active polymerized cross linked agglomerates with molecular mass several times higher in comparison to non plasma treated laccase bio recognition layers occurring as a result of polymerization reactions initiated by active plasma species are deposited onto glassy carbon electrode gce prior to deposition the gce electrodes were polished using 0 3 μm alumina slurry and ultra sounded several times in water and methanol our previous research 17 22 showed that the analytical parameters of biosensors fabricated using this spp technique are strongly dependent on plasma deposition time following work 17 in this work the biosensor was constructed under optimal plasma conditions namely deposition time 30 s applied voltage 3 kv and helium flow rate 10 l min at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure the as fabricated biosensor was named gce lac 2 3 electrochemical measurements determination of the analytical parameters of gce lac used the differential pulse voltammetric method all electrochemical measurements were performed by a μautolab analyzer utrecht the netherlands using the conventional three electrode system where gce lac was used as a working electrode ag agcl 3 m kcl electrode as the reference electrode and a platinum electrode as an auxiliary electrode electrochemical measurements were carried using an electrochemical cell volume of 10 ml at room temperature 25 0 0 5 c in non de aerated unstirred solution the voltammograms were recorded from 0 1 to 1 2 v other parameters were pulse amplitude 20 mv step potential 5 mv 2 4 sample preparation in the investigations real water samples were analysed tap water was collected from our laboratory whereas river water was collected from the eastern part of poland the czerniejówka river the analysed samples were strengthened with particular dihydroxybenzene isomers and the recovery studies were performed additional sample purification was not carried out 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph environmental buffer the first study objective was examination of the optimum working conditions of the gce lac dependency of the analytical signal generated by gce lac on ph was evaluated in 0 1 m acetate and 0 1 m phosphorous buffer in the ph range from 3 5 to 8 0 fig 1 a shows the effect of environment buffer ph on the electrochemical response of gce lac in the presence of 30 μm ct hq and rs respectively electrochemical recording of the analytical signals in the acetate buffer at ph range from 3 63 to 6 13 showed their gradual increase while in the phosphorous buffer at ph range from 6 50 to 8 00 a gradual decrease in the analytical signals was observed both in acetate and phosphorous buffers the oxidation peaks of ct hq and rs moved to more negative potentials with increasing ph the highest oxidation peaks of ct hq and rs were obtained for the acetate buffer at ph 6 13 in an environment of acetate buffer gce lac generates larger and sharper peaks generated by oxidation of ct hq and rs because in higher ph solutions analytes easily create anionic forms 14 therefore in further experiments acetate buffer at ph 6 13 was chosen as an electrolyte support fig 1b shows the relationship between the anodic peak potentials epa of ct hq and rs and acetate buffer ph for all analysed compounds an almost linear decrease of epa with increasing acetate buffer ph was observed for determination of ct hq and rs using gce lac the relationship can be described respectively by regression eqs 1 2 and 3 the slopes of these equations are close to the theoretical value 59 mv ph 4 which indicates a two electron and two proton redox reaction of ct hq and rs electrochemical determination of ct hq rs occurs through a redox reaction with the 4 copper active centre of laccase as is shown in scheme 1 1 epa mv 68 8 ph 1179 r2 0 989 2 epa mv 60 6 ph 1064 r2 0 972 3 epa mv 62 0 ph 642 7 r2 0 976 3 2 response time of gce lac response time directly influences sensor applicability so that the response times of gce lac in determining ct hq and rs were analysed in order to evaluate the response time the oxidation peaks of ct hq and rs at concentrations 5 and 15 μm were recorded after 60 120 180 and 240 s from analyte dosing for all studied dihydroxybenzene isomers a well formed oxidation peak was generated after just 60 s extension of waiting time did not cause signal change indicating that the use of corona spp in deposition of biorecognition layers enables construction of biosensors characterized by fast response times 3 3 electrochemical determination of ct hq and rs by gce lac the most important investigated analytical parameter of gce lac was linear range determining its applicability in the determination of dihydroxybenzene isomers in real environmental samples the linearity of gce lac was recorded in an environment of acetate buffer at ph 6 13 for increasing analyte concentration the response behaviour of gce lac for increasing ct hq and rs concentrations is presented in figs 2 a c and 3 a c the oxidation peak current of ct increased linearly in the range of concentrations from 1 0 to 90 9 μm according to eq 4 with the regression coefficient r2 0 997 for hq determination a linear response of gce lac was observed over the concentration ranges 1 0 μm 47 6 μm according to eq 5 with regression coefficient r2 0 998 in the case of rs the gce lac exhibited two linear ranges from 1 0 to 9 9 μm and from 9 9 to 56 6 μm respectively according to eqs 6 and 7 with regression coefficients r2 0 996 and r2 0 995 the eqs 4 7 determine the sensitivities of the bio electrode towards ct hq and rs which are respectively 0 0954 μa μm 0 1241 μa μm as well as 0 6169 μa μm 1st linear range and 0 3463 μa μm 2nd linear range 4 δi 0 0954 cct 0 303 5 δi 0 124 chq 0 242 6 δi 0 617 crs 0 0296 7 δi 0 346 crs 2 73 the analytical parameters linearity and sensitivity of gce lac were compared with other bioelectrodes fabricated by conventional wet methods described in the literature as can be seen in table 1 the gce lac biosensor fabricated by an innovative plasma technique is characterized by a wider linear range and higher sensitivity in ct hq and rs determination it confirms that application of the one step fabrication procedure with low energy corona discharges does not cause excessive or even significant loss of laccase based biosensor analytical parameters comparison of linear ranges and sensitivities of biosensors fabricated by conventional methods and corona spp confirms the possibility of application of corona discharges in construction of analytical devices used in environmental protection for dihydroxybenzene isomers monitoring it is worth noticing that the gce lac is constructed without using any additional chemical compounds or nanomaterials which significantly simplifies the fabrication procedure and reduces the cost of biosensor production 3 4 repeatability stability and interference studies good stability is a basic requirement for new biosensors thus this parameter of the fabricated bioelectrode was also investigated to study sensor stability its analytical signal was measured twice per week over a period of 60 days the measurements were conducted in acetate buffer at ph 6 13 containing 15 μm of ct hq and rs the relative standard deviations sd obtained from 16 measurements were 5 13 6 18 and 4 29 for ct hq and rs respectively the repeatability of gce lac was estimated by five measurements of oxidation peak current of ct hq and rs by the same electrode refreshed after each successful measurement the experiments were carried out at constant ct hq and rs concentration of 15 μm in an environment of acetate buffer at ph 6 13 the repeatability was evaluated on the basis of relative standard deviation defined as a ratio of standard deviation of five measurements and their mean value the measurement showed that for determination of ct hq and rs relative standard deviation was 2 80 3 42 and 3 05 respectively which indicated that the bioelectrode has good repeatability in some applications the interference of foreign compounds can influence oxidation peak current by its reduction therefore possible interferences commonly occurring in water samples were investigated the influence of foreign species was tested for cations mg2 ca2 na k with increasing concentrations from 100 μm to 1000 μm the studies were carried out by analysing standard solutions of ct hq and rs at concentration of 20 μm in acetate buffer ph 6 13 in the presence of coexisting and potentially interfering substances the selectivity coefficients sc of the gce lac in ct hq and rs determination were measured for each foreign substance using the following formula sc ia i ic where ia i and ic are currents generated for ct hq or rs in the presence and absence of coexisting substances respectively 30 in ct determination by gce lac the presence of mg2 ca2 na k ions caused decreases in the generated analytical signal of 8 4 5 and 4 respectively in the case of hq determination a smaller impact of the coexisting ions was seen being respectively 1 5 2 and 3 for rs the presence of mg2 ca2 na and k ions caused decreases in the generated analytical signal of 2 4 3 and 1 respectively according to prevailing rules if the sc is less than 5 this would be considered to show an absence of significant interference in the biosensor analytical signal the sc range from 1 to 8 thus indicates negligible interference by the studied ions in determination of dihydroxybenzene isomers by gce lac the interference studies showed that 5 fold 20 fold and even 50 fold higher concentration of coexisting foreign substances had no significant influence on the electrochemical analytical signal coming from oxidation of ct hq and rs the excellent selectivity of gce lac may occur as a result of repulsive electrostatic forces on the coexisting foreign ions caused by the positive charge of the cu atoms of laccase enzyme the effect of surface active substances was studied for three types of surfactants cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab anionic sodium dodecylsulfate sds and nonionic triton x 100 surfactants in the concentration range of 0 1 25 mg l 1 the measurements were performed using solutions containing 20 μm of ct hq and rs respectively and increasing concentrations of surfactants in acetate buffer with ph 6 13 the obtained results showed that the voltammetric signal of all dihydroxybenzene izomers studied was insensitive to the presence of anionic sds surfactant for cationic ctab surfactant there was no interference up to a concentration of 2 mg l 1 above this concentration peak distortion was observed for ct and hq respectively the presence of the tritonx 100 non ionic surfactant did not cause change the peak current obtained for both ct and hq in case of rs there was change in recorded signal in the presence of 10 mg l 1 of triton x 100 3 5 applicability of gce lac to ct hq and rs determination in real samples of tap water and river water to study the applicability of the gce lac bioelectrode ct hq and rs were determined in real samples of tap water and river water by the standard addition technique a recovery study was carried out in triplicate with standard concentrations of ct hq and rs of 5 0 μm and 10 00 μm using gce lac in twice diluted tap and river water in acetate buffer at ph 6 13 the determined concentrations were compared with the actual concentrations added which data is summarized in table 2 the applicability studies show that recoveries of gce lac used for determination of ct hq and rs in tap water vary from 99 3 to 104 0 for lower concentrations and from 101 0 to 102 9 for higher concentrations of dihydroxybenzene isomers it means that the simple sample matrix of tap water does not have an impact on the generation of ct hq and rs oxidation peaks the tap water in lublin used for study of the applicability of gce lac comprises hard water and contains among others ca hco3 2 and mg hco3 2 recoveries of ct hq and rs at high levels confirm the insignificant impact of ca2 and mg2 ions on generation of the oxidation peak as was presented in section 3 3 as is seen in table 2 the gce lac was also applied for direct determination of dihydroxybenzene isomers in river water with recoveries of 128 0 112 0 and 103 8 respectively for lower concentrations of ct hq and rs the recoveries of ct hq and rs obtained for higher concentrations were found respectively to be 122 0 111 0 and 102 2 the increase in gce lac recovery values seen in determination of ct and hq in river water samples in comparison to recovery values in tap water samples indicates the presence of coexisting substances oxidized at the same potential as ct and hq in summary gce lac shows a high ability for sensing ct hq and rs in real samples such as tap and river water 3 6 simultaneous determination of ct hq and rs due to the coexistence of dihydroxybenzene isomers 3 gce lac has been applied to the simultaneous determination of ct hq and rs at the same electrode by the voltammetry method that is a demanding task because of the isomers same electroactivity and same electroactive groups 10 the results show that simultaneous determination of ct and hq by gce lac is not possible because the peaks generated by the ct and hq determinations are overlapped however the gce lac electrode generates two well separated peaks from oxidation of ct or hq and rs so that it is possible to carry out determination of specific two component mixtures namely ct with rs and hq with rs in generating the i a vs e v curves of fig 4 the concentration of rs in the mix was held constant while the concentration of the second dihydroxybenzene isomer in the mix either ct or hq was varied keeping the concentration of rs at 10μm the oxidation peak current of ct generated by gce lac increased in the concentration range up 47 17 μm fig 4a with linearity described according to eq 8 with regression coefficient r2 0 999 fig 5 a similarly keeping the rs concentration at 10μm the concentration of hq was varied up to 47 17 μm fig 4b the oxidation peak current of hq increased linearly according to eq 9 with regression coefficient r2 0 999 fig 5b as seen in fig 5 the gce lac for simultaneous determination of both ct and rs and hq and rs generates two well defined separated oxidation peaks of ct hq and rs for simultaneous determination of ct and rs peak potential separation is 0 515 v and for hq and rs is 0 495 v 8 δi 0 135 cct 0 057 9 δi 0 085 chq 0 080 4 conclusions in this work a laccase based biosensor gce lac fabricated using corona spp for thin film laccase bioactive deposition has been successfully used for detection of dihydroxybenzene isomers in real water samples the electrochemical study showed a significant impact of the environmental buffer s ph both on oxidation peak potential and current increase in environmental buffer ph cause shifting of the peak to lower potentials the dependency of peak potential v on environmental buffer ph indicated a two electron and two proton process of ct hq and rs electrochemical determination by gce lac the highest peak of ct hq and rs oxidation was obtained in an environment of acetate buffer at ph 6 13 under these optimized conditions the peak generated by gce lac was proportional to ct concentration in a range from 1 0 μm to 90 9 μm and to hq concentration from 1 0 μm to 47 6 μm in the case of rs determination two linear ranges from gce lac were observed from 1 0 μm to 9 9 μm and from 9 9 μm to 56 6 μm these results are comparable and an addition to previously published studies which show that biosensors designed for determination of important compounds can be successfully constructed using this low energy low molecular damage plasma technique application of the corona spp technique allows major reduction in time needed for biosensor construction from several hours to 2 min together with reduction in cost moreover the presence of coexisting foreign substances in water samples had no significant influence on generation of oxidation peaks by the gce lac as was tested by interference recovery studies the gce lac can be also used for simultaneous determination of ct rs and hq rs in their two component mixtures in real water samples in summary the as fabricated biosensor displayed improved catalytic performances toward ct hq and rs oxidation compared with referenced biosensors as well as many other advantages such as high selectivity high sensitivity and good reproducibility declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgements we

3 moieties where moiety t1 is responsible for the characteristic blue colour of the enzyme and moieties t2 and t3 take part in the catalytic cycle of laccase in determination of chemical pollutants by way of a redox reaction in the literature many procedures are described for the construction of laccase based biosensors using time consuming and complex wet methods 19 the basis of these methods is deposition of the bio recognition layer via biomolecule immobilization using long hours of conditioning of the conductive solid support in enzyme solution the complexity of current procedures limits application of the biosensors for determination of real environmental samples therefore there is a great interest in developing new methods of biosensors construction allowing significant fabrication procedure simplification reduction of biosensors time and costs of construction as well as preservation improvement of their analytical parameters recently plasma has become an innovative tool of biosensor construction based on biomolecule plasma polymerization pp to deposit the bio recognition layer pp has been a well known technique used to change the surface properties of a matrix support by deposition of non bioactive inorganic or organic chemical compounds as thin film coatings however application of plasma polymerization to the direct deposition of biologically active coatings has only recently been achieved in our previous papers we presented the use of room temperature atmospheric pressure plasma in the form of corona discharges with low specific energy j mm3 in a soft plasma polymerization spp technique for deposition of laccase bio recognition layers 20 and their application in biosensor construction for the determination of rutin 17 this corona spp technique is fast cheap eco friendly and allows for enzyme immobilization without additional reagents in this work a laccase based biosensor constructed by the corona spp technique was studied the bio electrode fabricated gce lac by a 30 s plasma process is characterized by good repeatability and stability and exhibited attractive performances for sensitive and rapid determination of cc hq and rs with good selectivity the impact on measurements by the sensor s ph environment was studied the effect on the analytical signal generated by the as fabricated bio electrode and its recovery in tap water and real river water samples was analyzed the fabricated gce lac was also applied to simultaneous determination of two component mixtures of dihydroxybenzene isomers in water samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals 1 2 dihydroxybenzene catechol 1 4 dihydroxybenzene hydroquinone 1 3 dihydroxybenzene resorcinol sodium hydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 and potassium phthalate khc8h4o4 were obtained from sigma aldrich suprapur acetic acid ch3cooh and sodium hydroxide naoh were obtained from merck triton x 100 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab were purchased from fluka all chemicals were analytical grade and used in experiments without further purification for the preparation of solutions ultrapure water obtained from a milli q purification system was used ct hq and rc stock solutions at concentration 1 mm were prepared by dissolution of the appropriate amount of ct hq and rs in ultrapure water to obtain clear and homogenous solutions the working solutions of ct hq and rs of lower concentrations were prepared by dilution of the stock solution as required biological precursor in the form of laccase enzyme was isolated according to procedure presented in work 21 a working solution of laccase was prepared by 10 fold dilution of the laccase solution prepared by the dissolution of laccase liophylizate in 1 ml of deionized water with addition of a maximum 10 of ethyl alcohol the initial concentration of laccase liophylizate was claccase 178 mg ml and activity was 186 000 nkat l after lyophilizing the laccase activity dissolved in 1 ml of milliq water was 2 350 100 nkat l 141 u ml per mg of protein 2 2 laccase based biosensors construction the laccase based biosensor was constructed using the one step corona spp technique in deposition of the laccase bio recognition layer the spp technique applies low energy density corona discharge generated in a pin to plane type configuration from the points of two tungsten needle electrodes space around the electrodes was filled by a mixture of helium carrier gas and laccase solution vapour and micro droplets as our previous paper indicated 20 the plasma deposition process creates biologically active polymerized cross linked agglomerates with molecular mass several times higher in comparison to non plasma treated laccase bio recognition layers occurring as a result of polymerization reactions initiated by active plasma species are deposited onto glassy carbon electrode gce prior to deposition the gce electrodes were polished using 0 3 μm alumina slurry and ultra sounded several times in water and methanol our previous research 17 22 showed that the analytical parameters of biosensors fabricated using this spp technique are strongly dependent on plasma deposition time following work 17 in this work the biosensor was constructed under optimal plasma conditions namely deposition time 30 s applied voltage 3 kv and helium flow rate 10 l min at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure the as fabricated biosensor was named gce lac 2 3 electrochemical measurements determination of the analytical parameters of gce lac used the differential pulse voltammetric method all electrochemical measurements were performed by a μautolab analyzer utrecht the netherlands using the conventional three electrode system where gce lac was used as a working electrode ag agcl 3 m kcl electrode as the reference electrode and a platinum electrode as an auxiliary electrode electrochemical measurements were carried using an electrochemical cell volume of 10 ml at room temperature 25 0 0 5 c in non de aerated unstirred solution the voltammograms were recorded from 0 1 to 1 2 v other parameters were pulse amplitude 20 mv step potential 5 mv 2 4 sample preparation in the investigations real water samples were analysed tap water was collected from our laboratory whereas river water was collected from the eastern part of poland the czerniejówka river the analysed samples were strengthened with particular dihydroxybenzene isomers and the recovery studies were performed additional sample purification was not carried out 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph environmental buffer the first study objective was examination of the optimum working conditions of the gce lac dependency of the analytical signal generated by gce lac on ph was evaluated in 0 1 m acetate and 0 1 m phosphorous buffer in the ph range from 3 5 to 8 0 fig 1 a shows the effect of environment buffer ph on the electrochemical response of gce lac in the presence of 30 μm ct hq and rs respectively electrochemical recording of the analytical signals in the acetate buffer at ph range from 3 63 to 6 13 showed their gradual increase while in the phosphorous buffer at ph range from 6 50 to 8 00 a gradual decrease in the analytical signals was observed both in acetate and phosphorous buffers the oxidation peaks of ct hq and rs moved to more negative potentials with increasing ph the highest oxidation peaks of ct hq and rs were obtained for the acetate buffer at ph 6 13 in an environment of acetate buffer gce lac generates larger and sharper peaks generated by oxidation of ct hq and rs because in higher ph solutions analytes easily create anionic forms 14 therefore in further experiments acetate buffer at ph 6 13 was chosen as an electrolyte support fig 1b shows the relationship between the anodic peak potentials epa of ct hq and rs and acetate buffer ph for all analysed compounds an almost linear decrease of epa with increasing acetate buffer ph was observed for determination of ct hq and rs using gce lac the relationship can be described respectively by regression eqs 1 2 and 3 the slopes of these equations are close to the theoretical value 59 mv ph 4 which indicates a two electron and two proton redox reaction of ct hq and rs electrochemical determination of ct hq rs occurs through a redox reaction with the 4 copper active centre of laccase as is shown in scheme 1 1 epa mv 68 8 ph 1179 r2 0 989 2 epa mv 60 6 ph 1064 r2 0 972 3 epa mv 62 0 ph 642 7 r2 0 976 3 2 response time of gce lac response time directly influences sensor applicability so that the response times of gce lac in determining ct hq and rs were analysed in order to evaluate the response time the oxidation peaks of ct hq and rs at concentrations 5 and 15 μm were recorded after 60 120 180 and 240 s from analyte dosing for all studied dihydroxybenzene isomers a well formed oxidation peak was generated after just 60 s extension of waiting time did not cause signal change indicating that the use of corona spp in deposition of biorecognition layers enables construction of biosensors characterized by fast response times 3 3 electrochemical determination of ct hq and rs by gce lac the most important investigated analytical parameter of gce lac was linear range determining its applicability in the determination of dihydroxybenzene isomers in real environmental samples the linearity of gce lac was recorded in an environment of acetate buffer at ph 6 13 for increasing analyte concentration the response behaviour of gce lac for increasing ct hq and rs concentrations is presented in figs 2 a c and 3 a c the oxidation peak current of ct increased linearly in the range of concentrations from 1 0 to 90 9 μm according to eq 4 with the regression coefficient r2 0 997 for hq determination a linear response of gce lac was observed over the concentration ranges 1 0 μm 47 6 μm according to eq 5 with regression coefficient r2 0 998 in the case of rs the gce lac exhibited two linear ranges from 1 0 to 9 9 μm and from 9 9 to 56 6 μm respectively according to eqs 6 and 7 with regression coefficients r2 0 996 and r2 0 995 the eqs 4 7 determine the sensitivities of the bio electrode towards ct hq and rs which are respectively 0 0954 μa μm 0 1241 μa μm as well as 0 6169 μa μm 1st linear range and 0 3463 μa μm 2nd linear range 4 δi 0 0954 cct 0 303 5 δi 0 124 chq 0 242 6 δi 0 617 crs 0 0296 7 δi 0 346 crs 2 73 the analytical parameters linearity and sensitivity of gce lac were compared with other bioelectrodes fabricated by conventional wet methods described in the literature as can be seen in table 1 the gce lac biosensor fabricated by an innovative plasma technique is characterized by a wider linear range and higher sensitivity in ct hq and rs determination it confirms that application of the one step fabrication procedure with low energy corona discharges does not cause excessive or even significant loss of laccase based biosensor analytical parameters comparison of linear ranges and sensitivities of biosensors fabricated by conventional methods and corona spp confirms the possibility of application of corona discharges in construction of analytical devices used in environmental protection for dihydroxybenzene isomers monitoring it is worth noticing that the gce lac is constructed without using any additional chemical compounds or nanomaterials which significantly simplifies the fabrication procedure and reduces the cost of biosensor production 3 4 repeatability stability and interference studies good stability is a basic requirement for new biosensors thus this parameter of the fabricated bioelectrode was also investigated to study sensor stability its analytical signal was measured twice per week over a period of 60 days the measurements were conducted in acetate buffer at ph 6 13 containing 15 μm of ct hq and rs the relative standard deviations sd obtained from 16 measurements were 5 13 6 18 and 4 29 for ct hq and rs respectively the repeatability of gce lac was estimated by five measurements of oxidation peak current of ct hq and rs by the same electrode refreshed after each successful measurement the experiments were carried out at constant ct hq and rs concentration of 15 μm in an environment of acetate buffer at ph 6 13 the repeatability was evaluated on the basis of relative standard deviation defined as a ratio of standard deviation of five measurements and their mean value the measurement showed that for determination of ct hq and rs relative standard deviation was 2 80 3 42 and 3 05 respectively which indicated that the bioelectrode has good repeatability in some applications the interference of foreign compounds can influence oxidation peak current by its reduction therefore possible interferences commonly occurring in water samples were investigated the influence of foreign species was tested for cations mg2 ca2 na k with increasing concentrations from 100 μm to 1000 μm the studies were carried out by analysing standard solutions of ct hq and rs at concentration of 20 μm in acetate buffer ph 6 13 in the presence of coexisting and potentially interfering substances the selectivity coefficients sc of the gce lac in ct hq and rs determination were measured for each foreign substance using the following formula sc ia i ic where ia i and ic are currents generated for ct hq or rs in the presence and absence of coexisting substances respectively 30 in ct determination by gce lac the presence of mg2 ca2 na k ions caused decreases in the generated analytical signal of 8 4 5 and 4 respectively in the case of hq determination a smaller impact of the coexisting ions was seen being respectively 1 5 2 and 3 for rs the presence of mg2 ca2 na and k ions caused decreases in the generated analytical signal of 2 4 3 and 1 respectively according to prevailing rules if the sc is less than 5 this would be considered to show an absence of significant interference in the biosensor analytical signal the sc range from 1 to 8 thus indicates negligible interference by the studied ions in determination of dihydroxybenzene isomers by gce lac the interference studies showed that 5 fold 20 fold and even 50 fold higher concentration of coexisting foreign substances had no significant influence on the electrochemical analytical signal coming from oxidation of ct hq and rs the excellent selectivity of gce lac may occur as a result of repulsive electrostatic forces on the coexisting foreign ions caused by the positive charge of the cu atoms of laccase enzyme the effect of surface active substances was studied for three types of surfactants cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab anionic sodium dodecylsulfate sds and nonionic triton x 100 surfactants in the concentration range of 0 1 25 mg l 1 the measurements were performed using solutions containing 20 μm of ct hq and rs respectively and increasing concentrations of surfactants in acetate buffer with ph 6 13 the obtained results showed that the voltammetric signal of all dihydroxybenzene izomers studied was insensitive to the presence of anionic sds surfactant for cationic ctab surfactant there was no interference up to a concentration of 2 mg l 1 above this concentration peak distortion was observed for ct and hq respectively the presence of the tritonx 100 non ionic surfactant did not cause change the peak current obtained for both ct and hq in case of rs there was change in recorded signal in the presence of 10 mg l 1 of triton x 100 3 5 applicability of gce lac to ct hq and rs determination in real samples of tap water and river water to study the applicability of the gce lac bioelectrode ct hq and rs were determined in real samples of tap water and river water by the standard addition technique a recovery study was carried out in triplicate with standard concentrations of ct hq and rs of 5 0 μm and 10 00 μm using gce lac in twice diluted tap and river water in acetate buffer at ph 6 13 the determined concentrations were compared with the actual concentrations added which data is summarized in table 2 the applicability studies show that recoveries of gce lac used for determination of ct hq and rs in tap water vary from 99 3 to 104 0 for lower concentrations and from 101 0 to 102 9 for higher concentrations of dihydroxybenzene isomers it means that the simple sample matrix of tap water does not have an impact on the generation of ct hq and rs oxidation peaks the tap water in lublin used for study of the applicability of gce lac comprises hard water and contains among others ca hco3 2 and mg hco3 2 recoveries of ct hq and rs at high levels confirm the insignificant impact of ca2 and mg2 ions on generation of the oxidation peak as was presented in section 3 3 as is seen in table 2 the gce lac was also applied for direct determination of dihydroxybenzene isomers in river water with recoveries of 128 0 112 0 and 103 8 respectively for lower concentrations of ct hq and rs the recoveries of ct hq and rs obtained for higher concentrations were found respectively to be 122 0 111 0 and 102 2 the increase in gce lac recovery values seen in determination of ct and hq in river water samples in comparison to recovery values in tap water samples indicates the presence of coexisting substances oxidized at the same potential as ct and hq in summary gce lac shows a high ability for sensing ct hq and rs in real samples such as tap and river water 3 6 simultaneous determination of ct hq and rs due to the coexistence of dihydroxybenzene isomers 3 gce lac has been applied to the simultaneous determination of ct hq and rs at the same electrode by the voltammetry method that is a demanding task because of the isomers same electroactivity and same electroactive groups 10 the results show that simultaneous determination of ct and hq by gce lac is not possible because the peaks generated by the ct and hq determinations are overlapped however the gce lac electrode generates two well separated peaks from oxidation of ct or hq and rs so that it is possible to carry out determination of specific two component mixtures namely ct with rs and hq with rs in generating the i a vs e v curves of fig 4 the concentration of rs in the mix was held constant while the concentration of the second dihydroxybenzene isomer in the mix either ct or hq was varied keeping the concentration of rs at 10μm the oxidation peak current of ct generated by gce lac increased in the concentration range up 47 17 μm fig 4a with linearity described according to eq 8 with regression coefficient r2 0 999 fig 5 a similarly keeping the rs concentration at 10μm the concentration of hq was varied up to 47 17 μm fig 4b the oxidation peak current of hq increased linearly according to eq 9 with regression coefficient r2 0 999 fig 5b as seen in fig 5 the gce lac for simultaneous determination of both ct and rs and hq and rs generates two well defined separated oxidation peaks of ct hq and rs for simultaneous determination of ct and rs peak potential separation is 0 515 v and for hq and rs is 0 495 v 8 δi 0 135 cct 0 057 9 δi 0 085 chq 0 080 4 conclusions in this work a laccase based biosensor gce lac fabricated using corona spp for thin film laccase bioactive deposition has been successfully used for detection of dihydroxybenzene isomers in real water samples the electrochemical study showed a significant impact of the environmental buffer s ph both on oxidation peak potential and current increase in environmental buffer ph cause shifting of the peak to lower potentials the dependency of peak potential v on environmental buffer ph indicated a two electron and two proton process of ct hq and rs electrochemical determination by gce lac the highest peak of ct hq and rs oxidation was obtained in an environment of acetate buffer at ph 6 13 under these optimized conditions the peak generated by gce lac was proportional to ct concentration in a range from 1 0 μm to 90 9 μm and to hq concentration from 1 0 μm to 47 6 μm in the case of rs determination two linear ranges from gce lac were observed from 1 0 μm to 9 9 μm and from 9 9 μm to 56 6 μm these results are comparable and an addition to previously published studies which show that biosensors designed for determination of important compounds can be successfully constructed using this low energy low molecular damage plasma technique application of the corona spp technique allows major reduction in time needed for biosensor construction from several hours to 2 min together with reduction in cost moreover the presence of coexisting foreign substances in water samples had no significant influence on generation of oxidation peaks by the gce lac as was tested by interference recovery studies the gce lac can be also used for simultaneous determination of ct rs and hq rs in their two component mixtures in real water samples in summary the as fabricated biosensor displayed improved catalytic performances toward ct hq and rs oxidation compared with referenced biosensors as well as many other advantages such as high selectivity high sensitivity and good reproducibility declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgements we
