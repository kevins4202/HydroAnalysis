14155,this paper is the first critical review of the technology of water treatment via biological process for contaminants removal from water resources the biological process is considered the future for drinking water treatment especially for developing countries the main focus of the review is on single and integrated treatment technologies that have been studied for all types of drinking water resources including surface water and ground water these treatment technologies have the capability to treat contaminants in polluted drinking water resources such as heavy metals natural organic matter inorganic non metallic matter disinfection by products endocrine disrupting chemicals and microbial contaminants the potential threats and challenges of using the biological process for safe drinking water production also have been discussed as this technology is a relatively new concept for safe drinking water production and there have been very limited studies performed in developing countries keywords biological drinking water treatment biofilms organic and inorganic removal micropollutants removal drinking water 1 introduction safe water is important for humans plants and animals for example humans need water as a role in the metabolic process to breakdown large substances into small substances and transport them to other parts of the body once the water has been contaminated by toxic compounds it must be treated before can be consumed by people similarly contaminated water will become hazardous to plants and animals if their metabolic process is exposed through drinking it by these living things the water contaminations occur because of a few key factors i e industrial and sewage effluent discharge agricultural industry illegal garbage disposal and leakage of leachate from landfills 1 even though most of the industrial businesses have their own wastewater treatment plants if the effluent is discharged every day the concentration of pollutants will accumulate and increase over long term periods this phenomenon will pose a serious problem in the future for drinking water treatment plants dwtps which use river water as their main sources for safe drinking water production most of the dwtps globally only use conventional treatment processes such as screening coagulation flocculation filtration and chlorination fluoridation these treatment processes do not have the ability to effectively treat pollutants such as organic carbon nitrogen compounds and heavy metals at high levels some dwtps have to shut down their operations periodically until the level of contaminations decrease naturally through dilution by raining because the effluents from industries can only be controlled thus to overcome the problem a new approach has to be implemented for the continuity of clean and safe drinking water production the biological process started to become popular for wastewater treatment in the early 1900s 2 but not for drinking water treatment although biological drinking water treatment biodwt has been used since the 1800s 3 its application globally is still limited recently some developed countries such as the usa canada greece croatia and china have applied the biodwt for clean and safe drinking water treatment but there have been very limited studies performed in developing countries the biodwt is totally dependent on the non pathogenic bacteria acting as biocatalyst for biochemical oxidation degrading the pollutants in the contaminated drinking water and producing biologically stable water to prevent the growth of microorganisms in the water distribution system 2 this study aims to comprehensively review the technology of biological treatment systems for safe drinking water production this review will cover all types of drinking water resources including surface water river lake and reservoir and ground water that have been treated using biological technology 2 contaminants in polluted drinking water and its regulation 2 1 heavy metals a metal is a material in the form of an element compound or alloy that is typically hard opaque shiny and has good thermal and electrical conductivity meanwhile a heavy metal is a metal with a specific gravity greater than 4 or 5 4 and have been associated with contamination and potential toxicity 5 heavy metals that are toxic are arsenic as copper cu zinc zn nickel ni chromium cr and plumbum pb exposure to heavy metals thorough ingestion or inhalation is dangerous because they tend to accumulate and are retained by the human body some of the adverse effect and limits of heavy metal contamination are listed in table 1 once the human body has accumulated these heavy metals it could potentially lead to kidney problem cd skin and lung cancers as and neurological problems hg 2 2 natural organic matter natural organic matter nom is usually present in surface and ground water this pollutant can also be present in soil waters it includes both humic hydrophobic and non humic fractions hydrophilic 17 fig 1 nom can be present in two forms i e particulate organic matter pom and dissolved organic matter doc the characteristics of nom depend on the source and season 18 nom is reported to not be harmful to human health but the reaction of this matter with chlorine during the chlorination process of drinking water treatment will form disinfection by products such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haa the classification of nom is depicted in fig 1 the hydrophobic nom is less soluble in water has a high molecular weight such as humic and fulvic acids 17 has rich aromatic carbon and has conjugated double bonds and phenolic structures 19 while hydrophilic nom is less reactive and contains more carbon and nitrogenous compounds 19 in canada there is no regulation for the level of humic acids in drinking water but this substance has been addressed in health canada s drinking water quality guideline on colour it is because the presence of humic acid in water causes colour odour and taste problems to increase 20 2 3 inorganic non metallic matter inorganic non metallic contaminants are compounds that contain no carbon or contain only carbon bound to elements other than hydrogen inorganic non metallic contaminants will be discussed in this section inorganic non metallic contaminants consist of nitrogen sulfate phosphate and chlorides nitrogen compounds have been classified as ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n if an infant is exposed to these nitrogen compounds in excess of the allowable limits it could lead to the blue baby syndrome 21 the allowable limits for nitrogen compounds are listed in table 1 there is no limit for the ammonia level in drinking water regulated by the us epa in malaysia the ammonia level has been regulated to below than 1 5 mg l for both untreated and treated drinking water sulfate is a chemical substance that occurs naturally in drinking water and its limit in drinking water is below than 250 mg l exposure to this contaminant at high level can causes diarrhoeal diseases 12 the presence of sulfate in drinking water at high levels may also cause the water to taste bitter sulfate can be anaerobically reduced to sulfide and then combined with hydrogen to form hydrogen sulfide gas once this gas accumulates in the drinking water piping system it can be corrosive due to the formation of sulfuric acid 22 the presence of natural chloride in surface and ground water are caused by the leaching of chloride containing rocks and soils 22 anthropogenic sources such as discharge from industrial sources landfill leachate agricultural sources and septic tanks also contribute to the contamination of chloride in surface and groundwater 13 2 4 disinfection by products disinfection by products dbps are formed from the reaction of organic matters with inorganic dpbs precursors and disinfectants such as chlorine chloramines and chlorine dioxide as depicted in fig 2 usually these contaminants occur during chlorination bleaching and washing processes such as from car wash and washing machine dbps can be classified into two major by products i e thms and haa haloacetonitriles hans are another type of dbp that form in small amounts during the chlorination process 23 thms are measured as total thms 0 08 mg l which consist of chloroform dibromochloromethane bromodichloromethane and bromoform 24 meanwhile haas are measured as a total of the five haas 0 06 mg l i e the sum of monochloroacetic acid trichloroacetic acid dichloroacetic acid bromate and chlorite however in malaysia only two of the most commons out of these five haas are monitored i e trichloroacetic 0 1 mg l and dichloroacetic acid 0 05 mg l it has been reported that exposure to dbps at high levels will cause increased of risk of cancer and adverse reproductive outcomes 14 and the risk of intrauterine growth retardation 15 2 5 endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs many of the endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs may be present in surface and ground water edcs can be classified to four groups i e pesticides residue ddt methoxychlor endosulfan highly chlorinated compounds polychlorinated biphenyls dioxin furan alkylphenols and alkylphenolethoxylates nonylphenol octylphenol and plastic additives bisphenol a diethyl phthalate di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate among this group ddt methoxychlor pcbs endosulfan diethylhexylphthalate diethylphthalate bisphenol a perchlorate may occur in drinking water this contaminant can be found in various materials such as metals pesticides additives in food and personal care products edcs may interfere with the endocrine system which can cause adverse reproductive health effects including sperm count decline hypospadias and cryptorchidism and cancer of the breasts and testes 25 the regulation limits for pesticides residue such as ddt methoxychlor and endosulfan for the malaysian drinking water regulation are 0 002 mg l ddt and methoxychlor and 0 03 mg l endosulfan the usepa 26 has regulated that the concentration of polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxin must not higher than 0 0005 and 3 10 8 mg l respectively this regulation indicates that edcs in water are very strictly monitored due to their worse effects on the human endocrine system 2 6 microbial contamination contamination of microbial pathogens in drinking water causes diarrhoeal diseases microbial contamination includes total coliform faecal coliform and escherichia coli legionella giardia lamblia cryptosporidium and viruses contamination by these microorganisms usually comes from human and animal faecal waste that contains pathogenic microorganisms the pathogenic microorganism must be killed or removed from the drinking water before it is safe to drink the usepa 146 has regulated that the total coliform in drinking must be less than 5 of the samples in a month while malaysian government has regulated that the microbial contaminant must be totally removed from drinking water 3 single technology of biological water treatment 3 1 slow and rapid sand biofiltration 3 1 1 principles of ssf and rsf slow sand and rapid sand filters are conventionally used in drinking water treatment processing either by developed or developing countries the basic principle of a sand filter is to physically filter out the suspended solids or particles from the water the application of a sand filter has expanded because researchers have discovered its advantages in treating water the main advantage of a sand filter is that it not only separates the suspended solids and particles from the water but also other chemical constituents including micropollutants 27 nitrogen compounds 28 29 heavy metals 30 31 pesticide 32 and biological contaminants pathogenic microorganisms such as human pathogenic viruses and bacteria 33 the outstanding performance of the sand filter in removing contaminants from drinking water is due to the active biological activity present at the upper layer of the sand filter consequently upgrading the conventional sand filter system to a combination physical and biological sand filter there are two types of biological sand filters bsf i e the slow sand filter ssf and the rapid sand filter rsf these two sand biofiltration systems have commonly been designed in various shapes either in a column vessel rectangular or square polyethylene water tank or a concrete tank depending on the scale of treatment which can vary from a household to a full scale drinking water production plant the major difference between these two systems are the filtration rates the ssf have a slower filtration rate typically 0 1 to 0 2 mh 1 compared to the rsf 5 7 5 mh 1 epa 145 from the data analysis summarized in table 2 the size of the sand particles in the ssf was smaller sand size range 0 45 1 2 mm compared with the rsf sand size range 0 45 5 0 mm 3 1 2 schmutzdecke of ssf and rsf the ssf system is based on a centuries old bioremediation concept where water flows slowly through a sand packing and microorganisms or so called biologically active schmutzdecke form and grow at the top and within the sand packing 38 the advantages of the ssf are that it is simple to operate is an efficient and reliable system and requires low operating and capital cost 28 the ssf system removes the contaminants through a few mechanisms such as schmutzdecke activity at top layer surface catalysed degradation and mechanical filtration 28 fig 3 shows a thick layer matrix of schmutzdecke containing extracellular polymeric that attached to the sand surface 3 1 3 performance of ssf and rsf the performance of the ssf in removing contaminants depends on the water quality surface ripening and temperature 33 the rsf system can be designed either in open gravitational flow filters or in closed pressure filters 39 the rsf system is operated by pouring the water in a downward flow configuration through a sand filter to remove suspended solids 40 this system can separate more ss in a shorter period compared to the ssf 41 the efficiency of sand biofiltration application has been studied by researchers for removing pollutants from various types of drinking water resources such as surface water lake and river water and ground water and some of researchers used simulated contaminated potable water as summarized in table 2 the biological systems are applied either in a laboratory pilot or full scale drinking water treatment plant from the data summarized in table 2 ssf sand media are smaller than the rsf media with particle sizes between 0 29 the smallest to 1 2 the biggest the types of contaminants removed by sand biofiltration are pathogenic viruses and bacteria 33 42 46 metals 30 31 36 47 nitrogen compounds 28 29 34 36 37 48 50 pesticide 32 pharmaceutical chemicals 27 organic chemicals such as 2 methylisoborneol mib and trans 1 10 dimethyl trans 9 decalol geosmin 35 methyl tert butyl ether mtbe 51 dissolved organic carbon 49 50 dbps precursors 49 50 perchlorate 48 nom 52 and bisphenol 53 viruses and bacteria are biological pollutants that were investigated by researchers to be removed by sand biofiltration bacteriophage ms2 and escherichia coli wr1 present in contaminated potable water were investigated by schijven et al 33 to be removed using a pilot scale ssf under the various factors of temperature filtration rate grain sizes and schmutzdecke age the age of the schmutzdecke and the grain sizes were found to contribute to the significance of the removal of bacteriophage ms2 0 08 3 3 log10 removal and e coli wr1 0 94 with 4 5 log10 removal another study by jenkins et al 54 of an intermittent ssf equipped for a household could remove 0 94 log ms2 viruses 88 5 and 1 82 log faecal coliform 98 5 with a filtration rate of 0 01 0 03 m h yahya et al 46 achieved more than 99 removal of ms2 and prd1 stauber et al 55 also reported that sampling of 55 household filters near bonao dominican republic resulted in approximately 93 e coli removal nitrogen compounds nh4 n and no3 n are two famous contaminants in drinking water resources by using ssf and rsf more than 95 of these two compounds have been successfully removed 28 37 49 50 however cai et al 29 only achieved 46 6 of nh4 n removal from simulated contaminated drinking water using an ssf system in their studies but the removal increased on average to 48 5 when the loading of nh4 n increased on the other hand rsf would also be a good alternative system for removing nh4 n from groundwater lopato et al 56 found that the removal occurred through a heterogeneous mechanism by the ammonia oxidizing bacteria not only nitrogen compounds but also metals such as fe and mn that are naturally present in drinking water resources can be treated using ssf and rsf systems the rsf has been investigated by lee et al 36 li et al 31 and štembal et al 57 for the removal of fe and mn from groundwater while the ssf system was investigated to remove as 30 58 and se 47 at a high filtration rate of 8 m h the rsf system could remove more than 95 of fe and mn 31 the ssf and rsf systems do not require aeration or an oxygen supply creating anaerobic conditions at the middle and bottom parts of these systems an anaerobic ssf has the capability to efficiently remove se through the dissimilatory reduction of selenate to elemental selenium mechanism that is affected by the hydraulic loading rate hlr 47 3 2 biological activated carbon bac 3 2 1 principles and design of bac the process of biological activated carbon bac was first proposed by g w miller and r g rice in 1978 who are from the united states and switzerland respectively 59 60 according to jin et al 59 the advantage of the microbial growing on the ac layer was first affirmed by parkhrust and his partners in 1967 since then bac technology has become an essential process for advanced water treatment in developed countries such as america switzerland holland and japan 59 but in developing countries such as malaysia indonesia russia turkey and others this technology is consider as an alternative system for water treatment in japan the bac system has been used as advanced water treatment by large urban water systems since the early 1990s 61 the bac is developed on the activated carbon ac covered with a microbial which is called biofilm this technology combines the dual mechanisms of adsorption and biodegradation bio oxidation to enhance the effectiveness of drinking water 62 the unique characteristics of ac such as the large surface area ability to adsorb organic materials and the rough surface texture are major factors of bacteria attachment 63 the simple design of the bac system commonly consists of activated carbon a reactor column feeding pump and tank this system does not require an aeration supply but depends on the pollutants to be removed because some microbials especially aerobic microbes require dissolved oxygen do from an electron acceptor for the growth and pollutants degradation as depicted in fig 4 the aerobic bac process requires do for the growth instead of the anaerobic process there is symbiotic interaction between ac and microorganisms where the ac acts as the carrier of microbes in the form of biofilm while the microbes promote the regeneration of ac the bioregeneration of the organic substrate saturated ac occurs through the mechanism of organic substrate consumption by the microorganism as a source of energy and food 64 3 2 2 activated carbon there are various types of activated carbon that have been used worldwide for wastewater treatment processes such as crab shells 65 papaya peels biowaste 66 coal 49 50 and sugarcane bagasse 67 as summarized in table 3 activated carbon is only specifically used for the bac system where at certain period the ac has reached it saturated capacity of adsorption and during the meantime the removal of contaminants is mainly performed by the active microbe attached on the ac surface and only slightly by the ac even though some of the researchers reported that the adsorption and biodegradation of organic contaminants can occurs simultaneously and the adsorption of ac is bioregenerated by the microorganism the mechanisms of simultaneous adsorption biodegradation and bioregeneration are not well identified 3 2 3 performance of bac the removal of various types of contaminants using the bac system has been studied such as nitrogenous compounds 70 71 73 organic carbon 75 68 and micropollutants 62 74 yapsakli et al 70 investigated the removal of nh4 n using two types of activated carbon that were prepared using different methods chemical activation cagran and heat activation norit 1240 in the study the cagran media did not adsorb nh4 n at the initial stage of treatment as norit 1240 had done the removal only occurred after day 12 to the acclimatization of aob in the biofilter compared to the norit 1240 where the removal occurred immediately at day 0 due to sorption effect another study by kim et al 73 using pac found that up to 93 of nh4 n can be removed using pac media however the species of microorganism community involved in the process was not investigated only the biofilm density through heterotrophic counting plates was reported recently bac reactors have received researcher intention for the removal of micropollutants from surface water li et al 62 investigated the elimination of 17β estradiol e2 from surface water using a bac reactor filled with a calgon filtrasorb 400 f400 coal based gac media without seeds of any microorganism the bac was able to remove e2 up to 100 and at the end of the monitoring microbial activities were visually observed to naturally develop mckie at al 2016 researched the combination of exhausted gac sand media in the bac reactor with and without the inline addition of alum 0 2 and 0 8 mg l for the removal of spiked edcs and phacs the addition of alum improved the bac performances in removing both micropollutants in the study by mckie et al 74 there was no microbial community reported but the removals are believed to occur due to the microbial activities the reason is because the age of the gac used in the study was 4 years of operation and it was affirmed to have no adsorption capabilities more advanced bac systems were developed by lompe et al 76 that had mixed pac with iron oxide nanoparticles to improve the efficiency of the bac reactor which consequently changed the conventional bac to a magnetic bac mbac the iron oxide nanoparticle not only contributed to doc and ammonia removals but it is suitable to support the growth of nitrifying and heterotrophic bacteria 3 3 trickling filter tf 3 3 1 principles and design operating of tf a trickling filter is a fixed film biofilter using packing medium for the biofilm attachment the biofilm that develops on the packing medium contains microorganisms that are useful for the biodegradation of the contaminants there are three keys component of the tf design i e the rotary distributor packing medium and air circulation the influent of water is designed at the top of the packing medium through the rotating distribution arms packing mediums such as rock or plastic are common mediums for the conventional tf operation to treat wastewater and there a few that have been used for drinking water treatment such as gravel 77 tkp 312 polypropylene 78 and silicic gravel 79 to increase the treatment efficiency to maintain air circulation an underdrain system is designed at the bottom of the tf thus giving the advantage of not requiring an external air supply for the operation 80 additionally the underdrain is useful not only for the air circulation but also for the effluent of the tf however some researchers designed an external air supply to the tf system such as the study by gouzinis et al 77 that used a 10 l min air flow rate 3 3 2 performance of tf as seen in table 4 the application of the tf for the contaminant removal from drinking water sources are not as varied compared to the wastewater in wastewater treatment the tf is applied for the removal of organic matter 81 82 nitrogen compounds 82 84 cr vi 85 cyanide and thiocyanate 86 while for drinking water it is favourable for the removal of nh3 n fe and mn to the best our knowledge there were no other contaminants from drinking water sources treated by the tf groundwater treatment by full scale tf had been studied by tekerlekopoulou et al 87 in the study under the effect of pollutant and hydraulic loading and temperature it showed that the full scale tf efficiently performed in removing nh3 n fe and mn the implementation of the tf changed the lives of the new vouprasio population relieving them from paying for bottled water and worrying about the water supply to their home another full scale tf was studied by de vet et al 89 for the removal of fe from the groundwater michalakos et al 88 investigated the removal of fe from potable water under a high hydraulic loading of 453 677 m3 m2 day they concluded that the fe removal using a combination of biological and physicochemical tf was more efficient compared to the physicochemical tf alone the height and size of the packing medium in the tf influences the performance of the tf under similar hydraulic loading tekerlekopoulou et al 79 found that a monolayer tf with a 1 9 mm gravel size could totally eliminated mn from the potable water the performance was not comparable with the multiple layer tf with packing with variable gravel sizes up to 3 9 mm this indicates that the performance of tf is better with a small and single size of packing material the tf was also reported to simultaneously remove nh3 n fe and mn additionally as reported by gouzinis et al 77 tekerlekopoulou and vayenas 80 and tekerlekopoulou et al 87 the tf system could be applied for the simultaneous removal of nh3 n fe and mn this ability will reduce the number of unit operations in eliminating the contaminants from the contaminated drinking water some researchers reported that the microbial community plays a key role in the efficient removal of contaminants by tf in the study by de vet et al 89 the community of gallionella sp was closely monitored to ensure the bio oxidation of fe but the other species communities in the groundwater and tf packing media that is believed to also be responsible for the removal was not reported gouzinis et al 77 also did not report about the microbial community in detail reported by akker et al 78 under a low influent nh3 n concentration a significant amount of the nitrosomonas population was established on the tkp 312 polypropylene packing media the lacking information or investigation on the microbial population in the biological tf system for the drinking water treatment might be due to the biosafety issue regarding pathogenic microorganisms this issue will be discussed in detail later 3 4 biological aerated filter baf 3 4 1 principles and design operating of baf the biological aerated filter baf is well known in wastewater treatment but not for water treatment this system combined the attached and suspended growth processes the baf system is different from the bac ssf and rsf the term aerated shows that it must be supplied an aeration for the aerobic microorganisms to grow and co assist in the degradation and remediation of pollutants unlike the bac ssf and rsf that operated without aeration supply the baf can be designed in a rectangular square or column shape either with an up flow or down flow influent configuration the design shape can vary but this system must have an aeration configuration backwashing system and biofilm carrier floating or submerged media fig 5 shows the schematic of the baf for the drinking water treatment as studied by 90 92 the shape of the baf system will influence the oxygen transfer rate otr to the biofilms where a higher surface area will increase the otr and vice versa whereas the aeration system must be efficient enough to ensure that the do in the baf is at an appropriate level for the biofilm growth and pollutants removal an aeration system that is inefficient in supplying the air will lead to slow biofilm growth or may cause damage and consequently low performance in pollutants removal from contaminated water the operating conditions are a crucial part of the design due to the differences in the otr for each microorganism for each pollutant at a low aeration intensity some bacteria such as manganese oxidizing bacteria could perform well in removing manganese but not the ammonia oxidizing bacteria which requires a higher aeration intensity 90 in addition a backwash system is required to remove the excessive microbial biomass in the baf system and to prevent the biofilm carrier from clogging once the water head loss in the baf drops the backwashing system can be operated according to han et al 93 the backwashing system was operated once per 15 days in the summer and once per 7 days in the winter while hasan et al 94 operated the backwashing system every two weeks depending on the sampling and removal performance biofilm carriers that have been used in the baf system are types of floating media such as polypropylene media 95 96 and polyethylene media 97 and submerged media such as lava 93 and zeolite 97 pebbles and ceramite 98 basically submerged media has the adsorption capability so the pollutants will initially be removed through the adsorption mechanism followed by the degradation mechanism by the biofilm unlike the submerged media the floating media just acts as a support media for the biofilm and the removal mechanism only involves the biofilm role itself 3 4 2 performance of baf system 3 4 2 1 single treatment the performance of the baf system for drinking water treatment can be influenced by many operating factors such as the aeration flow rate hydraulic retention time or hydraulic loading loading rate of pollutants types of biofilm carriers and microbial community to the best of our knowledge there is no investigation of the backwash effect on the baf performance for the drinking water treatment but for wastewater treatment this factor is a priority 99 101 different from the other technologies there is a lack of studies using baf for water treatment from the literature few researchers investigated this system for water treatment the researchers focused on the removal of nh4 n 92 93 diclofenac 102 dissolved organic carbon 103 manganese 92 93 and ferum 104 previous researchers 90 92 94 95 105 106 had extensively investigated the baf performance in the simultaneous removal of cod nh4 n and mn2 in their study the researchers investigated the kinetics of the simultaneous removals the effective microbes involved the influence of the aeration rate and control of the do through on off aeration supply han et al 93 applied the baf system for the removal of nh4 n and mn2 from polluted drinking water sources the operating factors of the hydraulic loading and aeration intensity affecting the performance were investigated and the results showed that the hydraulic loading increased from 3 56 to 7 12 m3 m2 h which had a significance effect on the removals alongside the baf height meanwhile they found that a low aeration intensity had a positive effect of the mn2 removal but not for the nh4 n removal due to oxygen competition between the aob and mnob on the hand han et al 97 also investigated the removal of nh4 n and organic matters from the drinking water using a double layer baf filled with clinoptilolite and polyethylene media compared with a single baf using lava they concluded that the dual layer baf was easier to maintain since the backwashing frequency is less compared to the single layer baf by using submerged media such as lava sand zeolite or activated carbon the clogging problem occurs easier it may be because the void space between the media is less whereas floating media such polyethylene and polypropylene media has larger void spaces which can reduce the potential of the clogging problem occurring nevertheless both media have their own advantages and disadvantages to ensure the effective performance of the baf system in drinking water treatment 3 4 2 2 integrated with other technology the performance of the baf system in treating contaminated drinking water sources can be enhanced by integrating it with other process to enhance the removal of doc nh4 n and no2 n by the baf system han et al 103 integrated the system with a pre oxidation process using a permanganate composite chemical ppc the dose of 0 6 mg l ppc modified the structure of the doc to the simplest structure making it easier to be degraded in baf system although the addition of ppc in the contaminated drinking water did not show a negative effect on the aob growth 103 other pre oxidation chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ozone must be investigated to ensure its toxicity levels towards biofilms thus prevents the negative effect on the baf performance another example of a baf integrated with other process was the study by he et al 102 where the researchers combined the baf with electron beam eb technology eb baf for the degradation of diclofenac dfc at a 1 kgy gamma irradiation almost 100 of the dfc was degraded to other by products and by combining the technologies the water quality was improved with not only the dfc degradation but also for other pollutants such as cod and nh4 n 102 integrating eb baf may be efficient for the drinking water treatment in small scale but to implement it in full scale this integration must be thoroughly investigated including investigating the variation of pollutants in the water and the effect of radiation towards the biofilm community in the baf system some question include how can the eb treat a gallon of water for continuous distribution what is the cost of the technology and how would the increased radiation when handling this technology affect humans 3 5 membrane bioreactor 3 5 1 principles and design operating of membrane bioreactor the process of using the membrane bioreactor mbr for drinking water treatment was first proposed in the 1980s and the first membrane bioreactor plant was built in france in 1988 107 this technology may overcome the problem of microbiological contamination of treated water and support the growth and formation of a selected microorganism biomass in the reactor which can also act slowly by removing the biodegradable refractory organic contaminants 108 the mbr has dual functions and can be applied for the separation of the solid and liquid phases by using membranes such as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro whereas all processes produce permeate and retentate the separation ranges are as follows 0 1 to 1 μm mf 0 005 to 0 1 μm uf 0 001 to 0 005 μm nf and 0 0001 to 0 001 μm ro 109 the mf aims to remove of particles sediment algae bacteria and protozoa while the uf membranes target the elimination of small colloids and viruses the nf membrane targets the elimination of dissolved organic matters and divalent ions lastly the ro which is a non porous membrane is capable of removing monovalent ions however according to the literature survey most of the studies are using mf and uf for the separation it is impossible to use high quality membranes such as nf and ro due to problem in the separation process where high pressure and power are required to extract clean water from the membranes in addition the biofilm biomass causes a fouling problem which will also contribute to the high pressure requirement the membranes used in mbr are made up of polymers for example polyvinyl fluoride pvdf polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polyethersulfone pes polyamide pa polyacrylonitrile pan and poly amide hydrazide pah the most important characteristic of the polymer material is hydrophobicity and all the polymers listed above are hydrophobic hydrophobicity will occur as the interactions between the surface of the membrane and the components present in the feed water 110 the membrane can be a hollow fibre or flat sheet membrane which is submerged in the reactor containing the bacteria biomass at initial development the mbr is developed as a suspended growth membrane bioreactor susmbr but currently the reactor designs are innovated as an attached growth membrane bioreactor attmbr and an ion exchange membrane bioreactor imebr fig 6 shows the schematic principles design of the mbr system the accumulation of bacteria biofilm at the surface of the membrane effects the decreasing in permeate flux or an increasing in the transmembrane pressure tmp during a membrane process this loss in performance of the mbr process is called membrane fouling which it is the result of several complex occurrences involving electrostatic and hydrophobic processes membrane fouling is one of the main limitations of the mbr process for drinking water treatment 109 110 additionally mbr technology is also facing several research challenges such as mbr standardization membrane life span and operation cost 111 3 5 2 performance of mbr the biological suspended growth reactor is combined with the membranes in the mbr to act as a separation device to solve some of the problems such as denitrification of nitrate 108 112 115 ammonia removal 116 and reduction of total organic carbon toc 116 form the literature survey it was found that most of the researchers used mbr for the removal of nitrate ravnjak et al 114 achieved high nitrate removal from polluted groundwater by using a two stage membrane bioreactor anoxic and oxic in the study a pe membrane with a pore size of 0 4 μm combined with a biochip carrier was used in oxic but in the anoxic zone only biocontact n carriers were used to enhance the nitrate removal applying a biofilm carrier in the mbr would enhance the contact area between the biofilm and the pollutants compared to the conventional mbr that only applies the suspended growth processes however this innovation showed a good nitrate removal but maintaining both biofilm carriers in the anoxic and oxic zone is difficult and over a long period the carrier will settle to the bottom tank due to the high density of the dead biomass moreover in the study by ravnjak et al 114 the membrane zone was located in an oxic zone which would increase the fouling problem and shorten the membrane lifetime the fouling can be controlled through as reported by mcadam and judd 113 the mbr can removed high nitrate in the water by manipulating the c n ratio using different carbon sources such as methanol and ethanol for the biofilm metabolism in addition to the nitrate removal manipulating the c n ratio could also increase the hydrogen production during the treatment which can be beneficial for the dwt operation even though the membrane could easily be fouled due to biofilm attachment on its surface for a long term operation it can degrade the high molecule organic compounds that are retained in the mbr which consequently prevents the formation of thms in the treated water some researchers have investigated the technique by embedding nanoparticle on the membrane surface to keep the membrane from fouling although it shows good performance in controlling the fouling the embedding process requires a sticky procedure and is difficult and requires a high cost for full scale production to obtain high quality drinking water conventional mbr has been innovated through the application of ion exchange mbr iembr the iembr has good potential not only for macropollutants removal but also for anionic micropollutants such as perchlorate 117 and bromate 118 as an example a study by ricardo et al 117 uses iembr for the removal of nitrate and perchlorate from drinking water the biofilm attached on the membrane surface plays an important role for both pollutants reduction in the study heterotrophic denitrifiers biofilm take the first action to remove nitrate then it is followed by the perchlorate reducing biofilm which removes the perchlorate to ensure that the iembr performs well an electron donor such as ethanol must be added to the reactor for the biofilm metabolism however not controlling the addition of the electron donor would increase the acetic acid production which will reduce the ph and provide unsuitable conditions for biofilm growth 3 6 other biofiltration system 3 6 1 moving bed biofilm reactor the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr is a type of wastewater treatment process that was first invented by hallvard ødegaard at norwegian university of science and technology in 1989 mbbr is well known in wastewater treatment but there has been very limited study on its use for drinking water treatment mbbr was developed based on the concept of combining the conventional activated sludge process and the biofilm process this technology is a completely mixed and continuous operation and it can withstand a high density of biomass but omit clogs in the reactor and sludge recycling 119 the biological treatment process is taking place when the microorganisms that are attached at the carrier element will be in moving their position within the mbbr system 120 121 aerobic mbbrs use a diffused aeration system to uniformly move the biofilm carriers and meet the oxygen requirements while operated in the anaerobic condition the carrier movements are distributed by mechanical mixers 122 rodgers and zhan 123 stated that the biofilm thickness not only can be controlled by air flow but also by mechanical mixing energy the diffused aeration will be provided from the bottom of the mbbr and the inflow of water is coming from the top of the mbbr 124 the increasing biomass concentration inside the mbbr was developed by increasing the amount of supporting media and lowering the head loss 144 the carrier element in the mbbr process will preferably be made up of material that is less dense than water such as polyethylene polypropylene polymer foam pads polyvinyl alcohol gel polyurethane sponge and granular activated carbon mcquarrie and boltz 122 found that the high density of plastic biofilm carriers 0 98 g cm3 reduces the carrier s tendency to float and so power is needed to uniformly move the carriers however these carriers will slightly float with densities between 0 94 and 0 96 g cm3 in addition they also stated that a plastic biofilm carrier in the mbbr should increase the volume up to 67 of the empty bed liquid volume mbbr may be made up as a single reactor or as several reactors in series normally mbbr is designed with length to width ratio l w in the range of 0 5 1 to 1 5 1 however if the mmbr design is greater than that non uniform free moving plastic biofilm carriers will be distributed throughout the bioreactor as a result the oxygen transfer efficiency and hydraulic capacity of the plastic biofilm carrier retention screens are reduced 122 the performance of the mbbr technology is based on several parameters that need to be considered they are the aeration system 122 123 125 biofilm 126 flow configuration 127 types and characteristics of the media 122 loading rate 124 and filling fraction 128 this simple and strong biological treatment process is suitable for the treatment of nitrogen compounds from polluted raw water but currently there are no other types of contaminants has been studied to be removed from any type of drinking water resources using this technology some of the studies such as the investigation by zhang et al 129 focused on the responsibility of the nitrifying community on the nitrogen compounds removal the lack of interest by researchers to use mbbr for drinking water treatment may be due to the additional requirement of unit processes such as floatation or clarifier for the biomass separation and the high percentage of microbial contamination in the treated water due to high microbial biomass amounts passing thorough the mbbr to the next process 3 6 2 fluidized bed biofilm reactor biological drinking water treatment using a fluidized bed biofilm reactor fbbr was studied 30 decades ago by kurt et al 130 for the removal of nitrate the basic concept of fbbr technology is that the contaminated water is pumped up flow through the biological bed at a sufficient velocity to fluidize the granular media bed currently there are very few reports of using fbbr in drinking water treatment this may be related to the design and operation of the fbbr where the carriers used in the reactor must be in the fluidized condition this condition can only be achieved by manipulating the influent flow to a certain velocity a high velocity of influent flow rate would result in a biomass wash out from the fbbr however some of the advantages of this fbbr process are the non cloggable biofilm reactor where backwashing is not required 131 132 and it is easy to manage 131 the types of contaminants removed from drinking water sources by fbbr were toc thm and ammonia which were investigated by xie et al 132 while burghate and ingole 131 investigated the removal of nitrate based on xie et al 132 the reduction of toc was low at only 12 6 while the reduction of thmfp and haafp was significant and the ammonia was reduced 30 to 40 temperature below 3 however the reduction rose to over 50 when the temperature increased above 3 on the other hand the maximum removal efficiency for nitrate was 91 at an hrt of 30 min and optimum removal efficiency was 86 at an hrt of 10 min 131 in the study conducted by xie et al 132 nitrosomonas and nitrobacter were used for biological nitrification both groups of bacteria are autotrophic and they use carbon dioxide as the carbon source for biosynthesis and the oxidation of nitrogen compounds as the energy source 4 integrated combining technologies integrating two different processes is a wise action for upgrading the drinking water treatment technology to ensure that the treated water meets the standard discharge limits as regulated by the legislation integrated systems for the biodwt include the membrane coagulation bioreactor mcbr the bac mbr has been studied by researchers for obtaining the highest quality of treated drinking water 4 1 membrane coagulation bioreactor the membrane coagulation bioreactor mcbr is a combination of the coagulation and membrane filtration process and has been successfully applied to drinking water treatment 133 134 liu et al 135 and tian et al 136 stated that the coagulation process is the most effective pretreatment technology for the mitigation of membrane fouling prolong the membrane life span and the improving the permeate quality by using the mcbr process the conventional treatment plant units i e coagulation flocculation sedimentation and filtration can be eliminated from the treatment process in mcbr technology the performance is dependent on the upward internal circulation flow of water in the membrane separation region that is induced by air lift causing the water in the reactor and the feed water into the reactor to be mixed and flocculated when the water in reactor is flocculated continuously this will make the fine particles become larger and mitigate the membrane fouling this is because smaller particles easily deposit onto the membrane surface which is the main factor of membrane fouling due to blocking the membrane pores the mcbr has performed well in the removal of microorganisms and particulates denitrification and phosphate removal tian et al 136 found that mcbr achieved much higher removal efficiencies of organic matter such as total organic carbon toc and dissolved organic carbon doc compared to mbr which is caused by polyaluminium chloride pacl coagulation in the bioreactor in addition this mcbr process effectively removed the biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc and assimilable organic carbon aoc which were respectively 8 2 and 10 1 higher than with the mbr there is still a lack of research on this technology for the biodwt some suggestion for future research are to investigate the effect of the coagulant types on the performance using organic coagulants such chitosan would provide a benefit to the performance not only for the treatment but it can also be a nutrient for the biofilm growth in the system moreover the type of membrane can also be considered for good water quality production according to another study by tian et al 137 the mcbr can be modified by adding an adsorbent such pac to enhance the removal of organic matter but this type of technology may require extensive maintenance and a process to separate the pac 4 2 biological activated carbon membrane bioreactor the combination of the biological activated carbon and membrane bioreactor bac mbr has been evaluated for drinking water treatment by several researchers 134 138 139 the design setup of the bac mbr can be seen in fig 7 the combination of the bac to mbr not only improves the quality of the treated water but the bac could mitigate the membrane fouling issues even though this type of hybrid system is easier to maintain this technology is still receiving the researchers attention compared to the mcabr where only one unit is required for two functions in combining the technologies of bac mbr tian et al 134 concluded that the bac was capable of enhancing the removal of high amounts of organic matter and ammonium by the adsorption and biodegradation process as well as mitigating the membrane fouling in the downstream mbr conversely the mbr could eliminate organic matter and ammonium in the biodegradation process as well as separating particles in the bac effluent moreover tian et al 134 studied one of the fundamental parameters of water quality in drinking water treatment which is turbidity which represents the particles in water initially the turbidity in the raw water was 1 88 0 62 ntu on average as a result of the bac performance the removal efficiency was 59 7 12 7 with 0 70 0 16 ntu still remaining in the effluent however the mbr exhibited an excellent turbidity removal capacity which is 0 06 0 02 ntu through the separation of the membrane in operating the bac and mbr the microbial community can be different focusing on the degradation of specific groups of contaminants thus it can improve the treated water quality where it is difficult to achieve at a high level in only a one unit system 5 challenges in biological drinking water treatment drinking water is one of earth s most precious resources increased demand for high quality and safe drinking water production has led biological treatment technology to fulfil this demand webber 140 stated that there are many questions about the suitability capacity reliability and safety of using this biological water treatment technology however there are some threats to the drinking water sources that should not be underestimated one of them is the anthropogenic activities in industrial areas that caused the quantity and quality of water available for human consumption to decline consequently based on a review by benner et al 141 they found 133 micropollutants i e pesticides and pharmaceuticals in both the raw and finished drinking water not only micropollutants some other major contaminants such as heavy metals organic and inorganic matters and nitrogen compounds must be eliminated from the drinking water in this technology microorganisms are used to catalyse biochemical oxidation or reduction of drinking water contaminants and to produce biologically stable water 3 however the uncontrolled growth of microorganisms can occur during the drinking water treatment and distribution this issue can lead to hygiene problems such as the development of opportunistic pathogens deterioration in taste smell and colour or the biological corrosion of pipes 142 a better understanding of the interaction of bacteria in the distribution system and the environmental conditions is necessary to better control the bacteria during the treatment and distribution of drinking water in this review a few challenges of the biodwt were highlighted as summarized in fig 8 the treating of drinking water biologically may cause exposure to pathogenic microorganism contaminations such as e coli the diversity of pathogenic and non pathogenic microorganisms is difficult to control in biological treatment due to the factors of the raw water characteristic which always vary and contribute to the microorganism growth in the biodwt an assessment of microorganism in the schmutzdecke of the biosand filter for the treatment of river water showed that pathogen strains are a dominating group in the schmutzdecke layer compared to the non pathogens 143 introducing the effective non pathogenic microorganism in the start up may prevent the dominating of the pathogens present in the schmutzdecke or biofilm it is difficult to achieve good pollutants removal simultaneously in a one unit treatment system the microorganisms in the reactor must be diverse to ensure all pollutants in the raw water can be treated selectivity of microorganisms towards specific contaminants may overcome the inefficiency of biodwt for raw water treatment as an example the community of nitrospira and nitrosomonas has been reported to be only capable of treating nitrogen compounds but to treat other pollutants such as heavy metals it requires other types of microorganism groups however a specific genus of microorganism has the ability to remove various types of pollutants as an example genus sphingomonas is a good choice for the removal of terpene 2 methylisoborneol mib soproturon polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and lindane thus before start up the biodwt selection of specific microbials or general microbials as a seeding is important to ensure the stability and good performance of the reactor during the treatment the community of the microbial will shift according to the times due to a few factors such as the quality of raw water and the operating conditions of treatment such as the ph hrt and the organic loading rate maintaining and monitoring the microbial community may pose challenges to maintaining the performance stability as reported by liao et al 69 at the early stage of treatment the microbial identification only achieved at class level but after operating for 160 days the identification was at genus level where its shows the microbial community change within the treatment period this condition may affect the bioreactor performance of either low performance or good performance the last challenge of the biological treatment to be applied for drinking water treatment is the consumer perspective and acceptance of the microbial contamination in the treated water consumers may be worried about the microbial contamination from the biological process itself in the treated drinking water without a proper explanation or information it is very difficult to convince consumers of the safeness of the biodwt before the biodwt can applied in the water treatment a survey on the consumer perspective and acceptance may conducted then information on this biodwt should be distributed to public 6 conclusion the biological process via biofilms is a relatively new concept and is considered a future technology for the production of high quality and safe drinking water a few technologies for contaminant removal from the level of micro up to the macro level have been discussed in this review paper even though these technologies are well known in developed countries in most developing countries the technology is still unacceptable by the water treatment practiser and consumer some of the technologies that have good potential for application in water treatment plants are ssf rsf bac and mbr or combinations of these processes these technologies can efficiently remove ammonia nitrate nitrite organic carbon heavy metals and various type of micropollutants nevertheless information on these technologies must be explained to the water treatment practiser and consumer so that it can be accepted to be applied in water treatment plants in developing countries declaration of competing interests the authors

14155,this paper is the first critical review of the technology of water treatment via biological process for contaminants removal from water resources the biological process is considered the future for drinking water treatment especially for developing countries the main focus of the review is on single and integrated treatment technologies that have been studied for all types of drinking water resources including surface water and ground water these treatment technologies have the capability to treat contaminants in polluted drinking water resources such as heavy metals natural organic matter inorganic non metallic matter disinfection by products endocrine disrupting chemicals and microbial contaminants the potential threats and challenges of using the biological process for safe drinking water production also have been discussed as this technology is a relatively new concept for safe drinking water production and there have been very limited studies performed in developing countries keywords biological drinking water treatment biofilms organic and inorganic removal micropollutants removal drinking water 1 introduction safe water is important for humans plants and animals for example humans need water as a role in the metabolic process to breakdown large substances into small substances and transport them to other parts of the body once the water has been contaminated by toxic compounds it must be treated before can be consumed by people similarly contaminated water will become hazardous to plants and animals if their metabolic process is exposed through drinking it by these living things the water contaminations occur because of a few key factors i e industrial and sewage effluent discharge agricultural industry illegal garbage disposal and leakage of leachate from landfills 1 even though most of the industrial businesses have their own wastewater treatment plants if the effluent is discharged every day the concentration of pollutants will accumulate and increase over long term periods this phenomenon will pose a serious problem in the future for drinking water treatment plants dwtps which use river water as their main sources for safe drinking water production most of the dwtps globally only use conventional treatment processes such as screening coagulation flocculation filtration and chlorination fluoridation these treatment processes do not have the ability to effectively treat pollutants such as organic carbon nitrogen compounds and heavy metals at high levels some dwtps have to shut down their operations periodically until the level of contaminations decrease naturally through dilution by raining because the effluents from industries can only be controlled thus to overcome the problem a new approach has to be implemented for the continuity of clean and safe drinking water production the biological process started to become popular for wastewater treatment in the early 1900s 2 but not for drinking water treatment although biological drinking water treatment biodwt has been used since the 1800s 3 its application globally is still limited recently some developed countries such as the usa canada greece croatia and china have applied the biodwt for clean and safe drinking water treatment but there have been very limited studies performed in developing countries the biodwt is totally dependent on the non pathogenic bacteria acting as biocatalyst for biochemical oxidation degrading the pollutants in the contaminated drinking water and producing biologically stable water to prevent the growth of microorganisms in the water distribution system 2 this study aims to comprehensively review the technology of biological treatment systems for safe drinking water production this review will cover all types of drinking water resources including surface water river lake and reservoir and ground water that have been treated using biological technology 2 contaminants in polluted drinking water and its regulation 2 1 heavy metals a metal is a material in the form of an element compound or alloy that is typically hard opaque shiny and has good thermal and electrical conductivity meanwhile a heavy metal is a metal with a specific gravity greater than 4 or 5 4 and have been associated with contamination and potential toxicity 5 heavy metals that are toxic are arsenic as copper cu zinc zn nickel ni chromium cr and plumbum pb exposure to heavy metals thorough ingestion or inhalation is dangerous because they tend to accumulate and are retained by the human body some of the adverse effect and limits of heavy metal contamination are listed in table 1 once the human body has accumulated these heavy metals it could potentially lead to kidney problem cd skin and lung cancers as and neurological problems hg 2 2 natural organic matter natural organic matter nom is usually present in surface and ground water this pollutant can also be present in soil waters it includes both humic hydrophobic and non humic fractions hydrophilic 17 fig 1 nom can be present in two forms i e particulate organic matter pom and dissolved organic matter doc the characteristics of nom depend on the source and season 18 nom is reported to not be harmful to human health but the reaction of this matter with chlorine during the chlorination process of drinking water treatment will form disinfection by products such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haa the classification of nom is depicted in fig 1 the hydrophobic nom is less soluble in water has a high molecular weight such as humic and fulvic acids 17 has rich aromatic carbon and has conjugated double bonds and phenolic structures 19 while hydrophilic nom is less reactive and contains more carbon and nitrogenous compounds 19 in canada there is no regulation for the level of humic acids in drinking water but this substance has been addressed in health canada s drinking water quality guideline on colour it is because the presence of humic acid in water causes colour odour and taste problems to increase 20 2 3 inorganic non metallic matter inorganic non metallic contaminants are compounds that contain no carbon or contain only carbon bound to elements other than hydrogen inorganic non metallic contaminants will be discussed in this section inorganic non metallic contaminants consist of nitrogen sulfate phosphate and chlorides nitrogen compounds have been classified as ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n if an infant is exposed to these nitrogen compounds in excess of the allowable limits it could lead to the blue baby syndrome 21 the allowable limits for nitrogen compounds are listed in table 1 there is no limit for the ammonia level in drinking water regulated by the us epa in malaysia the ammonia level has been regulated to below than 1 5 mg l for both untreated and treated drinking water sulfate is a chemical substance that occurs naturally in drinking water and its limit in drinking water is below than 250 mg l exposure to this contaminant at high level can causes diarrhoeal diseases 12 the presence of sulfate in drinking water at high levels may also cause the water to taste bitter sulfate can be anaerobically reduced to sulfide and then combined with hydrogen to form hydrogen sulfide gas once this gas accumulates in the drinking water piping system it can be corrosive due to the formation of sulfuric acid 22 the presence of natural chloride in surface and ground water are caused by the leaching of chloride containing rocks and soils 22 anthropogenic sources such as discharge from industrial sources landfill leachate agricultural sources and septic tanks also contribute to the contamination of chloride in surface and groundwater 13 2 4 disinfection by products disinfection by products dbps are formed from the reaction of organic matters with inorganic dpbs precursors and disinfectants such as chlorine chloramines and chlorine dioxide as depicted in fig 2 usually these contaminants occur during chlorination bleaching and washing processes such as from car wash and washing machine dbps can be classified into two major by products i e thms and haa haloacetonitriles hans are another type of dbp that form in small amounts during the chlorination process 23 thms are measured as total thms 0 08 mg l which consist of chloroform dibromochloromethane bromodichloromethane and bromoform 24 meanwhile haas are measured as a total of the five haas 0 06 mg l i e the sum of monochloroacetic acid trichloroacetic acid dichloroacetic acid bromate and chlorite however in malaysia only two of the most commons out of these five haas are monitored i e trichloroacetic 0 1 mg l and dichloroacetic acid 0 05 mg l it has been reported that exposure to dbps at high levels will cause increased of risk of cancer and adverse reproductive outcomes 14 and the risk of intrauterine growth retardation 15 2 5 endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs many of the endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs may be present in surface and ground water edcs can be classified to four groups i e pesticides residue ddt methoxychlor endosulfan highly chlorinated compounds polychlorinated biphenyls dioxin furan alkylphenols and alkylphenolethoxylates nonylphenol octylphenol and plastic additives bisphenol a diethyl phthalate di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate among this group ddt methoxychlor pcbs endosulfan diethylhexylphthalate diethylphthalate bisphenol a perchlorate may occur in drinking water this contaminant can be found in various materials such as metals pesticides additives in food and personal care products edcs may interfere with the endocrine system which can cause adverse reproductive health effects including sperm count decline hypospadias and cryptorchidism and cancer of the breasts and testes 25 the regulation limits for pesticides residue such as ddt methoxychlor and endosulfan for the malaysian drinking water regulation are 0 002 mg l ddt and methoxychlor and 0 03 mg l endosulfan the usepa 26 has regulated that the concentration of polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxin must not higher than 0 0005 and 3 10 8 mg l respectively this regulation indicates that edcs in water are very strictly monitored due to their worse effects on the human endocrine system 2 6 microbial contamination contamination of microbial pathogens in drinking water causes diarrhoeal diseases microbial contamination includes total coliform faecal coliform and escherichia coli legionella giardia lamblia cryptosporidium and viruses contamination by these microorganisms usually comes from human and animal faecal waste that contains pathogenic microorganisms the pathogenic microorganism must be killed or removed from the drinking water before it is safe to drink the usepa 146 has regulated that the total coliform in drinking must be less than 5 of the samples in a month while malaysian government has regulated that the microbial contaminant must be totally removed from drinking water 3 single technology of biological water treatment 3 1 slow and rapid sand biofiltration 3 1 1 principles of ssf and rsf slow sand and rapid sand filters are conventionally used in drinking water treatment processing either by developed or developing countries the basic principle of a sand filter is to physically filter out the suspended solids or particles from the water the application of a sand filter has expanded because researchers have discovered its advantages in treating water the main advantage of a sand filter is that it not only separates the suspended solids and particles from the water but also other chemical constituents including micropollutants 27 nitrogen compounds 28 29 heavy metals 30 31 pesticide 32 and biological contaminants pathogenic microorganisms such as human pathogenic viruses and bacteria 33 the outstanding performance of the sand filter in removing contaminants from drinking water is due to the active biological activity present at the upper layer of the sand filter consequently upgrading the conventional sand filter system to a combination physical and biological sand filter there are two types of biological sand filters bsf i e the slow sand filter ssf and the rapid sand filter rsf these two sand biofiltration systems have commonly been designed in various shapes either in a column vessel rectangular or square polyethylene water tank or a concrete tank depending on the scale of treatment which can vary from a household to a full scale drinking water production plant the major difference between these two systems are the filtration rates the ssf have a slower filtration rate typically 0 1 to 0 2 mh 1 compared to the rsf 5 7 5 mh 1 epa 145 from the data analysis summarized in table 2 the size of the sand particles in the ssf was smaller sand size range 0 45 1 2 mm compared with the rsf sand size range 0 45 5 0 mm 3 1 2 schmutzdecke of ssf and rsf the ssf system is based on a centuries old bioremediation concept where water flows slowly through a sand packing and microorganisms or so called biologically active schmutzdecke form and grow at the top and within the sand packing 38 the advantages of the ssf are that it is simple to operate is an efficient and reliable system and requires low operating and capital cost 28 the ssf system removes the contaminants through a few mechanisms such as schmutzdecke activity at top layer surface catalysed degradation and mechanical filtration 28 fig 3 shows a thick layer matrix of schmutzdecke containing extracellular polymeric that attached to the sand surface 3 1 3 performance of ssf and rsf the performance of the ssf in removing contaminants depends on the water quality surface ripening and temperature 33 the rsf system can be designed either in open gravitational flow filters or in closed pressure filters 39 the rsf system is operated by pouring the water in a downward flow configuration through a sand filter to remove suspended solids 40 this system can separate more ss in a shorter period compared to the ssf 41 the efficiency of sand biofiltration application has been studied by researchers for removing pollutants from various types of drinking water resources such as surface water lake and river water and ground water and some of researchers used simulated contaminated potable water as summarized in table 2 the biological systems are applied either in a laboratory pilot or full scale drinking water treatment plant from the data summarized in table 2 ssf sand media are smaller than the rsf media with particle sizes between 0 29 the smallest to 1 2 the biggest the types of contaminants removed by sand biofiltration are pathogenic viruses and bacteria 33 42 46 metals 30 31 36 47 nitrogen compounds 28 29 34 36 37 48 50 pesticide 32 pharmaceutical chemicals 27 organic chemicals such as 2 methylisoborneol mib and trans 1 10 dimethyl trans 9 decalol geosmin 35 methyl tert butyl ether mtbe 51 dissolved organic carbon 49 50 dbps precursors 49 50 perchlorate 48 nom 52 and bisphenol 53 viruses and bacteria are biological pollutants that were investigated by researchers to be removed by sand biofiltration bacteriophage ms2 and escherichia coli wr1 present in contaminated potable water were investigated by schijven et al 33 to be removed using a pilot scale ssf under the various factors of temperature filtration rate grain sizes and schmutzdecke age the age of the schmutzdecke and the grain sizes were found to contribute to the significance of the removal of bacteriophage ms2 0 08 3 3 log10 removal and e coli wr1 0 94 with 4 5 log10 removal another study by jenkins et al 54 of an intermittent ssf equipped for a household could remove 0 94 log ms2 viruses 88 5 and 1 82 log faecal coliform 98 5 with a filtration rate of 0 01 0 03 m h yahya et al 46 achieved more than 99 removal of ms2 and prd1 stauber et al 55 also reported that sampling of 55 household filters near bonao dominican republic resulted in approximately 93 e coli removal nitrogen compounds nh4 n and no3 n are two famous contaminants in drinking water resources by using ssf and rsf more than 95 of these two compounds have been successfully removed 28 37 49 50 however cai et al 29 only achieved 46 6 of nh4 n removal from simulated contaminated drinking water using an ssf system in their studies but the removal increased on average to 48 5 when the loading of nh4 n increased on the other hand rsf would also be a good alternative system for removing nh4 n from groundwater lopato et al 56 found that the removal occurred through a heterogeneous mechanism by the ammonia oxidizing bacteria not only nitrogen compounds but also metals such as fe and mn that are naturally present in drinking water resources can be treated using ssf and rsf systems the rsf has been investigated by lee et al 36 li et al 31 and štembal et al 57 for the removal of fe and mn from groundwater while the ssf system was investigated to remove as 30 58 and se 47 at a high filtration rate of 8 m h the rsf system could remove more than 95 of fe and mn 31 the ssf and rsf systems do not require aeration or an oxygen supply creating anaerobic conditions at the middle and bottom parts of these systems an anaerobic ssf has the capability to efficiently remove se through the dissimilatory reduction of selenate to elemental selenium mechanism that is affected by the hydraulic loading rate hlr 47 3 2 biological activated carbon bac 3 2 1 principles and design of bac the process of biological activated carbon bac was first proposed by g w miller and r g rice in 1978 who are from the united states and switzerland respectively 59 60 according to jin et al 59 the advantage of the microbial growing on the ac layer was first affirmed by parkhrust and his partners in 1967 since then bac technology has become an essential process for advanced water treatment in developed countries such as america switzerland holland and japan 59 but in developing countries such as malaysia indonesia russia turkey and others this technology is consider as an alternative system for water treatment in japan the bac system has been used as advanced water treatment by large urban water systems since the early 1990s 61 the bac is developed on the activated carbon ac covered with a microbial which is called biofilm this technology combines the dual mechanisms of adsorption and biodegradation bio oxidation to enhance the effectiveness of drinking water 62 the unique characteristics of ac such as the large surface area ability to adsorb organic materials and the rough surface texture are major factors of bacteria attachment 63 the simple design of the bac system commonly consists of activated carbon a reactor column feeding pump and tank this system does not require an aeration supply but depends on the pollutants to be removed because some microbials especially aerobic microbes require dissolved oxygen do from an electron acceptor for the growth and pollutants degradation as depicted in fig 4 the aerobic bac process requires do for the growth instead of the anaerobic process there is symbiotic interaction between ac and microorganisms where the ac acts as the carrier of microbes in the form of biofilm while the microbes promote the regeneration of ac the bioregeneration of the organic substrate saturated ac occurs through the mechanism of organic substrate consumption by the microorganism as a source of energy and food 64 3 2 2 activated carbon there are various types of activated carbon that have been used worldwide for wastewater treatment processes such as crab shells 65 papaya peels biowaste 66 coal 49 50 and sugarcane bagasse 67 as summarized in table 3 activated carbon is only specifically used for the bac system where at certain period the ac has reached it saturated capacity of adsorption and during the meantime the removal of contaminants is mainly performed by the active microbe attached on the ac surface and only slightly by the ac even though some of the researchers reported that the adsorption and biodegradation of organic contaminants can occurs simultaneously and the adsorption of ac is bioregenerated by the microorganism the mechanisms of simultaneous adsorption biodegradation and bioregeneration are not well identified 3 2 3 performance of bac the removal of various types of contaminants using the bac system has been studied such as nitrogenous compounds 70 71 73 organic carbon 75 68 and micropollutants 62 74 yapsakli et al 70 investigated the removal of nh4 n using two types of activated carbon that were prepared using different methods chemical activation cagran and heat activation norit 1240 in the study the cagran media did not adsorb nh4 n at the initial stage of treatment as norit 1240 had done the removal only occurred after day 12 to the acclimatization of aob in the biofilter compared to the norit 1240 where the removal occurred immediately at day 0 due to sorption effect another study by kim et al 73 using pac found that up to 93 of nh4 n can be removed using pac media however the species of microorganism community involved in the process was not investigated only the biofilm density through heterotrophic counting plates was reported recently bac reactors have received researcher intention for the removal of micropollutants from surface water li et al 62 investigated the elimination of 17β estradiol e2 from surface water using a bac reactor filled with a calgon filtrasorb 400 f400 coal based gac media without seeds of any microorganism the bac was able to remove e2 up to 100 and at the end of the monitoring microbial activities were visually observed to naturally develop mckie at al 2016 researched the combination of exhausted gac sand media in the bac reactor with and without the inline addition of alum 0 2 and 0 8 mg l for the removal of spiked edcs and phacs the addition of alum improved the bac performances in removing both micropollutants in the study by mckie et al 74 there was no microbial community reported but the removals are believed to occur due to the microbial activities the reason is because the age of the gac used in the study was 4 years of operation and it was affirmed to have no adsorption capabilities more advanced bac systems were developed by lompe et al 76 that had mixed pac with iron oxide nanoparticles to improve the efficiency of the bac reactor which consequently changed the conventional bac to a magnetic bac mbac the iron oxide nanoparticle not only contributed to doc and ammonia removals but it is suitable to support the growth of nitrifying and heterotrophic bacteria 3 3 trickling filter tf 3 3 1 principles and design operating of tf a trickling filter is a fixed film biofilter using packing medium for the biofilm attachment the biofilm that develops on the packing medium contains microorganisms that are useful for the biodegradation of the contaminants there are three keys component of the tf design i e the rotary distributor packing medium and air circulation the influent of water is designed at the top of the packing medium through the rotating distribution arms packing mediums such as rock or plastic are common mediums for the conventional tf operation to treat wastewater and there a few that have been used for drinking water treatment such as gravel 77 tkp 312 polypropylene 78 and silicic gravel 79 to increase the treatment efficiency to maintain air circulation an underdrain system is designed at the bottom of the tf thus giving the advantage of not requiring an external air supply for the operation 80 additionally the underdrain is useful not only for the air circulation but also for the effluent of the tf however some researchers designed an external air supply to the tf system such as the study by gouzinis et al 77 that used a 10 l min air flow rate 3 3 2 performance of tf as seen in table 4 the application of the tf for the contaminant removal from drinking water sources are not as varied compared to the wastewater in wastewater treatment the tf is applied for the removal of organic matter 81 82 nitrogen compounds 82 84 cr vi 85 cyanide and thiocyanate 86 while for drinking water it is favourable for the removal of nh3 n fe and mn to the best our knowledge there were no other contaminants from drinking water sources treated by the tf groundwater treatment by full scale tf had been studied by tekerlekopoulou et al 87 in the study under the effect of pollutant and hydraulic loading and temperature it showed that the full scale tf efficiently performed in removing nh3 n fe and mn the implementation of the tf changed the lives of the new vouprasio population relieving them from paying for bottled water and worrying about the water supply to their home another full scale tf was studied by de vet et al 89 for the removal of fe from the groundwater michalakos et al 88 investigated the removal of fe from potable water under a high hydraulic loading of 453 677 m3 m2 day they concluded that the fe removal using a combination of biological and physicochemical tf was more efficient compared to the physicochemical tf alone the height and size of the packing medium in the tf influences the performance of the tf under similar hydraulic loading tekerlekopoulou et al 79 found that a monolayer tf with a 1 9 mm gravel size could totally eliminated mn from the potable water the performance was not comparable with the multiple layer tf with packing with variable gravel sizes up to 3 9 mm this indicates that the performance of tf is better with a small and single size of packing material the tf was also reported to simultaneously remove nh3 n fe and mn additionally as reported by gouzinis et al 77 tekerlekopoulou and vayenas 80 and tekerlekopoulou et al 87 the tf system could be applied for the simultaneous removal of nh3 n fe and mn this ability will reduce the number of unit operations in eliminating the contaminants from the contaminated drinking water some researchers reported that the microbial community plays a key role in the efficient removal of contaminants by tf in the study by de vet et al 89 the community of gallionella sp was closely monitored to ensure the bio oxidation of fe but the other species communities in the groundwater and tf packing media that is believed to also be responsible for the removal was not reported gouzinis et al 77 also did not report about the microbial community in detail reported by akker et al 78 under a low influent nh3 n concentration a significant amount of the nitrosomonas population was established on the tkp 312 polypropylene packing media the lacking information or investigation on the microbial population in the biological tf system for the drinking water treatment might be due to the biosafety issue regarding pathogenic microorganisms this issue will be discussed in detail later 3 4 biological aerated filter baf 3 4 1 principles and design operating of baf the biological aerated filter baf is well known in wastewater treatment but not for water treatment this system combined the attached and suspended growth processes the baf system is different from the bac ssf and rsf the term aerated shows that it must be supplied an aeration for the aerobic microorganisms to grow and co assist in the degradation and remediation of pollutants unlike the bac ssf and rsf that operated without aeration supply the baf can be designed in a rectangular square or column shape either with an up flow or down flow influent configuration the design shape can vary but this system must have an aeration configuration backwashing system and biofilm carrier floating or submerged media fig 5 shows the schematic of the baf for the drinking water treatment as studied by 90 92 the shape of the baf system will influence the oxygen transfer rate otr to the biofilms where a higher surface area will increase the otr and vice versa whereas the aeration system must be efficient enough to ensure that the do in the baf is at an appropriate level for the biofilm growth and pollutants removal an aeration system that is inefficient in supplying the air will lead to slow biofilm growth or may cause damage and consequently low performance in pollutants removal from contaminated water the operating conditions are a crucial part of the design due to the differences in the otr for each microorganism for each pollutant at a low aeration intensity some bacteria such as manganese oxidizing bacteria could perform well in removing manganese but not the ammonia oxidizing bacteria which requires a higher aeration intensity 90 in addition a backwash system is required to remove the excessive microbial biomass in the baf system and to prevent the biofilm carrier from clogging once the water head loss in the baf drops the backwashing system can be operated according to han et al 93 the backwashing system was operated once per 15 days in the summer and once per 7 days in the winter while hasan et al 94 operated the backwashing system every two weeks depending on the sampling and removal performance biofilm carriers that have been used in the baf system are types of floating media such as polypropylene media 95 96 and polyethylene media 97 and submerged media such as lava 93 and zeolite 97 pebbles and ceramite 98 basically submerged media has the adsorption capability so the pollutants will initially be removed through the adsorption mechanism followed by the degradation mechanism by the biofilm unlike the submerged media the floating media just acts as a support media for the biofilm and the removal mechanism only involves the biofilm role itself 3 4 2 performance of baf system 3 4 2 1 single treatment the performance of the baf system for drinking water treatment can be influenced by many operating factors such as the aeration flow rate hydraulic retention time or hydraulic loading loading rate of pollutants types of biofilm carriers and microbial community to the best of our knowledge there is no investigation of the backwash effect on the baf performance for the drinking water treatment but for wastewater treatment this factor is a priority 99 101 different from the other technologies there is a lack of studies using baf for water treatment from the literature few researchers investigated this system for water treatment the researchers focused on the removal of nh4 n 92 93 diclofenac 102 dissolved organic carbon 103 manganese 92 93 and ferum 104 previous researchers 90 92 94 95 105 106 had extensively investigated the baf performance in the simultaneous removal of cod nh4 n and mn2 in their study the researchers investigated the kinetics of the simultaneous removals the effective microbes involved the influence of the aeration rate and control of the do through on off aeration supply han et al 93 applied the baf system for the removal of nh4 n and mn2 from polluted drinking water sources the operating factors of the hydraulic loading and aeration intensity affecting the performance were investigated and the results showed that the hydraulic loading increased from 3 56 to 7 12 m3 m2 h which had a significance effect on the removals alongside the baf height meanwhile they found that a low aeration intensity had a positive effect of the mn2 removal but not for the nh4 n removal due to oxygen competition between the aob and mnob on the hand han et al 97 also investigated the removal of nh4 n and organic matters from the drinking water using a double layer baf filled with clinoptilolite and polyethylene media compared with a single baf using lava they concluded that the dual layer baf was easier to maintain since the backwashing frequency is less compared to the single layer baf by using submerged media such as lava sand zeolite or activated carbon the clogging problem occurs easier it may be because the void space between the media is less whereas floating media such polyethylene and polypropylene media has larger void spaces which can reduce the potential of the clogging problem occurring nevertheless both media have their own advantages and disadvantages to ensure the effective performance of the baf system in drinking water treatment 3 4 2 2 integrated with other technology the performance of the baf system in treating contaminated drinking water sources can be enhanced by integrating it with other process to enhance the removal of doc nh4 n and no2 n by the baf system han et al 103 integrated the system with a pre oxidation process using a permanganate composite chemical ppc the dose of 0 6 mg l ppc modified the structure of the doc to the simplest structure making it easier to be degraded in baf system although the addition of ppc in the contaminated drinking water did not show a negative effect on the aob growth 103 other pre oxidation chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ozone must be investigated to ensure its toxicity levels towards biofilms thus prevents the negative effect on the baf performance another example of a baf integrated with other process was the study by he et al 102 where the researchers combined the baf with electron beam eb technology eb baf for the degradation of diclofenac dfc at a 1 kgy gamma irradiation almost 100 of the dfc was degraded to other by products and by combining the technologies the water quality was improved with not only the dfc degradation but also for other pollutants such as cod and nh4 n 102 integrating eb baf may be efficient for the drinking water treatment in small scale but to implement it in full scale this integration must be thoroughly investigated including investigating the variation of pollutants in the water and the effect of radiation towards the biofilm community in the baf system some question include how can the eb treat a gallon of water for continuous distribution what is the cost of the technology and how would the increased radiation when handling this technology affect humans 3 5 membrane bioreactor 3 5 1 principles and design operating of membrane bioreactor the process of using the membrane bioreactor mbr for drinking water treatment was first proposed in the 1980s and the first membrane bioreactor plant was built in france in 1988 107 this technology may overcome the problem of microbiological contamination of treated water and support the growth and formation of a selected microorganism biomass in the reactor which can also act slowly by removing the biodegradable refractory organic contaminants 108 the mbr has dual functions and can be applied for the separation of the solid and liquid phases by using membranes such as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro whereas all processes produce permeate and retentate the separation ranges are as follows 0 1 to 1 μm mf 0 005 to 0 1 μm uf 0 001 to 0 005 μm nf and 0 0001 to 0 001 μm ro 109 the mf aims to remove of particles sediment algae bacteria and protozoa while the uf membranes target the elimination of small colloids and viruses the nf membrane targets the elimination of dissolved organic matters and divalent ions lastly the ro which is a non porous membrane is capable of removing monovalent ions however according to the literature survey most of the studies are using mf and uf for the separation it is impossible to use high quality membranes such as nf and ro due to problem in the separation process where high pressure and power are required to extract clean water from the membranes in addition the biofilm biomass causes a fouling problem which will also contribute to the high pressure requirement the membranes used in mbr are made up of polymers for example polyvinyl fluoride pvdf polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polyethersulfone pes polyamide pa polyacrylonitrile pan and poly amide hydrazide pah the most important characteristic of the polymer material is hydrophobicity and all the polymers listed above are hydrophobic hydrophobicity will occur as the interactions between the surface of the membrane and the components present in the feed water 110 the membrane can be a hollow fibre or flat sheet membrane which is submerged in the reactor containing the bacteria biomass at initial development the mbr is developed as a suspended growth membrane bioreactor susmbr but currently the reactor designs are innovated as an attached growth membrane bioreactor attmbr and an ion exchange membrane bioreactor imebr fig 6 shows the schematic principles design of the mbr system the accumulation of bacteria biofilm at the surface of the membrane effects the decreasing in permeate flux or an increasing in the transmembrane pressure tmp during a membrane process this loss in performance of the mbr process is called membrane fouling which it is the result of several complex occurrences involving electrostatic and hydrophobic processes membrane fouling is one of the main limitations of the mbr process for drinking water treatment 109 110 additionally mbr technology is also facing several research challenges such as mbr standardization membrane life span and operation cost 111 3 5 2 performance of mbr the biological suspended growth reactor is combined with the membranes in the mbr to act as a separation device to solve some of the problems such as denitrification of nitrate 108 112 115 ammonia removal 116 and reduction of total organic carbon toc 116 form the literature survey it was found that most of the researchers used mbr for the removal of nitrate ravnjak et al 114 achieved high nitrate removal from polluted groundwater by using a two stage membrane bioreactor anoxic and oxic in the study a pe membrane with a pore size of 0 4 μm combined with a biochip carrier was used in oxic but in the anoxic zone only biocontact n carriers were used to enhance the nitrate removal applying a biofilm carrier in the mbr would enhance the contact area between the biofilm and the pollutants compared to the conventional mbr that only applies the suspended growth processes however this innovation showed a good nitrate removal but maintaining both biofilm carriers in the anoxic and oxic zone is difficult and over a long period the carrier will settle to the bottom tank due to the high density of the dead biomass moreover in the study by ravnjak et al 114 the membrane zone was located in an oxic zone which would increase the fouling problem and shorten the membrane lifetime the fouling can be controlled through as reported by mcadam and judd 113 the mbr can removed high nitrate in the water by manipulating the c n ratio using different carbon sources such as methanol and ethanol for the biofilm metabolism in addition to the nitrate removal manipulating the c n ratio could also increase the hydrogen production during the treatment which can be beneficial for the dwt operation even though the membrane could easily be fouled due to biofilm attachment on its surface for a long term operation it can degrade the high molecule organic compounds that are retained in the mbr which consequently prevents the formation of thms in the treated water some researchers have investigated the technique by embedding nanoparticle on the membrane surface to keep the membrane from fouling although it shows good performance in controlling the fouling the embedding process requires a sticky procedure and is difficult and requires a high cost for full scale production to obtain high quality drinking water conventional mbr has been innovated through the application of ion exchange mbr iembr the iembr has good potential not only for macropollutants removal but also for anionic micropollutants such as perchlorate 117 and bromate 118 as an example a study by ricardo et al 117 uses iembr for the removal of nitrate and perchlorate from drinking water the biofilm attached on the membrane surface plays an important role for both pollutants reduction in the study heterotrophic denitrifiers biofilm take the first action to remove nitrate then it is followed by the perchlorate reducing biofilm which removes the perchlorate to ensure that the iembr performs well an electron donor such as ethanol must be added to the reactor for the biofilm metabolism however not controlling the addition of the electron donor would increase the acetic acid production which will reduce the ph and provide unsuitable conditions for biofilm growth 3 6 other biofiltration system 3 6 1 moving bed biofilm reactor the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr is a type of wastewater treatment process that was first invented by hallvard ødegaard at norwegian university of science and technology in 1989 mbbr is well known in wastewater treatment but there has been very limited study on its use for drinking water treatment mbbr was developed based on the concept of combining the conventional activated sludge process and the biofilm process this technology is a completely mixed and continuous operation and it can withstand a high density of biomass but omit clogs in the reactor and sludge recycling 119 the biological treatment process is taking place when the microorganisms that are attached at the carrier element will be in moving their position within the mbbr system 120 121 aerobic mbbrs use a diffused aeration system to uniformly move the biofilm carriers and meet the oxygen requirements while operated in the anaerobic condition the carrier movements are distributed by mechanical mixers 122 rodgers and zhan 123 stated that the biofilm thickness not only can be controlled by air flow but also by mechanical mixing energy the diffused aeration will be provided from the bottom of the mbbr and the inflow of water is coming from the top of the mbbr 124 the increasing biomass concentration inside the mbbr was developed by increasing the amount of supporting media and lowering the head loss 144 the carrier element in the mbbr process will preferably be made up of material that is less dense than water such as polyethylene polypropylene polymer foam pads polyvinyl alcohol gel polyurethane sponge and granular activated carbon mcquarrie and boltz 122 found that the high density of plastic biofilm carriers 0 98 g cm3 reduces the carrier s tendency to float and so power is needed to uniformly move the carriers however these carriers will slightly float with densities between 0 94 and 0 96 g cm3 in addition they also stated that a plastic biofilm carrier in the mbbr should increase the volume up to 67 of the empty bed liquid volume mbbr may be made up as a single reactor or as several reactors in series normally mbbr is designed with length to width ratio l w in the range of 0 5 1 to 1 5 1 however if the mmbr design is greater than that non uniform free moving plastic biofilm carriers will be distributed throughout the bioreactor as a result the oxygen transfer efficiency and hydraulic capacity of the plastic biofilm carrier retention screens are reduced 122 the performance of the mbbr technology is based on several parameters that need to be considered they are the aeration system 122 123 125 biofilm 126 flow configuration 127 types and characteristics of the media 122 loading rate 124 and filling fraction 128 this simple and strong biological treatment process is suitable for the treatment of nitrogen compounds from polluted raw water but currently there are no other types of contaminants has been studied to be removed from any type of drinking water resources using this technology some of the studies such as the investigation by zhang et al 129 focused on the responsibility of the nitrifying community on the nitrogen compounds removal the lack of interest by researchers to use mbbr for drinking water treatment may be due to the additional requirement of unit processes such as floatation or clarifier for the biomass separation and the high percentage of microbial contamination in the treated water due to high microbial biomass amounts passing thorough the mbbr to the next process 3 6 2 fluidized bed biofilm reactor biological drinking water treatment using a fluidized bed biofilm reactor fbbr was studied 30 decades ago by kurt et al 130 for the removal of nitrate the basic concept of fbbr technology is that the contaminated water is pumped up flow through the biological bed at a sufficient velocity to fluidize the granular media bed currently there are very few reports of using fbbr in drinking water treatment this may be related to the design and operation of the fbbr where the carriers used in the reactor must be in the fluidized condition this condition can only be achieved by manipulating the influent flow to a certain velocity a high velocity of influent flow rate would result in a biomass wash out from the fbbr however some of the advantages of this fbbr process are the non cloggable biofilm reactor where backwashing is not required 131 132 and it is easy to manage 131 the types of contaminants removed from drinking water sources by fbbr were toc thm and ammonia which were investigated by xie et al 132 while burghate and ingole 131 investigated the removal of nitrate based on xie et al 132 the reduction of toc was low at only 12 6 while the reduction of thmfp and haafp was significant and the ammonia was reduced 30 to 40 temperature below 3 however the reduction rose to over 50 when the temperature increased above 3 on the other hand the maximum removal efficiency for nitrate was 91 at an hrt of 30 min and optimum removal efficiency was 86 at an hrt of 10 min 131 in the study conducted by xie et al 132 nitrosomonas and nitrobacter were used for biological nitrification both groups of bacteria are autotrophic and they use carbon dioxide as the carbon source for biosynthesis and the oxidation of nitrogen compounds as the energy source 4 integrated combining technologies integrating two different processes is a wise action for upgrading the drinking water treatment technology to ensure that the treated water meets the standard discharge limits as regulated by the legislation integrated systems for the biodwt include the membrane coagulation bioreactor mcbr the bac mbr has been studied by researchers for obtaining the highest quality of treated drinking water 4 1 membrane coagulation bioreactor the membrane coagulation bioreactor mcbr is a combination of the coagulation and membrane filtration process and has been successfully applied to drinking water treatment 133 134 liu et al 135 and tian et al 136 stated that the coagulation process is the most effective pretreatment technology for the mitigation of membrane fouling prolong the membrane life span and the improving the permeate quality by using the mcbr process the conventional treatment plant units i e coagulation flocculation sedimentation and filtration can be eliminated from the treatment process in mcbr technology the performance is dependent on the upward internal circulation flow of water in the membrane separation region that is induced by air lift causing the water in the reactor and the feed water into the reactor to be mixed and flocculated when the water in reactor is flocculated continuously this will make the fine particles become larger and mitigate the membrane fouling this is because smaller particles easily deposit onto the membrane surface which is the main factor of membrane fouling due to blocking the membrane pores the mcbr has performed well in the removal of microorganisms and particulates denitrification and phosphate removal tian et al 136 found that mcbr achieved much higher removal efficiencies of organic matter such as total organic carbon toc and dissolved organic carbon doc compared to mbr which is caused by polyaluminium chloride pacl coagulation in the bioreactor in addition this mcbr process effectively removed the biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc and assimilable organic carbon aoc which were respectively 8 2 and 10 1 higher than with the mbr there is still a lack of research on this technology for the biodwt some suggestion for future research are to investigate the effect of the coagulant types on the performance using organic coagulants such chitosan would provide a benefit to the performance not only for the treatment but it can also be a nutrient for the biofilm growth in the system moreover the type of membrane can also be considered for good water quality production according to another study by tian et al 137 the mcbr can be modified by adding an adsorbent such pac to enhance the removal of organic matter but this type of technology may require extensive maintenance and a process to separate the pac 4 2 biological activated carbon membrane bioreactor the combination of the biological activated carbon and membrane bioreactor bac mbr has been evaluated for drinking water treatment by several researchers 134 138 139 the design setup of the bac mbr can be seen in fig 7 the combination of the bac to mbr not only improves the quality of the treated water but the bac could mitigate the membrane fouling issues even though this type of hybrid system is easier to maintain this technology is still receiving the researchers attention compared to the mcabr where only one unit is required for two functions in combining the technologies of bac mbr tian et al 134 concluded that the bac was capable of enhancing the removal of high amounts of organic matter and ammonium by the adsorption and biodegradation process as well as mitigating the membrane fouling in the downstream mbr conversely the mbr could eliminate organic matter and ammonium in the biodegradation process as well as separating particles in the bac effluent moreover tian et al 134 studied one of the fundamental parameters of water quality in drinking water treatment which is turbidity which represents the particles in water initially the turbidity in the raw water was 1 88 0 62 ntu on average as a result of the bac performance the removal efficiency was 59 7 12 7 with 0 70 0 16 ntu still remaining in the effluent however the mbr exhibited an excellent turbidity removal capacity which is 0 06 0 02 ntu through the separation of the membrane in operating the bac and mbr the microbial community can be different focusing on the degradation of specific groups of contaminants thus it can improve the treated water quality where it is difficult to achieve at a high level in only a one unit system 5 challenges in biological drinking water treatment drinking water is one of earth s most precious resources increased demand for high quality and safe drinking water production has led biological treatment technology to fulfil this demand webber 140 stated that there are many questions about the suitability capacity reliability and safety of using this biological water treatment technology however there are some threats to the drinking water sources that should not be underestimated one of them is the anthropogenic activities in industrial areas that caused the quantity and quality of water available for human consumption to decline consequently based on a review by benner et al 141 they found 133 micropollutants i e pesticides and pharmaceuticals in both the raw and finished drinking water not only micropollutants some other major contaminants such as heavy metals organic and inorganic matters and nitrogen compounds must be eliminated from the drinking water in this technology microorganisms are used to catalyse biochemical oxidation or reduction of drinking water contaminants and to produce biologically stable water 3 however the uncontrolled growth of microorganisms can occur during the drinking water treatment and distribution this issue can lead to hygiene problems such as the development of opportunistic pathogens deterioration in taste smell and colour or the biological corrosion of pipes 142 a better understanding of the interaction of bacteria in the distribution system and the environmental conditions is necessary to better control the bacteria during the treatment and distribution of drinking water in this review a few challenges of the biodwt were highlighted as summarized in fig 8 the treating of drinking water biologically may cause exposure to pathogenic microorganism contaminations such as e coli the diversity of pathogenic and non pathogenic microorganisms is difficult to control in biological treatment due to the factors of the raw water characteristic which always vary and contribute to the microorganism growth in the biodwt an assessment of microorganism in the schmutzdecke of the biosand filter for the treatment of river water showed that pathogen strains are a dominating group in the schmutzdecke layer compared to the non pathogens 143 introducing the effective non pathogenic microorganism in the start up may prevent the dominating of the pathogens present in the schmutzdecke or biofilm it is difficult to achieve good pollutants removal simultaneously in a one unit treatment system the microorganisms in the reactor must be diverse to ensure all pollutants in the raw water can be treated selectivity of microorganisms towards specific contaminants may overcome the inefficiency of biodwt for raw water treatment as an example the community of nitrospira and nitrosomonas has been reported to be only capable of treating nitrogen compounds but to treat other pollutants such as heavy metals it requires other types of microorganism groups however a specific genus of microorganism has the ability to remove various types of pollutants as an example genus sphingomonas is a good choice for the removal of terpene 2 methylisoborneol mib soproturon polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and lindane thus before start up the biodwt selection of specific microbials or general microbials as a seeding is important to ensure the stability and good performance of the reactor during the treatment the community of the microbial will shift according to the times due to a few factors such as the quality of raw water and the operating conditions of treatment such as the ph hrt and the organic loading rate maintaining and monitoring the microbial community may pose challenges to maintaining the performance stability as reported by liao et al 69 at the early stage of treatment the microbial identification only achieved at class level but after operating for 160 days the identification was at genus level where its shows the microbial community change within the treatment period this condition may affect the bioreactor performance of either low performance or good performance the last challenge of the biological treatment to be applied for drinking water treatment is the consumer perspective and acceptance of the microbial contamination in the treated water consumers may be worried about the microbial contamination from the biological process itself in the treated drinking water without a proper explanation or information it is very difficult to convince consumers of the safeness of the biodwt before the biodwt can applied in the water treatment a survey on the consumer perspective and acceptance may conducted then information on this biodwt should be distributed to public 6 conclusion the biological process via biofilms is a relatively new concept and is considered a future technology for the production of high quality and safe drinking water a few technologies for contaminant removal from the level of micro up to the macro level have been discussed in this review paper even though these technologies are well known in developed countries in most developing countries the technology is still unacceptable by the water treatment practiser and consumer some of the technologies that have good potential for application in water treatment plants are ssf rsf bac and mbr or combinations of these processes these technologies can efficiently remove ammonia nitrate nitrite organic carbon heavy metals and various type of micropollutants nevertheless information on these technologies must be explained to the water treatment practiser and consumer so that it can be accepted to be applied in water treatment plants in developing countries declaration of competing interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement the authors wish to thank

14156,water pollution by heavy metals is a major environmental concern for example copper and chromium are produced by metal and electronic industries and must be removed from wastewater but cu2 and cr3 are also paramagnetic ions which previously allowed the use of magnetic resonance imaging mri and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr relaxometry to follow their migration in several matrixes and their adsorption on different compounds in this work the removal of cu2 and cr3 from water by amberlite ir120 resin is studied with t 2 relaxometry the ion exchange process obeys a pseudo second order kinetics model while the equilibrium isotherms can be fitted by the langmuir theory providing values of 79 and 10 1 mg g for the maximum metal content per gram of resin for cu2 and cr3 respectively the equilibrium constants are 2 07 and 0 61 mm 1 for cu2 and cr3 respectively ph does not influence the removal capacity of the resin in the studied range ph 2 4 5 the longitudinal and transverse relaxation of the wet resin are shown to be biexponential the relaxation rate of the fast relaxing water fraction of the wet resin is correlated with its cu2 or cr3 content this paves the way of column experiments in which the gradual loading of the resin with cu2 or cr3 could be followed on line by nmr relaxometry keywords nmr relaxometry benchtop nmr paramagnetic ion copper chromium ion exchange resin 1 introduction the contamination of water by heavy metals is a major environmental and health issue growing with global industrialization 1 5 fuel and power industries metal industry and agriculture are the major sources of heavy metal pollution for example chromium is mainly produced by electroplating and metal processing industries while copper is often present in wastewater of electronic industry heavy metal pollution can also be the result of natural phenomena like rock alteration as it is sometimes the case for arsenic contamination the absence of waste management can have disastrous consequences for local populations especially in some emerging countries where little attention is paid to pollution even in europe heavy metals are present in wastewater and must be removed during water treatment heavy metals with detrimental health effects include pb as cr hg mn co cd cu ni the who 6 recommends for drinking water a maximum level of arsenic of 10 ppb while a level of 50 ppb is still accepted in china the guidelines are clearly different for the different metals depending on their toxicity for chromium who s guideline is 50 ppb while it is 2000 ppb for copper different solutions exist for the removal of heavy metal from polluted water including chemical hydroxide or sulphide coprecipitation adsorption by activated carbon iron oxides or manganese oxides ion exchange using resins 7 10 cationic ion exchange resins either synthetic or natural exchange their cations for example h na with the metals ions in wastewater 11 all of these techniques present advantages and drawbacks regarding their cost efficiency and reusability for example ion exchange is very efficient but more expansive than adsorption in this context methods helping to test adsorbents resins are clearly valuable the classical method to study the removal efficiency of a compound consists in batch experiments followed by atomic absorption emission spectroscopy aas and aes on the supernatant and or column experiments followed by aes aas on the outlet effluent to obtain the breakthrough curve sometimes an acid digestion of the sample is necessary before the aas or aes measurement which can be time consuming in each batch experiment the volume of solution is around 50 ml which is not negligible methods allowing to decrease this minimum volume would be valuable the on line follow up of heavy metal removal in a batch or column experiment is not easy to achieve since the results are only obtained after the elemental analysis a simple technique to obtain during a column experiment the breakthrough curve would be useful it is worth noting that on the field the saturation of an adsorbent resin column is only noticed because of its inefficiency a method to check live and in situ the saturation of the media would be really interesting to develop among heavy metals ions some are paramagnetic like cu2 cr3 but not cr6 ni2 and mn2 for example the magnetic moments of cr3 and cu2 are respectively of 3 8 μb and 1 73 μb where μb 9 274 10 24 j t is the bohr magneton 12 up to now these paramagnetic properties haven t often been used in water treatment applications except in studies which used magnetic resonance imaging mri to follow the diffusion migration and adsorption of paramagnetic tracers in different matrixes 13 18 in a recent study 19 we showed that it was possible to follow the adsorption of copper on activated alumina with low resolution nuclear magnetic resonance nmr relaxometry the proposed methodology allowed to work with very small amounts of adsorbent 45 mg and small volumes of solution 350 μl the longitudinal relaxation of wet copper loaded activated alumina was also shown to depend on the copper content which opens perspectives for the use of nmr relaxometry in column experiments indeed low field and low cost nmr has been tremendously developped during the last ten years with the emergence of low field benchtop systems even spectrometers and of miniaturized nmr 20 23 using ultrasmall magnets and all the rf excitation and receiver electronics on a single chip even earth field nmr can be achieved for less than a thousand of euros 24 on site nmr in industrial applications have also developed 25 26 in the present work we use the same nmr relaxometry technique to follow the capture of cr3 and cu2 by an ion exchange resin amberlite ir 120 the kinetics and equilibrium properties of the ion exchange process are studied using the nmr water relaxation induced by cr3 or cu2 during batch experiments metal loaded resins are also studied and their longitudinal and transverse relaxation properties are correlated with the metal content of the resin 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples copper sulfate sigma adrich ref 209198 chromium sulfate hydrate sigma adrich ref 342432 and deionized water were used for the preparation of the cu2 and cr3 solutions ph was adjusted using small amounts of concentrated naoh and hcl solutions the resin amberlite ir120 na form was obtained from sigma aldrich ref 224359 and used without further purification for the kinetics and isotherm experiments the resin was not dried before use the weight of resin is in this case given in g of wet resin however for the study of the relaxation properties of the resin itself the samples had to be dried before analysis and in that case the weight of resin is expressed in g of dry resin in fig 5 for example 2 2 atomic emission spectroscopy prior to aes the samples were digested with a hno3 h2o2 mixture in a microwave oven milestones start d the copper and chromium concentrations were measured by icp aes iris intrepid ii thermo fisher scientific special attention had to be given to matrix effects because of the high nitric acid concentration of the digested samples 2 3 nmr relaxometry the kinetics and isotherms nmr experiments were carried out on a homemade relaxometer using a permanent magnet producing a field of 0 47 t which corresponds to a proton larmor frequency of 20 mhz coupled to a lapnmr console from tecmag and a tomco rf power amplifier for the measurement of t 2 cpmg sequences with an echo train covering a time interval of 3 t 2 were used with an interecho time comprised between 1 and 4 ms depending on the value of t 2 the repetition time was taken as 5t 1 only the even echoes were considered for the fitting of the data which allowed the determination of t 2 the longitudinal and transverse relaxation data of wet resin containing copper and chromium were obtained respectively with an inversion recovery ir sequence and a cpmg sequence the interecho times of the cpmg sequence were comprised between 0 3 and 2 ms depending on the speed of the transverse relaxation and were chosen in order to obtain enough points to cover the first fast decay of the transverse relaxation curve the list of time delays used for the ir sequence was also chosen in order to cover the first part of the longitudinal relaxation curve all the nmr measurements were made at a temperature of 20 1 c the relative error on the relaxation rates is estimated to be less than 4 all the nmr experiments performed in this study can be carried out on any low resolution benchtop nmr system 2 4 nmr kinetics experiments the kinetics experiments were performed as follows at time zero 350 μl of cu2 or cr3 containing solution was added to 5 5 mg for cu2 or 45 mg for cr3 of wet resin directly in the nmr tube the tube was attached to a vortex mixer and shaken at 500 rpm for 1 min when removed from the mixer the sedimentation of resin beads at the bottom of the tube was fast taking only a few seconds which allowed to measure t 2 immediately after removal from the vortex mixer the tube was then placed in the relaxometer for the first nmr measurement and immediately put back on the vortex mixer the t 2 nmr measurement lasted less than 15 s the same sequence was repeated for each time step with the same tube the value of t 2 allowed to calculate the mass of cu2 or cr3 captured by the resin as explained below in our 20 mhz magnet at 20 c t 2 water of pure water is 2 s when a paramagnetic ion is added the relaxation becomes faster and t 2 decreases the increase in relaxation rate 1 t 2 is in fact proportional to the paramagnetic ion concentration 1 1 t 2 1 t 2 w a t e r r 2 m e t a l where m e t a l is the cu2 or cr3 concentration in mm r 2 is called the transverse relaxivity expressed in s 1 mm 1 it reflects the efficiency of a compound to quicken transverse relaxation for cu2 and cr3 at 20 mhz and 20 c the relaxivity is r 2 1 15 s 1 mm 1 and r 2 6 52 s 1 mm 1 respectively 27 it should be noted that the cu2 and cr3 relaxivities are strongly dependent on the magnetic field as shown in fig s1 and fig s6 of gossuin et al 19 the value of t 2 allowed to calculate the metal concentration of the solution then the absolute metal amount remaining in solution and finally the mass of copper or chromium captured by the resin 2 m m e t a l 0 35 10 3 a r m e t a l i n i 1 t 2 1 t 2 w a t e r r 2 where a r is the atomic weight of copper or chromium 0 35 10 3 is the volume of solution in litre and m e t a l i n i is the initial copper 20 mm or chromium concentration 8 95 mm of the solution the kinetics data were interpreted using the pseudo second order model 28 3 t q t 1 k q e 2 t q e k is the rate of ion exchange expressed in gresin mgmetal min q t is the amount of cu2 or cr3 removed by the resin at time t and q e is the amount of cu2 or cr3 contained in the resin at equilibrium both expressed in mgmetal gresin 2 5 ion exchange isotherm to obtain the isotherm of metal removal by the resin different tubes containing 350 μl of solution of different initial metal concentrations and 5 5 mg for cu2 or 45 mg for cr3 of wet resin were prepared and shaken during two hours t 2 was then measured when the ion exchange process is finished which allowed to calculate the equilibrium metal concentration of the solution and the metal content of the resin as described above the langmuir model 29 was used to fit the ion exchange isotherms 4 q c q max k c 1 k c c is the equilibrium concentration of copper or chromium remaining in solution in mm k is the equilibrium constant in mm 1 q c is the amount of metal contained in the resin for an equilibrium concentration c and q max is the maximum amount of metal captured by the resin both expressed in mgmetal gresin 2 6 relaxation of the cu2 or cr3 containing resin to study the relaxation of the water containing resin loaded with different amounts of metal the following procedure was used conventional batch adsorption experiments were performed with different initial cu2 or cr3 concentrations in order to obtain different metal loading for the resin after 2 h of shaking the resin was recovered wiped with paper filter and finally dried in the oven at 70 c for 5 h 0 2 g of the dry resin was then put in an nmr tube and finally 200 μl of deionized water was added the nmr experiments were performed 1 h after the preparation of the tube 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of the cu2 cr3 removal fig 1 presents the evolution with time of cu2 fig 1a and cr3 fig 1b removal by the amberlite resin at ph 2 8 and ph 4 2 for copper and chromium respectively the data seem to follow a pseudo second order kinetics as shown in fig 2 a and fig 2b the fitting of the data with eq 3 provided the rates of cu2 and cr3 removal respectively k 0 007 gresin mgcumin and k 0 78 gresin mgcrmin the amounts of cu2 and cr3 contained in the resin at equilibrium were respectively q e 3 28 mgcu gresin and q e 66 1 mgcr gresin table 1 nmr relaxometry thus allowed to study the removal of cr3 and cu2 by amberlite ir120 ion exchange resin the previously reported method is thus not restricted to adsorbents like activated alumina and carbon 19 it should be mentioned that the metal concentrations used in this work are somehow larger than the actual copper and chromium concentrations found in polluted water however large concentrations like ours are often used in the literature for the characterization of resin and sorbents the kinetics of the ion exchange follows a pseudo second order model as it was previously reported in different studies 30 34 for cu2 removal kinetics the agreement with literature data table 1 is rather good however for cr3 results the second order rate is really large when compared to the previously reported values 31 maybe because of different experimental conditions like ph initial chromium concentration amount of resin and shaking speed other kinetics models were also used in the literature for the description of the kinetics of removal of cu2 and cr3 by ion exchange resins as the pseudo first order model 35 37 the film diffusion controlled process and the particle diffusion controlled process 38 40 3 2 effect of ph nmr relaxometry also allows to evaluate the effect of ph on the capture of cu and cr by the resin in the studied range ph 2 4 5 ph did not significantly affect the removal of chromium or copper by the resin as shown in fig 3 3 3 ion exchange isotherms of the cu2 and cr3 removal the ion exchange isotherms are shown in fig 4 a and fig 4b for cu2 and cr3 respectively the fitting by the langmuir theory eq 4 allows to obtain k 2 07 mm 1 and k 0 61 mm 1 for cu2 and cr3 respectively the values of q max the maximum amount of metal contained in the resin are 79 mgcu gresin and 10 1 mgcr gresin for copper and chromium respectively table1 the langmuir parameters obtained in this study are compared with literature data in table 1 the value of q max obtained for cu2 is close to what was reported previously for some similar resins 30 34 41 43 for cr3 there is also a good agreement of q max with published data 31 35 36 44 however the difference between our q max and k values with some of the results reported in table 1 are sometimes enormous this is again probably due to different experimental conditions which does not ease the comparison it is worth noting that in our kinetics and isotherm results the mass of resin is expressed in gram of wet resin while in the literature it is sometimes given in gram of dry resin when this information was clearly given in the reference it is mentioned in the table in our case we noticed a weight reduction by a factor of approximately 2 after drying which allows a rough comparison of the data 3 4 relaxation of the cu2 cr3 loaded resin both the longitudinal and transverse relaxation properties of the wet resin loaded with different amounts of cu2 or cr3 were studied the actual metal content of the dry resin was independently measured by icp aes the relaxation curves are not monoexponential but rather biexponential with two fractions presenting very different relaxation times the slow fraction is 50 times slower than the fast one see si for the relaxation curves the fast relaxing fraction is 3 4 times more abundant than the slowly relaxing fraction usually in such porous materials the fast fraction is attributed to water bound on the surface of the pores while the slow fraction corresponds to unbound water diffusing in the pores 45 in this context we decided to focus on the fast fraction which was dramatically influenced by the cu2 or cr3 content of the resin the correlation between the relaxation rates 1 t 1 and 1 t 2 of the fast fraction and q the metal content of the resin measured by aes is very good as illustrated by fig 5 a for copper and fig 5b for chromium a power curve was empirically used to fit the 1 t 1 and 1 t 2 dependence on the metal content of the dry resin 1 t i a q n b the results of the fitting are provided in table 2 the correlation between the paramagnetic metal content of the resin and the fast relaxation rate t 1 or t 2 of the wet resin opens promising prospects indeed if aas and aes allow the determination of cu2 or cr3 concentration in the liquid phase it is useless when trying to evaluate directly the metal content of the resin this would however be very useful in column experiments for recording breakthrough curves with a stopped flow setup by looking at the curves of fig 5 one can roughly estimate a limit of quantification of 0 1 mg gdry resin for cu2 and 0 15 mg gdry resin for cr3 which would be enough for the follow up of breakthrough curves let us compare our nmr method with a more conventional one the determination of the resin metal content by aas before aas the sample in our case 200 mg of dry resin has to be digested in 20 ml of an acidic solution which causes a dilution of the metal content in a large volume in these conditions a sample at the limit of quantification 0 1 mg g would approximately provide a 1 ppm solution for aas aas could thus provide more accurate measurements of copper and chromium content since the aas limit of quantification is below 1 ppm but contrarily to our method aas destroys the sample and cannot be used in situ which are the main advantages of our nmr method rather than the accuracy even actual filtration system would benefit from such an nmr monitoring of the saturation or regeneration of the resin the currently developing low cost benchtop nmr systems could thus find new applications in the field of water treatment 4 conclusions in the present work we show that the nmr methodology previously developed for the follow up of cu2 adsorption on activated alumina can also be used for the study of the kinetics and the equilibrium isotherms of cu2 and cr3 removal of by an ion exchange resin such experiments can be performed with any benchtop low resolution device the correlation between the paramagnetic ion content and the longitudinal and transverse relaxation properties of the resin paves the way to column experiments which should allow to follow on line the gradual loading of the resin with the paramagnetic ion without any further analysis of the effluent declaration of

14156,water pollution by heavy metals is a major environmental concern for example copper and chromium are produced by metal and electronic industries and must be removed from wastewater but cu2 and cr3 are also paramagnetic ions which previously allowed the use of magnetic resonance imaging mri and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr relaxometry to follow their migration in several matrixes and their adsorption on different compounds in this work the removal of cu2 and cr3 from water by amberlite ir120 resin is studied with t 2 relaxometry the ion exchange process obeys a pseudo second order kinetics model while the equilibrium isotherms can be fitted by the langmuir theory providing values of 79 and 10 1 mg g for the maximum metal content per gram of resin for cu2 and cr3 respectively the equilibrium constants are 2 07 and 0 61 mm 1 for cu2 and cr3 respectively ph does not influence the removal capacity of the resin in the studied range ph 2 4 5 the longitudinal and transverse relaxation of the wet resin are shown to be biexponential the relaxation rate of the fast relaxing water fraction of the wet resin is correlated with its cu2 or cr3 content this paves the way of column experiments in which the gradual loading of the resin with cu2 or cr3 could be followed on line by nmr relaxometry keywords nmr relaxometry benchtop nmr paramagnetic ion copper chromium ion exchange resin 1 introduction the contamination of water by heavy metals is a major environmental and health issue growing with global industrialization 1 5 fuel and power industries metal industry and agriculture are the major sources of heavy metal pollution for example chromium is mainly produced by electroplating and metal processing industries while copper is often present in wastewater of electronic industry heavy metal pollution can also be the result of natural phenomena like rock alteration as it is sometimes the case for arsenic contamination the absence of waste management can have disastrous consequences for local populations especially in some emerging countries where little attention is paid to pollution even in europe heavy metals are present in wastewater and must be removed during water treatment heavy metals with detrimental health effects include pb as cr hg mn co cd cu ni the who 6 recommends for drinking water a maximum level of arsenic of 10 ppb while a level of 50 ppb is still accepted in china the guidelines are clearly different for the different metals depending on their toxicity for chromium who s guideline is 50 ppb while it is 2000 ppb for copper different solutions exist for the removal of heavy metal from polluted water including chemical hydroxide or sulphide coprecipitation adsorption by activated carbon iron oxides or manganese oxides ion exchange using resins 7 10 cationic ion exchange resins either synthetic or natural exchange their cations for example h na with the metals ions in wastewater 11 all of these techniques present advantages and drawbacks regarding their cost efficiency and reusability for example ion exchange is very efficient but more expansive than adsorption in this context methods helping to test adsorbents resins are clearly valuable the classical method to study the removal efficiency of a compound consists in batch experiments followed by atomic absorption emission spectroscopy aas and aes on the supernatant and or column experiments followed by aes aas on the outlet effluent to obtain the breakthrough curve sometimes an acid digestion of the sample is necessary before the aas or aes measurement which can be time consuming in each batch experiment the volume of solution is around 50 ml which is not negligible methods allowing to decrease this minimum volume would be valuable the on line follow up of heavy metal removal in a batch or column experiment is not easy to achieve since the results are only obtained after the elemental analysis a simple technique to obtain during a column experiment the breakthrough curve would be useful it is worth noting that on the field the saturation of an adsorbent resin column is only noticed because of its inefficiency a method to check live and in situ the saturation of the media would be really interesting to develop among heavy metals ions some are paramagnetic like cu2 cr3 but not cr6 ni2 and mn2 for example the magnetic moments of cr3 and cu2 are respectively of 3 8 μb and 1 73 μb where μb 9 274 10 24 j t is the bohr magneton 12 up to now these paramagnetic properties haven t often been used in water treatment applications except in studies which used magnetic resonance imaging mri to follow the diffusion migration and adsorption of paramagnetic tracers in different matrixes 13 18 in a recent study 19 we showed that it was possible to follow the adsorption of copper on activated alumina with low resolution nuclear magnetic resonance nmr relaxometry the proposed methodology allowed to work with very small amounts of adsorbent 45 mg and small volumes of solution 350 μl the longitudinal relaxation of wet copper loaded activated alumina was also shown to depend on the copper content which opens perspectives for the use of nmr relaxometry in column experiments indeed low field and low cost nmr has been tremendously developped during the last ten years with the emergence of low field benchtop systems even

determined by measurements of chemical oxygen demand cod and color in addition the maximum adsorptive capacities associated with the adsorbents were also determined adsorption batch tests were initially performed with synthetic leachate and variables such as ph activated carbon dose temperature and contact time were evaluated the effectiveness of the adsorbents was also verified for real landfill leachate oat hulls samples were chemically activated with phosphoric acid impregnation ratios 60 and 100 and pyrolyzed n2 atmosphere at 350 and 500 c the 100 impregnation ratio resulted in adsorbents with higher surface areas 1090 3880 m2 g 1 rather than the ratio 60 123 731 m2 g 1 it was found that the organic matter removal from synthetic leachate was favored by performing the

biodegradable organic matter ammonia in high concentrations dissolved solids and heavy metals 1 5 depending on the level of purification required for leachate prior to its released into the environment it can be treated by stand alone or combined methods such as air stripping 6 7 advanced oxidation processes 3 8 biological processes 4 5 and adsorption 9 10 significant removals of heavy metals and organic matter have been attributed to the use of commercial activated carbon for leachate treatment 9 11 nonetheless as part of the efforts to divert organic wastes from landfills these materials have been tested as precursors for activated carbon production and applied for wastewater treatment 12 oat is one the most popular cereals consumed worldwide and its global production in 2017 was approximately 25 9 million tons according to the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations 13 while oat is processed for human consumption massive amounts of hulls are produced the latter is a lignin cellulosic waste that corresponds to about 25 of the oat grain weight oat hulls can be reused as animal feed biomass for fuel production or ultimately disposed in landfills 14 15 alternatively oat hulls can be recovered as activated carbon being successfully applied for dye 14 and arsenic 16 removals from aqueous solutions while limited information is available for oat hulls activated carbon applied for water purification the literature lacks their application for landfill leachate therefore this study aimed to contribute to the literature by using oat hulls as precursors for activated carbon and testing these adsorbents to remove cod and color from landfill leachate 2 material and methods 2 1 oat hulls activated carbon oat hulls were collected from a milling industry located in emerson mb canada following methods described in previous studies reporting on waste derived adsorbents 14 16 18 oat hulls activated carbon samples were prepared by means of chemical activation with phosphoric acid impregnation ratios 60 and 100 followed by pyrolysis for 1 h under a n2 atmosphere the temperatures tested for pyrolysis were 350 and 500 c 14 16 18 2 2 landfill leachate synthetic leachate was prepared adapting the recipe used by ren et al 19 and bardi et al 20 it consisted of a mixture containing 1000 mg l 1 of humic acid corresponding to a cod of approximately 1000 mg o2 l 1 and 1500 mg l 1 of nh4cl the municipal landfill brady road in winnipeg mb canada provided the real leachate used in this study as observed by other authors 5 20 24 the leachate collected in the brady road landfill presents a high content of refractory organic matter and ammonia table 1 to prevent variations on the organic content of synthetic and real leachate the wastewaters were stored in the dark and at 4 c before being used in the experiments 2 3 batch tests blanks and samples 100 ml volume were evaluated in batch tests as per previous studies on waste derived activated carbon 14 16 17 25 27 tests with synthetic leachate were run for 3 h and the organic matter removal was evaluated by varying the following parameters according to a previous study 26 oat hulls activated carbon dose 10 and 20 g l 1 ph 4 and 8 and temperature 20 and 50 c the adsorptive capacities were determined in 24 h tests using 20 g l 1 of oat hulls activated carbon and different initial concentrations of synthetic leachate cod 300 3000 mg o2 l 1 the performance of the oat hulls activated carbon was also tested on real leachate using the best experimental conditions in terms of adsorbent dose ph and temperature in order to prevent interferences on cod and color determinations the adsorbents were removed from the treated samples by centrifugation followed by filtration carbon 14 16 17 25 27 otherwise cod and color measurements would be overestimated due to the presence of activated carbon particles 2 4 experimental data analysis the experiments were run in triplicates and data was reported as mean and standard deviations 8 25 26 28 29 cod and color removals were determined according to equation 1 eq 1 r e m o v a l 100 c i c f c i where ci and cf refer to the initial and final values of color or cod concentration respectively the langmuir model was applied for determination of the maximum adsorptive capacities 16 25 oat hulls activated carbons were also tested on real leachate and the experimental data was applied to pseudo first eq 2 and second order equation 3 kinetic models eq 2 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t eq 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qt mg g 1 is the amount of cod removed at time t qe mg g 1 is the adsorptive capacity at the equilibrium time whereas k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 are the pseudo first and second order constant rates 28 2 5 physico chemical and spectroscopic analysis color and cod were determined according to standard methods 30 functional groups on the surface of the oat hulls activated carbon were determined by ftir atr nicolet tm is10 ftir spectrometer a quantachrome autosorb 1 bet analyzer was used to determine the surface area and pore volume of the oat hulls activated carbon samples 3 results and discussions 3 1 physico chemical and spectroscopic properties of oat hulls activated carbon the yields obtained for oat hulls activated carbon were about 38 whereas burn off was around 60 and ash content 30 table 2 as reported by hildago oporto et al 31 oat hulls are lignocellulosic materials composed by nitrogen 0 6 carbon 43 hydrogen 6 and oxygen 50 4 during pyrolysis hydrogen and oxygen atoms are removed from lignocellulosic materials and the formed porous adsorbent is mainly composed by carbon atoms therefore the maximum yield for activated carbon produced from lignocellulosic materials would be 40 48 which corresponds to its carbon content 31 32 hence the yields obtained for oat hulls activated carbon corresponded to 80 of the maximum theoretical yield confirming the high efficiency of chemical activation pyrolysis under the conditions tested in this study the bet surface area was affected by both the tested impregnation ratios and pyrolysis temperature table 2 which was also observed by previous studies investigating activated carbon derived from sunflower 33 and potato peel 34 samples that were impregnated with h3po4 at the ratio 100 presented much higher surface areas 1090 and 3880 m2 g 1 compared to those impregnated at the ratio 60 123 and 731 m2 g 1 table 2 in addition samples pyrolyzed at 500 c presented higher bet surface areas than those pyrolyzed at 350 c the values herein reported are greater than the bet surface areas published by previous studies 16 35 36 steam activation applied to the production of oat hulls activated carbon resulted in bet surface areas varying from 349 to 625 m2 g 1 16 35 oat hulls activated carbon impregnated at 100 with h3po4 and heated by microwave presented bet surface area of 460 m2 g 1 36 similarly to the bet surface area the development of porosity in the samples was affected by both the impregnation ratios and pyrolysis temperatures table 2 which was confirmed by previous studies 33 34 the oat hulls activated carbon samples presented pore diameters from 2 5 8 3 nm as a result of mesopores formation 37 functional groups pertaining to oat hulls were identified by ftir atr as follows fig 1 bands at 2100 cm 1 were attributed to cc stretching vibration in alkyne bands at 1500 cm 1 were assigned to co stretching vibration in carboxyl and cc stretching vibration in aromatic rings and bands at 1024 cm 1 were assigned to co stretching 14 25 32 36 38 3 2 synthetic leachate treatment 3 2 1 cod removal in function of the tested adsorbent dose it was observed in all experiments that the activated carbon dose of 20 g l 1 resulted in the highest efficiencies of cod removal fig 2 a for instance samples impregnated at 60 and pyrolyzed at 500 c removed 46 0 7 of cod when the 10 g l 1 dose was used and this value was increased to 95 1 5 when the adsorbent dose was 20 g l 1 fig 2a the comparison of the results herein presented with the literature is limited due to the lack in similar studies with oat hulls published so far 3 2 2 cod removal in function of the ph oat hulls activated carbon samples performed better when the ph of synthetic leachate was adjusted to ph 4 instead of 8 fig 2b consequently cod removals obtained at ph 4 were almost twice the values obtained for synthetic leachate treatment at ph 8 previous studies related to carbon based adsorbents also observed improved removals of organic matter at low ph 27 39 40 according to the literature the charges on the activated carbon surface tend to be neutralized at ph 4 enhancing the adsorption of humic acid on the contrary at ph higher than 7 the activated carbon tends to present a negative charge repulsing ionized humic acid molecules 27 39 40 3 2 3 cod removal in function of the temperature increasing the temperature to 50 c did not improved cod removal by the tested oat hulls activated carbon samples fig 2c in contrast the highest cod removal 76 1 14 was obtained in tests performed at 20 c using the sample impregnated at 100 and pyrolyzed at 500 c if heating leachate does not favor cod removal then the use of oat hulls activated carbon becomes more advantageous in terms of operational costs 3 2 4 cod and color removals in function of the contact time oat hulls activated carbon impregnated at 100 and pyrolyzed at 500 c exhibited the highest performance on cod and color removals when compared to the other tested adsorbents fig 3 in the first hour cod and color removals were 48 2 and 37 0 8 respectively after 3 h these values increased to 68 2 for cod and 45 0 5 for color the adsorbent impregnated at 60 and pyrolyzed at 500 c removed approximately 30 of cod and color in the first hour after 3 h this value increased to approximately 40 regarding the adsorbents pyrolyzed at 350 c the sample impregnated at 100 removed up to 45 of cod and color from synthetic leachate on the other hand the lowest efficiency was observed for the sample impregnated at 60 cod and color removals were 24 6 and 35 1 4 respectively fig 3 as expected blank samples presented the same cod approximately 1100 mg o2 l 1 and color approximately 35 000 pt co units at the beginning and at the end of the experiment 3 2 5 isothermal tests for oat hulls activated carbon higher adsorptive capacities were obtained for activated carbon samples impregnated at 100 rather than for those impregnated at 60 fig 4 for instance the maximum adsorptive capacities for samples impregnated at 100 and pyrolyzed at 500 c and 350 c were 41 and 30 mg g 1 adsorbent respectively on the other hand samples impregnated at 60 and pyrolyzed at 500 c and 350 c presented maximum adsorptive capacities of 27 and 14 mg g 1 adsorbent respectively therefore the impregnation ratio 100 favoured the formation of high bet surface area adsorbents which in turn improved the cod removal from synthetic leachate 3 3 real leachate treatment in accordance with synthetic leachate tests tests performed with real leachate confirmed that adsorbents impregnated at 100 provided the best removals of cod and color fig 5 the oat hulls activated carbon pyrolyzed at 500 c removed 75 5 of cod and 85 1 6 of color from real leachate in only 30 min while additional removals were observed at the end of the test after 3 h color was completely removed and cod removal was 90 0 5 the cod removal herein reported was equivalent to an adsorptive capacity of 40 mg g 1 adsorbent confirming the values calculated by the langmuir model for synthetic leachate the oat hulls activated carbon pyrolyzed at 350 c removed 45 3 of cod and 73 3 of color from real leachate in only 30 min after 3 h cod and color removals were 63 0 5 and 90 0 5 respectively lower performances were obtained in tests with the adsorbents impregnated at 60 at the end of the treatment 3 h cod and color removals were around 30 and 70 respectively for the adsorbents pyrolyzed at 500 c on the other hand adsorbents pyrolyzed at 350 c removed approximately 24 of cod and 60 of color after 3 h the initial levels of cod and color in blank samples remained unaffected after 3 h independently of the conditions used to prepare the activated carbons impregnation ratio and pyrolysis temperature the experimental data was best fitted by the pseudo second order model fig 6 in contrast poor fitting was observed when the first order model was applied to the experimental data as shown in table 3 the pseudo second order model resulted in r2 values close to the unit and it provided adsorptive capacities that were very similar to the obtained experimental values consequently chemisorption could be assigned as the mechanism responsible for most of the organic matter removal from landfill leachate which is in agreement with previous studies reporting on waste derived activated carbons 25 28 29 41 42 therefore humic substances in leachate can be adsorbed onto the surface of the activated carbons by diverse interactions as for example hydrophobic forces van der walls forces or the formation of complexes with heavy metals in leachate which can then be attracted to the surface of the activated carbon 25 28 29 41 42 4 conclusion the adsorbents produced at different impregnation ratios and pyrolysis temperatures presented average pore diameters varying from 2 5 8 3 nm indicating that mesoporous activated carbon samples were successfully produced the bet surface area was dependent on both the tested impregnation ratios and pyrolysis temperatures adsorption was favored by running the batch tests at 20 c using a 20 g l 1 adsorbent dose and adjusting the ph of leachate to 4 due to their high bet surface areas oat hulls activated carbon samples impregnated at 100 presented higher adsorptive capacities 30 41 mg g 1 adsorbents compared with those impregnated at 60 14 27 mg g 1 adsorbents oat hulls activated carbon also presented high efficiencies for organic matter removal from real leachate in a short time adsorbents impregnated at 100 and pyrolyzed at 500 c removed 75 5 of cod and 85 1 6 of color from real leachate in only 30 min after 3 h color was completely removed and cod removal was 90 0 5 therefore the recovery of oat hulls as precursor for activated carbon should be highly encouraged once promising results were obtained for the organic matter removal from landfill leachate

14157,this research aimed to recover oat hulls as activated carbon using the produced adsorbent to remove the organic matter removal from landfill leachate the organic matter content in leachate was determined by measurements of chemical oxygen demand cod and color in addition the maximum adsorptive capacities associated with the adsorbents were also determined adsorption batch tests were initially performed with synthetic leachate and variables such as ph activated carbon dose temperature and contact time were evaluated the effectiveness of the adsorbents was also verified for real landfill leachate oat hulls samples were chemically activated with phosphoric acid impregnation ratios 60 and 100 and pyrolyzed n2 atmosphere at 350 and 500 c the 100 impregnation ratio resulted in adsorbents with higher surface areas 1090 3880 m2 g 1 rather than the ratio 60 123 731 m2 g 1 it was found that the organic matter removal from synthetic leachate was favored by performing the adsorption tests at 20 c ph 4 and using a 20 g l 1 activated carbon dose under these experimental conditions the activated carbon sample impregnated at 100 with phosphoric acid and pyrolyzed at 500 c completely removed the color from leachate and cod removal was up to 90 therefore oat hulls comprise a suitable precursor for activated carbon and its application for leachate treatment should be

hanging sponge dhs reactor abr dhs system hydraulic retention time hrt seeding of the core rubber and existence of air are selected as key factors for rubber coagulation in the abr longer hrt and seeding of the core rubber was not affected for rubber coagulation only biodegradable substances were consumed in the abr on the other hand the dhs reactor achieved high removal efficiency of residual rubber by both coagulation and biological degradation in addition seeding of the core rubber to the dhs reactor enhanced rubber coagulation the genera gordonia known as a rubber degrading bacteria were detected from the retained sludge in the dhs reactor therefore the wastewater air and wastewater core rubber contacts are considered as key factors for residual rubber coagulation in the nr wastewater treatment furthermore biodegraded residual rubber was considered as carbon source for denitrification in the dhs reactor keywords natural rubber industry anaerobic baffled reactor downflow

eco friendly characteristics such as its net zero carbon footprint however a large amount of wastewater is discharged during nr processing which may pollute nearby water air and soil environments 2 most factories have open type wastewater treatment systems due to their low operating costs and easy maintenance 3 in the open system residual rubber contents in nr wastewater were accumulated at the surface and were removed by the workers in nr factories however open systems emit large amounts of greenhouse gases ghgs such as methane and nitrous oxide 4 on the other hand closed anaerobic systems are effective in reducing ghgs emissions from the wastewater treatment system 5 and these systems can recover methane as an energy source for both nr processing and wastewater treatment however clogging of closed systems will be conducted by the coagulation of residual rubber contents in nr wastewater 2 6 therefore open systems are employed for nr wastewater treatment in actual nr processing factories to avoid clogging the wastewater treatment system in addition coagulated rubber can be utilized as rubber resources however the mechanism and key factors for residual rubber coagulation have still not been clarified nr wastewater also contains a high ammonia concentration which is added to nr latex as a preserving agent 7 vietnamese nr processing factories expend a large amount of energy for nr wastewater treatment ranging 5 9 k wh m 3 wastewater especially for nitrogen removal because of its strict effluent standards 8 with the energy consumption for wastewater treatment higher than that required for nr processing in some factories therefore appropriate treatment systems that enhance both rubber recovery and nitrogen removal are required here an anaerobic baffled reactor abr and downflow hanging sponge dhs reactor are proposed as applicable closed anaerobic and low cost aerobic reactors respectively the abr has a high solid liquid separation capability via a series of alternating downflow and upflow compartments 9 the rubber will accumulate at the top of the compartments in the abr due to its low specific gravity allowing easy recovery the dhs reactor is a trickling filter equipped with sponge media as the biomass carrier previous studies have confirmed the high oxidation performances of both organic matter and ammonia in dhs reactors via its high air liquid contact efficiency 10 11 the potential for single stage nitrogen removal via a dhs reactor with an anoxic zone inside the sponge media was also reported 12 13 therefore an abr and a dhs reactor can be applied as rubber recovery and nitrogen removal systems for nr wastewater treatment respectively furthermore both the reactors can be operated with less than 0 05 kw h m 3 wastewater of power consumption for nr wastewater treatment 8 the combination of an abr and a dhs abr dhs system is applied to conduct a laboratory scale experiment for synthetic nr wastewater treatment the main purpose of this study is to evaluate key factors of the coagulation of residual rubber in the nr wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a schematic of the laboratory scale abr dhs system is shown in fig 1 the abr dhs system comprises an abr and a dhs reactor both of which are made of polyvinyl chloride pipes diameter 65 mm the abr consists of four compartments with a total effective volume of 6 3 l after day 203 two additional compartments diameter 100 mm and 65 mm with a total effective volume of 7 5 l are installed to the abr the dhs reactor is filled with polyurethane sponges inserted in a net ring as the biomass media volume 0 4 l hrts of the abr and dhs reactor are 2 7 and 0 2 days respectively with the dhs hrt based on the sponge volume the abr is inoculated with 2 l of granular sludge from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor that treated wastewater from a food factory the sponge media in the dhs reactor is not inoculated the abr dhs system is operated at 30 c in a temperature controlled room the synthetic block rubber type nr wastewater is made by mixing nr latex acetic acid propionic acid and ammonia with these particular components based on a previous study 4 the synthetic wastewater contained a total chemical oxygen demand cod of 6960 1390 mg l 1 ammonia concentration of 235 58 mg l 1 and a ph of 4 95 0 50 2 2 evaluation of the key factors of residual rubber coagulation the experimental period is divided into four phases table 1 shows operating conditions of each phase in previous studies rubber accumulation was confirmed at open systems with long hrts 4 14 15 therefore hrt of the abr and existence of air were evaluated as key factors for residual rubber coagulation phase 1 is operated as the control condition two additional compartments are installed before the first compartment during phase 2 to increase hrt of the abr from 2 7 to 5 9 days during phase 1 and 2 rubber accumulation was confirmed at the surface of sponge media in the dhs reactor then core substance was additionally considered as a key factor for rubber coagulation subsequent to phase 3 each abr compartment is seeded with coagulated rubber as the core substance core rubber for rubber recovery at the beginning of phase 3 the sponge medias in the first box of the dhs reactor are replaced with core rubber in phase 4 2 3 chemical analysis wastewater samples were collected from the wastewater tank and the abr and dhs effluents twice weekly the ph was measured using a ph meter kp 10z krk japan the gas production rate was measured using a wet type

greengenes database v 13 8 the related strains of the representative sequences were identified using a web based blast search of the ncbi database 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of hrt and seeding of the core rubbers in the abr for residual rubber coagulation fig 2 shows the evolution of both the cod removal for the abr and abr dhs system and the abr organic loading rate olr during the experiment the abr achieved 41 0 10 1 cod removal at an olr of 2 80 0 31 kg m 3 d 1 during phase 1 average data from day 126 202 conversely cod removal of the abr increased to 52 2 10 8 during phase 2 by increasing the hrt however the cod removal in phases 3 and 4 in which core rubbers were seeded at the top of each compartment in the abr decreased to 44 1 8 7 in the synthetic nr wastewater acetate and propionate shared 55 6 of total cod in addition 54 6 21 4 of removed cod was converted to methane during whole experimental period therefore longer hrt in the abr was just contributed to degradation of biodegradable organic matters such as volatile fatty acids and both longer hrt and seeding of the core rubbers were not affected to residual rubber coagulation an open type baffled reactor removed 94 4 of the total cod in ribbed smoked sheet rss rubber wastewater after 12 days of hrt 4 most of the solid cod which was residual rubber was recovered in this reactor as coagulated rubber after 3 2 days of hrt watari et al 14 also used an open type baffled reactor for the pretreatment of standard vietnamese rubber wastewater with a 28 h hrt and achieved 47 6 solid cod removal using an abr to treat synthetic nr wastewater tran et al 15 confirmed rubber accumulation at the first open type compartment and achieved 92 3 total cod removal after 3 2 days of hrt in these reactors accumulation of the coagulated rubber was confirmed at the surface of liquid phase which was contacted with air in contrast coagulated rubber in the abr was confirmed at the effluent pipes not the surface of liquid phase in addition rubber recovery of the abr was much lower than these systems even though same baffled type reactor it is therefore considered that the nr wastewater air contact is one of key factor for the coagulation of rubber 3 2 effect of core rubber in the dhs for residual rubber coagulation during phases 1 3 rubber accumulation was confirmed at the surface of the net ring and sponge media in the dhs reactor during this period 48 0 11 7 of cod of the nr wastewater was removed in the dhs reactor however the accumulated rubber conducted clogged the dhs reactor during phases 2 and 3 then all sponge media were collected from the dhs reactor and accumulated rubber at the surface of the sponge media were removed by hand after removing the accumulated rubber from the sponge media in the dhs reactor the cod concentration of the dhs effluent continued to increase for 2 weeks to 1 month these results indicated that residual rubber in the nr wastewater started to coagulate by contacting with the sponge media then the accumulated rubber enhanced the coagulation of residual rubber fig 3 shows the height profile of the cod concentration in the dhs reactor on day 356 phase 3 and day 376 phase 4 there was an approximately linear increase in cod removal efficiency during phase 3 however there was a drastic increase in cod removal efficiency from 27 6 60 8 between the inlet and 0 35 m height during phase 4 sponge media in the first box was replaced with core rubber furthermore the cod removal efficiency in the dhs did not decrease during phase 4 even though the accumulated rubber at the surface of the sponge was removed these results suggest that the nr wastewater core rubber contact can enhance the coagulation of rubber in nr wastewater during the whole experimental period 3 08 kg m 3 based on the amount of treated wastewater of coagulated rubber was collected from the abr dhs system the rubber content of the synthetic nr wastewater was calculated as 14 0 kg m 3 based on a 40 dry rubber content in nr latex 18 these results indicated that approximately 20 of the residual rubber in the wastewater was recovered with 80 of the residual rubber was biologically degraded in the dhs reactor therefore the dhs is highly effective in the removal of persistent organic pollutants from the synthetic nr wastewater during whole experimental period ammonia and total inorganic nitrogen removal in the dhs reactor were 20 8 5 9 and 21 5 6 2 respectively in the dhs effluent 98 0 of total inorganic nitrogen was ammonia tanikawa et al 13 reported that the dhs reactor can achieve single stage nitrification denitrification by dosing carbon source into the lower part of the dhs reactor these results indicated that nitrite and nitrate that were oxidized from ammonia were promptly consumed for denitrification in the dhs reactor the carbon source for denitrification in the dhs reactor was considered to be organic matter related to residual rubber because most of biodegradable organic matter in the nr wastewater was consumed in the abr however nitrogen removal performance of the dhs reactor in this study was less than 50 of that of other dhs reactors treating anaerobic treated nr wastewater 6 19 in these studies most of residual rubber in the nr wastewater was coagulated in the open type anaerobic wastewater treatment system therefore the dhs reactor in this study was mainly rolled as rubber trap and accumulated rubber inhibited nitrification in the dhs reactor 3 3 microbial community analysis fig 4 shows the ratio of total sequence reads for the predominant bacteria in the dhs reactor gordonia paenisporosarcina acinetobacter and xanthobacter were predominant with the denitrifying bacteria bosea devosia rhodoplanes paracoccus hylemonella and pseudoxanthomonas also detected at rates of 0 1 0 2 from the dhs reactor gordonia are known as aerobic rubber degrading bacteria that can solubilize and mineralize nr substrates 20 21 paenisporosarcina are able to produce acid from some sugars such as d fructose d glucose sucrose and d galactose 22 these bacteria are considered as the primary contributors to the degradation of residual rubber in the wastewater and also supply the carbon source for denitrification to the denitrifying bacteria acinetobacter are known as heterotrophic ammonia removers 23 this genus has also been detected in an open type anaerobic system treating rss wastewater and is considered a key bacterium for nitrous oxide emission 24 pseudoxanthomonas are also known as nitrous oxide producers reduce nitrite to nitrous oxide by utilizing oxygen as an electron acceptor 25 on the other hand xanthobacter are nitrogen fixing bacteria that are able to reduce nitrate to nitrite and utilize acetate 26 28 previous studies have detected large quantities of nitrogen fixing bacteria in reactors that produced nitrous oxide and confirmed their ability to reduce nitrous oxide 29 30 thus xanthobacter are considered as nitrous oxide reducers in the dhs reactor in addition bosea and hylemonella are also considered as important bacteria for the reduction of nitrous oxide 31 32 it is known that a low dissolved oxygen concentration in the nitrification stage and a low cod n ratio in the denitrification stage causes high nitrous oxide emissions 33 however nitrous oxide was not detected from the gas phase of the dhs reactor during whole experimental period even though it was similar to the above mentioned condition therefore existing of both producers and reducers of nitrous oxide contributed to the nitrogen removal without nitrous oxide emission in the dhs reactor 4 conclusions in the abr dhs system that treats synthetic nr wastewater biodegradable substances were consumed in the abr then residual rubber was removed in the dhs reactor for coagulation of residual rubber in nr wastewater the wastewater air and wastewater core rubber contacts are considered as key factors more residual rubber was removed biologically than via coagulation in the dhs reactor the residual rubber degraded biologically by rubber degrading bacteria such as gordonia and was utilized for denitrification as a carbon source in the dhs reactor however accumulated rubber reduced nitrogen removal performance of the dhs reactor to maximize the performance of the abr dhs system the installation of opened contact type pretreatment system for rubber recovery such as a core rubber seeded trickling filter was considered as one of effective method funding this work was supported by

hanging sponge dhs reactor abr dhs system hydraulic retention time hrt seeding of the core rubber and existence of air are selected as key factors for rubber coagulation in the abr longer hrt and seeding of the core rubber was not affected for rubber coagulation only biodegradable substances were consumed in the abr on the other hand the dhs reactor achieved high removal efficiency of residual rubber by both coagulation and biological degradation in addition seeding of the core rubber to the dhs reactor enhanced rubber coagulation the genera gordonia known as a rubber degrading bacteria were detected from the retained sludge in the dhs reactor therefore the wastewater air and wastewater core rubber contacts are considered as key factors for residual rubber coagulation in the nr wastewater treatment furthermore biodegraded residual rubber was considered as carbon source for denitrification in the dhs reactor keywords natural rubber industry anaerobic baffled reactor downflow hanging sponge reactor rubber coagulation denitrification 1 introduction the natural rubber nr industry is one of the main agro industries in southeastern asia 1 nr production is increasing due to its eco friendly characteristics such as its net zero carbon footprint however a large amount of wastewater is discharged during nr processing which may pollute nearby water air and soil environments 2 most factories have open type wastewater treatment systems due to their low operating costs and easy maintenance 3 in the open system residual rubber contents in nr wastewater were accumulated at the surface and were removed by the workers in nr factories however open systems emit large amounts of greenhouse gases ghgs such as methane and nitrous oxide 4 on the other hand closed anaerobic systems are effective in reducing ghgs emissions from the wastewater treatment system 5 and these systems can recover methane as an energy source for both nr processing and wastewater treatment however clogging of closed systems will be conducted by the coagulation of residual rubber contents in nr wastewater 2 6 therefore open systems are employed for nr wastewater treatment in actual nr processing factories to avoid clogging the wastewater treatment system in addition coagulated rubber can be utilized as rubber resources however the mechanism and key factors for residual rubber coagulation have

14159,antibiotic contamination is a relevant environmental problem since these compounds are discharged in conventionally treated wastewaters and can favor antibiotic resistance in this work the mineralization of solutions containing 50 mg l of erythromycin part of the european union wide watch list was studied using electro oxidation and the uv based processes direct photolysis heterogeneous photocatalysis and photo electrocatalysis for the uv based processes a higher photonic flux favored mineralization and lowered energy consumption since it increases both molecule absorbance and hydroxyl radical production for the high photonic flux experiments direct photolysis presented higher mineralization 42 than photocatalysis 16 which might be explained by the reactor configuration the electronic recombination and the erythromycin concentration electro oxidation presented low overall mineralization 10 but had synergistic effects when combined to photocatalysis resulting in 38 mineralization for photo electrocatalysis matrix effects on mineralization were evaluated by performing photo electrocatalysis and direct photolysis experiments with a spiked real wastewater while direct photolysis resulted in no mineralization due to photochemically active light filtering by dissolved organic matter and inorganic ions photo electrocatalysis with the spiked wastewater did not differ significantly from photo electrocatalysis with the working solution and would be a more viable alternative the use of a supporting electrolyte for the photo electrocatalysis experiments with spiked wastewater resulted in no significant difference in mineralization but probably led to different reaction pathways as suggested by chloride and nitrogen species concentration analysis keywords uv based process electro oxidation advanced oxidation process erythromycin mineralization 1 introduction antibiotics are a group of pharmaceutical products used in the treatment and prevention of human and animal infections and can reach the environment through pathways such as normal use and excretion into sewer or discharges by manufacturers 1 2 these compounds are particularly relevant since they can select intrinsically resistant bacteria including pathogenic ones as well as favor the transmission and development of antibiotic resistant genes 3 antibiotics have been detected in water and wastewater around the world generally in the ng l to μg l range but concentrations of up to a few dozen mg l have been reported in treated wastewaters of the pharmaceutical industry 4 5 the macrolide antibiotics erythromycin clarithromycin and azithromycin are part of the watch list of 10 substances or group of substances that should be monitored in the aquatic environment within the european union published in decision 495 2015 6 erythromycin ery is used as an alternative to penicillin when the patient is allergic to the latter and has been identified in wastewaters and or surface waters in many countries including brazil 7 germany 2 switzerland 8 united states 9 canada 10 australia 11 and china 12 therefore it is of great importance to develop processes that can remove this macrolide from wastewaters conventional wastewater treatment is not designed to eliminate pharmaceuticals and although removing them to some extent compounds are still discharged to receiving water systems 1 2 13 14 advanced treatment technologies including membrane separation and advanced oxidation processes aops can be coupled to conventional treatment being proposed as a strategy to reduce discharge 15 aops are based on the production of reactive species especially hydroxyl radicals ho to degrade molecules to different by products and eventually to inert end products when degradation is not complete by products are in several cases more biodegradable and less toxic than the parent compound making a biological post treatment feasible 13 aops comprise methods based on fenton s reagent ozone o3 o3 h2o2 sonolysis ionizing radiation electro oxidation with special anodes as well as uv based processes such as o3 uv h2o2 uv o3 h2o2 uv photocatalysis and photo electrocatalysis 13 15 17 direct photolysis although not characterized as an aop is an important uv based process consisting in the interaction of the target compounds with artificial or natural light photochemical reactions are then induced and can lead to the direct degradation of the compounds 13 either by transfer of an electron from the excited state molecule to ground state oxygen or by homolysis with subsequent reaction with oxygen 18 on the other hand when a photocatalyst is added to the direct photolysis system an electron hole pair e h is generated on the catalyst mox surface eq 1 16 18 1 mo x hv mo x e h in the photocatalytic process holes can directly oxidize organic molecules or more frequently react with solvent molecules h2o and oh adsorbed to the catalyst surface forming the ho eq 2 and 3 18 which can lead to the mineralization of organic pollutants however the photocatalytic process has a limitation the e h recombination which leads to a decrease in mineralization rates 2 mo x h h 2 o ad mo x ho ad h 3 mo x h oh ad mo x ho ad electro oxidation with dimensionally stable anodes dsa has been widely used due to the possibility of electro generating ho by water discharge and of generating other oxidants from the ions present in the bulk solution 19 however the organic oxidation with dsa leads to low current efficiency since they favor parasitic reactions such as oxygen evolution 20 one way to avoid the recombination of the e h in the photocatalytic process and at the same time improve the efficiency of the electro oxidation process using dsa is to combine them leading to the so called photo electrocatalysis in the photo electrocatalytic process a uv radiation source a photoanode dsa a counter electrode and an external potential or current are used conducing the electrons away from the photoanode and improving e h separation thus avoiding recombination and increasing ho generation 21 17 the application of photo electrocatalysis has been investigated for the degradation and mineralization of numerous contaminants 16 22 including some antibiotics 23 26 due to ery s importance different advanced treatment technologies are being studied

membrane filtration 27 fenton processes 28 h2o2 uv 29 30 ozonation and or photocatalytic ozonation 14 31 and photocatalysis with different suspended catalysts 32 38 these processes although many times presenting good removals for ery concentration have some limitations such as respectively the need for further treatment of the concentrate the acid ph requirement the use and storage of hazardous chemicals the need for expensive equipment for production and destruction of ozone and the requirement of a final step for separation of the catalyst moreira et al 31 studied the photocatalytic process with tio2 immobilized on glass rasching rings but it presented a lower performance than the photocatalytic ozonation process the use of photo electrocatalysis could also improve efficiency of the immobilized catalyst but no reports on its use were found in the literature many studies focus on pollutant concentration abatement rather than its mineralization the aim of this work is to investigate the application of uv based direct photolysis photocatalysis and photo electrocatalysis and electro oxidation processes for the mineralization of ery the effect of operational parameters such as photonic flux on mineralization kinetics and electric energy consumption were evaluated furthermore the synergistic effects of the constituting processes of photo electrocatalysis electro oxidation photocatalysis and direct photolysis were investigated finally the effect of water matrix on direct photolysis and photo electrocatalysis was assessed 2 materials and method 2 1 water matrix 2 1 1 synthetic solutions the stock solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of ery sigma aldrich in 1 l of deionized water to facilitate investigations with the presently applied analytical methods and considering that antibiotic concentrations in the range of mg l have been reported in wastewaters of the pharmaceutical industry 4 5 working solutions ws with ery concentration of 50 mg l were obtained from the dilution of the stock solution 2 g l of na2so4 were added as a supporting electrolyte to the ws for photo electrocatalysis and electro oxidation experiments the addition of na2so4 did not significantly affect preliminary direct photolysis and photocatalysis experiments so it was not added for these processes before the experiments ws ph was adjusted to 7 0 2 using h2so4 or naoh solutions 2 1 2 real wastewater due to the presence of organic matter and inorganic ions which can interact with oxidizing species and contaminants as well as absorb light the water matrix can have significant impact on the efficiency of oxidation and advanced oxidation processes 34 39 41 therefore to investigate the mineralization of ery in a real matrix a real wastewater rww was used samples were collected after the secondary treatment of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in december 2017 the plant located in novo hamburgo rs brazil operates an aerobic activated sludge sequencing batch reactor rww physicochemical characteristics are summarized in table s1 in the supplementary material to ensure that a comparable concentration of ery was present in the experiments with ws and with rww rww was spiked with 50 mg l of the antibiotic this spiked rww srw was then used for photo electrocatalysis and direct photolysis experiments for photo electrocatalysis two different experiments were performed one with no supporting electrolyte since the wastewater already contained ions that might serve as such and one containing 2 g l na2so4 no electrolyte was used for the direct photolysis experiments as in the previous experiments initial ph was adjusted to 7 0 2 2 2 experimental setup the experimental setup used in the direct photolysis photocatalysis photo electrocatalysis and electro oxidation processes was described in previous works 42 43 19 and is exhibited in the supplementary material figure s1 for all photomediated processes the uv radiation source was placed inside a quartz bulb at the center of the reactor the uv sources were a 125 w or a 250 w high pressure mercury vapor lamp hpl n with a spectral irradiance peak in 254 nm in the photocatalysis experiments commercial catalysts provided by denora do brasil were positioned around the radiation source the catalysts consisted of tio2 ti with a geometrical surface area of 118 cm2 and dsa ru0 3ti0 7o2 ti with a geometrical surface area of 475 2 cm2 for the photo electrocatalysis and electro oxidation assays the tio2 ti acted as cathode while ru0 3ti0 7o2 ti acted as anode and a current of 5 a was applied ps 5000 dc power supply icel between the electrodes besides for the electro oxidation process the radiation source was turned off 2 3 uv system characterization the emission of the 125 w and 250 w hpl n lamps in uv c spectra was characterized with a spectrometer princeton acton spectra pro 2300 equipped with a photomultiplier the uv vis spectra of ws rww and srw were characterized by t80 uv vis spectrometer from pg instruments ltd these results are displayed in figure s2 in supplementary material an instrutherm mrur 203 uv light meter was used to measure the uv c intensity e w cm² that reaches the system when hpl n lamps were employed the photon energy at a wavelength of 254 nm uv c and the photonic flux were calculated according to bolton et al and da silva et al 44 42 2 4 experiments for all experiments 4 l of ws or srw were kept in a non irradiated container and recirculated by a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 1 l min to the cylindrical reactor 2

every 60 min until a final treatment time of 240 min and then evaluated by total organic carbon toc toc was determined on a shimadzu toc lcph equipped with an automatic asi l shimadzu sample injector the analyses were carried out by thermal catalytic oxidation at 680 c using a normal combustion tube filled with platinum catalyst spheres and a continuous supply of oxygen flow 6 0 the non purgeable organic carbon npoc method was used and all procedures were done according to shimadzu standard manual ph was also analyzed using a digimed dm 22 ph meter previously calibrated with buffer solutions for the experiments using srw samples were also analyzed by ion chromatography anion and cation analyses were performed on a dionex ics 3000 dc coupled to a conductivity detector using an ionpac as23 2 250 mm and an ionpac cs12a 2 250 mm columns respectively the eluent for anions analysis consisted of a 4 5 mm na2co3 and 0 8 mm nahco3 solution while for cations detection an 11 mm h2so4 solution was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 photonic flux characterization table 2 presents the uv intensity and photonic flux reaching the catalysts for each lamp through different media no difference could be observed between the photonic fluxes through deionized water and through ws for the 125 w lamp for the 250 w lamp the small decrease in the photonic flux indicates that the pollutant could absorb photons and undergo phototransformation nevertheless considering the small absorption of the ws figure s2 in supplementary material phototransformation would not be expected as the main degradation pathway the higher photonic flux reaching the system for the 250 w lamp when compared to the 125 w lamp could favor the photolytic process because of higher molecule absorbance and the photocatalytic process since it leads to higher electron hole pair formation 40 increasing oxidation reduction reactions and ho formation analyzing the photonic flux reaching the catalyst surface through rww and srw a significant decrease in comparison to deionized water and ws was noted table 2 apart from its inherent turbidity wastewater components which can absorb uv light include dissolved organic matter such as humic acids 45 and ions such as no3 46 nh4 and cl 47 these are present in the rww table s1 in the supplementary material and could be acting as uv scavengers rww thus decreases the photonic flux reaching the catalyst surface and the bulk solution which could contribute to a decrease in the photocatalytic activity and in the direct photolysis of ery 3 2 toc abatement fig 1 shows the mineralization progression with treatment time for the experiments with ws toc decreased faster for the uv based processes with a high photonic flux dp2 pec2 and pc2 when compared to electrochemical process eo and the processes conducted at lower photonic flux pec1 pc1 and dp1 after 240 min of treatment the low photonic flux presented an average toc removal of less than 10 for photo electrocatalysis and photocatalysis and no toc removal for direct photolysis showing difficulty to mineralize ery on the other hand the use of a higher photonic flux leads to significant ery mineralization since as previously discussed it can favor both direct photolysis and photocatalysis photodegradation of ery has been reported in literature in spite of its low uv absorbance 39 48 however phototransformation was not expected as the main degradation pathway and the smaller mineralization presented by the high photonic flux photocatalysis pc2 16 2 compared to the direct photolysis dp2 42 1 was not anticipated since the addition of catalysts generally results in better contaminant degradation 49 25 26 50 51 this result might be explained by reactor configuration in which photon absorption by the catalyst could lower the radiation penetration to the solution and hence the photolysis 19 furthermore a too high photonic flux reaching the catalyst could contribute to increase recombination of e h 42 lowering the performance of the photocatalytic process another explanation would be that the presently used concentration 50 mg l might have affected removal during the photocatalytic assay at higher concentrations contaminant molecules may cover the catalyst saturating its active sites thus reducing ho formation 51 52 decrease in toc removal for increasing ery concentration 2 5 30 mg l has been reported in aqueous tio2 suspension 38 on the other hand pec2 presented a mineralization of 38 3 indicating that the photo electrocatalytic process can overcome limitations of the photocatalysis process higher toc abatement for photo electrocatalysis was also observed in studies using a ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 anode for the degradation of a flame retardant 19 and of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole 23 interestingly pec2 resulted on higher mineralization than the simple addition of pc2 and electro oxidation results this can be explained by the synergistic effects of photo electrocatalysis since it increases the photocatalytic efficiency of the anode by reducing recombination and increasing ho generation 16 also oxygen evolved on the anode due to electro oxidation can photocatalytically react to form active species such as h2o2 and ho 53 while hydrogen gas can be formed at the cathode 54 the turbulence created by the o2 and h2 bubbles may allow cleanup of the catalysts active sites thus contributing to the formation of ho the pollutant could also be degraded by hydroxyl radicals formed by electro oxidation but this seems secondary for the mineralization of ery under the present experimental conditions considering that the electro oxidation process by itself lead to an average toc removal of less than 10 3 3 kinetics and energy consumption apparent first order kinetics k eq 4 have been widely used to explain kinetics of the heterogeneous catalytic process and have been applied for the photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics 34 55 as well as the photolytic and photo electrocatalytic degradation of other contaminants 19 56 4 l n t o c t o c 0 k t were toc0 and toc are the toc concentration mg l at the beginning of the process and at each studied time respectivelly from the apparent first order kinetic constant one can also calculate the electric energy per order eeo eq 5 or the energy required to decrease concentration by one order of magnitude in one unit volume 1 m3 of contaminated water 23 57 an interesting tool for comparison of different processes 5 e e o 38 4 p v k where p is the rated power kw v is the solution volume l as seen in fig 2 a the ln toc toc0 versus time plot for the lower photonic flux and electro oxidation assays with ws follows a linear trend showing that ery mineralization can be approximated by apparent first order kinetics for these conditions the lower photonic flux direct photolysis experiment showed no toc removal so that its kinetic was not studied for the higher photonic flux experiments two separate kinetic constants can be considered fig 2b a change in kinetics with treatment time has been reported for other contaminants 49 19 in the present study the increase in kinetic constant is probably related to the formation of intermediate products initially ery is mainly converted in these products rather than co2 then the products which are probably more susceptible to photodegradation are further converted to co2 hence increasing mineralization kinetics for the higher photonic flux experiments fig 2b it is worth noting that the increase occurs after the second hour of treatment for direct photolysis and photocatalysis and after the first hour for photo electrocatalysis which again suggests the occurrence of synergistic effects on the photo electrocatalytic process on the other hand for electro oxidation and the lower photonic flux conditions there is not enough photons and or ho to convert enough ery to products and reach the faster kinetic constant table 3 presents kinetic constants and eeo for the different experiments k 1 was not calculated for pec2 since it would use only two data points the low photonic flux photocatalysis and photo electrocatalysis resulted in low kinetic constants indicating that a low photonic flux could not efficiently mineralize erythromycin the higher photonic flux experiments resulted in higher kinetics and lower energy consumption photo electrocatalysis required similar energy to photocatalysis when using a low photonic flux while eeo2 was two times less when comparing the high photonic flux processes pec2 to pc2 since the additional power source applied was compensated by a greater reduction of e h recombination the best kinetic constant results 0 0033 and 0 0024 min 1 were shown for the higher photonic flux direct photolysis and photo electrocatalysis direct photolysis was slightly more energy efficient than photo electrocatalysis and could be preferred in an energy based decision process however the water matrix should be considered see 3 5 matrix effect below toxicity tests would also be recommended since direct photolysis might generate by products with higher toxicity as shown for other pollutants 19 interestingly electro oxidation presented the lowest energy requirement since it did not apply a lamp nevertheless it obtained a considerably low kinetic constant and overall toc abatement as previously shown 3 4 ph analysis fig 3 presents ph measurements with time for ws treatments acidification in the higher photonic flux photocatalysis and photo electrocatalysis experiments can be explained by the production of h and consumption of oh during generation of h eq 2 and 3 this is also compatible with the relatively constant ph of the low photonic flux photocatalysis pc1 the smaller photonic flux forms less electron hole pairs producing less h and consuming less oh another explanation for ph decrease could be the formation of acid degradation by products such as low molecular weight organic acids 49 50 also ery mineralization liberates co2 which can form carbonic acid in water and could partially contribute to the ph decrease this would explain acidification in the higher photonic flux experiments pc2 pec2 and dp2 the stable ph for electro oxidation and for the lower photonic flux photocatalysis and direct photolysis pc1 and dp1 treatments can be explained by a small degradation of ery with low by product formation or mineralization as for the lower photonic flux photo electrocatalysis pec1 it is probable that a different degradation pathway occurred as suggested by silva et al 42 when comparing different photonic fluxes during photo electrocatalysis of a surfactant two factors could contribute to the increasing ph first basic degradation byproducts could have formed second the degradation mechanism itself could have contributed de brito pelegrini et al 58 observed an increase in ph during photo electrocatalysis experiments with a textile effluent and suggested that a direct oxidation of the organic matter in the hole h would lead to ho being predominantly generated by the reaction of oxygen with the electron e causing an excess of hydroxyl ions and increasing ph values 3 5 matrix effect real wastewater considering that the higher photonic flux direct photolysis and photo electrocatalysis assays presented the best overall toc abatement in ws these experiments were then performed with the srw photo electrocatalysis was performed without supporting electrolyte pec srw1 and with na2so4 pec srw2 toc removal is presented in fig 4 direct photolysis presented no mineralization for srw which compared to the 42 1 mineralization for ws fig 1 shows that the wastewater matrix caused negative impact the wastewater contains dissolved organic matter and its irradiation could result in reactions which generate reactive species such as ho peroxyl radicals roo and singlet oxygen 1o2 however dissolved organic matter can also have negative effects by consuming oxidant agents and filtering photochemically active light decreasing direct photolysis 41 considering the attenuation of photonic flux observed for the wastewater see 3 1 photonic flux characterization above light filtering by dissolved organic matter and inorganic ions was the main effect of the matrix for the direct photolysis process leading to the absence of mineralization therefore the current direct photolysis configuration would not be recommended for the mineralization of ery on this wastewater on the other hand the synergistic effects of photo electrocatalysis could overcome this limitation the experiments without or with na2so4 resulted on a final mineralization of 42 8 and 29 5 respectively due to the high variability an anova test was performed excel to identify if these results were significantly different from each other and from the ws experiment pec2 in fig 1 38 3 as shown in table 4 p 0 05 for each pair of experiments which means their difference was not statistically significant this is also supported by the fact that the f value was higher than the f critical value for each pair of experiments despite no significant difference on toc removal different reaction pathways probably take place when the supporting electrolyte is used or not cl2 can be electrogenerated from chloride contained in the wastewater table s1 and can form hocl and clo 59 which can oxidize organics 41 and ammonium 59 when no supporting electrolyte is used pec srw1 there was less so4 2 competing with chloride for active sites on the anode as seen in fig 5 the photo electrocatalysis without supporting electrolyte pec srw1 presented a higher decrease on chloride concentration with treatment time implying that more active chlorine was generated in this experiment and that it might have followed a more chlorine based degradation pathway than when the supporting electrolyte was used pec srw2 on the other hand chloride concentration remained constant throughout the direct photolysis experiment indicating that this ion did not undergo phototransformation regarding nitrogen species nitrate concentration decreased while nitrite concentration increased during direct photolysis fig 6 a this is compatible with eq 6 which can in some cases be used to describe the overall reaction of nitrate photolysis 46 this indicates the uv scavenging role of nitrate contributing to attenuate the photonic flux through srw and therefore to prevent mineralization in this process 6 n o 3 h v n o 2 1 2 o 2 on the other hand as shown in fig 6b ammonium was oxidized to nitrate during the photo electrocatalysis without supporting electrolyte in the photo electrocatalysis with supporting electrolyte no ammonium could be detected which was due to the great input of sodium the two cations elute in close proximity to each other making samples of very different concentrations difficult to quantify in cation exchange columns with carboxylic acid functional groups 60 however ammonium was probably present in the samples and was to a lesser extent also oxidized to nitrate fig 6c both nitrite and ammonium can be oxidized by ho 61 62 however nitrite concentration is only slightly reduced in the first hour and considering that toc removal in srw experiments did not present a significant difference to ws experiments ammonium and nitrite do not seem to act as important ho scavengers in the present experimental conditions 4 conclusions this study investigated the use of the uv based processes direct photolysis photocatalysis and photo electrocatalysis and of the electro oxidation process for the mineralization of erythromycin photonic flux had a very important impact for the uv based processes with a higher mineralization of ery and lower energy consumption for the higher photonic flux for these experiments direct photolysis resulted in higher mineralization than photocatalysis which could be attributed to reactor configuration with catalysts preventing radiation penetration to the bulk solution e h recombination and ery concentration electro oxidation presented low mineralization but contributed for significant synergistic effects on the photo electrocatalysis process which resulted in greater mineralization than the sum of photocatalysis and electro oxidation the application of the two best processes high photonic flux direct photolysis and photo electrocatalysis to a spiked real wastewater was also assessed demonstrating the importance of considering matrix effect on the treatment processes direct photolysis resulted in no mineralization for this matrix due to the light screening effect of dissolved organic matter and inorganic ions and would not be indicated for the mineralization of ery in a real wastewater photo electrocatalysis on the other hand resulted in mineralization in both water matrixes and would be a more viable alternative different reaction pathways occurred when na2so4 was added or not to the solution and for further studies of photo electrocatalysis as an alternative for the mineralization of ery in real wastewaters identification of possible reaction intermediaries as well as toxicity assessments would be necessary funding the authors would like to thank capes cyted cnpq fapergs and f inep for their

14159,antibiotic contamination is a relevant environmental problem since these compounds are discharged in conventionally treated wastewaters and can favor antibiotic resistance in this work the mineralization of solutions containing 50 mg l of erythromycin part of the european union wide watch list was studied using electro oxidation and the uv based processes direct photolysis heterogeneous photocatalysis and photo electrocatalysis for the uv based processes a higher photonic flux favored mineralization and lowered energy consumption since it increases both molecule absorbance and hydroxyl radical production for the high photonic flux experiments direct photolysis presented higher mineralization 42 than photocatalysis 16 which might be explained by the reactor configuration the electronic recombination and the erythromycin concentration electro oxidation presented low overall mineralization 10 but had synergistic effects when combined to photocatalysis resulting in 38 mineralization for photo electrocatalysis matrix effects on mineralization were evaluated by performing photo electrocatalysis and direct photolysis experiments with a spiked real wastewater while direct photolysis resulted in no mineralization due to photochemically active light filtering by dissolved organic matter and inorganic ions photo electrocatalysis with the spiked wastewater did not differ significantly from photo electrocatalysis with the working solution and would be a more viable alternative the use of a supporting electrolyte for the photo electrocatalysis experiments with spiked wastewater resulted in no significant difference in mineralization but probably led to different reaction pathways as suggested by chloride and nitrogen species concentration analysis keywords uv based process electro oxidation advanced oxidation process erythromycin mineralization 1 introduction antibiotics are a group of pharmaceutical products used in the treatment and prevention of human and animal infections and can reach the environment through pathways such as normal use and excretion into sewer or discharges by manufacturers 1 2 these compounds are particularly relevant since they can select intrinsically resistant bacteria including pathogenic ones as well as favor the transmission and development of antibiotic resistant genes 3 antibiotics have been detected in water and wastewater around the world generally in the ng l to μg l range but concentrations of up to a few dozen mg l have been reported in treated wastewaters of the pharmaceutical industry 4 5 the macrolide antibiotics erythromycin clarithromycin and azithromycin are part of the watch list of 10 substances or group of substances that should be monitored in the aquatic environment within the european union published in decision 495 2015 6 erythromycin ery is used as an alternative to penicillin when the patient is allergic to the latter and has been identified in wastewaters and or surface waters in many countries including brazil 7 germany 2 switzerland 8 united states 9 canada 10 australia 11 and china 12 therefore it is of great importance to develop processes that can remove this macrolide from wastewaters conventional wastewater treatment is not designed to eliminate pharmaceuticals and although removing them to some extent compounds are still discharged to receiving water systems 1 2 13 14 advanced treatment technologies including membrane separation and advanced oxidation processes aops can be coupled to conventional treatment being proposed as a strategy to reduce discharge 15 aops are based on the production of reactive species especially hydroxyl radicals ho to degrade molecules to different by products and eventually to inert end products when degradation is not complete by products are in several cases more biodegradable and less toxic than the parent compound making a biological post treatment feasible 13 aops comprise methods based on fenton s reagent ozone o3 o3 h2o2 sonolysis ionizing radiation electro oxidation with special anodes as well as uv based processes such as o3 uv h2o2 uv o3 h2o2 uv photocatalysis and photo electrocatalysis 13 15 17 direct photolysis although not characterized as an aop is an important uv based process consisting in the interaction of the target compounds with artificial or natural light photochemical reactions are then induced and can lead to the direct degradation of the compounds 13 either by transfer of an electron from the excited state molecule to ground state oxygen or by homolysis with subsequent reaction with oxygen 18 on the other hand when a photocatalyst is added to the direct photolysis system an electron hole pair e h is generated on the catalyst mox surface eq 1 16 18 1 mo x hv mo x e h in the photocatalytic process holes can directly oxidize organic molecules or more frequently react with solvent molecules h2o and oh adsorbed to the catalyst surface forming the ho eq 2 and 3 18 which can lead to the mineralization of organic pollutants however the photocatalytic process has a limitation the e h recombination which leads to a decrease in mineralization rates 2 mo x h h 2 o ad mo x ho ad h 3 mo x h oh ad mo x ho ad electro oxidation with dimensionally stable anodes dsa has been widely used due to the possibility of electro generating ho by water discharge and of generating other oxidants from the ions present in the bulk solution 19 however the organic oxidation with dsa leads to low current efficiency since they favor parasitic reactions such as oxygen evolution 20 one way to avoid the recombination of the e h in the photocatalytic process and at the same time improve the efficiency of the electro oxidation process using dsa is to combine them leading to the so called photo electrocatalysis in the photo electrocatalytic process a uv radiation source a photoanode dsa a counter electrode and an external potential or current are used conducing the electrons away from the photoanode and improving e h separation thus avoiding recombination and increasing ho generation 21 17 the application of photo electrocatalysis has been investigated for the degradation and mineralization of numerous contaminants 16 22 including some antibiotics 23 26 due to ery s importance different advanced treatment technologies are being studied for its removal studies on ery either as the sole target compound or as one of a group of compounds both with real effluent waters frequently spiked or with synthetic solutions include the use of membrane filtration 27 fenton processes 28 h2o2 uv 29 30 ozonation and or photocatalytic ozonation 14 31 and photocatalysis with different suspended catalysts 32 38 these processes although many times presenting good removals for ery concentration have some limitations such as respectively the need for further treatment of the concentrate the acid ph requirement the use and storage of hazardous chemicals the need for expensive equipment for production and destruction of ozone and the requirement of a final step for separation of the catalyst moreira et al 31 studied the photocatalytic process with tio2 immobilized on glass rasching rings but it presented a lower performance than the photocatalytic ozonation process the use of photo electrocatalysis could also improve efficiency of the immobilized catalyst but no reports on its use were found in the literature many studies focus on pollutant concentration abatement rather than its mineralization the aim of this work is to

limitations of the photocatalysis process higher toc abatement for photo electrocatalysis was also observed in studies using a ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 anode for the degradation of a flame retardant 19 and of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole 23 interestingly pec2 resulted on higher mineralization than the simple addition of pc2 and electro oxidation results this can be explained by the synergistic effects of photo electrocatalysis since it increases the photocatalytic efficiency of the anode by reducing recombination and increasing ho generation 16 also oxygen evolved on the anode due to electro oxidation can photocatalytically react to form active species such as h2o2 and ho 53 while hydrogen gas can be formed at the cathode 54 the turbulence created by the o2 and h2 bubbles may allow cleanup of the catalysts active sites thus contributing to the formation of ho the pollutant could also be degraded by hydroxyl radicals formed by electro oxidation but this seems secondary for the mineralization of ery under the present experimental conditions considering that the electro oxidation process by itself lead to an average toc removal of less than 10 3 3 kinetics and energy consumption apparent first order kinetics k eq 4 have been widely used to explain kinetics of the heterogeneous catalytic process and have been applied for the photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics 34 55 as well as the photolytic and photo electrocatalytic degradation of other contaminants 19 56 4 l n t o c t o c 0 k t were toc0 and toc are the toc concentration mg l at the beginning of the process and at each studied time respectivelly from the apparent first order kinetic constant one can also calculate the electric energy per order eeo eq 5 or the energy required to decrease concentration by one order of magnitude in one unit volume 1 m3 of contaminated water 23 57 an interesting tool for comparison of different processes 5 e e o 38 4 p v k where p is the rated power kw v is the solution volume l as seen in fig 2 a the ln toc toc0 versus time plot for the lower photonic flux and electro oxidation assays with ws follows a linear trend showing that ery mineralization can be approximated by apparent first order kinetics for these conditions the lower photonic flux direct photolysis experiment showed no toc removal so that its kinetic was not studied for the higher photonic flux experiments two separate kinetic constants can be considered fig 2b a change in kinetics with treatment time has been reported for other contaminants 49 19 in the present study the increase in kinetic constant is probably related to the formation of intermediate products initially ery is mainly converted in these products rather than co2 then the products which are probably more susceptible to photodegradation are further converted to co2 hence increasing mineralization kinetics for the higher photonic flux experiments fig 2b it is worth noting that the increase occurs after the second hour of treatment for direct photolysis and photocatalysis and after the first hour for photo electrocatalysis which again suggests the occurrence of synergistic effects on the photo electrocatalytic process on the other hand for electro oxidation and the lower photonic flux conditions there is not enough photons and or ho to convert enough ery to products and reach the faster kinetic constant table 3 presents kinetic constants and eeo for the different experiments k 1 was not calculated for pec2 since it would use only two data points the low photonic flux photocatalysis and photo electrocatalysis resulted in low kinetic constants indicating that a low photonic flux could not efficiently mineralize erythromycin the higher photonic flux experiments resulted in higher kinetics and lower energy consumption photo electrocatalysis required similar energy to photocatalysis when using a low photonic flux while eeo2 was two times less when comparing the high photonic flux processes pec2 to pc2 since the additional power source applied was compensated by a greater reduction of e h recombination the best kinetic constant results 0 0033 and 0 0024 min 1 were shown for the higher photonic flux direct photolysis and photo electrocatalysis direct photolysis was slightly more energy efficient than photo electrocatalysis and could be preferred in an energy based decision process however the water matrix should be considered see 3 5 matrix effect below toxicity tests would also be recommended since direct photolysis might generate by products with higher toxicity as shown for other pollutants 19 interestingly electro oxidation presented the lowest energy requirement since it did not apply a lamp nevertheless it obtained a considerably low kinetic constant and overall toc abatement as previously shown 3 4 ph analysis fig 3 presents ph measurements with time for ws treatments acidification in the higher photonic flux photocatalysis and photo electrocatalysis experiments can be explained by the production of h and consumption of oh during generation of h eq 2 and 3 this is also compatible with the relatively constant ph of the low photonic flux photocatalysis pc1 the smaller photonic flux forms less electron hole pairs producing less h and consuming less oh another explanation for ph decrease could be the formation of acid degradation by products such as low molecular weight organic acids 49 50 also ery mineralization liberates co2 which can form carbonic acid in water and could partially contribute to the ph decrease this would explain acidification in the higher photonic flux experiments pc2 pec2 and dp2 the stable ph for electro oxidation and for the lower photonic flux photocatalysis and direct photolysis pc1 and dp1 treatments can be explained by a small degradation of ery with low by product formation or mineralization as for the lower photonic flux photo electrocatalysis pec1 it is probable that a different degradation pathway occurred as suggested by silva et al 42 when comparing different photonic fluxes during photo electrocatalysis of a surfactant two factors could contribute to the increasing ph first basic degradation byproducts could have formed second the degradation mechanism itself could have contributed de brito pelegrini et al 58 observed an increase in ph during photo electrocatalysis experiments with a textile effluent and suggested that a direct oxidation of the organic matter in the hole h would lead to ho being predominantly generated by the reaction of oxygen with the electron e causing an excess of hydroxyl ions and increasing ph values 3 5 matrix effect real wastewater considering that the higher photonic flux direct photolysis and photo electrocatalysis assays presented the best overall toc abatement in ws these experiments were then performed with the srw photo electrocatalysis was performed without supporting electrolyte pec srw1 and with na2so4 pec srw2 toc removal is presented in fig 4 direct photolysis presented no mineralization for srw which compared to the 42 1 mineralization for ws fig 1 shows that the wastewater matrix caused negative impact the wastewater contains dissolved organic matter and its irradiation could result in reactions which generate reactive species such as ho peroxyl radicals roo and singlet oxygen 1o2 however dissolved organic matter can also have negative effects by consuming oxidant agents and filtering photochemically active light decreasing direct photolysis 41 considering the attenuation of photonic flux observed for the wastewater see 3 1 photonic flux characterization above light filtering by dissolved organic matter and inorganic ions was the main effect of the matrix for the direct photolysis process leading to the absence of mineralization therefore the current direct photolysis configuration would not be recommended for the mineralization of ery on this wastewater on the other hand the synergistic effects of photo electrocatalysis could overcome this limitation the experiments without or with na2so4 resulted on a final mineralization of 42 8 and 29 5 respectively due to the high variability an anova test was performed excel to identify if these results were significantly different from each other and from the ws experiment pec2 in fig 1 38 3 as shown in table 4 p 0 05 for each pair of experiments which means their difference was not statistically significant this is also supported by the fact that the f value was higher than the f critical value for each pair of experiments despite no significant difference on toc removal different reaction pathways probably take place when the supporting electrolyte is used or not cl2 can be electrogenerated from chloride contained in the wastewater table s1 and can form hocl and clo 59 which can oxidize organics 41 and ammonium 59 when no supporting electrolyte is used pec srw1 there was less so4 2 competing with chloride for active sites on the anode as seen in fig 5 the photo electrocatalysis without supporting electrolyte pec srw1 presented a higher decrease on chloride concentration with treatment time implying that more active chlorine was generated in this experiment and that it might have followed a more chlorine based degradation pathway than when the supporting electrolyte was used pec srw2 on the other hand chloride concentration remained constant throughout the direct photolysis experiment indicating that this ion did not undergo phototransformation regarding nitrogen species nitrate concentration decreased while nitrite concentration increased during direct photolysis fig 6 a this is compatible with eq 6 which can in some cases be used to describe the overall reaction of nitrate photolysis 46 this indicates the uv scavenging role of nitrate contributing to attenuate the photonic flux through srw and therefore to prevent mineralization in this process 6 n o 3 h v n o 2 1 2 o 2 on the other hand as shown in fig 6b ammonium was oxidized to nitrate during the photo electrocatalysis without supporting electrolyte in the photo electrocatalysis with supporting electrolyte no ammonium could be detected which was due to the great input of sodium the two cations elute in close proximity to each other making samples of very different concentrations difficult to quantify in cation exchange columns with carboxylic acid functional groups 60 however ammonium was probably present in the samples and was to a lesser extent also oxidized to nitrate fig 6c both nitrite and ammonium can be oxidized by ho 61 62 however nitrite concentration is only slightly reduced in the first hour and considering that toc removal in srw experiments did not present a significant difference to ws experiments ammonium and nitrite do not seem to act as important ho scavengers in the present experimental conditions 4 conclusions this study investigated the use of the uv based processes direct photolysis photocatalysis and photo electrocatalysis and of the electro oxidation process for the mineralization of erythromycin photonic flux had a very important impact for the uv based processes with a higher mineralization of ery and lower energy consumption for the higher photonic flux for these experiments direct photolysis resulted in higher mineralization than photocatalysis which could be attributed to reactor configuration with catalysts preventing radiation penetration to the bulk solution e h recombination and ery concentration electro oxidation presented low mineralization but contributed for significant synergistic effects on the photo electrocatalysis process which resulted in greater mineralization than the sum of photocatalysis and electro oxidation the application of the two best processes high photonic flux direct photolysis and photo electrocatalysis to a spiked real wastewater was also assessed demonstrating the importance of considering matrix effect on the treatment processes direct photolysis resulted in no mineralization for this matrix due to the light screening effect of dissolved organic matter and inorganic ions and would not be indicated for the mineralization of ery in a real wastewater photo electrocatalysis on the other hand resulted in mineralization in both water matrixes and would be a more viable alternative different reaction pathways occurred when na2so4 was added or not to the solution and for further studies of photo electrocatalysis as an alternative for the mineralization of ery in real wastewaters identification of possible reaction intermediaries as well as toxicity assessments would be necessary funding the authors would like to thank capes cyted cnpq fapergs and f inep for their
