concentrations were used in these calculations listed above for the samples collected on consecutive days from each wwtp 3 results and discussion 3 1 spas in wastewater two parent spas and four metabolites of bht were determined n 7 for each sample type from each wwtp table 1 bht was found in all wastewater influent primary effluent and final effluent samples detection frequency df 100 from both wwtps furthermore bht was the predominant compound found in wastewater influents occurring at median concentrations of 1320 and 2390 ng l in wwtpa and wwtpb respectively for influent wastewater the median concentration of bht was 10 1000 times higher than the concentrations of its metabolites and bha bht oh median 187 and 55 5 ng l and bht cooh median 113 and 158 ng l were the major bht metabolites found in the influents of wwtpa and wwtpb respectively the predominance of bht in wastewater influents reflects the profiles found in many consumer products such as foodstuffs and cosmetics nieva echevarria et al 2014 wang et al 2016 the concentrations of bht in final effluents were approximately 3 times lower than those in influents median 438 ng l for wwtpa 795 ng l for wwtpb whereas the concentrations of bht metabolites were 2 5 times higher than those in influents bht oh ranges 179 566 ng l for wwtpa 84 1 322 ng l for wwtpb bht cho ranges 54 9 317 ng l for wwtpa 64 7 453 ng l for wwtpb and bht cooh ranges 50 6 459 ng l for wwtpa 18 2 504 ng l for wwtpb were found in all final effluent samples the summed median concentrations of the four spa metabolites σmetabolites in final effluents median 822 ng l for wwtpa 511 ng l for wwtpb were significantly higher than the concentrations in influents median 465 ng l for wwtpa 290 ng l for wwtpb however the summed concentrations of all six parent spas σspas sum of all 6 compounds 392 2380 ng l in final effluents were lower than the concentrations measured in influents σspas 1100 34300 ng l 3 2 spas and their metabolites in sludge and spm bht was found in sludge n 6 for wwtpa and n 3 for wwtpb from wwtpa and wwtpb at median concentrations of 3210 and 4170 ng g dry wt respectively this was followed in decreasing order by bht q median 68 8 and 73 7 ng g bht oh median 94 2 and 59 5 ng g bht cho median 55 2 and 9 66 ng g and bht cooh median 9 47 and 10 8 ng g table 1 bha was found in 92 9 of the sludge samples at concentration ranges of loq 3 59 and 2 60 3 92 ng g dry wt in wwtpa and wwtpb respectively no earlier studies have reported the occurrence of bht and its metabolites in sludge samples from the usa it is worth noting that significantly higher concentrations of bht range 2190 3880 ng g dry wt in wwtpa and range 2740 4520 ng g dry wt in wwtpb than those of σmetabolites range 48 5 430 ng g dry wt for wwtpa and median 38 8 200 ng g dry wt for wwtpb were found in sludge although some of the metabolites can be derived from the degradation of bht a previous study reported the occurrence of bht in spm at a concentration of up to 2460 ng g liu et al 2015 bht was found in 100 of the spm samples from influents at median concentrations of 201 15 1 3090 μg g and 891 102 3010 μg g dry wt in wwtpa and wwtpb respectively these results suggested remarkable sorption of bht to particulate matter the median concentrations of σmetabolites in influent spm were 20 6 and 187 μg g dry wt for wwtpa and wwtpb respectively however bha was not found in spm 0 loq the median bht concentrations df 100 in spm of final effluent were in the range of 2 5 122 μg g dry wt however the concentrations of σmetabolites were significantly elevated in spm of final effluent at median concentrations of 82 4 and 489 μg g dry wt for wwtpa and wwtpb respectively 3 3 removal of spas and their metabolites in wwtps little is known about the fate of spas and their metabolites in wwtps based on the concentrations of spas and their metabolites measured in influents and final effluents table 2 the average removal efficiency of bht 75 6 in wwtpa and 75 8 in wwtpb was lower than that reported at 90 in another study from china liu et al 2015 the removal efficiencies of bht q bht oh bht cho and bht cooh were 98 2 33 1 302 and 104 in wwtpa and 86 1 401 470 and 41 4 in wwtpb respectively bha 86 5 98 3 was significantly removed from wwtps although this may be an artifact of the low detection rate of bha in influents however by taking into account the fraction of spas and their metabolites found in spm the removal efficiency referred to as re ii was calculated at 62 3 76 2 for bht 3020 to 2610 for bht q 395 to 65 6 for bht oh 136 to 111 for bht cho and 134 to 73 8 for bht cooh these results suggest that spas are not efficiently removed in wwtps and that many of the metabolites are formed during wastewater treatment process 3 4 mass loadings and discharge of spas the total mass of spas and their metabolites entering into wwtps i e mass load was estimated based on the measured concentrations in influents daily flow rate of wastewater and the population served by the wwtps the median loadings of spas in wwtpa and wwtpb were 3180 mg d 1000 people and 6970 mg d 1000 people respectively table 2 the median mass loadings of bht were 2430 and 6290 mg d 1000 people for wwtpa and wwtpb respectively which accounted for the majority of the spa loadings into wwtps the differences in mass loadings of spas between the two wwtps can be related to specific sources of wastewater wwtpb serves a larger population and treats 25 industrial wastewater the mass loadings of bht in both wwtps were 4 10 times higher than those of the metabolites which suggested that the metabolites originate from the transformation of spas in wastewater treatment processes this is the first study globally to report the mass loading of spas and their metabolites in wwtps the total mass of spas and their metabolites discharged from wwtps through final effluents and sewage sludge was calculated based on the concentrations measured in final effluents the fraction of analytes sorbed to spm and activated sludge the daily flow of effluents total sludge production rate and the population served by the wwtps the emission of bht 608 and 719 mg day 1000 people was the highest in both wwtpa and wwtpb followed by bht oh 207 and 261 mg day 1000 people table 2 the respective emission rates of σmetabolites for the two wwtps were 592 and 953 mg d 1000 people which is higher than the emission rates of bht although there was considerable removal of bht large amounts 42 9 1339 mg d 1000 people were released into the environment through the final effluent and sewage sludge disposal the high emission rates of metabolites of spas ranging from 230 to 1426 mg d 1000 people warrant further studies due to their potential aquatic toxicity eriksson et al 2003 3 5 inventory assessment and source of spas we estimated a nationwide mass loading rate for spas based on the calculated loading rates in the two wwtps and an estimate of the u s population 315 million in 2013 the estimated mass loadings of bht through wwtps in the usa were in the range of 279 781 722 882 kg y the combined production and import volume of bht cas no 128 37 0 was reported to be 7 178 481 kg y in the usa in 2011 thus mass loadings of bht in wwtps in the usa accounted for approximately 4 10 of the total production the environmental emission of bht via wwtps accounted for 1 0 1 2 of the annual production annual emission of bht through wwtp discharges was 70 828 83 672 kg y bht is widely used as an antioxidant in cosmetics plastics and petroleum products hsdb 2002 however bht has been shown to be resistant to degradation and toxic to aquatic organisms eriksson et al 2002 grey wastewater has been estimated to account for approximately 75 by volume of the combined residential sewage hansen and kjellerup 1994 household items such as laundry detergents fabric softeners dishwashing liquids cleaning detergents shampoos soaps and toothpastes are a major source of xenobiotic organic compounds including bht in grey wastewater the average weekly consumption of these products by inhabitants has been estimated at 40 g per person eriksson et al 2003 dominated by shampoo and soap assuming that 0 1 of bht was found in personal care products health canada 2016 bht loading can be estimated at 5710 mg d 1000 people which accounts for 91 of bht mass loading calculated for the two wwtps 3 6 fate of spas and their metabolites in wwtp processes the composition profiles of spas and their metabolites from various stages of wastewater treatment processes are presented in fig 1 in both wwtps bht was the largest contributor to total spa concentrations in sludge influent primary effluent and spm in particular bht accounted for 85 and 77 of total spas in spm of influent and sludge respectively in contrast bht metabolites collectively accounted for 75 of σspa concentrations in final effluent the contribution of bht to σspas concentrations in wastewater decreased in the following order influent 95 2 97 8 primary effluent 84 0 92 6 final effluent 81 4 91 3 in the spm it decreased in the following order influent 95 2 97 8 primary effluent 84 0 92 6 final effluent 81 4 91 3 based on the daily mass flows of spas and their metabolites a significant proportion of bht was removed in wwtps fig s1 the ʻmass outʼ was estimated as 6 3 67 g day for bht and 7 1 64 kg day for σmetabolites which were 22 29 and 150 240 respectively of bht and σmetabolites loads estimated to enter the plants i e ʻmass inʼ the removal mechanisms for spas and their metabolites in wwtps vary with sorption to sludge generally accounting for 1 of the removal the ratio of σmetabolites to bht increased from 0 16 for ʻmass inʼ to 1 12 for ʻmass outʼ for wwtpa and from 0 12 to 0 96 for wwtpb which suggests that transformation of bht occurs during wwtp processes and that the metabolites are resistant to further degradation the ratio of σmetabolites to bht concentrations was lower in sludge than in wastewater from the two wwtps studied 0 07 for wwtpa and 0 04 for wwtpb further investigations are needed to identify and or quantify other transformation products of bht and their metabolites although this is the first study to report the fate of six spas in wwtps our study has some limitations the mass loading estimates for spa metabolites are confounded to some extent by the existence of multiple sources of metabolites themselves secondly samples were extracted and analyzed several months after collection and storage at 4 c and potential for the transformation or degradation of bht during storage is not known however it should be noted that the validity of our results and interpretations are not necessarily affected by the above factors the negative removal rates and large emission rates of spa metabolites suggest that they are discharged into surface waters in large amounts considering the bioaccumulation and toxic potentials of spas in aquatic organisms further studies are needed to assess the environmental fate and ecotoxicity of these compounds 4 conclusions in summary our study was the first to examine inventory environmental fate sources mass loadings removal efficiencies and discharge of spas in wwtps bht was the predominant compound found in influent approximately 70 77 of bht was lost or transformed in wwtps whereas the abundance of bht metabolites increased by 49 139 of during the wastewater treatment process sorption to sludge accounted for a minor proportion of the removal of spas 1 and a negative removal was found for the metabolites of spas the environmental emission of metabolites of bht 773 mg d 1000 people was higher than that for bht 663 mg d 1000 people wwtp based mass loading of bht accounted for approximately 4 10 of the total production of this compound in the usa whereas 1 0 of the annual production of bht was discharged into surface waters through wwtp effluents in the usa while personal care products were estimated to accounted for 91 of bht loading source into wwtps acknowledgments the authors would

concentrations were used in these calculations listed above for the samples collected on consecutive days from each wwtp 3 results and discussion 3 1 spas in wastewater two parent spas and four metabolites of bht were determined n 7 for each sample type from each wwtp table 1 bht was found in all wastewater influent primary effluent and final effluent samples detection frequency df 100 from both wwtps furthermore bht was the predominant compound found in wastewater influents occurring at median concentrations of 1320 and 2390 ng l in wwtpa and wwtpb respectively for influent wastewater the median concentration of bht was 10 1000 times higher than the concentrations of its metabolites and bha bht oh median 187 and 55 5 ng l and bht cooh median 113 and 158 ng l were the major bht metabolites found in the influents of wwtpa and wwtpb respectively the predominance of bht in wastewater influents reflects the profiles found in many consumer products such as foodstuffs and cosmetics nieva echevarria et al 2014 wang et al 2016 the concentrations of bht in final effluents were approximately 3 times lower than those in influents median 438 ng l for wwtpa 795 ng l for wwtpb whereas the concentrations of bht metabolites were 2 5 times higher than those in influents bht oh ranges 179 566 ng l for wwtpa 84 1 322 ng l for wwtpb bht cho ranges 54 9 317 ng l for wwtpa 64 7 453 ng l for wwtpb and bht cooh ranges 50 6 459 ng l for wwtpa 18 2 504 ng l for wwtpb were found in all final effluent samples the summed median concentrations of the four spa metabolites σmetabolites in final effluents median 822 ng l for wwtpa 511 ng l for wwtpb were significantly higher than the concentrations in influents median 465 ng l for wwtpa 290 ng l for wwtpb however the summed concentrations of all six parent spas σspas sum of all 6 compounds 392 2380 ng l in final effluents were lower than the concentrations measured in influents σspas 1100 34300 ng l 3 2 spas and their metabolites in sludge and spm bht was found in sludge n 6 for wwtpa and n 3 for wwtpb from wwtpa and wwtpb at median concentrations of 3210 and 4170 ng g dry wt respectively this was followed in decreasing order by bht q median 68 8 and 73 7 ng g bht oh median 94 2 and 59 5 ng g bht cho median 55 2 and 9 66 ng g and bht cooh median 9 47 and 10 8 ng g table 1 bha was found in 92 9 of the sludge samples at concentration ranges of loq 3 59 and 2 60 3 92 ng g dry wt in wwtpa and wwtpb respectively no earlier studies have reported the occurrence of bht and its metabolites in sludge samples from the usa it is worth noting that significantly higher concentrations of bht range 2190 3880 ng g dry wt in wwtpa and range 2740 4520 ng g dry wt in wwtpb than those of σmetabolites range 48 5 430 ng g dry wt for wwtpa and median 38 8 200 ng g dry wt for wwtpb were found in sludge although some of the metabolites can be derived from the degradation of bht a previous study reported the occurrence of bht in spm at a concentration of up to 2460 ng g liu et al 2015 bht was found in 100 of the spm samples from influents at median concentrations of 201 15 1 3090 μg g and 891 102 3010 μg g dry wt in wwtpa and wwtpb respectively these results suggested remarkable sorption of bht to particulate matter the median concentrations of σmetabolites in influent spm were 20 6 and 187 μg g dry wt for wwtpa and wwtpb respectively however bha was not found in spm 0 loq the median bht concentrations df 100 in spm of final effluent were in the range of 2 5 122 μg g dry wt however the concentrations of σmetabolites were significantly elevated in spm of final effluent at median concentrations of 82 4 and 489 μg g dry wt for wwtpa and wwtpb respectively 3 3 removal of spas and their metabolites in wwtps little is known about the fate of spas and their metabolites in wwtps based on the concentrations of spas and their metabolites measured in influents and final effluents table 2 the average removal efficiency of bht 75 6 in wwtpa and 75 8 in wwtpb was lower than that reported at 90 in another study from china liu et al 2015 the removal efficiencies of bht q bht oh bht cho and bht cooh were 98 2 33 1 302 and 104 in wwtpa and 86 1 401 470 and 41 4 in wwtpb respectively bha 86 5 98 3 was significantly removed from wwtps although this may be an artifact of the low detection rate of bha in influents however by taking into account the fraction of spas and their metabolites found in spm the removal efficiency referred to as re ii was calculated at 62 3 76 2 for bht 3020 to 2610 for bht q 395 to 65 6 for bht oh 136 to 111 for bht cho and 134 to 73 8 for bht cooh these results suggest that spas are not efficiently removed in wwtps and that many of the metabolites are formed during wastewater treatment process 3 4 mass loadings and discharge of spas the total mass of spas and their metabolites entering into wwtps i e mass load was estimated based on the measured concentrations in influents daily flow rate of wastewater and the population served by the wwtps the median loadings of spas in wwtpa and wwtpb were 3180 mg d 1000 people and 6970 mg d 1000 people respectively table 2 the median mass loadings of bht were 2430 and 6290 mg d 1000 people for wwtpa and wwtpb respectively which accounted for the majority of the spa loadings into wwtps the differences in mass loadings of spas between the two wwtps can be related to specific sources of wastewater wwtpb serves a larger population and treats 25 industrial wastewater the mass loadings of bht in both wwtps were 4 10 times higher than those of the metabolites which suggested that the metabolites originate from the transformation of spas in wastewater treatment processes this is the first study globally to report the mass loading of spas and their metabolites in wwtps the total mass of spas and their metabolites discharged from wwtps through final effluents and sewage sludge was calculated based on the concentrations measured in final effluents the fraction of analytes sorbed to spm and activated sludge the daily flow of effluents total sludge production rate and the population served by the wwtps the emission of bht 608 and 719 mg day 1000 people was the highest in both wwtpa and wwtpb followed by bht oh 207 and 261 mg day 1000 people table 2 the respective emission rates of σmetabolites for the two wwtps were 592 and 953 mg d 1000 people which is higher than the emission rates of bht although there was considerable removal of bht large amounts 42 9 1339 mg d 1000 people were released into the environment through the final effluent and sewage sludge disposal the high emission rates of metabolites of spas ranging from 230 to 1426 mg d 1000 people warrant further studies due to their potential aquatic toxicity eriksson et al 2003 3 5 inventory assessment and source of spas we estimated a nationwide mass loading rate for spas based on the calculated loading rates in the two wwtps and an estimate of the u s population 315 million in 2013 the estimated mass loadings of bht through wwtps in the usa were in the range of 279 781 722 882 kg y the combined production and import volume of bht cas no 128 37 0 was reported to be 7 178 481 kg y in the usa in 2011 thus mass loadings of bht in wwtps in the usa accounted for approximately 4 10 of the total production the environmental emission of bht via wwtps accounted for 1 0 1 2 of the annual production annual emission of bht through wwtp discharges was 70 828 83 672 kg y bht is widely used as an antioxidant in cosmetics plastics and petroleum products hsdb 2002 however bht has been shown to be resistant to degradation and toxic to aquatic organisms eriksson et al 2002 grey wastewater has been estimated to account for approximately 75 by volume of the combined residential sewage hansen and kjellerup 1994 household items such as laundry detergents fabric softeners dishwashing liquids cleaning detergents shampoos soaps and toothpastes are a major source of xenobiotic organic compounds including bht in grey wastewater the average weekly consumption of these products by inhabitants has been estimated at 40 g per person eriksson et al 2003 dominated by shampoo and soap assuming that 0 1 of bht was found in personal care products health canada 2016 bht loading can be estimated at 5710 mg d 1000 people which accounts for 91 of bht mass loading calculated for the two wwtps 3 6 fate of spas and their metabolites in wwtp processes the composition profiles of spas and their metabolites from various stages of wastewater treatment processes are presented in fig 1 in both wwtps bht was the largest contributor to total spa concentrations in sludge influent primary effluent and spm in particular bht accounted for 85 and 77 of total spas in spm of influent and sludge respectively in contrast bht metabolites collectively accounted for 75 of σspa concentrations in final effluent the contribution of bht to σspas concentrations in wastewater decreased in the following order influent 95 2 97 8 primary effluent 84 0 92 6 final effluent 81 4 91 3 in the spm it decreased in the following order influent 95 2 97 8 primary effluent 84 0 92 6 final effluent 81 4 91 3 based on the daily mass flows of spas and their metabolites a significant proportion of bht was removed in wwtps fig s1 the ʻmass outʼ was estimated as 6 3 67 g day for bht and 7 1 64 kg day for σmetabolites which were 22 29 and 150 240 respectively of bht and σmetabolites loads estimated to enter the plants i e ʻmass inʼ the removal mechanisms for spas and their metabolites in wwtps vary with sorption to sludge generally accounting for 1 of the removal the ratio of σmetabolites to bht increased from 0 16 for ʻmass inʼ to 1 12 for ʻmass outʼ for wwtpa and from 0 12 to 0 96 for wwtpb which suggests that transformation of bht occurs during wwtp processes and that the metabolites are resistant to further degradation the ratio of σmetabolites to bht concentrations was lower in sludge than in wastewater from the two wwtps studied 0 07 for wwtpa and 0 04 for wwtpb further investigations are needed to identify and or quantify other transformation products of bht and their metabolites although this is the first study to report the fate of six spas in wwtps our study has some limitations the mass loading estimates for spa metabolites are confounded to some extent by the existence of multiple sources of metabolites themselves secondly samples were extracted and analyzed several months after collection and storage at 4 c and potential for the transformation or degradation of bht during storage is not known however it should be noted that the validity of our results and interpretations are not necessarily affected by the above factors the negative removal rates and large emission rates of spa metabolites suggest that they are discharged into surface waters in large amounts considering the bioaccumulation and toxic potentials of spas in aquatic organisms further studies are needed to assess the environmental fate and ecotoxicity of these compounds 4 conclusions in summary our study was the first to examine inventory environmental fate sources mass loadings removal efficiencies and discharge of spas in wwtps bht was the predominant compound found in influent approximately 70 77 of bht was lost or transformed in wwtps whereas the abundance of bht metabolites increased by 49 139 of during the wastewater treatment process sorption to sludge accounted for a minor proportion of the removal of spas 1 and a negative removal was found for the metabolites of spas the environmental emission of metabolites of bht 773 mg d 1000 people was higher than that for bht 663 mg d 1000 people wwtp based mass loading of bht accounted for approximately 4 10 of the total production of this compound in the usa whereas 1 0 of the annual production of bht was discharged into surface waters through wwtp effluents in the usa while personal care products were estimated to accounted for 91 of bht loading source into wwtps acknowledgments the authors would

19856,extracellular polymeric substances eps are an important parameter in drinking water biofilters and to date this is the first study to compare protocols from the literature for extracting eps from granular filter media five extraction protocols were compared and one was improved by varying the type of initial physical treatment and the shaking intensity temperature and time of incubation extracting eps from granular filter media in triplicate by combining 2 g wet weight of filter media with 10 ml of extraction buffer 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 vortexing for 1 min and incubating for 4 h at 35 c with shaking at 200 rpm yielded significantly higher eps polysaccharide and or protein concentrations than did protocols from the literature this improved protocol extracted a significant fraction of the biofilm attached to sand but was less effective on biofilm attached to anthracite or granular activated carbon gac a survey of 11 full scale biofilters from the u s and canada revealed that eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations can vary over one order of magnitude from 0 02 to 0 60 mg glucose g total solids ts and 0 27 to 3 38 mg bovine serum albumin g ts respectively backwashing significantly lowered the biomass and eps polysaccharide concentrations but the majority of the biofilm remained attached to the filter media after backwashing as expected the fraction of eps polysaccharides and proteins removed during backwashing did not differ between anthracite and gac biofilters the improved eps extraction protocol can be utilized to investigate the

2014 a filter is considered to be biologically active when bacteria colonize the filter media forming a biofilm extracellular polymeric substances eps form the biofilm matrix encasing bacteria and facilitating their adherence to surfaces flemming and wingender 2010 many drinking water biofilter studies have interrogated biomass concentrations microbial activity and the microbial community but few studies have investigated eps within biofilters a protocol for extracting and quantifying eps from granular filter media is needed to investigate the role of eps in biofilter performance and the operational and environmental factors that impact eps eps is likely an important parameter in biofilter operation because it has been implicated in the fouling of porous media xia et al 2016 and slow sand filters mauclaire et al 2004 biofilters can develop headloss more rapidly than do abiotic filters goldgrabe et al 1993 brown et al 2016 leading to more frequent backwashing and higher energy costs lauderdale et al 2012 investigations into the role of eps in biofilter fouling and engineering strategies for mitigating that fouling would benefit from a consistent and well characterized protocol for extracting eps from granular filter media to extract eps the biofilm matrix has to be destabilized by disrupting ionic interactions hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions flemming and wingender 2010 chemical or physical methods can be applied and generally a combination of the two works best fang and jia 1996 adav and lee 2008 physical methods include shear cavitation and heat chemical methods include ph adjustment addition of a surfactant addition of a fixative and removal of divalent cations through ion exchange or addition of a chelating agent adjusting the ph can disrupt the matrix because raising it ph 10 deprotonates proteins while lowering it ph 2 protonates polysaccharides wang et al 2012 divalent cations contribute greatly to the stabilization of the matrix above neutral ph banin et al 2006 wang et al 2012 so removing them can release eps polysaccharides and proteins into solution extraction protocols should not however be so harsh that they cause significant cell lysis lysis releases intracellular polysaccharides and proteins thereby contaminating the eps pool and complicating downstream analysis and data interpretation multiple eps extraction protocols have been developed for wastewater flocs and granules these protocols include the use of cation exchange resin cer formaldehyde sodium hydroxide naoh ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and heat table 1 presents a summary of previous studies aimed at improving eps extraction efficacy edta and formaldehyde naoh appear to be two of the best methods i e yield the most eps without causing substantial lysis but it is important to note that a these studies do not agree on which method is best and b none of them examined eps extraction from biofilms attached to granular filter media elhadidy et al 2017 modified the standard cer protocol for use with granular filter media but they did not compare its efficacy to other eps extraction protocols thus there is a need to improve and characterize an eps extraction protocol suitable for granular filter media to date the current study is the first to compare eps extraction protocols for biofilms attached to granular filter media in drinking water biofilters additionally few studies have measured eps in drinking water biofilters lauderdale et al 2012 nyfennegger et al 2015 elhadidy et al 2017 and the current study is the first to use a single protocol to assess eps in biofilters from multiple treatment plants as compared to existing eps extraction protocols an improved eps extraction protocol is one that yields higher concentrations of polysaccharides and proteins while minimizing contamination from cell lysis in the current study a variety of protocols from the literature were compared and one was targeted for further improvements by adjusting the physical parameters of the extraction process the efficacy of the improved extraction protocol on different granular media types was evaluated via staining and imaging eps concentrations in full scale biofilters in the u s and canada were interrogated using the improved extraction protocol and the impact of backwashing on eps and biomass concentrations was assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection for all samples approximately 50 ml of filter media were collected from 15 cm below the surface of full scale drinking water biofilters and shipped overnight on ice to the university of texas at austin samples were homogenized by stirring with a sterile spatula before removing each aliquot for analysis development and improvement of the eps extraction protocol were conducted using granular activated carbon gac from a full scale biofilter gac is a common media for biofilters brown et al 2016 and has a more complex surface than does anthracite or sand fox et al 1990 it was assumed that if the protocol were effective for gac then it would be applicable to other common types of filter media filter media samples were stored at 4 c until analysis which always occurred within one week of receipt extraction efficacy of the improved protocol was assessed using anthracite gac and sand biofilter samples eps was extracted upon arrival and after extraction the media was rinsed 3 with phosphate buffered saline pbs ausubel et al 2002 and stored at 4 c for 24 h until it was stained and imaged for the full scale survey water treatment plants in the u s and canada known to practice biofiltration were contacted media samples were collected before and after backwashing and they were analyzed upon receipt for eps and biomass concentration 2 2 extraction protocols four protocols from the literature and one new protocol were compared table 2 for all protocols except cer 2 0 05 g of gac were added to a 15 ml conical tube followed by 10 ml of extraction buffer samples were incubated at the given conditions temperature time and shaking table 2 and then centrifuged at 10 000 g and 25 c for 10 min the supernatant containing the eps was filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon filter and the gac in the pellet was retained for total solids ts analysis for only the extraction protocol with formaldehyde naoh the filtrate was further purified by dialysis using a 3000 da molecular weight cutoff snakeskin thermo fisher scientific waltham ma liu and fang 2002 formaldehyde interfered with both polysaccharide and protein quantification but none of the other extraction buffers did so dialysis was unnecessary after the other extraction methods formaldehyde and phenol react through an acid catalyzed reaction to form a resin that solidifies at high temperatures and the polysaccharide quantification protocol provides these conditions section 2 5 edta interferes with some protein assays but the current study used an assay compatible with the edta concentration in the te 8 te 11 and te final buffers section 2 5 each extraction was conducted in triplicate eps extractions done using cer were performed according to the protocol of elhadidy et al 2017 first the cer dowex marathon na form 20 50 mesh sigma aldrich st louis mo was washed by soaking it in 1 l ultrapure water overnight then 3 g wet weight of gac 3 g wet weight of washed cer and 20 ml of pbs were added to a 50 ml tube the tubes were incubated at 350 rpm and 25 c for 1 h after which they were centrifuged at 10 000 g and 25 c for 10 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon filter and transferred to a fresh 50 ml tube after identifying the chemical method that yielded the highest relative eps concentration 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 the protocol was improved by systematically varying four physical parameters the type of initial physical treatment and the shaking intensity temperature and time of incubation four initial physical treatments were considered inverting by hand 10 bath sonicating for 10 min bransonic 3510 branson ultrasonics danbury ct probe sonicating at 40 w for 2 min model 550 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma and vortexing at 3200 rpm for 1 min vortex genie 2 scientific industries inc bohemia ny three incubation temperatures were assessed 4 22 and 35 c three shaking intensities were tested 0 50 and 200 rpm four incubation times were tested 1 2 4 and 8 h baseline conditions i e inverting 10 by hand and incubating at 22 c for 4 h without shaking were used in the protocol improvement process except for the one parameter that was varied in a particular experiment protocol improvements were tested using aliquots of one filter media sample the four parameters of the protocol were tested over four consecutive days where one parameter was varied per day 2 3 lysis assessment planktonic escherichia coli k12 was used to assess the extent of cell lysis caused by the extraction protocol and the degree of eps contamination caused by such lysis this strain was chosen because it produces negligible amounts of eps prigent combaret et al 2000 e coli was grown overnight in r2a broth himedia laboratories mumbai india at 30 c and 150 rpm to a concentration of 1 1 107 colony forming units cfu ml then 2 ml of culture were centrifuged and the pellet was washed twice with pbs before being subjected to the eps extraction protocol the resulting cell count was within the range found in filter media samples the extraction protocol consisting of 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 with 1 min of vortexing followed by incubation at 35 c with shaking at 200 rpm was tested for incubation times of 4 8 and 24 h plate counts were conducted before and after the eps extraction and the difference in the bacterial concentrations was attributed to cell lysis the polysaccharide and protein concentrations in the extractant were quantified and these concentrations were attributed to cell lysis previous studies have used the dna concentration to assess lysis but these studies did not relate the dna concentration to the contamination of the extracted eps e g liu and fang 2002 in the current study we quantified the contamination of the eps pool that could be caused by lysis and plate counts were used to confirm whether an increase in the polysaccharide or protein concentration was associated with a decrease in the e coli concentration 2 4 assessment of extraction efficacy extraction efficacy was determined for three common media types i e anthracite gac and sand by staining and imaging unprocessed filter media and filter media processed with the final improved extraction protocol te final in preparation for staining and imaging samples were washed 3 with pbs and stained

microscopy and imaging facility in the institute for cellular and molecular biology at the university of texas at austin images were processed using imaris version 8 0 1 bitplane zurich switzerland to determine the sum of the fluorescence signal in the biofilm surrounding the filter media grain contour lines were drawn by hand around the grain in every image from the z stack to create a 3 d surface nine to fifteen grains were analyzed per condition for each stain the cumulative signal intensity in the biofilm surrounding the filter media grain was used to calculate the fluorescence intensity per unit external surface area of the grain 2 5 eps and biomass quantification eps was quantified by measuring polysaccharides and proteins in the extractant the bulk concentration of polysaccharides in the extractant was measured using a modified phenol sulfuric acid colorimetric method with glucose as the standard dubois et al 1956 masuko et al 2005 briefly 150 μl of extractant were added to a 13

samples were vortexed briefly and incubated at 60 c in a water bath for 30 min then 200 μl were transferred to a 96 well plate in triplicate and absorbance was measured at 562 nm synergy ht biotek winooski vt the linear range was 5 250 mg bsa l and the mdl was 2 2 mg bsa l eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations were normalized to the mass of filter media used in the extraction for all protocols in table 2 except cer ts were determined by transferring the aliquot of media from which the eps was extracted to a metal pan and drying it at 105 c for 24 h after which it was cooled in a desiccator and weighed this method was not suitable for cer because the resin would increase the overall mass of solids measured after eps extraction for cer ts were calculated by multiplying the wet mass of the gac used in the extraction by the dry wet mass ratio the dry wet mass ratio was determined by baking 10 g wet gac at 105 c overnight in triplicate and measuring the dry mass to release the biomass from the media for subsequent enumeration by plate counts a second aliquot of wet filter media 3 0 05 g was transferred to a sterile 15 ml conical tube and 8 ml of 5 mm tris buffer ph 7 3 was added to the tube the microtip of a sonic dismembrator model 550 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma was wiped with 70 ethanol and then placed in the tube such that the tip was approximately 2 cm above the surface of the filter media the sonic dismembrator was operated for 2 min at 40 w and then the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube this process was repeated five times on the filter media aliquot yielding a total volume of 48 ml magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 the filter solids were retained dried and weighed heterotrophic plate counts hpc were conducted on the supernatant in

discussion 3 1 comparison of extraction protocols the comparison of extraction protocols listed in table 2 is shown in fig 1 for all protocols the ratio of proteins to polysaccharides pn ps was 3 mg bsa mg glucose but pn ps was significantly higher using te 8 and te 11 tukey s hsd p 0 05 the protocols yielded significantly different quantities of eps polysaccharides and proteins 1 way anova p 0 001 among the protocols from the literature te 8 yielded significantly more eps proteins than did the other protocols tukey s hsd p 0 001 but form naoh yielded the highest polysaccharide concentration tukey s hsd p 0 01 unlike the other protocols form naoh uses a carcinogen formaldehyde and the extractant must be purified by dialysis both of which hinder its widespread adoption particularly for drinking water utilities te 8 yielded substantially more eps polysaccharides 1 8 and proteins 9 7 than did the cer protocol developed by elhadidy et al 2017 adding naoh to the extraction buffer can improve the eps extraction yield liu and fang 2002 and edta chelates ca2 and mg2 better at ph 10 however significantly more eps proteins were extracted using te 8 than te 11 tukey s hsd p 0 001 the extraction buffer used in te 8 appeared to be the best for granular filter media because it extracted the highest quantity of eps proteins among the tested literature protocols and because it does not have the operational complication of the form naoh protocol thus improvement of the physical extraction parameters was conducted using the 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 buffer 3 2 improvement of te 8 four physical parameters were varied to improve eps extraction with the 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 buffer the type of initial physical treatment and the shaking intensity temperature and time of incubation temperature and time had a statistically significant effect on the eps polysaccharide concentration 1 way anova p 0 01 and all four physical parameters that were tested had a statistically significant effect on the eps protein concentration 1 way anova p 0 001 fig 2 for the initial physical treatment fig 2a both the vortex and probe sonicator resulted in a higher average eps protein concentration than did inversion by hand tukey s hsd p 0 001 the eps concentrations yielded by these two treatments did not differ significantly from one another p 0 05 so the vortex was chosen for its ease and higher throughput increasing the incubation temperature from 4 c to 35 c yielded significantly more eps polysaccharides and proteins fig 2b tukey s hsd p 0 001 for an extraction time of 4 h the extracted eps polysaccharide concentration was significantly higher than for 1 h fig 2c tukey s hsd p 0 01 but the protein concentration did not increase significantly p 0 05 an incubation time of 8 h yielded significantly more eps polysaccharides and proteins as compared to a time of 1 h tukey s hsd p 0 01 and p 0 001 respectively shaking during incubation significantly increased the eps protein concentration as compared to static incubation fig 2d 1 way anova p 0 001 and increasing the intensity from 50 to 200 rpm yielded significantly more proteins tukey s hsd p 0 05 these data suggest that extracting eps from gac using 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 as the extraction buffer vortexing for 1 min at the outset and incubating at 35 c for 8 h with shaking at 200 rpm would yield the highest polysaccharide and protein concentrations among the tested protocols however as discussed in the following section this protocol needed to be modified to limit contamination of the eps pool due to cell lysis 3 3 limiting contamination from lysis planktonic e coli and biofilter gac were subjected to the extraction protocol consisting of 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 as the extraction buffer vortexing for 1 min at the outset and incubating at 35 c with shaking at 200 rpm for 4 8 or 24 h the resulting polysaccharide and protein concentrations were compared to assess contamination of the eps pool from lysis the initial cell count of e coli in each aliquot used for eps extraction was approximately 2 107 cfu the cell concentration in full scale biofilters as estimated by hpc can range from 2 5 104 8 0 107 cfu g ts fig 5b eps typically was extracted from 1 2 g ts which means that the initial cell count in the aliquot used for eps extraction ranges from 3 104 1 108 cfu thus the lysis test with e coli represents the high end of the cell count that typically is subjected to the extraction protocol this particular sample of biofilter gac is a reasonable point of comparison because its eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations were within the range measured during the full scale survey as part of the current study no polysaccharides were detected after subjecting planktonic e coli to the extraction protocol for any of the tested incubation times the protein concentration increased with incubation time during the eps extraction and the protein concentrations from planktonic e coli represented 11 20 and 23 of the protein concentration extracted from gac from a full scale biofilter after 4 8 and 24 h respectively fig 3 a concomitantly the log reduction of viable e coli increased with incubation time during the eps extraction fig 3b the magnitude of the increase in the protein concentration was similar between the e coli and gac samples suggesting that the additional proteins measured after extended incubation times might be attributed to release of intracellular proteins from lysis therefore an extraction time of 4 h was chosen for the final improved eps extraction protocol to limit contamination of the eps protein pool due to cell lysis the final improved protocol te final in table 2 is as follows using 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 as the extraction buffer vortexing for 1 min at the outset and incubating the sample for 4 h at 35 c and 200 rpm te final extracted significantly more eps proteins than did the protocols from the literature fig 1 tukey s hsd p 0 001 and it extracted a similar amount of eps polysaccharides as form naoh tukey s hsd p 0 05 increasing the intensity of the four physical parameters during the extraction protocol yielded more eps polysaccharides and proteins using te final as compared to te 8 tukey s hsd p 0 01 and p 0 001 even with an incubation time of 4 h te final therefore represents a substantial improvement of previous eps extraction protocols for use on granular filter media 3 4 assessment of extraction efficacy and reproducibility the overall effectiveness of te final was assessed by staining and imaging biofilter media before and after eps extraction fig 4 shows representative 3 d projections from three media types before eps extraction anthracite gac and sand from full scale biofilters were analyzed on different days with different gains so the fluorescence intensity among the three samples should not be compared table 3 shows the average cumulative fluorescence intensity of the four target constituents over the surface area of the filter media grain for the three media types before and after eps extraction it is to be noted that these stains cannot distinguish between cells and eps because they can bind to both cell wall components and eps the standard deviations were quite large reflecting the heterogeneous nature of biofilm development on granular filter media velten et al 2007 te final caused a statistically significant decrease in the fluorescence associated with α linked polysaccharides β linked polysaccharides and proteins on sand paired 1 sided t test table 3 te final only caused a statistically significant decrease in the fluorescence associated with β linked polysaccharides on anthracite and it did not decrease the fluorescence associated with any of the four target constituents on gac paired 1 sided t test table 3 these results confirm that gac is a particularly difficult medium from which to detach biomass camper et al 1985 nevertheless gac was used to develop the improved eps extraction protocol because te final extracted more eps from gac than did the other tested protocols it also should be the most effective protocol for anthracite and sand regardless staining and imaging indicated that a substantial amount of biomass cells and or eps remained attached to all media types after extraction and these data suggest that the final improved protocol developed in the current study only captured a fraction of the total eps on the filter media elhadidy et al 2017 reported that the cer protocol recovered 65 of the biomass from the filter media as indicated by adenosine triphosphate atp measurements but they did not assess eps recovery while even the final improved eps extraction protocol developed here does not extract all the eps from the filter media it yielded higher extracted eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations than did other methods from the literature its use should be complemented with other biofilm analytical techniques but its reproducibility described below makes it a valuable tool for evaluating eps in biofilters few eps extraction protocol studies report the protocol s reproducibility but we have demonstrated the reproducibility of the final improved eps extraction protocol the relative standard deviations rsds among seven replicates from gac were 9 60 and 3 77 for polysaccharides and proteins respectively selecting all possible combinations of three from these seven replicates showed that triplicate extractions could have rsds ranging from 4 10 to 14 6 and 1 20 to 5 50 for polysaccharides and proteins respectively protein quantification previously has been found to be more reproducible than is polysaccharide quantification pellicer nàcher et al 2013 the rsds in the current study reflect the heterogeneous nature of biofilter media and are similar to the uncertainty in quantifying atp from biofilter media velten et al 2007 rsds less than 15 and 6 for polysaccharides and proteins respectively among triplicate extractions suggest that te final can be used to characterize eps on granular filter media but particular care should be taken when attempting to ascertain small changes in dynamic systems 3 5 survey of full scale biofilters the final improved eps extraction protocol was employed to measure eps concentrations before and after backwashing in 11 full scale biofilters from the u s and canada table 4 summarizes characteristics of the biofilters that were surveyed the distributions of media type and the use of pre ozonation in this survey were similar to those reported in a larger survey of biofiltration in north america brown et al 2016 the current survey provides a useful baseline for assessing the range of eps concentrations that exist in full scale biofilters and for examining the effect of backwashing on the eps concentration the eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations ranged over one order of magnitude from 0 016 to 0 60 mg glucose g ts and 0 29 to 3 38 mg bsa g ts fig 5a and they were positively correlated spearman s ρ 0 59 p 0 05 the pn ps ratio ranged from 1 3 to 19 2 and it was similar between gac and anthracite biofilters and between biofilters with and without pre ozonation wilcoxon rank sum p 0 05 elhadidy et al 2017 found pn ps towards the low end of this range in pilot scale anthracite and sand biofilters but they used the cer extraction protocol which extracts less eps proteins than does te final the pn ps in wastewater flocs and granules can range from 0 4 to 14 with most studies showing pn ps 1 fang and jia 1996 frølund et al 1996 liu and fang 2002 adav and lee 2008 d abzac et al 2010 pellicer nàcher et al 2013 hpc varied widely from 2 5 104 to 8 0 107 cfu g ts fig 5b eps polysaccharides were positively correlated with hpc spearman s ρ 0 76 p 0 01 but eps proteins were not p 0 05 elhadidy et al 2017 identified a positive correlation between both eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations and biofilm cell count within biofilters treating the same source water eps proteins might not have been correlated with hpc in the current survey because of substantial differences in eps and hpc concentrations among the various biofilters the current survey normalized eps concentrations to the mass of ts because it is straightforward to measure but normalizing eps to filter media grain surface area would more accurately represent the eps concentration in the filter comparisons of eps concentrations normalized to the mass of ts are discouraged among different filter media types due to differences in the density of various media rather eps concentrations normalized to the mass of ts are more suited to comparisons within the same media type e g across time or among filters at one treatment plant the trends in eps concentrations among the biofilters in the current survey were similar when the eps concentrations were normalized to filter media grain surface area appendix a backwashing tended to lower eps and sometimes the hpc concentrations in the full scale biofilters the median min max removals for eps polysaccharides and proteins were 21 25 56 and 4 28 49 respectively fig 5a this reduction was significant for eps polysaccharides but not proteins wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 and p 0 05 respectively the relative removals of eps polysaccharides and proteins due to backwashing were similar between anthracite and gac filters wilcoxon rank sum p 0 05 nyfennegger et al 2015 found that backwashing did not remove a substantial fraction of eps on biofilter media but their extraction protocol te 8 does not recover as much eps polysaccharides as does te final backwashing did not significantly affect pn ps wilcoxon rank sum p 0 05 backwashing tended to remove more hpc from anthracite and sand biofilters than from gac biofilters the median min max log reduction of hpc after backwashing was 0 68 0 017 2 61 for anthracite and sand biofilters but only 0 0004 0 16 0 74 for gac biofilters this difference reflects that gac is a particularly good biofilm support medium liu et al 2001 emelko et al 2006 interestingly the biofilter with the greatest reduction in hpc after backwashing g also had the lowest eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations there was a slight negative correlation between percent removal of hpc via backwashing and eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations spearman s ρ 0 2 but the correlations were not significant p 0 05 previous studies similarly have shown backwashing to lower biomass levels miltner et al 1995 ahmad et al 1998 emelko et al 2006 liao et al 2014 in biofilters it is likely that a small fraction of the biomass are loosely attached and removed by backwashing but the majority of the eps and biofilm cells remain attached to the media during backwashing 4 conclusion previous studies have compared eps extraction protocols for wastewater flocs granules the current study developed and characterized an improved protocol for extracting eps from granular filter media in drinking water biofilters eps is likely an important parameter in biofilter operation and this study assessed eps concentrations in full scale biofilters and investigated the impact of backwashing on eps concentration the major conclusions are as follows the final improved eps extraction protocol 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 as the extraction buffer vortex for 1 min and incubate at 35 c with shaking at 200 rpm for 4 h substantially improved on protocols from the literature yielding a significantly higher eps protein concentration than did the other tested protocols and a similar eps polysaccharide concentration to the formaldehyde naoh protocol the effectiveness of the eps extraction protocol depended on the media type and was ranked as follows sand anthracite gac although the final improved protocol does not extract all the eps from a biofilter sample the protocol is reproducible with rsds of 9 60 and 3 77 for polysaccharides and proteins respectively among 11 full scale drinking water biofilters including gac anthracite and sand eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations ranged over one order of magnitude from 0 016 to 0 60 mg glucose g ts and 0 27 3 38 mg bsa g ts respectively backwashing significantly lowered the eps polysaccharide concentration on the filter media but the majority of the biofilm remained attached to the media after backwashing as expected backwashing tended to remove relatively more hpc from anthracite and sand filters than from gac filters but the percent removal of eps polysaccharides and proteins did not differ by media type acknowledgements this project was

19856,extracellular polymeric substances eps are an important parameter in drinking water biofilters and to date this is the first study to compare protocols from the literature for extracting eps from granular filter media five extraction protocols were compared and one was improved by varying the type of initial physical treatment and the shaking intensity temperature and time of incubation extracting eps from granular filter media in triplicate by combining 2 g wet weight of filter media with 10 ml of extraction buffer 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 vortexing for 1 min and incubating for 4 h at 35 c with shaking at 200 rpm yielded significantly higher eps polysaccharide and or protein concentrations than did protocols from the literature this improved protocol extracted a significant fraction of the biofilm attached to sand but was less effective on biofilm attached to anthracite or granular activated carbon gac a survey of 11 full scale biofilters from the u s and canada revealed that eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations can vary over one order of magnitude from 0 02 to 0 60 mg glucose g total solids ts and 0 27 to 3 38 mg bovine serum albumin g ts respectively backwashing significantly lowered the biomass and eps polysaccharide concentrations but the majority of the biofilm remained attached to the filter media after backwashing as expected the

2014 a filter is considered to be biologically active when bacteria colonize the filter media forming a biofilm extracellular polymeric substances eps form the biofilm matrix encasing bacteria and facilitating their adherence to surfaces flemming and wingender 2010 many drinking water biofilter studies have interrogated biomass concentrations microbial activity and the microbial community but few studies have investigated eps within biofilters a protocol for extracting and quantifying eps from granular filter media is needed to investigate the role of eps in biofilter performance and the operational and environmental factors that impact eps eps is likely an important parameter in biofilter operation because it has been implicated in the fouling of porous media xia et al 2016 and slow sand filters mauclaire et al 2004 biofilters can develop headloss more rapidly than do abiotic filters goldgrabe et al 1993 brown et al 2016 leading to more frequent backwashing and higher energy costs lauderdale et al 2012 investigations into the role of eps in biofilter fouling and engineering strategies for mitigating that fouling would benefit from a consistent and well characterized protocol for extracting eps from granular filter media to extract eps the biofilm matrix has to be destabilized by disrupting ionic interactions hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions flemming and wingender 2010 chemical or physical methods can be applied and generally a combination of the two works best fang and jia 1996 adav and lee 2008 physical methods include shear cavitation and heat chemical methods include ph adjustment addition of a surfactant addition of a fixative and removal of divalent cations through ion exchange or addition of a chelating agent adjusting the ph can disrupt the matrix because raising it ph 10 deprotonates proteins while lowering it ph 2 protonates polysaccharides wang et al 2012 divalent cations contribute greatly to the stabilization of the matrix above neutral ph banin et al 2006 wang et al 2012 so removing them can release eps polysaccharides and proteins into solution extraction protocols should not however be so harsh that they cause significant cell lysis lysis releases intracellular polysaccharides and proteins thereby contaminating the eps pool and complicating downstream analysis and data interpretation multiple eps extraction protocols have been developed for wastewater flocs and granules these protocols include the use of cation exchange resin cer formaldehyde sodium hydroxide naoh ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and heat table 1 presents a summary of previous studies aimed at improving eps extraction efficacy edta and formaldehyde naoh appear to be two of the best methods i e yield the most eps without causing substantial lysis but it is important to note that a these studies do not agree on which method is best and b none of them examined eps extraction from biofilms attached to granular filter media elhadidy et al 2017 modified the standard cer protocol for use with granular filter media but they did not compare its efficacy to other eps extraction protocols thus there is a need to improve and characterize an eps extraction protocol suitable for granular filter media to date the current study is the first to compare eps extraction protocols for biofilms attached to granular filter media in drinking water biofilters additionally few studies have measured eps in drinking water biofilters lauderdale et al 2012 nyfennegger et al 2015 elhadidy et al 2017 and the current study is the first to use a single protocol to assess eps in biofilters from multiple treatment plants as compared to existing eps extraction protocols an improved eps extraction protocol is one that yields higher concentrations of polysaccharides and proteins while minimizing contamination from cell lysis in the current study a variety of protocols from the literature were compared and one was targeted for further improvements by adjusting the physical parameters of the extraction process the efficacy of the improved extraction protocol on different granular media types was evaluated via staining and imaging eps concentrations in full scale biofilters in the u s and canada were interrogated using the improved extraction protocol and the impact of backwashing on eps and biomass concentrations was assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection for all samples approximately 50 ml of filter media were collected from 15 cm below the surface of full scale drinking water biofilters and shipped overnight on ice to the university of texas at austin samples were homogenized by stirring with a sterile spatula before removing each aliquot for analysis development and improvement of the eps extraction protocol were conducted using granular activated carbon gac from a full scale biofilter gac is a common media for biofilters brown et al 2016 and has a more complex surface than does anthracite or sand fox et al 1990 it was assumed that if the protocol were effective for gac then it would be applicable to other common types of filter media filter media samples were stored at 4 c until analysis which always occurred within one week of receipt extraction efficacy of the improved protocol was assessed using anthracite gac and sand biofilter samples eps was extracted upon arrival and after extraction the media was rinsed 3 with phosphate buffered saline pbs ausubel et al 2002 and stored at 4 c for 24 h until it was stained and imaged for the full scale survey water treatment plants in the u s and canada known to practice biofiltration were contacted media samples were collected before and after backwashing and they were analyzed upon receipt for eps and biomass concentration 2 2 extraction protocols four protocols from the literature and one new protocol were compared table 2 for all protocols except cer 2 0 05 g of gac were added to a 15 ml conical tube followed by 10 ml of extraction buffer samples were incubated at the given conditions temperature time and shaking table 2 and then centrifuged at 10 000 g and 25 c for 10 min the supernatant containing the eps was filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon filter and the gac in the pellet was retained for total solids ts analysis for only the extraction protocol with formaldehyde naoh the filtrate was further purified by dialysis using a 3000 da molecular weight cutoff snakeskin thermo fisher scientific waltham ma liu and fang 2002 formaldehyde interfered with both polysaccharide and protein quantification but none of the other extraction buffers did so dialysis was unnecessary after the other extraction methods formaldehyde and phenol react through an acid catalyzed reaction to form a resin that solidifies at high temperatures and the polysaccharide quantification protocol provides these conditions section 2 5 edta interferes with some protein assays but the current study used an assay compatible with the edta concentration in the te 8 te 11 and te final buffers section 2 5 each extraction was conducted in triplicate eps extractions done using cer were performed according to the protocol of elhadidy et al 2017 first the cer dowex marathon na form 20 50 mesh sigma aldrich st louis mo was washed by soaking it in 1 l ultrapure water overnight then 3 g wet weight of gac 3 g wet weight of washed cer and 20 ml of pbs were added to a 50 ml tube the tubes were incubated at 350 rpm and 25 c for 1 h after which they were centrifuged at 10 000 g and 25 c for 10 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon filter and transferred to a fresh 50 ml tube after identifying the chemical method that yielded the highest relative eps concentration 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 the protocol was improved by systematically varying four physical parameters the type of initial physical treatment and the shaking intensity temperature and time of incubation four initial physical treatments were considered inverting by hand 10 bath sonicating for 10 min bransonic 3510 branson ultrasonics danbury ct probe sonicating at 40 w for 2 min model 550 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma and vortexing at 3200 rpm for 1 min vortex genie 2 scientific industries inc bohemia ny three incubation temperatures were assessed 4 22 and 35 c three shaking intensities were tested 0 50 and 200 rpm four incubation times were tested 1 2 4 and 8 h baseline conditions i e inverting 10 by hand and incubating at 22 c for 4 h without shaking were used in the protocol improvement process except for the one parameter that was varied in a particular experiment protocol improvements were tested using aliquots of one filter media sample the four parameters of the protocol were tested over four consecutive days where one parameter was varied per day 2 3 lysis assessment planktonic escherichia coli k12 was used to assess the extent of cell lysis caused by the extraction protocol and the degree of eps contamination caused by such lysis this strain was chosen because it produces negligible amounts of eps prigent combaret et al 2000 e coli was grown overnight in r2a broth himedia laboratories mumbai india at 30 c and 150 rpm to a concentration of 1 1 107 colony forming units cfu ml then 2 ml of culture were centrifuged and the pellet was washed twice with pbs before being subjected to the eps extraction protocol the resulting cell count was within the range found in filter media samples the extraction protocol consisting of 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 with 1 min of vortexing followed by incubation at 35 c with shaking at 200 rpm was tested for incubation times of 4 8 and 24 h plate counts were conducted before and after the eps extraction and the difference in the bacterial concentrations was attributed to cell lysis the polysaccharide and protein concentrations in the extractant were quantified and these concentrations were attributed to cell lysis previous studies have used the dna concentration to assess lysis but these studies did not relate the dna concentration to the contamination of the extracted eps e g liu and fang 2002 in the current study we quantified the contamination of the eps pool that could be caused by lysis and plate counts were used to confirm whether an increase in the polysaccharide or protein concentration was associated with a decrease in the e coli concentration 2 4 assessment of extraction efficacy extraction efficacy was determined for three common media types i e anthracite gac and sand by staining and imaging unprocessed filter media and filter media processed with the final improved extraction protocol te final in preparation for staining and imaging samples were washed 3 with pbs and stained

microscopy and imaging facility in the institute for cellular and molecular biology at the university of texas at austin images were processed using imaris version 8 0 1 bitplane zurich switzerland to determine the sum of the fluorescence signal in the biofilm surrounding the filter media grain contour lines were drawn by hand around the grain in every image from the z stack to create a 3 d surface nine to fifteen grains were analyzed per condition for each stain the cumulative signal intensity in the biofilm surrounding the filter media grain was used to calculate the fluorescence intensity per unit external surface area of the grain 2 5 eps and biomass quantification eps was quantified by measuring polysaccharides and proteins in the extractant the bulk concentration of polysaccharides in the extractant was measured using a modified phenol sulfuric acid colorimetric method with glucose as the standard dubois et al 1956 masuko et al 2005 briefly 150 μl of extractant were added to a 13 mm glass test tube followed by 450 μl of concentrated h2so4 and 90 μl of 5 phenol the tubes were capped and vortexed briefly before being incubated at 90 c in a water bath for 10 min the samples were

manufacturer s enhanced test tube protocol thermo fisher scientific waltham ma briefly 100 μl of extractant were added to a 13 mm glass test tube followed by 2 ml of the kit s combined reagent the

winooski vt the linear range was 5 250 mg bsa l and the mdl was 2 2 mg bsa l eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations were normalized to the mass of filter media used in the extraction for all protocols in table 2 except cer ts were determined by transferring the aliquot of media from which the eps was extracted to a metal pan and drying it at 105 c for 24 h after which it was cooled in a desiccator and weighed this method was not suitable for cer because the resin would increase the overall mass of solids measured after eps extraction for cer ts were calculated by multiplying the wet mass of the gac used in the extraction by the dry wet mass ratio the dry wet mass ratio was determined by baking 10 g wet gac at 105 c overnight in triplicate and measuring the dry mass to release the biomass from the media for subsequent enumeration by plate counts a second aliquot of wet filter media 3 0 05 g was transferred to a sterile 15 ml conical tube and 8 ml of 5 mm tris buffer ph 7 3 was added to the tube the microtip of a sonic dismembrator model 550 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma was wiped with 70 ethanol and then placed in the tube such that the tip was approximately 2 cm above the surface of the filter media the sonic dismembrator was operated for 2 min at 40 w and then the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube this process was repeated five times on the filter media aliquot yielding a total volume of 48 ml magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 the filter solids were retained dried and weighed heterotrophic plate counts hpc were conducted on the supernatant in

discussion 3 1 comparison of extraction protocols the comparison of extraction protocols listed in table 2 is shown in fig 1 for all protocols the ratio of proteins to polysaccharides pn ps was 3 mg bsa mg glucose but pn ps was significantly higher using te 8 and te 11 tukey s hsd p 0 05 the protocols yielded significantly different quantities of eps polysaccharides and proteins 1 way anova p 0 001 among the protocols from the literature te 8 yielded significantly more eps proteins than did the other protocols tukey s hsd p 0 001 but form naoh yielded the highest polysaccharide concentration tukey s hsd p 0 01 unlike the other protocols form naoh uses a carcinogen formaldehyde and the extractant must be purified by dialysis both of which hinder its widespread adoption particularly for drinking water utilities te 8 yielded substantially more eps polysaccharides 1 8 and proteins 9 7 than did the cer protocol developed by elhadidy et al 2017 adding naoh to the extraction buffer can improve the eps extraction yield liu and fang 2002 and edta chelates ca2 and mg2 better at ph 10 however significantly more eps proteins were extracted using te 8 than te 11 tukey s hsd p 0 001 the extraction buffer used in te 8 appeared to be the best for granular filter media because it extracted the highest quantity of eps proteins among the tested literature protocols and because it does not have the operational complication of the form naoh protocol thus improvement of the physical extraction parameters was conducted using the 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 buffer 3 2 improvement of te 8 four physical parameters were varied to improve eps extraction with the 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 buffer the type of initial physical treatment and the shaking intensity temperature and time of incubation temperature and time had a statistically significant effect on the eps polysaccharide concentration 1 way anova p 0 01 and all four physical parameters that were tested had a statistically significant effect on the eps protein concentration 1 way anova p 0 001 fig 2 for the initial physical treatment fig 2a both the vortex and probe sonicator resulted in a higher average eps protein concentration than did inversion by hand tukey s hsd p 0 001 the eps concentrations yielded by these two treatments did not differ significantly from one another p 0 05 so the vortex was chosen for its ease and higher throughput increasing the incubation temperature from 4 c to 35 c yielded significantly more eps polysaccharides and proteins fig 2b tukey s hsd p 0 001 for an extraction time of 4 h the extracted eps polysaccharide concentration was significantly higher than for 1 h fig 2c tukey s hsd p 0 01 but the protein concentration did not increase significantly p 0 05 an incubation time of 8 h yielded significantly more eps polysaccharides and proteins as compared to a time of 1 h tukey s hsd p 0 01 and p 0 001 respectively shaking during incubation significantly increased the eps protein concentration as compared to static incubation fig 2d 1 way anova p 0 001 and increasing the intensity from 50 to 200 rpm yielded significantly more proteins tukey s hsd p 0 05 these data suggest that extracting eps from gac using 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 as the extraction buffer vortexing for 1 min at the outset and incubating at 35 c for 8 h with shaking at 200 rpm would yield the highest polysaccharide and protein concentrations among the tested protocols however as discussed in the following section this protocol needed to be modified to limit contamination of the eps pool due to cell lysis 3 3 limiting contamination from lysis planktonic e coli and biofilter gac were subjected to the extraction protocol consisting of 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 as the extraction buffer vortexing for 1 min at the outset and incubating at 35 c with shaking at 200 rpm for 4 8 or 24 h the resulting polysaccharide and protein concentrations were compared to assess contamination of the eps pool from lysis the initial cell count of e coli in each aliquot used for eps extraction was approximately 2 107 cfu the cell concentration in full scale biofilters as estimated by hpc can range from 2 5 104 8 0 107 cfu g ts fig 5b eps typically was extracted from 1 2 g ts which means that the initial cell count in the aliquot used for eps extraction ranges from 3 104 1 108 cfu thus the lysis test with e coli represents the high end of the cell count that typically is subjected to the extraction protocol this particular sample of biofilter gac is a reasonable point of comparison because its eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations were within the range measured during the full scale survey as part of the current study no polysaccharides were detected after subjecting planktonic e coli to the extraction protocol for any of the tested incubation times the protein concentration increased with incubation time during the eps extraction and the protein concentrations from planktonic e coli represented 11 20 and 23 of the protein concentration extracted from gac from a full scale biofilter after 4 8 and 24 h respectively fig 3 a concomitantly the log reduction of viable e coli increased with incubation time during the eps extraction fig 3b the magnitude of the increase in the protein concentration was similar between the e coli and gac samples suggesting that the additional proteins measured after extended incubation times might be attributed to release of intracellular proteins from lysis therefore an extraction time of 4 h was chosen for the final improved eps extraction protocol to limit contamination of the eps protein pool due to cell lysis the final improved protocol te final in table 2 is as follows using 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 as the extraction buffer vortexing for 1 min at the outset and incubating the sample for 4 h at 35 c and 200 rpm te final extracted significantly more eps proteins than did the protocols from the literature fig 1 tukey s hsd p 0 001 and it extracted a similar amount of eps polysaccharides as form naoh tukey s hsd p 0 05 increasing the intensity of the four physical parameters during the extraction protocol yielded more eps polysaccharides and proteins using te final as compared to te 8 tukey s hsd p 0 01 and p 0 001 even with an incubation time of 4 h te final therefore represents a substantial improvement of previous eps extraction protocols for use on granular filter media 3 4 assessment of extraction efficacy and reproducibility the overall effectiveness of te final was assessed by staining and imaging biofilter media before and after eps extraction fig 4 shows representative 3 d projections from three media types before eps extraction anthracite gac and sand from full scale biofilters were analyzed on different days with different gains so the fluorescence intensity among the three samples should not be compared table 3 shows the average cumulative fluorescence intensity of the four target constituents over the surface area of the filter media grain for the three media types before and after eps extraction it is to be noted that these stains cannot distinguish between cells and eps because they can bind to both cell wall components and eps the standard deviations were quite large reflecting the heterogeneous nature of biofilm development on granular filter media velten et al 2007 te final caused a statistically significant decrease in the fluorescence associated with α linked polysaccharides β linked polysaccharides and proteins on sand paired 1 sided t test table 3 te final only caused a statistically significant decrease in the fluorescence associated with β linked polysaccharides on anthracite and it did not decrease the fluorescence associated with any of the four target constituents on gac paired 1 sided t test table 3 these results confirm that gac is a particularly difficult medium from which to detach biomass camper et al 1985 nevertheless gac was used to develop the improved eps extraction protocol because te final extracted more eps from gac than did the other tested protocols it also should be the most effective protocol for anthracite and sand regardless staining and imaging indicated that a substantial amount of biomass cells and or eps remained attached to all media types after extraction and these data suggest that the final improved protocol developed in the current study only captured a fraction of the total eps on the filter media elhadidy et al 2017 reported that the cer protocol recovered 65 of the biomass from the filter media as indicated by adenosine triphosphate atp measurements but they did not assess eps recovery while even the final improved eps extraction protocol developed here does not extract all the eps from the filter media it yielded higher extracted eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations than did other methods from the literature its use should be complemented with other biofilm analytical techniques but its reproducibility described below makes it a valuable tool for evaluating eps in biofilters few eps extraction protocol studies report the protocol s reproducibility but we have demonstrated the reproducibility of the final improved eps extraction protocol the relative standard deviations rsds among seven replicates from gac were 9 60 and 3 77 for polysaccharides and proteins respectively selecting all possible combinations of three from these seven replicates showed that triplicate extractions could have rsds ranging from 4 10 to 14 6 and 1 20 to 5 50 for polysaccharides and proteins respectively protein quantification previously has been found to be more reproducible than is polysaccharide quantification pellicer nàcher et al 2013 the rsds in the current study reflect the heterogeneous nature of biofilter media and are similar to the uncertainty in quantifying atp from biofilter media velten et al 2007 rsds less than 15 and 6 for polysaccharides and proteins respectively among triplicate extractions suggest that te final can be used to characterize eps on granular filter media but particular care should be taken when attempting to ascertain small changes in dynamic systems 3 5 survey of full scale biofilters the final improved eps extraction protocol was employed to measure eps concentrations before and after backwashing in 11 full scale biofilters from the u s and canada table 4 summarizes characteristics of the biofilters that were surveyed the distributions of media type and the use of pre ozonation in this survey were similar to those reported in a larger survey of biofiltration in north america brown et al 2016 the current survey provides a useful baseline for assessing the range of eps concentrations that exist in full scale biofilters and for examining the effect of backwashing on the eps concentration the eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations ranged over one order of magnitude from 0 016 to 0 60 mg glucose g ts and 0 29 to 3 38 mg bsa g ts fig 5a and they were positively correlated spearman s ρ 0 59 p 0 05 the pn ps ratio ranged from 1 3 to 19 2 and it was similar between gac and anthracite biofilters and between biofilters with and without pre ozonation wilcoxon rank sum p 0 05 elhadidy et al 2017 found pn ps towards the low end of this range in pilot scale anthracite and sand biofilters but they used the cer extraction protocol which extracts less eps proteins than does te final the pn ps in wastewater flocs and granules can range from 0 4 to 14 with most studies showing pn ps 1 fang and jia 1996 frølund et al 1996 liu and fang 2002 adav and lee 2008 d abzac et al 2010 pellicer nàcher et al 2013 hpc varied widely from 2 5 104 to 8 0 107 cfu g ts fig 5b eps polysaccharides were positively correlated with hpc spearman s ρ 0 76 p 0 01 but eps proteins were not p 0 05 elhadidy et al 2017 identified a positive correlation between both eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations and biofilm cell count within biofilters treating the same source water eps proteins might not have been correlated with hpc in the current survey because of substantial differences in eps and hpc concentrations among the various biofilters the current survey normalized eps concentrations to the mass of ts because it is straightforward to measure but normalizing eps to filter media grain surface area would more accurately represent the eps concentration in the filter comparisons of eps concentrations normalized to the mass of ts are discouraged among different filter media types due to differences in the density of various media rather eps concentrations normalized to the mass of ts are more suited to comparisons within the same media type e g across time or among filters at one treatment plant the trends in eps concentrations among the biofilters in the current survey were similar when the eps concentrations were normalized to filter media grain surface area appendix a backwashing tended to lower eps and sometimes the hpc concentrations in the full scale biofilters the median min max removals for eps polysaccharides and proteins were 21 25 56 and 4 28 49 respectively fig 5a this reduction was significant for eps polysaccharides but not proteins wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 and p 0 05 respectively the relative removals of eps polysaccharides and proteins due to backwashing were similar between anthracite and gac filters wilcoxon rank sum p 0 05 nyfennegger et al 2015 found that backwashing did not remove a substantial fraction of eps on biofilter media but their extraction protocol te 8 does not recover as much eps polysaccharides as does te final backwashing did not significantly affect pn ps wilcoxon rank sum p 0 05 backwashing tended to remove more hpc from anthracite and sand biofilters than from gac biofilters the median min max log reduction of hpc after backwashing was 0 68 0 017 2 61 for anthracite and sand biofilters but only 0 0004 0 16 0 74 for gac biofilters this difference reflects that gac is a particularly good biofilm support medium liu et al 2001 emelko et al 2006 interestingly the biofilter with the greatest reduction in hpc after backwashing g also had the lowest eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations there was a slight negative correlation between percent removal of hpc via backwashing and eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations spearman s ρ 0 2 but the correlations were not significant p 0 05 previous studies similarly have shown backwashing to lower biomass levels miltner et al 1995 ahmad et al 1998 emelko et al 2006 liao et al 2014 in biofilters it is likely that a small fraction of the biomass are loosely attached and removed by backwashing but the majority of the eps and biofilm cells remain attached to the media during backwashing 4 conclusion previous studies have compared eps extraction protocols for wastewater flocs granules the current study developed and characterized an improved protocol for extracting eps from granular filter media in drinking water biofilters eps is likely an important parameter in biofilter operation and this study assessed eps concentrations in full scale biofilters and investigated the impact of backwashing on eps concentration the major conclusions are as follows the final improved eps extraction protocol 10 mm tris 10 mm edta 2 5 nacl ph 8 as the extraction buffer vortex for 1 min and incubate at 35 c with shaking at 200 rpm for 4 h substantially improved on protocols from the literature yielding a significantly higher eps protein concentration than did the other tested protocols and a similar eps polysaccharide concentration to the formaldehyde naoh protocol the effectiveness of the eps extraction protocol depended on the media type and was ranked as follows sand anthracite gac although the final improved protocol does not extract all the eps from a biofilter sample the protocol is reproducible with rsds of 9 60 and 3 77 for polysaccharides and proteins respectively among 11 full scale drinking water biofilters including gac anthracite and sand eps polysaccharide and protein concentrations ranged over one order of magnitude from 0 016 to 0 60 mg glucose g ts and 0 27 3 38 mg bsa g ts respectively backwashing significantly lowered the eps polysaccharide concentration on the filter media but the majority of the biofilm remained attached to the media after backwashing as expected backwashing tended to remove relatively more hpc from anthracite and sand filters than from gac filters but the percent removal of eps polysaccharides and proteins did not differ by media type acknowledgements this project was

19857,switch of source water may induce red water episodes this study investigated the impacts of water quality on iron release dissolved oxygen consumption δdo corrosion scale evolution and bacterial community succession in cast iron pipes used for drinking water distribution at pilot scale and proposed a source water switch strategy accordingly three sets of old cast iron pipe section named bp sp and gp were excavated on site and assembled in a test base which had historically transported blended water surface water and groundwater respectively results indicate that an increasing cl or so4 2 concentration accelerated iron release but alkalinity and calcium hardness exhibited an opposite tendency disinfectant shift from free chlorine to monochloramine slightly inhibited iron release while the impact of peroxymonosulfate depended on the source water historically transported in the test pipes the δdo was highly consistent with iron release in all three pipe systems the mass ratio of magnetite to goethite in the corrosion scales of sp was higher than those of bp and gp and kept almost unchanged over the whole operation period siderite and calcite formation confirmed that an increasing alkalinity and hardness inhibited iron release iron reducing bacteria decreased in the bp but increased in the sp and gp meanwhile sulfur oxidizing sulfate reducing and iron oxidizing bacteria increased in all three pipe systems to avoid the occurrence of red water a source water switch strategy was proposed based on the difference between local and foreign water qualities graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality cast iron pipe corrosion scale bacterial community switch strategy 1 introduction the south to north water diversion project is a multi decade infrastructure mega project in china aiming to transfer 4 48 1010 m3 of fresh water annually to the more arid north through three canal systems i e eastern middle and western routes the middle route winds from danjiangkou reservoir to beijing and tianjin cities crossing henan and hebei provinces henan province annually consumes about 3 0 109 m3 of the transferred water 18 0 and 7 5 of which are for zhengzhou and xuchang cities respectively internal corrosion of cast iron pipes is ubiquitous in drinking water distribution systems dwdss the corrosion scales formed by gradual accumulation of corrosion products offer habitations for pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria inducing infections of gastrointestinal tract skin and lymph nodes sun et al 2016 sudden variation in water chemistry may cause the destabilization of corrosion scales and associated biofilms resulting in discolored and odorous water episodes yang et al 2014 the physicochemical properties of corrosion scales are closely related to water quality parameters such as ph aqueous ions alkalinity and oxidation reduction potential tang et al 2006 observed an aggravated iron release as ph and alkalinity decreased by using a siderite feco3 model yang et al 2014 reported that iron release increased remarkably and even red water occurred in pipes with a historical groundwater supply when sulfate so4 2 concentration was elevated abruptly sarin et al 2001 found that an increasing oxidant concentration was beneficial to control iron release from corroded iron pipes yang et al 2012 found that water quality significantly impacted the composition of corrosion scales such as magnetite fe3o4 goethite α feooh lepidocrocite γ feooh and akaganeite β feooh to evaluate the corrosive nature and scaling tendency of water several water quality indices have been developed such as larson skold index lsi and calcium carbonate caco3 precipitation potential ccpp larson and skold 1958 merrill and sanks 1977 lsi determines a water s tendency for iron corrosion while ccpp indicates a water s capacity for calcium carbonate deposition meanwhile water quality also impacts the bacterial community in dwdss previous studies reported that microbial metabolism in dwdss played important roles in the biogeochemical redox cycle of iron erbs 2004 lytle et al 2005 generally the main bacterial types associated with iron corrosion are sulfate reducing bacteria srb sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob iron reducing bacteria irb and iron oxidizing bacteria iob sun et al 2014 srb are usually related to anaerobic iron corrosion which produces hydrogen sulfide h2s xu et al 2007 corrosion via iob occurs with a crevice corrosion mechanism formation of condensed oxygen zones and partition of metal surface into small anodic sites and a large surrounding cathodic area starosvetskya et al 2001 sob are responsible for the production of h2so4 and dissolved metals korehi et al 2013 additionally the enzymatic activity in biofilms and h2o2 produced by microorganisms can elevate the open circuit potential or free corrosion potential thus accelerating metal corrosion liao et al 2010 however irb inhibit iron corrosion because extracellular polymeric substances secreted by microorganisms can impede the dissolution of ferrous corrosion products videla and herrera 2009 wang et al 2012 red water occurred in beijing when a reservoir source water was imported from hebei province years ago learning from this harsh lesson this study as an early evaluation was to elucidate the interrelationships among water quality corrosion scale and bacterial community at pilot scale so as to propose effective countermeasures to water treatment plants that would be affected by the south to north water diversion project the impacts of water quality cl or so4 2 concentration alkalinity calcium hardness and disinfectant species on iron release in cast ion pipes were investigated together with the morphological and physicochemical transformation of corrosion scales in addition the succession of bacterial community in corrosion scales was examined as well this study helps prevent and control the deterioration of water quality in dwdss induced by source water switch 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used were of acs grade or higher cl so4 2 alkalinity and calcium hardness were supplied with nacl na2so4 na2co3 and ca no3 2 respectively free chlorine fc naclo monochloramine mc nh2cl and peroxymonosulfate pms khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 were used as disinfectants pms was purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china and all other chemicals from sinopharm chemical reagent company shanghai china 2 2 setup and operational conditions of pipe systems three sets of cast iron pipe section named bp sp and gp 20 25 years old were excavated from three different sites in zhengzhou and xuchang cities henan province china which had historically transported blended water surface water and groundwater respectively these pipe sections were transported immediately to our test base established in a drinking water treatment plant right beside danjiangkou reservoir hubei province china and assembled into three pipe systems within 24 h fig s1 the length and inner diameter of each pipe system were 20 m and 100 mm respectively the surface water in danjiangkou reservoir after treatment in the drinking water plant was pumped into the three pipe systems with a hydraulic retention time of 24 h the major characteristics of danjiangkou surface water dsw zhengzhou blended water zbw zhengzhou surface water zsw xuchang groundwater xgw which had been treated in local water treatment plants are shown in table 1 to evaluate the impacts of water quality on the corrosion scales and bacterial community in the three pipe systems upon source water switch cl alkalinity so4 2 and calcium hardness concentrations and disinfectant species were varied individually these pipe systems were operated continuously for 125 d which were divided into six operation phases phases i 1 21 d ii 22 35 d iii 36 55 d iv 56 75 d v 76 95 d and vi 96 125 d table 2 experimental conditions of each operation phase were referred to the historical water quality in the three pipe systems for example the cl concentration in zbw zsw and xgw was detected as 82 5 111 9 and 34 8 mg l 1 respectively table 1 correspondingly the experimental cl concentrations were set at 54 0 and 120 0 mg l 1 in phase ii in addition two indices lsi and ccpp were adopted to assess the corrosive nature and scaling tendency of the test waters respectively text s1 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of alkalinity calcium hardness and aqueous ions were analyzed using a hach dr2800 spectrophotometer hach usa dissolved oxygen do was detected using a hach sension 156 portable multiparameter meter the outward inward and cross sectional views of corrosion scales were recorded with a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi 7500 japan the specific surface area ssa of corrosion scales was determined with a tristar ii 3020 surface area and porosity analyzer micromeritics usa after samples were degassed at 120 c the crystalline phase composition of powder samples was analyzed using x ray diffraction xrd d max ra rigaku usa with the following operation parameters cu kα radiation at 40 kv and 100 ma 2θ ranging from 3 to 70 with a 0 02 step and a count time of 0 15 s at each step the elemental composition of powder samples was analyzed by x ray fluorescence xrf advant xp thermo electron switzerland coupled with a lawrencium lr excitation at 0 70 kv voltage and 0 120 ma current before xrd and x ray fluorescence analyses corrosion scales were pulverized in an anaerobic glove box and then freeze dried under vacuum biofilm samples were carefully scraped by using a sterile stainless steel spatula from the surface of corrosion scales with a total projection area of ca 50 cm2 collected at the top middle and bottom of each pipe system i e the 1st 3rd and 5th pipe sections in fig s1b on days 1 22 76 and 115 the acquired three biofilm samples were mixed gently rinsed with deionized water and centrifuged to remove water then genomic dna was extracted using a fast dna spin kit for soil qbiogene usa considering a high mineral content in the biofilm samples the dna extracts were further purified by gel electrophoresis running aliquots 50 μl of sample on 1 agarose gel at 60 v for 1 h excising dna bands from the gel and extracting the dna with the previous kit again the purified dna extracts were analyzed by amplicon pyrosequencing with standard 454 gs flx protocols sun et al 2011 the v1v3 regions within the 16s rrna gene fragment were amplified using barcoded universal primers of 27f 5 gagtttgatcntggctcag 3 and 533r 5 ttaccgcggctgctggcac 3 paired end reads were truncated i e cutting off the barcode and primer sequence and then merged using flash to obtain raw tags clean tags were acquired through filtering the raw tags under specific conditions and then chimera sequences were removed to obtain final effective tags haas et al 2011 bokulich et al 2013 in this study the average number of effective tags was about 40 000 operational taxonomic units otus at the 97 sequence identity level were picked using uclust representative sequences from each otu were identified with the ribosomal database project classification method after phylogenetic allocation of the sequences down to the phylum class and genus levels the relative abundance of a given phylogenetic group was calculated as the number of sequences affiliated with that group divided by the total number of sequences per sample hu et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of corrosion scales 3 1 1 morphological analysis of corrosion scales the visual appearance of the initial corrosion scales in the bp sp and gp is shown in fig s2 corrosion tubercles were densely distributed and connected to each other on the internal surfaces of bp and sp forming a continuous thick layer the corrosion tubercles of bp were orange and black while those of sp were mainly black the corrosion scales of gp were relatively smoother and thinner with yellowish brown tubercles sporadically distributed on the inner surface yang et al 2012 observed similar corrosion scales in water pipes historically transporting surface water or groundwater different water qualities in the three pipe systems could account for the morphological difference of their corrosion scales zsw and zbw had a stronger corrosive nature which facilitated the formation of more densely distributed tubercles and thicker corrosion scales to elucidate the microstructure evolution of the corrosion scales four samples were collected respectively from each pipe system on days 1 22 76 and 115 for sem analysis fig s3 for the three pipe systems their tubercle surfaces showed somewhat different evolution patterns reflecting a net result of iron dissolution and caco3 precipitation taking the bp as an example the tubercle surface shifted roughly from filar crystals on day 1 original morphology porous crystals on day 22 initially rapid iron release after introduction of dsw lamellar crystals on day 76 after addition of cl alkalinity and so4 2 to powdery crystals on day 115 after addition of calcium hardness and disinfectant the final tubercle surfaces in the sp and gp i e on day 115 were similar to that in the sp which was mainly due to the coverage of caco3 precipitate as the operation proceeded the surface of the tubercles in the three pipe systems became progressively dense which was also confirmed by the ssa analysis for example the tubercle ssa in the sp decreased gradually from 18 9 20 1 15 6 to 14 4 m2 g 1 on days 1 22 75 and 115 respectively 3 1 2 xrd analysis of corrosion scales to reveal the composition of the corrosion scales four samples were collected periodically i e on days 1 22 76 and 115 as aforementioned from each pipe system for xrd analysis as shown in table 3 fe3o4 and α feooh remained as the main crystalline minerals in the three pipe systems over the whole operation period with a total content exceeding 50 other iron minerals such as β feooh γ feooh and feco3 were also detected the mass ratio of fe3o4 to α feooh m g was 1 15 1 46 and 0 40 in the bp sp and gp respectively indicating that the bp and sp had more stable corrosion scales than the gp in addition the relatively higher content of the unstable iron minerals i e β feooh and γ feooh implied that the gp was less corroded accordingly the tubercle ssas in the bp and sp were lower than that in the gp for example the initial tubercle ssas in the bp sp and gp were measured to be 30 4 18 9 and 39 7 m2 g 1 respectively the ssa was closely relative to the composition of the corrosion scales such as fe3o4 α feooh and feco3 the ssas of natural fe3o4 and α feooh were in the ranges of 4 100 and 8 200 m2 g 1 respectively cornell and schwertmann 2003 liu et al 2013 therefore the higher tubercle ssa in the gp may be ascribed to its lower fe3o4 content if the source water is switched the gp tends to release iron more easily than the bp and sp because of a higher content of unstable iron and a higher tubercle ssa over the whole operation period the m g ratio almost kept unchanged for an instance the m g ratio of the corrosion scales in the sp was 1 46 1 34 1 31 and 1 39 on days 1 22 76 and 115 respectively hence it can be inferred that under the experimental conditions applied the reaction rate among fe2 do and oh to form α feooh was close to that among fe2 do and co3 2 to form fe3o4 according to a siderite model proposed by sontheimer et al 1981 a small amount of feco3 was precipitated after addition of alkalinity which could be further oxidized to fe3o4 at a slow pace the total content of unstable iron minerals β feooh and γ feooh increased first and then decreased indicating that the corrosion scales in the three pipe systems were approaching a stable status additionally a considerable amount of caco3 was precipitated when calcium hardness was increased 3 1 3 xrf analysis of corrosion scales table s1 shows the elemental composition of corrosion scales in the three pipe systems as aforementioned iron was the dominant element in the corrosion scales surpassing 50 other non iron elements could be approximately classified into three levels level i 7 42 0 1 including si al cl s ca and mg level ii 0 1 0 01 including mn p k and ba and level iii 0 01 0 001 including ti ta ni v zn and sr the main trace inorganic elements content 0 1 were metals yang et al 2012 investigated 58 iron corrosion scales collected from the dwdss in beijing and identified bromine and metals as the main trace inorganic elements the contents of cl s and ca generally increased with the operation time indicating that the added cl so4 2 and ca2 partially precipitated during the evolution of corrosion scales some metals such as ba ti ta ni and v were released into water during the operation period especially in the gp hence when source water is switched the release of trace metals should be paid more attention to in the gp than in the sp and bp 3 2 iron release fig 1 shows the variation of total iron concentration tic in the influents and effluents of the three pipe systems over the entire operation period obviously the effluent tic fluctuation was closely relative to the water quality in different operation phases in phase i dsw was pumped into the three pipe systems the effluent tic was initially high and then dropped quickly for example the initial effluent tic of sp was as high as 5 65 mg l 1 and finally stabilized at about 0 60 mg l 1 the lsi of dsw 0 26 was lower than those of zbw 1 36 zsw 1 85 and xgw 0 35 indicating its relatively weaker corrosive nature therefore the initially high effluent tic observed in all three pipe systems may be attributed to the easy washoff of corrosion scales which became loose after a long distance transport in phase ii the addition of cl induced a significant increase of the effluent tic as the cl concentration increased from 3 6 54 0 120 0 mg l 1 the lsi increased from 0 26 0 99 to 1 94 correspondinly as a result the effluent tic of the sp increased from 0 61 0 80 0 98 mg l 1 foley 1970 found that complexes formed between cl and iron oxides were transitory in a neutral solution unless trapped in a pit or crevice in phase iii an increase of alkalinity inhibited iron release as the alkalinity increased from 98 200 409 mg caco3 l 1 the lsi increased from 1 94 0 95 to 0 46 and the ccpp increased from 0 18 9 69 to 38 98 consequently the effluent tic of the sp decreased from 0 98 0 56 to 0 43 mg l 1 drissi et al 1994 reported that fe oh 2 precipitate could be successively oxidized to carbonate green rust and α feooh in the presence of co3 2 thus enhancing the stability of corrosion scales additionally a high alkalinity favored the precipitation of caco3 and feco3 which could coat the corrosion scales in phase iv the addition of so4 2 slightly promoted iron release as the so4 2 concentration increased from 20 229 518 mg l 1 the lsi increased from 0 46 1 00 to 1 73 as a result the effluent tic of the sp increased from 0 43 0 56 0 63 mg l 1 similar to cl so4 2 could also react with iron oxides to form unstable complexes erbs 2004 yang et al 2014 reported that so4 2 altered the microbial activities inside corrosion scales and the increased acidity promoted the dissolution of metals from corrosion scales in phase v an increasing calcium hardness inhibited iron release as the calcium hardness increased from 100 200 300 mg caco3 l 1 the ccpp increased from 34 27 64 43 to 85 02 consequently the effluent tic of the sp decreased from 0 63 0 51 to 0 39 mg l 1 merrill and sanks 1977 reported that a high calcium hardness was beneficial to the precipitation of caco3 in phase vi fc mc and pms were applied in sequence as disinfectants with an inlet concentration of 5 2 mg cl2 l 1 5 2 mg cl2 l 1 and 100 0 mg l 1 respectively the effluent tic exhibited somewhat different variation patterns in the three pipe systems the effluent tic of the bp and sp decreased gradually while that of gp decreased first and then increased li et al 2014 found that nitrate dependent ferrous iron oxidation occurred more significantly in dwdss disinfected with mc than with fc leading to the formation of denser corrosion scales wang et al 2012 also found that the switch from fc to mc inhibited iron release in a reclaimed water distribution system however mc could promote lead release in dwdss edwards and dudi 2004 lin and valentine 2008 which needs great attention when applying mc as a disinfectant pms exhibited two opposite effects on iron release from corrosion scales on the one side pms may be catalyzed heterogenerously and or homogenerously by metals present in dwdss to produce hydroxyl radicals ho and sulfate radicals so4 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 which could rapidly oxidize soluble ferrous iron to ferric iron precipitate on the other side so4 2 transformed from pms could promote iron release the net result indicated that pms slightly inhibited iron release in the bp and sp whereas it initially inhibited and then promoted iron release in the gp 3 3 dissolved oxygen consumption as shown in fig 2 the consumption of dissolved oxygen δdo was highly consistent with the variation of effluent tic taking the gp as an example in phase iii the effluent tic decreased from 1 46 1 09 to 0 82 mg l 1 and the δdo declined from 2 89 2 42 to 2 26 mg l 1 correspondingly in phase iv the effluent tic increased from 0 82 1 05 1 13 mg l 1 and the δdo increased from 2 26 2 60 2 76 mg l 1 correspondingly sarin et al 2004 found that iron was primarily released into bulk water in the ferrous form whose oxidation to ferric form required consumption of a matched amount of do in addition microbial activities in dwdss could also consume a certain amount of do li et al 2016 for an instance in phase iv an increasing so4 2 concentration may stimulate the activity of srb to generate reductive sulfides e g h2s hs s2 and s2 2 lytle et al 2005 the resulting sulfides could be re oxidized to so4 2 by sob which used do as an electron acceptor de romero et al 2003 meanwhile the sulfides could reduce feooh to ferrous ion fe2 lytle et al 2005 by utilizing the do sob could also oxidize the resulting fe2 to fe oh 3 precipitate mouchet 1992 in phase v the δdo decreased considerably due to the precipitation of caco3 which covered the corrosion scales and therefore inhibited the microbial activities and iron dissolution in addition kuch 1988 found that iron release could occur under an anoxic condition because ferric iron e g feooh could be reduced by zero valent iron fe0 to generate fe2 fig 2 shows that in phase vi upon the addition of fc the δdo dropped remarkably in all three pipe systems in other words fc helped maintain the do level in water pipes taking the sp as an example the δdo dropped rapidly from 0 93 on day 96 to 0 31 mg l 1 on day 97 right after the fc addition on the one side ferrous iron was readily oxidized to ferric iron by fc on the other side bacteria relative to iron corrosion were inactivated by fc as a result much less do was consumed the addition of mc on day 106 had little impact on the δdo after pms was added on day 116 the δdo increased to some extent in the gp and bp but remained almost unchanged in the sp as an overall result of chemical and bacterial oxidation of ferrous iron as described above 3 4 bacterial community figs 3 and s4 show the succession of bacterial community in the three pipe systems during the whole operation period overall on day 1 proteobacteria 70 were the dominant phylum in the three pipe systems which mainly consisted of five classes alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria and epsilonproteobacteria additionally actinobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes gemmatimonadetes and acidobacteria were also identified the relative abundance of proteobacteria in the gp 95 1 was considerably higher than those in the bp 71 9 and sp 75 5 sun et al 2014 reported that the relative abundance of proteobacteria in the corrosion scales of groundwater pipes was higher than those of surface water or blended water pipes fig s4 also shows that betaproteobacteria were dominant in the gp 67 4 while epsilonproteobacteria were more abundant than betaproteobacteria in the bp 33 2 and sp 30 3 previous studies showed that betaproteobacteria occurred almost exclusively in freshwater and were relatively higher in the corrosion scales of groundwater pipes glöckner et al 1999 sun et al 2014 at the genus level sulfurimonas was dominant in the bp 31 6 and sp 30 1 whereas massilia 50 1 and azospirillum 18 2 dominated the bacterial community in the gp grote et al 2012 reported that sulfurimonas gotlandica played a key role in nitrogen and sulfur cycling hemme et al 2015 observed that massilia was important in groundwater microbiomes bahar et al 2016 reported that the diazotroph azospirillum was effective in oxidizing arsenite to arsenate in groundwater during the 125 day operation period the composition of bacterial community in the three pipe systems changed significantly for example on days 1 22 76 and 115 the relative abundances were 50 1 14 6 9 5 and 11 3 for massilia and 0 3 2 6 0 3 and 18 9 for acinetobacter in the gp respectively yang et al 2014 found that when water pipes were switched to a new source water with a high so4 2 concentration irb remained dominant in pipes with stable corrosion scales while the relative abundances of sob srb and iob increased significantly in pipes with less stable corrosion scales in this study from day 22 to day 76 the relative abundance of irb e g pseudomonas shewanella clostridium escherichia geothrix and bacillus decreased from 0 3 to 0 2 in the bp increased from 0 80 to 1 86 in the sp and increased from 1 1 to 5 6 in the gp the total relative abundance of sob e g thiobacillus sulfurospirillum sulfurimonas and alicyclobacillus srb e g desulfitobacterium and desulfurivibrio and iob e g acidovorax ralstonia and gallionella in the bp sp and gp increased from 30 3 to 48 8 23 1 35 3 and 9 9 13 7 respectively this result indicates that in addition to so4 2 concentration other water quality parameters could also influence the bacterial communities in the three pipe systems 3 5 source water switch strategy north china is a water deficient area especially in beijing and tianjin cities which have a current population of about 37 2 million drinking water source has long been a big challenge in face of the rapid economic development and population increase therefore the south to north water diversion project is vital to the sustainable development of north china for this project source water switches are inevitable for cities of different sizes affected by the middle route a forward switch of source water that is from a local water e g zbw zgw xgw to dsw will be carried out when danjiangkou reservoir is sufficient in water in normal years however a reverse switch of source water is required in case that danjiangkou reservoir encounters a dry year since zbw zgw and xgw all have a stronger corrosive nature than dsw red water is more likely to occur during the reverse switch than during the forward switch to avoid the occurrence of red water during the reverse switch blending of a local source water e g zbw zgw or xgw with dsw can be a precautionary countermeasure the blending ratio of a local source water to dsw i e a foreign source water can be calculated as follow 1 blending ratio q loc q loc q dsw where qloc and qdsw represent the flow rates of a local source water and dsw m3 d 1 respectively fig 4 shows the variation of effluent tic with lsi as well as the correlation between lsi and blending ratio the linear regression equations between the effluent tic y and lsi x in the bp sp and gp were obtained as follows y 0 34x 0 71 y 0 40x 0 24 and y 0 40x 0 71 respectively fig 4a according to these equations to restrict the variation of effluent tic i e δtic within 0 2 mg l 1 in all three pipe systems the variation of lsi i e δlsi should be controlled within 0 50 because the lsi of xgw 0 35 is similar to that of dsw 0 26 it is feasible to conduct a full reverse switch i e blending ratio 100 however the lsi of zsw 1 85 far exceeds that of dsw 0 26 so a blending ratio of 15 needs to be adopted to control the δlsi within 0 5 i e lsi 0 76 fig 4b in general a full reverse switch from dsw to a local source water is possible when the two waters have similar water qualities especially the lsi but a progressive reverse switch with an appropriate blending ratio is necessary when their water qualities are considerably different even so there is no guarantee that red water will not occur due to the complex chemical and biological compositions of corrosion scales in the dwdss two emergency countermeasures are proposed to cope with the red water 1 increasing the water s alkalinity to reduce its corrosive nature lsi 0 5 and enhance its scaling tendency ccpp 40 and 2 increasing the dose of disinfectant to oxidize unstable iron and suppress microbial activities deterioration of water quality induced by source water switch often leads to consumer complaints and poses a serious threat to public health hence taking precautionary and emergency countermeasures in time is of great importance to ensure the safety of drinking water 4 conclusions in this study the impacts of water quality on iron release dissolved oxygen consumption corrosion scale evolution and bacterial comnunity succession in cast iron water pipes were investigated at pilot scale and a source water switch strategy was proposed accordingly based on the experimental results obtained the following conclusions are drawn an increasing cl or so4 2 concentration accelerated iron release but an increasing alkalinity or calcium hardness inhibited iron release disinfectant shift from free chlorine to monochloramine slightly inhibited iron release fe3o4 and α feooh were the main crystalline iron minerals in the corrosion scales of three pipe systems the m g ratio in the corrosion scales of sp was higher than those of bp and gp indicating that the sp had more stable corrosion scales feco3 and caco3 formation confirmed that an increasing alkalinity and calcium hardness inhibited iron release respectively the sp released less iron than the bp and gp during the whole operation period because of its more stable corrosion scales the δdo was highly consistent with the iron release in all three pipe systems sulfurimonas was dominant in the bp and sp while massilia and azospirillum dominated the bacterial community in the gp the water quality significantly influenced the bacterial community in the three pipe systems to avoid the occurrence of red water a source water switch strategy was proposed based on the difference between local and foreign water qualities for example a full reverse switch is feasible for xuchang city whereas a blending ratio of a local water zbw or zsw to dsw of 0 15 should be adopted for zhengzhou city acknowledgements this study was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51290281 51525806 51408590 and chinese academy of sciences qyzdy

19857,switch of source water may induce red water episodes this study investigated the impacts of water quality on iron release dissolved oxygen consumption δdo corrosion scale evolution and bacterial community succession in cast iron pipes used for drinking water distribution at pilot scale and proposed a source water switch strategy accordingly three sets of old cast iron pipe section named bp sp and gp were excavated on site and assembled in a test base which had historically transported blended water surface water and groundwater respectively results indicate that an increasing cl or so4 2 concentration accelerated iron release but alkalinity and calcium hardness exhibited an opposite tendency disinfectant shift from free chlorine to monochloramine slightly inhibited iron release while the impact of peroxymonosulfate depended on the source water historically transported in the test pipes the δdo was highly consistent with iron release in all three pipe systems the mass ratio of magnetite to goethite in the corrosion scales of sp was higher than those of bp and gp and kept almost unchanged over the whole operation period siderite and calcite formation confirmed that an increasing alkalinity and hardness inhibited iron release iron reducing bacteria decreased in the bp but increased in the sp and gp meanwhile sulfur oxidizing sulfate reducing and iron oxidizing bacteria increased in all three pipe systems to avoid the occurrence of red water a source water switch strategy was proposed based on the difference between local and foreign water qualities graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality cast iron pipe corrosion scale bacterial community switch strategy 1 introduction the south to north water diversion project is a multi decade infrastructure mega project in china aiming to transfer 4 48 1010 m3 of fresh water annually to the more arid north through three canal systems i e eastern middle and western routes the middle route winds from danjiangkou reservoir to beijing and tianjin cities crossing henan and hebei provinces henan province annually consumes about 3 0 109 m3 of the transferred water 18 0 and 7 5 of which are for zhengzhou and xuchang cities respectively internal corrosion of cast iron pipes is ubiquitous in drinking water distribution systems dwdss the corrosion scales formed by gradual accumulation of corrosion products offer habitations for pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria inducing infections of gastrointestinal tract skin and lymph nodes sun et al 2016 sudden variation in water chemistry may cause the destabilization of corrosion scales and associated biofilms resulting in discolored and odorous water episodes yang et al 2014 the physicochemical properties of corrosion scales are closely related to water quality parameters such as ph aqueous ions alkalinity and oxidation reduction potential tang et al 2006 observed an aggravated iron release as ph and alkalinity decreased by using a siderite feco3 model yang et al 2014 reported that iron release increased remarkably and even red water occurred in pipes with a historical groundwater supply when sulfate so4 2 concentration was elevated abruptly sarin et al 2001 found that an increasing oxidant concentration was beneficial to control iron release from corroded iron pipes yang et al 2012 found that water quality significantly impacted the composition of corrosion scales such as magnetite fe3o4 goethite α feooh lepidocrocite γ feooh and akaganeite β feooh to evaluate the corrosive nature and scaling tendency of water several water quality indices have been developed such as larson skold index lsi and calcium carbonate caco3 precipitation potential ccpp larson and skold 1958 merrill and sanks 1977 lsi determines a water s tendency for iron corrosion while ccpp indicates a water s capacity for calcium carbonate deposition meanwhile water quality also impacts the bacterial community in dwdss previous studies reported that microbial metabolism in dwdss played important roles in the biogeochemical redox cycle of iron erbs 2004 lytle et al 2005 generally the main bacterial types associated with iron corrosion are sulfate reducing bacteria srb sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob iron reducing bacteria irb and iron oxidizing bacteria iob sun et al 2014 srb are usually related to anaerobic iron corrosion which produces hydrogen sulfide h2s xu et al 2007 corrosion via iob occurs with a crevice corrosion mechanism formation of condensed oxygen zones and partition of metal surface into small anodic sites and a large surrounding cathodic area starosvetskya et al 2001 sob are responsible for the production of h2so4 and dissolved metals korehi et al 2013 additionally the enzymatic activity in biofilms and h2o2 produced by microorganisms can elevate the open circuit potential or free corrosion potential thus accelerating metal corrosion liao et al 2010 however irb inhibit iron corrosion because extracellular polymeric substances secreted by microorganisms can impede the dissolution of ferrous corrosion products videla and herrera 2009 wang et al 2012 red water occurred in beijing when a reservoir source water was imported from hebei province years ago learning from this harsh lesson this study as an early evaluation was to elucidate the interrelationships among water quality corrosion scale and bacterial community at pilot scale so as to propose effective countermeasures to water treatment plants that would be affected by the south to north water diversion project the impacts of water quality cl or so4 2 concentration alkalinity calcium hardness and disinfectant species on iron release in cast ion pipes were investigated together with the morphological and physicochemical transformation of corrosion scales in addition the succession of bacterial community in corrosion scales was examined as well this study helps prevent and control the deterioration of water quality in dwdss induced by source water switch 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used were of acs grade or higher cl so4 2 alkalinity and calcium hardness were supplied with nacl na2so4 na2co3 and ca no3 2 respectively free chlorine fc naclo monochloramine mc nh2cl and peroxymonosulfate pms khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 were used as disinfectants pms was purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china and all other chemicals from sinopharm chemical reagent company shanghai china 2 2 setup and operational conditions of pipe systems three sets of cast iron pipe section named bp sp and gp 20 25 years old were excavated from three different sites in zhengzhou and xuchang cities henan province china which had historically transported blended water surface water and groundwater respectively these pipe sections were transported immediately to our test base established in a drinking water treatment plant right beside danjiangkou reservoir hubei province china and assembled into three pipe systems within 24 h fig s1 the length and inner diameter of each pipe system were 20 m and 100 mm respectively the surface water in danjiangkou reservoir after treatment in the drinking water plant was pumped into the three pipe systems with a hydraulic retention time of 24 h the major characteristics of danjiangkou surface water dsw zhengzhou blended water zbw zhengzhou surface water zsw xuchang groundwater xgw which had been treated in local water treatment plants are shown in table 1 to evaluate the impacts of water quality on the corrosion scales and bacterial community in the three pipe systems upon source water switch cl alkalinity so4 2 and calcium hardness concentrations and disinfectant species were varied individually these pipe systems were operated continuously for 125 d which were divided into six operation phases phases i 1 21 d ii 22 35 d iii 36 55 d iv 56 75 d v 76 95 d and vi 96 125 d table 2 experimental conditions of each operation phase were referred to the historical water quality in the three pipe systems for example the cl concentration in zbw zsw and xgw was detected as 82 5 111 9 and 34 8 mg l 1 respectively table 1 correspondingly the experimental cl concentrations were set at 54 0 and 120 0 mg l 1 in phase ii in addition two indices lsi and ccpp were adopted to assess the corrosive nature and scaling tendency of the test waters respectively text s1 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of alkalinity calcium hardness and aqueous ions were analyzed using a hach dr2800 spectrophotometer hach usa dissolved oxygen do was detected using a hach sension 156 portable multiparameter meter the outward inward and cross sectional views of corrosion scales were recorded with a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi 7500 japan the specific surface area ssa of corrosion scales was determined with a tristar ii 3020 surface area and porosity analyzer micromeritics usa after samples were degassed at 120 c the crystalline phase composition of powder samples was analyzed using x ray diffraction xrd d max ra rigaku usa with the following operation parameters cu kα radiation at 40 kv and 100 ma 2θ ranging from 3 to 70 with a 0 02 step and a count time of 0 15 s at each step the elemental composition of powder samples was analyzed by x ray fluorescence xrf advant xp thermo electron switzerland coupled with a lawrencium lr excitation at 0 70 kv voltage and 0 120 ma current before xrd and x ray fluorescence analyses corrosion scales were pulverized in an anaerobic glove box and then freeze dried under vacuum biofilm samples were carefully scraped by using a sterile stainless steel spatula from the surface of corrosion scales with a total projection area of ca 50 cm2 collected at the top middle and bottom of each pipe system i e the 1st 3rd and 5th pipe sections in fig s1b on days 1 22 76 and 115 the acquired three biofilm samples were mixed gently rinsed with deionized water and centrifuged to remove water then genomic dna was extracted using a fast dna spin kit for soil qbiogene usa considering a high mineral content in the biofilm samples the dna extracts were further purified by gel electrophoresis running aliquots 50 μl of sample on 1 agarose gel at 60 v for 1 h excising dna bands from the gel and extracting the dna with the previous kit again the purified dna extracts were analyzed by amplicon pyrosequencing with standard 454 gs flx protocols sun et al 2011 the v1v3 regions within the 16s rrna gene fragment were amplified using barcoded universal primers of 27f 5 gagtttgatcntggctcag 3 and 533r 5 ttaccgcggctgctggcac 3 paired end reads were truncated i e cutting off the barcode and primer sequence and then merged using flash to obtain raw tags clean tags were acquired through filtering the raw tags under specific conditions and then chimera sequences were removed to obtain final effective tags haas et al 2011 bokulich et al 2013 in this study the average number of effective tags was about 40 000 operational taxonomic units otus at the 97 sequence identity level were picked using uclust representative sequences from each otu were identified with the ribosomal database project classification method after phylogenetic allocation of the sequences down to the phylum class and genus levels the relative abundance of a given phylogenetic group was calculated as the number of sequences affiliated with that group divided by the total number of sequences per sample hu et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of corrosion scales 3 1 1 morphological analysis of corrosion scales the visual appearance of the initial corrosion scales in the bp sp and gp is shown in fig s2 corrosion tubercles were densely distributed and connected to each other on the internal surfaces of bp and sp forming a continuous thick layer the corrosion tubercles of bp were orange and black while those of sp were mainly black the corrosion scales of gp were relatively smoother and thinner with yellowish brown tubercles sporadically distributed on the inner surface yang et al 2012 observed similar corrosion scales in water pipes historically transporting surface water or groundwater different water qualities in the three pipe systems could account for the morphological difference of their corrosion scales zsw and zbw had a stronger corrosive nature which facilitated the formation of more densely distributed tubercles and thicker corrosion scales to elucidate the microstructure evolution of the corrosion scales four samples were collected respectively from each pipe system on days 1 22 76 and 115 for sem analysis fig s3 for the three pipe systems their tubercle surfaces showed somewhat different evolution patterns reflecting a net result of iron dissolution and caco3 precipitation taking the bp as an example the tubercle surface shifted roughly from filar crystals on day 1 original morphology porous crystals on day 22 initially rapid iron release after introduction of dsw lamellar crystals on day 76 after addition of cl alkalinity and so4 2 to powdery crystals on day 115 after addition of calcium hardness and disinfectant the final tubercle surfaces in the sp and gp i e on day 115 were similar to that in the sp which was mainly due to the coverage of caco3 precipitate as the operation proceeded the surface of the tubercles in the three pipe systems became progressively dense which was also confirmed by the ssa analysis for example the tubercle ssa in the sp decreased gradually from 18 9 20 1 15 6 to 14 4 m2 g 1 on days 1 22 75 and 115 respectively 3 1 2 xrd analysis of corrosion scales to reveal the composition of the corrosion scales four samples were collected periodically i e on days 1 22 76 and 115 as aforementioned from each pipe system for xrd analysis as shown in table 3 fe3o4 and α feooh remained as the main crystalline minerals in the three pipe systems over the whole operation period with a total content exceeding 50 other iron minerals such as β feooh γ feooh and feco3 were also detected the mass ratio of fe3o4 to α feooh m g was 1 15 1 46 and 0 40 in the bp sp and gp respectively indicating that the bp and sp had more stable corrosion scales than the gp in addition the relatively higher content of the unstable iron minerals i e β feooh and γ feooh implied that the gp was less corroded accordingly the tubercle ssas in the bp and sp were lower than that in the gp for example the initial tubercle ssas in the bp sp and gp were measured to be 30 4 18 9 and 39 7 m2 g 1 respectively the ssa was closely relative to the composition of the corrosion scales such as fe3o4 α feooh and feco3 the ssas of natural fe3o4 and α feooh were in the ranges of 4 100 and 8 200 m2 g 1 respectively cornell and schwertmann 2003 liu et al 2013 therefore the higher tubercle ssa in the gp may be ascribed to its lower fe3o4 content if the source water is switched the gp tends to release iron more easily than the bp and sp because of a higher content of unstable iron and a higher tubercle ssa over the whole operation period the m g ratio almost kept unchanged for an instance the m g ratio of the corrosion scales in the sp was 1 46 1 34 1 31 and 1 39 on days 1 22 76 and 115 respectively hence it can be inferred that under the experimental conditions applied the reaction rate among fe2 do and oh to form α feooh was close to that among fe2 do and co3 2 to form fe3o4 according to a siderite model proposed by sontheimer et al 1981 a small amount of feco3 was precipitated after addition of alkalinity which could be further oxidized to fe3o4 at a slow pace the total content of unstable iron minerals β feooh and γ feooh increased first and then decreased indicating that the corrosion scales in the three pipe systems were approaching a stable status additionally a considerable amount of caco3 was precipitated when calcium hardness was increased 3 1 3 xrf analysis of corrosion scales table s1 shows the elemental composition of corrosion scales in the three pipe systems as aforementioned iron was the dominant element in the corrosion scales surpassing 50 other non iron elements could be approximately classified into three levels level i 7 42 0 1 including si al cl s ca and mg level ii 0 1 0 01 including mn p k and ba and level iii 0 01 0 001 including ti ta ni v zn and sr the main trace inorganic elements content 0 1 were metals yang et al 2012 investigated 58 iron corrosion scales collected from the dwdss in beijing and identified bromine and metals as the main trace inorganic elements the contents of cl s and ca generally increased with the operation time indicating that the added cl so4 2 and ca2 partially precipitated during the evolution of corrosion scales some metals such as ba ti ta ni and v were released into water during the operation period especially in the gp hence when source water is switched the release of trace metals should be paid more attention to in the gp than in the sp and bp 3 2 iron release fig 1 shows the variation of total iron concentration tic in the influents and effluents of the three pipe systems over the entire operation period obviously the effluent tic fluctuation was closely relative to the water quality in different operation phases in phase i dsw was pumped into the three pipe systems the effluent tic was initially high and then dropped quickly for example the initial effluent tic of sp was as high as 5 65 mg l 1 and finally stabilized at about 0 60 mg l 1 the lsi of dsw 0 26 was lower than those of zbw 1 36 zsw 1 85 and xgw 0 35 indicating its relatively weaker corrosive nature therefore the initially high effluent tic observed in all three pipe systems may be attributed to the easy washoff of corrosion scales which became loose after a long distance transport in phase ii the addition of cl induced a significant increase of the effluent tic as the cl concentration increased from 3 6 54 0 120 0 mg l 1 the lsi increased from 0 26 0 99 to 1 94 correspondinly as a result the effluent tic of the sp increased from 0 61 0 80 0 98 mg l 1 foley 1970 found that complexes formed between cl and iron oxides were transitory in a neutral solution unless trapped in a pit or crevice in phase iii an increase of alkalinity inhibited iron release as the alkalinity increased from 98 200 409 mg caco3 l 1 the lsi increased from 1 94 0 95 to 0 46 and the ccpp increased from 0 18 9 69 to 38 98 consequently the effluent tic of the sp decreased from 0 98 0 56 to 0 43 mg l 1 drissi et al 1994 reported that fe oh 2 precipitate could be successively oxidized to carbonate green rust and α feooh in the presence of co3 2 thus enhancing the stability of corrosion scales additionally a high alkalinity favored the precipitation of caco3 and feco3 which could coat the corrosion scales in phase iv the addition of so4 2 slightly promoted iron release as the so4 2 concentration increased from 20 229 518 mg l 1 the lsi increased from 0 46 1 00 to 1 73 as a result the effluent tic of the sp increased from 0 43 0 56 0 63 mg l 1 similar to cl so4 2 could also react with iron oxides to form unstable complexes erbs 2004 yang et al 2014 reported that so4 2 altered the microbial activities inside corrosion scales and the increased acidity promoted the dissolution of metals from corrosion scales in phase v an increasing calcium hardness inhibited iron release as the calcium hardness increased from 100 200 300 mg caco3 l 1 the ccpp increased from 34 27 64 43 to 85 02 consequently the effluent tic of the sp decreased from 0 63 0 51 to 0 39 mg l 1 merrill and sanks 1977 reported that a high calcium hardness was beneficial to the precipitation of caco3 in phase vi fc mc and pms were applied in sequence as disinfectants with an inlet concentration of 5 2 mg cl2 l 1 5 2 mg cl2 l 1 and 100 0 mg l 1 respectively the effluent tic exhibited somewhat different variation patterns in the three pipe systems the effluent tic of the bp and sp decreased gradually while that of gp decreased first and then increased li et al 2014 found that nitrate dependent ferrous iron oxidation occurred more significantly in dwdss disinfected with mc than with fc leading to the formation of denser corrosion scales wang et al 2012 also found that the switch from fc to mc inhibited iron release in a reclaimed water distribution system however mc could promote lead release in dwdss edwards and dudi 2004 lin and valentine 2008 which needs great attention when applying mc as a disinfectant pms exhibited two opposite effects on iron release from corrosion scales on the one side pms may be catalyzed heterogenerously and or homogenerously by metals present in dwdss to produce hydroxyl radicals ho and sulfate radicals so4 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 which could rapidly oxidize soluble ferrous iron to ferric iron precipitate on the other side so4 2 transformed from pms could promote iron release the net result indicated that pms slightly inhibited iron release in the bp and sp whereas it initially inhibited and then promoted iron release in the gp 3 3 dissolved oxygen consumption as shown in fig 2 the consumption of dissolved oxygen δdo was highly consistent with the variation of effluent tic taking the gp as an example in phase iii the effluent tic decreased from 1 46 1 09 to 0 82 mg l 1 and the δdo declined from 2 89 2 42 to 2 26 mg l 1 correspondingly in phase iv the effluent tic increased from 0 82 1 05 1 13 mg l 1 and the δdo increased from 2 26 2 60 2 76 mg l 1 correspondingly sarin et al 2004 found that iron was primarily released into bulk water in the ferrous form whose oxidation to ferric form required consumption of a matched amount of do in addition microbial activities in dwdss could also consume a certain amount of do li et al 2016 for an instance in phase iv an increasing so4 2 concentration may stimulate the activity of srb to generate reductive sulfides e g h2s hs s2 and s2 2 lytle et al 2005 the resulting sulfides could be re oxidized to so4 2 by sob which used do as an electron acceptor de romero et al 2003 meanwhile the sulfides could reduce feooh to ferrous ion fe2 lytle et al 2005 by utilizing the do sob could also oxidize the resulting fe2 to fe oh 3 precipitate mouchet 1992 in phase v the δdo decreased considerably due to the precipitation of caco3 which covered the corrosion scales and therefore inhibited the microbial activities and iron dissolution in addition kuch 1988 found that iron release could occur under an anoxic condition because ferric iron e g feooh could be reduced by zero valent iron fe0 to generate fe2 fig 2 shows that in phase vi upon the addition of fc the δdo dropped remarkably in all three pipe systems in other words fc helped maintain the do level in water pipes taking the sp as an example the δdo dropped rapidly from 0 93 on day 96 to 0 31 mg l 1 on day 97 right after the fc addition on the one side ferrous iron was readily oxidized to ferric iron by fc on the other side bacteria relative to iron corrosion were inactivated by fc as a result much less do was consumed the addition of mc on day 106 had little impact on the δdo after pms was added on day 116 the δdo increased to some extent in the gp and bp but remained almost unchanged in the sp as an overall result of chemical and bacterial oxidation of ferrous iron as described above 3 4 bacterial community figs 3 and s4 show the succession of bacterial community in the three pipe systems during the whole operation period overall on day 1 proteobacteria 70 were the dominant phylum in the three pipe systems which mainly consisted of five classes alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria and epsilonproteobacteria additionally actinobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes gemmatimonadetes and acidobacteria were also identified the relative abundance of proteobacteria in the gp 95 1 was considerably higher than those in the bp 71 9 and sp 75 5 sun et al 2014 reported that the relative abundance of proteobacteria in the corrosion scales of groundwater pipes was higher than those of surface water or blended water pipes fig s4 also shows that betaproteobacteria were dominant in the gp 67 4 while epsilonproteobacteria were more abundant than betaproteobacteria in the bp 33 2 and sp 30 3 previous studies showed that betaproteobacteria occurred almost exclusively in freshwater and were relatively higher in the corrosion scales of groundwater pipes glöckner et al 1999 sun et al 2014 at the genus level sulfurimonas was dominant in the bp 31 6 and sp 30 1 whereas massilia 50 1 and azospirillum 18 2 dominated the bacterial community in the gp grote et al 2012 reported that sulfurimonas gotlandica played a key role in nitrogen and sulfur cycling hemme et al 2015 observed that massilia was important in groundwater microbiomes bahar et al 2016 reported that the diazotroph azospirillum was effective in oxidizing arsenite to arsenate in groundwater during the 125 day operation period the composition of bacterial community in the three pipe systems changed significantly for example on days 1 22 76 and 115 the relative abundances were 50 1 14 6 9 5 and 11 3 for massilia and 0 3 2 6 0 3 and 18 9 for acinetobacter in the gp respectively yang et al 2014 found that when water pipes were switched to a new source water with a high so4 2 concentration irb remained dominant in pipes with stable corrosion scales while the relative abundances of sob srb and iob increased significantly in pipes with less stable corrosion scales in this study from day 22 to day 76 the relative abundance of irb e g pseudomonas shewanella clostridium escherichia geothrix and bacillus decreased from 0 3 to 0 2 in the bp increased from 0 80 to 1 86 in the sp and increased from 1 1 to 5 6 in the gp the total relative abundance of sob e g thiobacillus sulfurospirillum sulfurimonas and alicyclobacillus srb e g desulfitobacterium and desulfurivibrio and iob e g acidovorax ralstonia and gallionella in the bp sp and gp increased from 30 3 to 48 8 23 1 35 3 and 9 9 13 7 respectively this result indicates that in addition to so4 2 concentration other water quality parameters could also influence the bacterial communities in the three pipe systems 3 5 source water switch strategy north china is a water deficient area especially in beijing and tianjin cities which have a current population of about 37 2 million drinking water source has long been a big challenge in face of the rapid economic development and population increase therefore the south to north water diversion project is vital to the sustainable development of north china for this project source water switches are inevitable for cities of different sizes affected by the middle route a forward switch of source water that is from a local water e g zbw zgw xgw to dsw will be carried out when danjiangkou reservoir is sufficient in water in normal years however a reverse switch of source water is required in case that danjiangkou reservoir encounters a dry year since zbw zgw and xgw all have a stronger corrosive nature than dsw red water is more likely to occur during the reverse switch than during the forward switch to avoid the occurrence of red water during the reverse switch blending of a local source water e g zbw zgw or xgw with dsw can be a precautionary countermeasure the blending ratio of a local source water to dsw i e a foreign source water can be calculated as follow 1 blending ratio q loc q loc q dsw where qloc and qdsw represent the flow rates of a local source water and dsw m3 d 1 respectively fig 4 shows the variation of effluent tic with lsi as well as the correlation between lsi and blending ratio the linear regression equations between the effluent tic y and lsi x in the bp sp and gp were obtained as follows y 0 34x 0 71 y 0 40x 0 24 and y 0 40x 0 71 respectively fig 4a according to these equations to restrict the variation of effluent tic i e δtic within 0 2 mg l 1 in all three pipe systems the variation of lsi i e δlsi should be controlled within 0 50 because the lsi of xgw 0 35 is similar to that of dsw 0 26 it is feasible to conduct a full reverse switch i e blending ratio 100 however the lsi of zsw 1 85 far exceeds that of dsw 0 26 so a blending ratio of 15 needs to be adopted to control the δlsi within 0 5 i e lsi 0 76 fig 4b in general a full reverse switch from dsw to a local source water is possible when the two waters have similar water qualities especially the lsi but a progressive reverse switch with an appropriate blending ratio is necessary when their water qualities are considerably different even so there is no guarantee that red water will not occur due to the complex chemical and biological compositions of corrosion scales in the dwdss two emergency countermeasures are proposed to cope with the red water 1 increasing the water s alkalinity to reduce its corrosive nature lsi 0 5 and enhance its scaling tendency ccpp 40 and 2 increasing the dose of disinfectant to oxidize unstable iron and suppress microbial activities deterioration of water quality induced by source water switch often leads to consumer complaints and poses a serious threat to public health hence taking precautionary and emergency countermeasures in time is of great importance to ensure the safety of drinking water 4 conclusions in this study the impacts of water quality on iron release dissolved oxygen consumption corrosion scale evolution and bacterial comnunity succession in cast iron water pipes were investigated at pilot scale and a source water switch strategy was proposed accordingly based on the experimental results obtained the following conclusions are drawn an increasing cl or so4 2 concentration accelerated iron release but an increasing alkalinity or calcium hardness inhibited iron release disinfectant shift from free chlorine to monochloramine slightly inhibited iron release fe3o4 and α feooh were the main crystalline iron minerals in the corrosion scales of three pipe systems the m g ratio in the corrosion scales of sp was higher than those of bp and gp indicating that the sp had more stable corrosion scales feco3 and caco3 formation confirmed that an increasing alkalinity and calcium hardness inhibited iron release respectively the sp released less iron than the bp and gp during the whole operation period because of its more stable corrosion scales the δdo was highly consistent with the iron release in all three pipe systems sulfurimonas was dominant in the bp and sp while massilia and azospirillum dominated the bacterial community in the gp the water quality significantly influenced the bacterial community in the three pipe systems to avoid the occurrence of red water a source water switch strategy was proposed based on the difference between local and foreign water qualities for example a full reverse switch is feasible for xuchang city whereas a blending ratio of a local water zbw or zsw to dsw of 0 15 should be adopted for zhengzhou city acknowledgements this study was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51290281 51525806 51408590 and chinese academy of sciences qyzdy

19858,california has one of the largest systems of surface water reservoirs in the world providing irrigation water to california s agriculturally productive central valley irrigation water is recognized as a vehicle for the microbial contamination of raw produce and must be monitored according to new federal regulation the purpose of this study was to further understanding of the variability of fecal indicator bacteria escherichia coli and fecal coliforms and pathogens e coli o157 h7 o157 non o157 shiga toxin producing e coli stec and salmonella along both horizontal and vertical profiles within california reservoirs monthly sampling was conducted in six reservoirs located in the foothills of the western sierra nevada during the summer irrigation season and extreme drought conditions of 2014 n 257 concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria were highly variable between reservoirs p 0 05 and along the horizontal profile p 0 001 from upstream to downstream with higher concentrations typically found outside of the reservoirs than within though many of the reservoirs were thermally stratified bacterial concentrations were not associated with water temperature p 0 05 or any one particular depth strata p 0 05 however prevalence of salmonella and stec 16 70 and 9 70 respectively was higher in the deep strata than in mid or surface layers we found no statistical association between samples collected downstream of reservoirs and those from the reservoirs themselves continued monitoring and modeling of both bacterial indicators and enteric pathogens

pachepsky et al 2011 have escaped regulation and mandatory monitoring however in 2011 the food safety modernization act fsma was passed by congress tasking the us food and drug administration fda with finalizing rules for produce safety and implementing standards for the monitoring of irrigation water supplies usfda 2011 more specifically the final rule mandates testing agricultural water for acceptable levels of generic escherichia coli the geometric mean gm is not to exceed 126 cfu 100 ml and the statistical threshold value stv is not to exceed 410 cfu 100 ml usfda 2011 historically resource agencies have utilized fecal indicator bacteria fib as a surrogate for potentially harmful pathogenic bacteria in public water supplies nevers and whitman 2011 poma et al 2012 usepa 1978 pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella and non o157 h7 shiga toxin producing e coli stec are of particular concern given the regularity of cases following exposure to contaminated water and or consumption of adulterated produce centers for disease control and prevention 2012 however the value of monitoring for fib instead of bacterial pathogens continues to be debated bradshaw et al 2016 busta et al 2003 edge et al 2012 ferguson et al 1996 poma et al 2012 pathogens are often rare in surface waters partyka et al 2016 and tend to be time consuming and expensive to enumerate necessitating an alternative target such as generic e coli for determining the potential human health risk following exposure while new regulation puts the onus on the grower to monitor their individual water supplies the variability of microbial water quality in surface water sources remains poorly understood particularly in moving surface waters frequently utilized in the arid western united states california s central valley cv covers nearly 52 000 km2 of the most productive agricultural region in the world and produces nearly 65 of the state s agricultural output estimated at nearly 20 billion a year it also accounts for nearly 75 of the state s irrigated acreage faunt et al 2016 hanemann et al 2016 much of california is mediterranean in climate with long rainless summers agriculture in the cv relies extensively on surface water for irrigation most of california s surface water originates from snowmelt in the sierra nevada mountains that is eventually impounded by large state and federal water projects in a series of reservoirs hanemann et al 2016 these reservoirs provide not only irrigation water for the cv but also most of the state s hydroelectric power drinking water and water based recreation georgakakos et al 2012 while local and state agencies have a significant role in all aspects of water deliveries with over 400 utilities and hundreds of agricultural water districts hanak and lund 2012 there are no routine bacterial monitoring programs in california s entire 240 reservoir system this study took place at the peak of one of the greatest droughts in california history maestro et al 2016 with record high temperatures and record low precipitation shukla et al 2015 irrigation water supplies always in great demand were of limited availability and potentially of reduced quality as there had been no previous microbiological food safety assessments within the california reservoir system there was growing concern by the agricultural community that water diverted from publically accessible impoundments imposed additional risk to downstream irrigation water supplies bearing these concerns in mind we sought to understand the variability of fib and pathogens in a subset of reservoirs in the cv during the peak of the irrigation season july through october specifically we wanted to examine whether microbiological water quality of irrigation water supplies diverted from reservoir discharge was related to the water quality within the reservoirs and whether reservoir water quality varied by geographical position across horizontal and vertical profiles 2 material and methods 2 1 site description water samples were collected over the course of five months during the summer and fall of 2014 at six managed reservoirs in the western sierra nevada foothills of eastern california n 257 selection of the reservoirs was based on geographical stratification to cover the southern mid and northern sections of the cv specifically we selected lake success ls and lake kaweah lk situated in the southern cv new hogan nh and woodward wr reservoirs located in central cv and camp far west cf and englebright eb reservoirs located in northern cv fig 1 we grouped these reservoirs in pairs for ease of sampling and roughly to duplicate the effect of regional environmental conditions while all reservoirs were created by dammed rivers each had its own unique morphology capacity and relationship to the surrounding landscape table 1 generally as typical of western sierra foothills reservoirs were surrounded by a combination of annual grasslands and oak woodlands much of the surrounding landscape is open to mixed uses including grazing by sheep and cattle all of the reservoirs were open to the public and were frequented by recreators during the study period 2 2 sampling design water samples were collected from each reservoir monthly from june 24th to october 8th in 2014 two volumes were collected 1 l for fib analysis and 20 l for pathogen analysis see section 2 3 below one liter samples were placed on ice in coolers and the 20 l carboys were transported in hard walled bins 204 l with ice both were maintained at 4 10 c until analysis samples taken within the reservoir were collected from a boat explained further below while samples taken outside the reservoir were collected via grab there were four sampling events per reservoir an event consisted of sampling at five horizontal positions hp fig 2 hp0 4 beginning upstream of the reservoir hp0 continuing through the reservoir hp1 3 and ending at the nearest accessible point downstream of the reservoir hp4 the hps within each reservoir were positioned within the historical river channel as determined by a combination of bathymetric maps when available and repeated passes with single beam sonar garmin gpsmap 547xs garmin ltd olathe ks hp1 was placed as near to the top of the reservoir as could be accessed by boat while still allowing for vertical profiling hp2 was placed near the mid point and hp3 near the dam face at a safe distance from the point of water off take the position of horizontal sampling sites was highly reservoir specific fig 1 and dependent upon safe access and adequate flow within the reservoir stratified depth samples were collected at each hp at three vertical positions vp fig 2 inset the first was within the epilimnion or well mixed surface layer vpa the second within the metalimnion or thermocline vpb and the third within the hypolimnion or well mixed bottom layer vpc determination of the vertical sampling depths followed a multi step process at each reservoir site hp1 3 four initial vertical conductivity temperature depth ctd casts were conducted using a sontek ysi castaway ctd yellow springs instruments yellow springs oh attached to a 100 m surveyor s rope keson aurora il these four casts formed the corners of a box that shared similar depth and vertical stratification characteristics allowing for repeated sampling in an area without the use of an anchor a single ctd cast was conducted on subsequent visits to determine the depth of the thermocline and hypolimnion layers for vpb and vpc sampling respectively briefly cast data were immediately uploaded to an onboard laptop and evaluated for the presence of a thermocline or thermal gradient when present samples were collected near the mid point of the gradient the hypolimnion sample was collected at least 2 m deeper than the gradient or at the deepest location possible without disturbing bottom sediments in the absence of a clear thermocline samples were collected below the surface 1 m midpoint of water column and near bottom without disturbing sediments samples for vertical profiles

jackson professional tools camp hill pa the pump was lowered to the desired sampling depth and run long enough to allow approximately 2 the required sample volume 2 21 l to be purged 7 min in addition to water samples in situ physiochemical measurements dissolved oxygen ph conductivity and temperature were taken at all surface sites using a ysi proplus multiparameter instrument yellow springs

concentrated to 500 ml using the ultrafiltration method described by partyka et al 2016 briefly sample water was conveyed via peristaltic pump through a dialyzer filter fresenius medical care na concord ca under pressure to create tangential flow allowing bacteria free water to be discarded and the bacteria laden water to be retained retentate retentates were enriched with irradiated tryptic soy broth pellets 30 g l retentate merck and co kenilworth nj and incubated at 25 c for 2 h followed by 8 h at 42 c with orbital shaking at 100 rpm then held static at 6 c until pathogen specific

statistical analysis descriptive statistics for environmental parameters and concentrations of indicator bacteria along with all statistical models were calculated using stata 14 software statacorp lp microbial indicator counts were log10 transformed prior to parametric analyses to conform with assumptions within group comparisons of environmental categorical and microbiological results were made using anova followed by post estimation using the wald test for linear hypotheses in this study we adhered to a detailed model fitting protocol fully described in partyka et al 2017 briefly we evaluated the data for distribution shape residual correlation structure and autoregressive components prior to examining the presence of multi level effects or interactions we used a combination of criteria for determining best model fits including quasi likelihood under the independence model criterion qic cui 2007 the hausman test and the breusch pagan lm test rabe hesketh and skrondal 2012 and comparisons between a combination of aic score and r2 for final model selection a univariate significance of p 0 10 was used as a threshold for inclusion in preliminary model selection robust variance estimation was then utilized to calculate p values within the finalized models spatial analyses and mapping were performed using arcmap 10 4 esri inc redlands ca 3 results 3 1 environmental

measurable precipitation in any of the study systems greatly reducing any influence of surrounding land uses on subsequent water quality physical and chemical conditions i e air temperature water temperature conductivity ph dissolved oxygen and turbidity varied between all reservoirs at times significantly table s2 some of these differences followed regional trends reservoirs in the central

alkaline of the reservoirs 7 47 8 97 significantly more so p 0 05 than cf eb and lk individually both air and water temperatures were significantly warmer in the southern cv ls and lk than the central cv p 0 01 and p 0 001 respectively though air temperatures cooled significantly as sampling proceeded from the summer into the fall p 0 0000 events 2 4 individually compared to event 1 reservoir temperatures did not show significant cooling from starting conditions until the final sample visit in the early fall of 2014 p 0 05 event 4 compared to event 1 turbidities varied significantly between all reservoirs p 0 0001 except ls and cf and across both horizontal p 0 0001 and vertical strata p 0 0001 with lowest median values found at hp0 for surface samples p 0 05 and vpa for samples within reservoirs p 0 001 3 1 1 thermal stratification clear stratification in water column temperatures was evident in each reservoir at the beginning of the study period with thermocline width maximum depth epilimnion minimum depth hypolimnion ranging from 2 m to 31 5 m μ sd 10 9 8 4 accompanied by changes in temperature from 3 c to 14 c μ sd 7 8 3 6 however fully developed profiles with a distinct epilimnion metalimnion and hypolimnion layers were only measured at sites closest to the dam face hp3 with the exception of eb reservoir that had defined thermoclines at all sites and all visits the other five reservoirs slowly became less stratified with complete loss of the hypolimnion in lk ls and nh by the fourth and final sampling visit even at hp3 fig 3 the impact of reservoir drawdown was seen most clearly at cf where the maximum depth decreased from 40 m to 20 m over the 4 month study yet the minimal temperature of the hypolimnion remained constant 11 5 c camp far west also experienced the steepest thermoclines greatest change in temperature per change in depth averaging 1 39 c per m at hp3 significantly steeper than every other reservoir when averaged across visits

from the source water feeding the reservoirs hp0 and the reservoirs themselves fig s1 median concentrations of ec were 10 times higher at hp0 than surface samples taken within the reservoir hp1 3 table 3 regardless of distance km to hp0 while median fc concentrations were 8 times higher at hp0 than hp1 3 for log transformed ec samples taken downstream of the dam hp4 were also significantly higher p 0 0001 than those taken from hp1 3 and were marginally different from hp0 p 0 0456 the trend in fc was different however with no significant difference found between samples from hp4 and those taken from hp1 3 p 0 05 nor any difference between hp0 samples and hp4 samples p 0 05 fig s1 when averaged across reservoirs log10 fc concentrations did not correlate closely with log10 ec r2 0

while log10 ec results from wr had essentially no association with log10 fc β 0 050 p 0 522 r2 0 009 the variability in the strength of these correlations could result from a combination of different contributing sources variability in the endemic microbial populations and differential die off in the microbial populations over a broad geographic scale average concentrations of log transformed bacteria did not vary significantly p 0 05 between depths vpa c when averaged across all reservoirs table 4 though vertical position did not have an overall effect there were significant differences in microbial indicators across depth strata in nh log10 ec and log10 fc p 0 05 with highest average concentrations at the surface vpa compared to thermocline vpb and hypolimnion vpc samples similarly within cf log transformed concentrations of fc were significantly higher at vpa p 0 001 on average though this was not always the case at each hp or every sampling event 3 2 1 linear regression analysis following preliminary evaluation using our model fitting protocol partyka et al 2017 fib results were best approximated lowest aic highest r2 and smallest residuals using linear regression of the log transformed outcomes separate models were created for surface waters across the entire horizontal profile and samples at all depths within the reservoirs none of the models exhibited fixed or random effects as the result of repeated sampling hausman 0 05 breusch pagan lm 0 05 nor did they show meaningful autoregressive trends and so were best modeled using simple multiple regression methods the final regression model for the horizontal profile included multiple components table 5 including factor variables horizontal position and reservoir a continuous variable ph and an interaction between ph and reservoir fig 4 1 β 0 77 effect size 0 18 in nh wr and ls the three reservoirs with the highest average ph increased ph was associated with a reduction in log10 ec while the opposite relationship was demonstrated in the other three reservoirs for the within reservoir model the width of the thermocline an indication of how abruptly water temperatures changed through the water column was negatively associated with log transformed ec in a univariate evaluation however the shape of the relationship was much more complex within a fully specified model with strong reservoir specific interactions table 6 1 β 0 92 effect size 0 10 for example ls nh and wr showed more or less linear associations between thermocline width and log10 ec yet there appear to be curvilinear associations with thermocline width in cf eb and lk fig 5 as with ec separate models were generated for fc the regression model for surface water samples is similar to that for ec with the replacement of turbidity ntu and dissolved oxygen concentration mg l for ph along with a significant interaction between turbidity and reservoir table s3 1 β 0 75 effect size 0 18 unlike the model for

prevalence of both stec and e coli o157 were too low to find statistical associations and were not modeled 4 discussion many studies have examined the interaction of physical and biological factors that may influence the distribution and abundance of enteric bacteria in surface waters boehm and soller 2013 davis et al 2005 olyphant 2005 partyka et al 2017 with varying degrees of agreement on which factors contribute to the greatest understanding of the variability captured through sampling and the subsequent value of statistical models for making predictions for instance olyphant 2005 found that models incorporating meteorological conditions including wind speed and air temperature were highly successful at predicting bacterial abundance in fresh water lakes of the mid west united states by contrast thoe et al 2015 found that the value of predictive models was highly contingent upon site specific conditions and the overall quality of the water source being modeled further in a detailed study of surface water quality within the california central valley partyka et al 2017 found that the strength and direction of relationships between indicator bacteria and antecedent conditions was highly variable and driven by unmeasured site specific conditions with these challenges in mind we sought to explore the horizontal vertical and temporal trends in microbial water quality within six multi use reservoirs in order to understand the possible risks imposed on downstream irrigation water supplies to our knowledge this is the first published study evaluating three dimensional distribution and abundance of fecal indicator bacteria and bacterial pathogens in multiple california reservoirs alongside source water inflows and outflows we found that regardless of the consistency in our sampling design across all reservoirs each reservoir posed its own unique set of circumstances and challenges to collecting representative samples for example the distance of the inflow sampling location hp0 varied from 3 km at lake kaweah to over 15 km at camp far west fig 1 because of limitations in accessibility though we attempted to control for variability in relative site locations water levels and overall geographies by the inclusion of these characteristics like distance to inflow in our statistical models none remained in the models individually or in combination rather each model retained a term for reservoir that represents many of the differences measured and otherwise inherent in these systems for example models for the horizontal distribution of fib in surface waters retained strong interactions between individual reservoirs and water quality characteristics ph and turbidity indicating that each system may be better understood if modeled independently the horizontal profile from inflow through outflow explained over 90 of the variance in a new hogan specific model a relationship apparent in fig s1 yet was non significant and non informative in a lake success specific model however this disparity was not surprising given lake success continually defied analysis we also sought to understand the role vertical stratification played in harboring bacterial pathogens during hot dry california summers thermal stratification can have important implications for planktonic succession fisheries management and the quality of the water within multi use reservoirs borics et al 2015 szelag wasielewska et al 2015 yu et al 2014a many waterborne bacteria are capable of utilizing a wide range of organic substances during anaerobic respiration therefore facultative anaerobes like fecal indicator bacteria and the pathogens studied here could contribute to an increase in released nutrients during hypoxic conditions typical of the hypolimnion yu et al 2014a 2014b while we lacked the instrumentation to collect physical chemical characteristics other than temperature and conductivity below the epilimnion other studies have found that temperature do and ph are lower in the hypolimnion during periods of stratification davis et al 2005 north et al 2014 yu et al 2014a conditions that typically favor bacterial persistence if not growth based on these suppositions we expected to see clear differences in bacterial concentrations and pathogen occurrence across depth strata when vertical stratification was detected surprisingly while there was clear stratification within all reservoirs at some point in space and time during the study there was no clear statistical association between sample depth presence of stratification or sample temperature on concentration of fecal indicator bacteria within the study reservoirs though not significant fib concentrations were actually generally lower at depth than at the surface contrary to our prediction the width of the thermocline m a measure of the separation between the epilimnion and hypolimnion was weakly predictive of both indicators however this relationship was highly variable across reservoirs fig 5 it also remains difficult to explain biologically since sites with narrower thermoclines tended to also have the greatest difference in fib between individual strata vpa c liu et al 2016 found decreased microbial abundances with depth in vertically stratified lakes of the tibetan plateau decreases that were associated with increases in microbial diversity it is possible that the same processes were taking place within our study reservoirs however we failed to capture them when we selected for our study organisms ones not originating from the aquatic environment and in direct competition with endemic species menon et al 2003 surprisingly pathogen occurrence within the reservoirs was not predictive of pathogen detection in downstream samples hp4 on the contrary the majority of samples testing positive for any pathogen were found within the reservoirs and largely in the deeper strata table 4 this trend does seem to be in line with our hypothesis mentioned above increased persistence in the protective deep water layers since it is unlikely that pathogens are being sourced at depth englebright the reservoir with the highest prevalence of salmonella also had the largest drainage area land area inclusive of streams creeks or rivers that flow into a reservoir a relatively small overall capacity the deepest average depths and consistent thermal stratification perhaps this allowed for increased loading in source river from the surrounding landscape followed by rapid submersion in the reservoir similar to processes described by hoyer et al 2015 for pathogen distribution in lake tahoe reduced downstream prevalence of pathogens in surface water samples from all reservoirs may be a result of rapid exposure to sunlight and increased oxygenation during a highly turbulent discharge however fib concentrations in the reservoirs were not related to bacterial levels in water supplies downstream of the reservoir perhaps indicating that either additional sources are contributing to the water quality in a short distance between dam face and sample site or the turbulent flow generated from water release somehow disrupts or disturbs buried sources near the discharge intakes this project took place during the summer of 2014 in the midst of one of the deepest droughts that california has ever experienced maestro et al 2016 and prior to the enactment of strict water conservation legislation passed during 2015 some reservoirs in california had been cut off from the rivers that feed them and many reservoir levels fell well below half of their historical averages table 1 reservoir specific differences observed in this study may have been driven hydrological differences ca department of water resources 2014 intensity of recreational use sierra nevada alliance 2006 or even concentrations of domestic wild animals forced to use the reservoirs as nearby streams began to disappear moreover drought conditions along with rising atmospheric temperatures and anticipated increases in extreme drought events followed by heavier than normal storms conditions are likely to impact management of valuable and vulnerable surface water supplies reservoirs regardless of geographical location or surrounding land uses may harbor bacterial pathogens monitoring for fecal indicator bacteria is unlikely to lead to better understanding of the risks associated with these water sources as evidenced by the absence of a correlation between regulatory exceedances and pathogen prevalence in this and similar studies continued monitoring and modeling of not only bacterial indicators but enteric pathogens is critical to our ability to estimate the risk of exposure to surface water supplies and make appropriate management decisions pachepsky et al 2014 partyka et al 2017 particularly when humans may come into direct contact with water supplies through drinking water recreation or consumption of irrigated produce 5 conclusions concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria were highly variable across space and time with riverine samples taken from above and below the impoundments generally higher than samples from within reservoirs dissolved oxygen turbidity and ph were the only environmental variables that showed association with bacterial concentrations thermal stratification was documented within all reservoirs on at least one occasion however as the summer progressed and water levels dropped many of the reservoirs became more uniformly mixed bacterial concentrations were not associated with any one particular water layer prevalence of salmonella and non o157 stec was highest in reservoirs with the lowest overall concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria however salmonella occurrence was best modeled with the inclusion of log10 transformed e coli concentrations microbial water quality in downstream irrigation supplies was not statistically associated with the conditions within the source reservoir and more closely resembles water quality upstream of reservoirs suggesting effective monitoring of irrigation supplies needs to be conducted downstream of impoundments nearer the

19858,california has one of the largest systems of surface water reservoirs in the world providing irrigation water to california s agriculturally productive central valley irrigation water is recognized as a vehicle for the microbial contamination of raw produce and must be monitored according to new federal regulation the purpose of this study was to further understanding of the variability of fecal indicator bacteria escherichia coli and fecal coliforms and pathogens e coli o157 h7 o157 non o157 shiga toxin producing e coli stec and salmonella along both horizontal and vertical profiles within california reservoirs monthly sampling was conducted in six reservoirs located in the foothills of the western sierra nevada during the summer irrigation season and extreme drought conditions of 2014 n 257 concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria were highly variable between reservoirs p 0 05 and along the horizontal profile p 0 001 from upstream to downstream with higher concentrations typically found outside of the reservoirs than within though many of the reservoirs were thermally stratified bacterial concentrations were not associated with water temperature p 0 05 or any one particular depth strata p 0 05 however prevalence of salmonella and stec 16 70 and 9 70 respectively was higher in the deep strata than in mid or surface layers we found no statistical association between samples collected downstream of reservoirs and those from the reservoirs themselves continued monitoring and modeling of both bacterial indicators and enteric pathogens

pachepsky et al 2011 have escaped regulation and mandatory monitoring however in 2011 the food safety modernization act fsma was passed by congress tasking the us food and drug administration fda with finalizing rules for produce safety and implementing standards for the monitoring of irrigation water supplies usfda 2011 more specifically the final rule mandates testing agricultural water for acceptable levels of generic escherichia coli the geometric mean gm is not to exceed 126 cfu 100 ml and the statistical threshold value stv is not to exceed 410 cfu 100 ml usfda 2011 historically resource agencies have utilized fecal indicator bacteria fib as a surrogate for potentially harmful pathogenic bacteria in public water supplies nevers and whitman 2011 poma et al 2012 usepa 1978 pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella and non o157 h7 shiga toxin producing e coli stec are of particular concern given the regularity of cases following exposure to contaminated water and or consumption of adulterated produce centers for disease control and prevention 2012 however the value of monitoring for fib instead of bacterial pathogens continues to be debated bradshaw et al 2016 busta et al 2003 edge et al 2012 ferguson et al 1996 poma et al 2012 pathogens are often rare in surface waters partyka et al 2016 and tend to be time consuming and expensive to enumerate necessitating an alternative target such as generic e coli for determining the potential human health risk following exposure while new regulation puts the onus on the grower to monitor their individual water supplies the variability of microbial water quality in surface water sources remains poorly understood particularly in moving surface waters frequently utilized in the arid western united states california s central valley cv covers nearly 52 000 km2 of the most productive agricultural region in the world and produces nearly 65 of the state s agricultural output estimated at nearly 20 billion a year it also accounts for nearly 75 of the state s irrigated acreage faunt et al 2016 hanemann et al 2016 much of california is mediterranean in climate with long rainless summers agriculture in the cv relies extensively on surface water for irrigation most of california s surface water originates from snowmelt in the sierra nevada mountains that is eventually impounded by large state and federal water projects in a series of reservoirs hanemann et al 2016 these reservoirs provide not only irrigation water for the cv but also most of the state s hydroelectric power drinking water and water based recreation georgakakos et al 2012 while local and state agencies have a significant role in all aspects of water deliveries with over 400 utilities and hundreds of agricultural water districts hanak and lund 2012 there are no routine bacterial monitoring programs in california s entire 240 reservoir system this study took place at the peak of one of the greatest droughts in california history maestro et al 2016 with record high temperatures and record low precipitation shukla et al 2015 irrigation water supplies always in great demand were of limited availability and potentially of reduced quality as there had been no previous microbiological food safety assessments within the california reservoir system there was growing concern by the agricultural community that water diverted from publically accessible impoundments imposed additional risk to downstream irrigation water supplies bearing these concerns in mind we sought to understand the variability of fib and pathogens in a subset of reservoirs in the cv during the peak of the irrigation season july through october specifically we wanted to examine whether microbiological water quality of irrigation water supplies diverted from reservoir discharge was related to the water quality within the reservoirs and whether reservoir water quality varied by geographical position across horizontal and vertical profiles 2 material and methods 2 1 site description water samples were collected over the course of five months during the summer and fall of 2014 at six managed reservoirs in the western sierra nevada foothills of eastern california n 257 selection of the reservoirs was based on geographical stratification to cover the southern mid and northern sections of the cv specifically we selected lake success ls and lake kaweah lk situated in the southern cv new hogan nh and woodward wr reservoirs located in central cv and camp far west cf and englebright eb reservoirs located in northern cv fig 1 we grouped these reservoirs in pairs for ease of sampling and roughly to duplicate the effect of regional environmental conditions while all reservoirs were created by dammed rivers each had its own unique morphology capacity and relationship to the surrounding landscape table 1 generally as typical of western sierra foothills reservoirs were surrounded by a combination of annual grasslands and oak woodlands much of the surrounding landscape is open to mixed uses including grazing by sheep and cattle all of the reservoirs were open to the public and were frequented by recreators during the study period 2 2 sampling design water samples were collected from each reservoir monthly from june 24th to october 8th in 2014 two volumes were collected 1 l for fib analysis and 20 l for pathogen analysis see section 2 3 below one liter samples were placed on ice in coolers and the 20 l carboys were transported in hard walled bins 204 l with ice both were maintained at 4 10 c until analysis samples taken within the reservoir were collected from a boat explained further below while samples taken outside the reservoir were collected via grab there were four sampling events per reservoir an event consisted of sampling at five horizontal positions hp fig 2 hp0 4 beginning upstream of the reservoir hp0 continuing through the reservoir hp1 3 and ending at the nearest accessible point downstream of the reservoir hp4 the hps within each reservoir were positioned within the historical river channel as determined by a combination of bathymetric maps when available and repeated passes with single beam sonar garmin gpsmap 547xs garmin ltd olathe ks hp1 was placed as near to the top of the reservoir as could be accessed by boat while still allowing for vertical profiling hp2 was placed near the mid point and hp3 near the dam face at a safe distance from the point of water off take the position of horizontal sampling sites was highly reservoir specific fig 1 and dependent upon safe access and adequate flow within the reservoir stratified depth samples were collected at each hp at three vertical positions vp fig 2 inset the first was within the epilimnion or well mixed surface layer vpa the second within the metalimnion or thermocline vpb and the third within the hypolimnion or well mixed bottom layer vpc determination of the vertical sampling depths followed a multi step process at each reservoir site hp1 3 four initial vertical conductivity temperature depth ctd casts were conducted using a sontek ysi castaway ctd yellow springs instruments yellow springs oh attached to a 100 m surveyor s rope keson aurora il these four casts formed the corners of a box that shared similar depth and vertical stratification characteristics allowing for repeated sampling in an area without the use of an anchor a single ctd cast was conducted on subsequent visits to determine the depth of the thermocline and hypolimnion layers for vpb and vpc sampling respectively briefly cast data were immediately uploaded to an onboard laptop and evaluated for the presence of a thermocline or thermal gradient when present samples were collected near the mid point of the gradient the hypolimnion sample was collected at least 2 m deeper than the gradient or at the deepest location possible without disturbing bottom sediments in the absence of a clear thermocline samples were collected below the surface 1 m midpoint of water column and near bottom without disturbing sediments samples for vertical profiles

to water samples in situ physiochemical measurements dissolved oxygen ph conductivity and temperature were taken at all surface sites using a ysi proplus multiparameter instrument yellow springs

concentrated to 500 ml using the ultrafiltration method described by partyka et al 2016 briefly sample water was conveyed via peristaltic pump through a dialyzer filter fresenius medical care na

statistical analysis descriptive statistics for environmental parameters and concentrations of indicator bacteria along with all statistical models were calculated using stata 14 software statacorp lp microbial indicator counts were log10 transformed prior to parametric analyses to conform with assumptions within group comparisons of environmental categorical and microbiological results were made using anova followed by post estimation using the wald test for linear hypotheses in this study we adhered to a detailed model fitting protocol fully described in partyka et al 2017 briefly we evaluated the data for distribution shape residual correlation structure and autoregressive components prior to examining the presence of multi level effects or interactions we used a combination of criteria for determining best model fits including quasi likelihood under the independence model criterion qic cui 2007 the hausman test and the breusch pagan lm test rabe hesketh and skrondal 2012 and comparisons between a combination of aic score and r2 for final model selection a univariate significance of p 0 10 was used as a threshold for inclusion in preliminary model selection robust variance estimation was then utilized to calculate p values within the finalized models spatial analyses and mapping were performed using arcmap 10 4 esri inc redlands ca 3 results 3 1 environmental

and ls experienced significant p 0 05 reductions in volume capacity by the end of the study period depths within eb remained the most consistent throughout table 1 during the study period there was no measurable precipitation in any of the study systems greatly reducing any influence of surrounding land uses on subsequent water quality physical and chemical conditions i e air temperature water temperature conductivity ph dissolved oxygen and turbidity varied between all reservoirs at times significantly table s2 some of these differences followed regional trends reservoirs in the central

alkaline of the reservoirs 7 47 8 97 significantly more so p 0 05 than cf eb and lk individually both air and water temperatures were significantly warmer in the southern cv ls and lk than the central cv p 0 01 and p 0 001 respectively though air temperatures cooled significantly as sampling proceeded from the summer into the fall p 0 0000 events 2 4 individually compared to event 1 reservoir temperatures did not show significant cooling from starting conditions until the final sample visit in the early fall of 2014 p 0 05 event 4 compared to event 1 turbidities varied significantly between all reservoirs p 0 0001 except ls and cf and across both horizontal p 0 0001 and vertical strata p 0 0001 with lowest median values found at hp0 for surface samples p 0 05 and vpa for samples within reservoirs p 0 001 3 1 1 thermal stratification clear stratification in water column temperatures was evident in each reservoir at the beginning of the study period with thermocline width maximum depth epilimnion minimum depth hypolimnion ranging from 2 m to 31 5 m μ sd 10 9 8 4 accompanied by changes in temperature from 3 c to 14 c μ sd 7 8 3 6 however fully developed profiles with a distinct epilimnion metalimnion and hypolimnion layers were only measured at sites closest to the dam face hp3 with the exception of eb reservoir that had defined thermoclines at all sites and all visits the other five reservoirs slowly became less stratified with complete loss of the hypolimnion in lk ls and nh by the fourth and final sampling visit even at hp3 fig 3 the impact of reservoir drawdown was seen most clearly at cf where the maximum depth decreased from 40 m to 20 m over the 4 month study yet the minimal temperature of the hypolimnion remained constant 11 5 c camp far west also experienced the steepest thermoclines greatest change in temperature per change in depth averaging 1 39 c per m at hp3 significantly steeper than every other reservoir when averaged across visits

001 log10 fc p 0 0001 median ec concentrations were greatest in cf and wr reservoirs while highest median fc concentrations were found at lk ls and wr clear differences also existed between samples from the source water feeding the reservoirs hp0 and the reservoirs themselves fig s1 median concentrations of ec were 10 times higher at hp0 than surface samples taken within the reservoir hp1 3 table 3 regardless of distance km to hp0 while median fc concentrations were 8 times higher at hp0 than hp1 3 for log transformed ec samples taken downstream of the dam hp4 were also significantly higher p 0 0001 than those taken from hp1 3 and were marginally different from hp0 p 0 0456 the trend in fc was different however with no significant difference found between samples from hp4 and those taken from hp1 3 p 0 05 nor any difference between hp0 samples and hp4 samples p 0 05 fig s1 when averaged across reservoirs log10 fc concentrations did not correlate closely with log10 ec r2 0 05 however stronger correlations were apparent on a reservoir by reservoir basis for example log10 ec concentrations from nh had a nearly one to one relationship with log10 fc β 1 011 p 0 0001 r2 0 39 while log10 ec results from wr had essentially no association with log10 fc β 0 050 p 0 522 r2 0 009 the variability in the strength of these correlations could result from a combination of different contributing sources variability in the endemic microbial populations and differential die off in the microbial populations over a broad geographic scale average concentrations of log transformed bacteria did not vary significantly p 0 05 between depths vpa c when averaged across all reservoirs table 4 though vertical position did not have an overall effect there were significant differences in microbial indicators across depth strata in nh log10 ec and log10 fc p 0 05 with highest average concentrations at the surface vpa compared to thermocline vpb and hypolimnion vpc samples similarly within cf log transformed concentrations of fc were significantly higher at vpa p 0 001 on average though this was not always the case at each hp or every sampling event 3 2 1 linear regression analysis following preliminary evaluation using our model fitting protocol partyka et al 2017 fib results were best approximated lowest aic highest r2 and smallest residuals using linear regression of the log transformed outcomes separate models were created for surface waters across the entire horizontal profile and samples at all depths within the reservoirs none of the models exhibited fixed or random effects as the result of repeated sampling hausman 0 05 breusch pagan lm 0 05 nor did they show meaningful autoregressive trends and so were best modeled using simple multiple regression methods the final regression model for the horizontal profile included multiple components table 5 including factor variables horizontal position and reservoir a continuous variable ph and an interaction between ph and reservoir fig 4 1 β 0 77 effect size 0 18 in nh wr and ls the three reservoirs with the highest average ph increased ph was associated with a reduction in log10 ec while the opposite relationship was demonstrated in the other three reservoirs for the within reservoir model the width of the thermocline an indication of how abruptly water temperatures changed through the water column was negatively associated with log transformed ec in a univariate evaluation however the shape of the relationship was much more complex within a fully specified model with strong reservoir specific interactions table 6 1 β 0 92 effect size 0 10 for example ls nh and wr showed more or less linear associations between thermocline width and log10 ec yet there appear to be curvilinear associations with thermocline width in cf eb and lk fig 5 as with ec separate models were generated for fc the regression model for surface water samples is similar to that for ec with the replacement of turbidity ntu and dissolved oxygen concentration mg l for ph along with a significant interaction between turbidity and reservoir table s3 1 β 0 75 effect size 0 18 unlike the model for ec log10 fc within reservoir showed a seasonal component with each subsequent sampling event exhibiting lower concentrations p 0 001 than the first event table s4 1 β 0 87 effect size 0 10 3 3 pathogens all samples were analyzed for the presence of salmonella e coli o157 h7 o157 and non o157 shiga toxin producing e coli stec presumptive stec isolates were further analyzed for specific serotype o45 o145 o103 o111 o121 or o26 and presence of genes associated with virulence and or toxin production stx1 stx2 hyla and eae of the 257 samples collected during this study over 26 tested positive for salmonella 67 257 9 were positive for stec 23 257 and only 1 3 257 of samples were positive for o157 the most common stec serotypes were o26 and o103 each with 17 representation amongst the stec positive samples 4 23 of the samples that were positive for stec a majority n 9 were not differentiated into one of the seven serotypes evaluated by our assay but did contain at least one of the virulence factors associated with pathogenicity in e coli pathogen prevalence did not mirror indicator results occurrence of salmonella in eb was significantly higher than all other reservoirs p 0 01 table 2 while also having the second lowest overall ec concentration of all reservoirs similarly wr had the lowest median fib concentrations but had the highest occurrence of stec positives 35 8 23 for all pathogens a greater percentage of positive results came from samples within the reservoirs hp1 3 salmonella 54 36 57 stec 75 12 16 and o157 66 2 3 than from source hp0 or discharge hp4 samples table 3 within the reservoirs a higher proportion of both salmonella and stec positives were found in samples from the bottom of the water column vpc 44 and 50 respectively than the other two depths table 4 though this distinction was not significant p 0 05 when evaluating surface water samples alone an entirely different trend is seen the highest occurrence of all pathogens were found outside of the reservoir hp0 or hp4 this further indicates the importance of understanding which layers of water are being diverted from dams based on their operation and engineering and of monitoring different depth strata when assessing the risk to human health 3 3 1 logistic regression analysis logistic regression was used to model the binary pathogen outcomes a positive or negative pcr result all reservoirs were significantly less likely p 0 01 o r 0 04 0 13 to test positive for salmonella than samples taken from eb when accounting for differences in reservoirs log10 ec was significantly p 0 01 associated with an increased probability of testing positive for salmonella table 7 fig 6 according to the model for every one log increase in ec the odds of a sample testing positive for salmonella increased more than 2 fold o r 2 1 however the majority of samples testing positive for salmonella had log10 ec concentrations at or below 1 or 10 cfu 100 ml 72 48 67 no other environmental or physical attribute was capable of explaining additional variability in salmonella prevalence including sampling depth sample temperature sampling visit or location within the reservoir the prevalence of both stec and e coli o157 were too low to find statistical associations and were not modeled 4 discussion many studies have examined the interaction of physical and biological factors that may influence the distribution and abundance of enteric bacteria in surface waters boehm and soller 2013 davis et al 2005 olyphant 2005 partyka et al 2017 with varying degrees of agreement on which factors contribute to the greatest understanding of the variability captured through sampling and the subsequent value of statistical models for making predictions for instance olyphant 2005 found that models incorporating meteorological conditions including wind speed and air temperature were highly successful at predicting bacterial abundance in fresh water lakes of the mid west united states by contrast thoe et al 2015 found that the value of predictive models was highly contingent upon site specific conditions and the overall quality of the water source being modeled further in a detailed study of surface water quality within the california central valley partyka et al 2017 found that the strength and direction of relationships between indicator bacteria and antecedent conditions was highly variable and driven by unmeasured site specific conditions with these challenges in mind we sought to explore the horizontal vertical and temporal trends in microbial water quality within six multi use reservoirs in order to understand the possible risks imposed on downstream irrigation water supplies to our knowledge this is the first published study evaluating three dimensional distribution and abundance of fecal indicator bacteria and bacterial pathogens in multiple california reservoirs alongside source water inflows and outflows we found that regardless of the consistency in our sampling design across all reservoirs each reservoir posed its own unique set of circumstances and challenges to collecting representative samples for example the distance of the inflow sampling location hp0 varied from 3 km at lake kaweah to over 15 km at camp far west fig 1 because of limitations in accessibility though we attempted to control for variability in relative site locations water levels and overall geographies by the inclusion of these characteristics like distance to inflow in our statistical models none remained in the models individually or in combination rather each model retained a term for reservoir that represents many of the differences measured and otherwise inherent in these systems for example models for the horizontal distribution of fib in surface waters retained strong interactions between individual reservoirs and water quality characteristics ph and turbidity indicating that each system may be better understood if modeled independently the horizontal profile from inflow through outflow explained over 90 of the variance in a new hogan specific model a relationship apparent in fig s1 yet was non significant and non informative in a lake success specific model however this disparity was not surprising given lake success continually defied analysis we also sought to understand the role vertical stratification played in harboring bacterial pathogens during hot dry california summers thermal stratification can have important implications for planktonic succession fisheries management and the quality of the water within multi use reservoirs borics et al 2015 szelag wasielewska et al 2015 yu et al 2014a many waterborne bacteria are capable of utilizing a wide range of organic substances during anaerobic respiration therefore facultative anaerobes like fecal indicator bacteria and the pathogens studied here could contribute to an increase in released nutrients during hypoxic conditions typical of the hypolimnion yu et al 2014a 2014b while we lacked the instrumentation to collect physical chemical characteristics other than temperature and conductivity below the epilimnion other studies have found that temperature do and ph are lower in the hypolimnion during periods of stratification davis et al 2005 north et al 2014 yu et al 2014a conditions that typically favor bacterial persistence if not growth based on these suppositions we expected to see clear differences in bacterial concentrations and pathogen occurrence across depth strata when vertical stratification was detected surprisingly while there was clear stratification within all reservoirs at some point in space and time during the study there was no clear statistical association between sample depth presence of stratification or sample temperature on concentration of fecal indicator bacteria within the study reservoirs though not significant fib concentrations were actually generally lower at depth than at the surface contrary to our prediction the width of the thermocline m a measure of the separation between the epilimnion and hypolimnion was weakly predictive of both indicators however this relationship was highly variable across reservoirs fig 5 it also remains difficult to explain biologically since sites with narrower thermoclines tended to also have the greatest difference in fib between individual strata vpa c liu et al 2016 found decreased microbial abundances with depth in vertically stratified lakes of the tibetan plateau decreases that were associated with increases in microbial diversity it is possible that the same processes were taking place within our study reservoirs however we failed to capture them when we selected for our study organisms ones not originating from the aquatic environment and in direct competition with endemic species menon et al 2003 surprisingly pathogen occurrence within the reservoirs was not predictive of pathogen detection in downstream samples hp4 on the contrary the majority of samples testing positive for any pathogen were found within the reservoirs and largely in the deeper strata table 4 this trend does seem to be in line with our hypothesis mentioned above increased persistence in the protective deep water layers since it is unlikely that pathogens are being sourced at depth englebright the reservoir with the highest prevalence of salmonella also had the largest drainage area land area inclusive of streams creeks or rivers that flow into a reservoir a relatively small overall capacity the deepest average depths and consistent thermal stratification perhaps this allowed for increased loading in source river from the surrounding landscape followed by rapid submersion in the reservoir similar to processes described by hoyer et al 2015 for pathogen distribution in lake tahoe reduced downstream prevalence of pathogens in surface water samples from all reservoirs may be a result of rapid exposure to sunlight and increased oxygenation during a highly turbulent discharge however fib concentrations in the reservoirs were not related to bacterial levels in water supplies downstream of the reservoir perhaps indicating that either additional sources are contributing to the water quality in a short distance between dam face and sample site or the turbulent flow generated from water release somehow disrupts or disturbs buried sources near the discharge intakes this project took place during the summer of 2014 in the midst of one of the deepest droughts that california has ever experienced maestro et al 2016 and prior to the enactment of strict water conservation legislation passed during 2015 some reservoirs in california had been cut off from the rivers that feed them and many reservoir levels fell well below half of their historical averages table 1 reservoir specific differences observed in this study may have been driven hydrological differences ca department of water resources 2014 intensity of recreational use sierra nevada alliance 2006 or even concentrations of domestic wild animals forced to use the reservoirs as nearby streams began to disappear moreover drought conditions along with rising atmospheric temperatures and anticipated increases in extreme drought events followed by heavier than normal storms conditions are likely to impact management of valuable and vulnerable surface water supplies reservoirs regardless of geographical location or surrounding land uses may harbor bacterial pathogens monitoring for fecal indicator bacteria is unlikely to lead to better understanding of the risks associated with these water sources as evidenced by the absence of a correlation between regulatory exceedances and pathogen prevalence in this and similar studies continued monitoring and modeling of not only bacterial indicators but enteric pathogens is critical to our ability to estimate the risk of exposure to surface water supplies and make appropriate management decisions pachepsky et al 2014 partyka et al 2017 particularly when humans may come into direct contact with water supplies through drinking water recreation or consumption of irrigated produce 5 conclusions concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria were highly variable across space and time with riverine samples taken from above and below the impoundments generally higher than samples from within reservoirs dissolved oxygen turbidity and ph were the only environmental variables that showed association with bacterial concentrations thermal stratification was documented within all reservoirs on at least one occasion however as the summer progressed and water levels dropped many of the reservoirs became more uniformly mixed bacterial concentrations were not associated with any one particular water layer prevalence of salmonella and non o157 stec was highest in reservoirs with the lowest overall concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria however salmonella occurrence was best modeled with the inclusion of log10 transformed e coli concentrations microbial water quality in downstream irrigation supplies was not statistically associated with the conditions within the source reservoir and more closely resembles water quality upstream of reservoirs suggesting effective monitoring of irrigation supplies needs to be conducted downstream of impoundments nearer the

shale gas produced water sgpw treatment imposes greater technical challenges because of its high concentration of various contaminants membrane distillation crystallization mdc has a great potential to manage sgpw since it is capable of recovering both water and minerals at high rates up to near a zero liquid discharge zld condition to evaluate the feasibility of mdc for sgpw treatment mdc performance indicators such as water recovery rate solid production rate spr and specific energy consumption sec were systematically investigated to our knowledge for the first time by using actual sgpw from eagle ford shale usa the main operating parameters including feed cross flow velocity cfv and crystallization temperature tcr were optimized by performing a series of mdc experiments the results reported that water and minerals were effectively recovered with 84 of recovery rate and 2 72 kg m2day of spr under respective optimal operating conditions furthermore the scale mechanism was firstly identified as limiting factor for mdc performance degradation lastly sec of mdc was estimated to be as low as 28 2 kwh m3 under ideal optimal operating conditions our experimental observations demonstrated that mdc could sustainably and effectively recover water and mineral with low energy consumption from sgpw by optimizing operating condition graphical abstract image keywords shale gas produced water sgpw membrane distillation crystallization mdc zero liquid discharge zld water production mineral recovery energy consumption 1 introduction the global water shortage is one of the biggest challenges humans face primarily due to climate change in recent years water reuse has emerged as the most economically viable and environmentally friendly solution to this crisis rasul et al 2006 liu et al 2012 furthermore the concept of zero liquid discharge zld has been adopted by industrial waste management not only to recycle wastewater but also to recover precious resources from it pérez gonzález et al 2012 tong and elimelech 2016 such a new strategy could be applied to the newly rising shale gas and oil industry administration and kuuskraa 2011 shaffer et al 2013 the extraction of shale gas and oil using a hydraulic fracturing produces large amounts of aqueous waste often called shale gas produced water sgpw that can pose serious environmental risks the current trend of sgpw management has focused on the increase of its internal reuse for resolving economic and environmental issues however the discharge of sgpw into the environment imposes much greater technical challenges because of ever increasingly stringent environmental regulations sgpw typically contains high concentrations of mineral and organic constituents dissolved from shale formations as well as chemicals used for shale gas and oil extraction gregory et al 2011 vidic et al 2013 various processes such as thermal evaporation and mechanical vapor compression have been proposed and developed for sgpw reuse and treatment however the main drawbacks associated with them including high cost large footprint and the use of toxic chemicals have hampered their applications recently membrane processes have been examined as promising options because of their superior applicability and cost effectiveness alkhudhiri et al 2013 macedonio et al 2014 the membrane processes newly developed for sgpw management include membrane distillation md mcginnis et al 2013 md technology can be further integrated with crystallization and thus offer an attractive technical advancement suitable for spgw management specifically such a membrane distillation crystallization mdc process can desalinate highly concentrated minerals produce high quality treated water recover valuable minerals from sgpw and possibly utilize the inherent geothermal heat of sgpw kim et al 2017 mdc technology could achieve even a zld requirement if necessary however mdc is still an immature technology and research into it remains at a basic level based on an extensive literature review it can be concluded that the existing mdc studies suffered greatly from critical deficiencies in i evaluation of fundamental performance indicators ii optimization of operating parameters iii analysis of scaling mechanisms and iv estimation of energy consumption furthermore real application studies are rarely found in the current literature previous mdc studies have focused on two objectives mineral recovery and production and high salinity water treatment possibly achieving zld as summarized in table 1 most mdc studies were performed using synthetic solutions such as nacl edwie and chung 2013 chen et al 2014 rather than investigating various real water resources including industrial wastewaters julian et al 2016 due to a lack of knowledge and experience with this process critical operating conditions were not fundamentally evaluated and systematically optimized according feed water characteristics moreover the scaling issue which is the key problem for actual operation has not been sufficiently considered and addressed lastly few studies have evaluated energy consumption in the mdc process even though the mdc process relies on a heat source as its driving force kim et al 2017 therefore it is of paramount importance to elucidate and optimize the critical factors affecting the mdc process and to analyze its energy consumption for real applications this paper presents our efforts to develop mdc technology for spgw management which would be the first mdc application study using real industrial wastewaters specifically the objective of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of the mdc process for water and mineral recovery from sgpw under various operating conditions the mdc process was systematically assessed not only by monitoring md performance including water productivity and contaminant removal but also by elucidating fundamental crystallization mechanisms including growth nucleation and solid production rates specific energy consumption sec was also estimated to determine the economic viability of the mdc the scaling mechanism in mdc process was elucidated and delineated as a limiting factor lastly the main operating parameters i e feed cross flow velocity cfv and temperature of crystallization tcr were optimized to determine the technological applicability of mdc to sgpw management in view of water and mineral production as well as energy consumption 2 material and methods 2 1 shale gas produced water sgpw the composition of sgpw is complicated varying from well to well it mainly consists of chemical additives for fracturing dissolved salts from shale formation and solid particles the sgpw sample used in this study was collected from multi wells being drilled in the eagle ford shale formation which is one of the major shale plays in the usa sgpw collected from the eagle ford shale in texas by truck was used in this study the water quality characteristics of the sgpw are summarized in table 2 the sgpw fed to mdc was prepared by an mf pretreatment with a pes membrane of 150 kda for the following mdc experiments 2 2 membrane distillation crystallization mdc experiments mdc experiments were carried out using the unit shown in fig 1 for all mdc experiments 10 l of sgpw pretreated by mf was prepared at a typical sgpw temperature i e 60 1 0 c while the 4 l of permeate water was cool deionized water retained at 20 1 0 c by thermostatic bath kim et al 2017 the pretreated sgpw was circulated by pump from the crystallizer into the membrane module and returned to the crystallizer additionally the permeate was circulated between the permeate reservoir and membrane module to evaluate the performance of mdc under different operating conditions the feed cfv was controlled at 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m s and tcr was set at 30 40 and 50 c the permeate flux and conductivity were continuously monitored to estimate water productivity and quality using electrical balance and a conductivity meter hach hq40d respectively the crystallizer had an internal stirrer constantly rotating at 100 rpm 2 2 1 md membrane and module hydrophobic hollow fiber membranes accurel pp s6 2 membrana gmbh made of polypropylene pp were employed in the study the principal characteristics of the hollow fiber membranes as specified by the manufacturer were the pore size with maximum and nominal diameters of 0 55 and 0 22 μm respectively and a porosity of 72 the acrylic membrane module was equipped with 45 hollow fibers with a total membrane area of 0 12 m2 2 2 2 characterization of the crystal formation the growth g and nucleation b rates of the formed crystals in the mdc process were calculated to evaluate the productivity of crystal formation

methodology for energy calculation in the mdc process some assumptions are made as follows naidu et al 2014 eleiwi and laleg kirati 2016 1 the temperature of the feed and permeate solutions inside the modules is kept at a constant 2 the energy required for agitation and the heat energy from crystallization in the crystallizer is neglected 3 the heat capacity of solutions is kept at a constant 4 the pressure drop through pipelines and modules is negligible despite these simplifying assumptions especially the ignoring of the heat loss inside the modules this approach can provide approximate energy consumption according to operating conditions energy consumption in a mdc system includes the thermal energy to heat up and cool down the feed along with the electrical energy to operate the circulation pumps we assumed that no energy was needed to cool down the permeate stream due to the fact that i no heat loss across the module is assumed ii unnoticeable changes of temperature between inlet and outlet module were found during the lab scale tests and iii the heated up distillate stream is a very small part of the total water volume for fracturing in the shale gas industry and hence cannot heat a massive amount of fracturing water in the reservoir epa 2015 7 e t o t a l w e e e t where ee is the electrical energy to operate the circulation pumps and et is the thermal energy necessary to heat up the feed from the crystal reactor tank and to cool down the md brine from the membrane module the required electrical energy of the circulation pumps is calculated as 8 e e e f f i c i e n c y δ p q where delta p is the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet of the circulation pump and q is the volumetric feed flow rate in this study the feed and permeate were

crystallization temperature on water productivity sgpw is extremely difficult to treat and discharge due to its high concentration of various toxic components which can adversely affect human health and the environment therefore it is essential to select a suitable sgpw management option such as the mdc process to achieve the near zld goal in this section the performance of mdc was firstly evaluated in terms of water production from sgpw two main operating parameters i e feed cfv and tcr were investigated to elucidate the critical factors affecting the total water recovery rate tcr was firstly examined to evaluate its effect on mdc s water productivity in fig 2 various tcr conditions were investigated based on process performance with the fixed feed cfv initial flux was identical at 2 5 lmh for all ranges of tcr and sustained with permeate conductivity at 10 μs cm tcr did not affect the initial water flux as shown in fig 2a flux decline occurred after 1500 min of experiment time and delayed as decreasing tcr from 50 to 30 c permeate conductivity was increased in line with flux decline and also delayed by decreasing tcr identical to the trend of flux decline although mdc effectively recovered fresh water from sgpw eventually performance degradation was observed at high water recovery condition over the entire experiment this clearly corresponds with our previous research concerning the water flux and rejection behaviors of mdc under membrane scaling conditions kim et al 2017 besides a direct comparison of water recovery performance is additionally required for a more accurate analysis for that reason water recovery rate was employed as a new performance indicator it was defined as the recovery rate when the normalized flux is 0 8 representing the performance degradation of the mdc process as a result water recovery rates were 84 80 and 76 under a tcr of 30 40 and 50 c respectively fig 2b to sum up the lower tcr of mdc can easily lead to quantitative water production to investigate the accurate cause of the performance degradation scanning electron microscopy sem analysis was conducted after each mdc experiment fig 3 compared to the virgin membrane fig 3a scales in the membrane pores were observed in every membrane coupon obtained from each mdc experiment fig 3b d the scales were formed under all tcr conditions lower tcr causes less scale formation on the membrane surface this trend was more intensified in 30 than 40 50 c since this trend of scale formation is parallel to the previous results of flux and rejection behaviors for tcr inorganic scaling could be considered a main limiting factor of water recovery rate which is the performance indicator as a result the reason for the performance degradation of mdc under high recovery rate conditions is inorganic scaling which can be effectively controlled by decreasing the tcr parameter to further understand the configuration of formed scales an energy dispersive spectroscopy eds analysis was performed according to the eds analysis the scales on the membrane surface fig 3 were calcium and sodium based scales fig 4 the spherical and cubic shape of the scales were identical to the basic shape of calcium carbonate and sodium chloride respectively ji et al 2010 rodriguez blanco et al 2011 3 1 2 effects of cross flow velocity on water productivity fig 5 shows the water production of mdc under various cross flow velocity conditions specifically initial flux varied from 2 1 to 2 8 lmh while feed cfv was adjusted at 0 1 0 3 m s fig 5a this result is attributed to the increment of driving force along with cfv from reducing the temperature polarization a decisive factor for flux which results in improved water flux eykens et al 2016 a much earlier flux decline was observed with increasing cfv permeate conductivity was also increased sharply at operating times of 1 400 1 600 and 1800 min with 0 1 0 3 m s of cfv respectively indicating the deterioration of permeate water quality in fig 5b the water fluxes remained stable until the recovery rate reached 70 with low permeate conductivity and then drastically decreased in conjunction with sharply increasing permeate conductivity finally the total recovery rates were 78 84 and 75 under cfvs of 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m s respectively as a result the optimal feed cfv was found to be 0 2 m s an intermediate velocity in view of quantitative water production in the case of other cfv conditions the performance degradation of mdc was accelerated and consequently the recovery rate was decreased this result is explained possibly by the secondary nucleation by excessive flow motion under high feed cfv the secondary nucleation is the dominant nucleation mechanism and initiated by fluid shear or contact with other existing crystal such as seed particles agrawal and paterson 2015 the condition of the membrane module under 0 3 m s of cfv is favorable to secondary nucleation so that crystal nuclei from the crystallizer can be easily formed by the collision of transferred crystal particles under high hydraulic shear force and other sufficient existing crystal particle conditions the crystal nuclei formed by the secondary nucleation promote bulk crystallization in the membrane module which might lead to increased inorganic scaling shin and sohn 2016 the more detailed mechanism will be discussed in the next section according to sem image analysis a spherical scale which is similar to the scale of the tcr experiments was observed to be 0 1 0 2 m s of cfv condition fig 6 b c importantly the scale was observed not only in the membrane pore but also on the membrane surface under 0 3 m s of cfv fig 6d this result is attributed to the crystal particle transfer will be discussed in 3 2 4 section with crystalline kinetics the amount of scale was minimized at 0 2 m s of cfv fig 6b this trend corresponds with the flux and rejection behavior under various cfvs sem eds and mapping analysis were conducted to identify the scale fig 7 calcium carbonate scale which is identical to that in tcr experiments was observed under all cfv conditions however under 0 3 m s of cfv sodium scales were also observed along with the calcium mapping analysis revealed that most of the sodium based scale is adhering to the calcium scale the sodium based scale which covered the membrane surface under 0 3 m s of cfv condition was not observed in every tcr conditions these results correspond with the previous trend of flux and rejection by inorganic scaling and are attributed to only calcium ions being crystallized under 0 1 0 2 m s of cfv which is due to its multivalent charge s relatively high scaling potential the calcium ions could be easily crystallized with nearby almost saturated sodium ions because of accelerated secondary nucleation and crystal nuclei collision via excessive flow motion under 0 3 m s of cfv in brief the additional crystallization of sodium ions at such critical cfv conditions could decrease the water recovery rate due to intensified inorganic scaling as a consequence optimization of the mdc process operating parameters is required for performance maximization this optimization will be discussed in the last section of this paper consequently optimal cfv and tcr to reduce scale formation were 0 2 m s and 30 c with respect to water recovery rate respectively however these interpretations are solely based on the water productivity mineral recovery which is another advantage of mdc will be discussed in the following section 3 2 3 1 3 contaminant removal by the mdc process apart from the aforementioned conducted quantitative analysis the quality of the water recovered from sgpw by mdc will be discussed in this section because the removal rate of volatile organic compounds vocs of typical sgpw in the mdc process is expected to be low primarily from the inherent fundamental separation mechanism which utilizes vapor pressure differences the vocs in sgpw were traced in each treatment step to qualitatively assess the feasibility of mdc for sgpw treatment since the main operating parameters of the mdc process had no significant effect on the rejection in md boubakri et al 2015 contaminant removal analysis was conducted under 0 2 m s of cfv and 30 c of tcr condition which was concluded to be optimal in terms of water production in the previous section the sampling was performed before the normalized flux was 0 8 in each experiment as shown in figs 1 2 and 8 4 trimethylbenzene 1 3 5 trimethylbenzene n propylbenzene isopropylbenzene and o xylene which have relatively large molecular size and weight among vocs were rejected more than other vocs by the mf pretreatment step the removal rate differences were not significant however 4 methyl 2 pentanone mibk tert butyl alcohol tba 2 butanone mek and methylene chloride were not rejected and completely passed through the membrane of the final treatment step mdc in particular the rejection of methylene chloride was only 3 85 these results are attributed to the vapor pressure of 4 methyl 2 pentanone mibk tert butyl alcohol tba 2 butanone mek and methylene chloride which have relatively low boiling points lower than or similar to that of water i e 23 77 mmhg at 25 c speight 2005 thus they can pass through the membrane pores as pure vapor and cause the deterioration of permeate water quality table 4 even though the aforesaid vocs do not largely affect water quality our findings suggest that an adequate pretreatment process prior to mdc to remove vocs is mandatory for real scale applications in summary sgpw was successfully treated by the mdc process achieving an 84 water recovery rate under optimum operating conditions the majority of the inorganic and organic contaminants in sgpw were effectively removed by mdc however it still remains a challenge to control inorganic scaling on md membranes at a high recovery rate and to improve the rejection of organic contaminants with low vapor pressure 3 2 mineral recovery by mdc from sgpw 3 2 1 analysis of crystalline kinetics mdc can not only produce water at a high recovery rate but can also recover minerals from sgpw various analyses of crystal samples formed in a crystallizer were performed to evaluate the applicability of mdc for mineral recovery from sgpw crystal sampling was conducted in concentration equivalent to sgpw based on eqs 1 6 the primary kinetic parameters of crystallization growth rate g nucleation rate b and solid production rate spr were evaluated under various operating conditions the results are listed in table 5 though the feed cfv was increased from 0 1 to 0 2 m s the effects to crystallization kinetic parameters were not significant however further increase of feed cfv to 0 3 m s might cause secondary nucleation by excessive flow motion and seeding effect via crystal particle transfer from crystallizer to membrane module shin and sohn 2016 lokare et al 2017 the seeding effect is an acceleration of crystallization by existing crystal seed particle or nuclei it can occur under sufficient crystal particle transfer with low tcr and secondary nucleation with high feed cfv these two conditions complicatedly affect the scale foaming in the membrane module the formed scale could reduce the water recovery rate and cause the seeding effect by returning to the crystallizer thus these kinetic parameters were significantly increased spr also improved from 2 12 to 2 72 kg m2day when the feed cfv was increased from 0 1 to 0 3 m s however to accurately determine the critical condition both water production and crystallization kinetics should be considered total implications of the analysis will be discussed in section 3 2 4 on the contrary both growth and nucleation rates gradually decreased when tcr was increased from 30 to 50 c accordingly the spr declined from 2 04 to 0 74 kg m2day it can be postulated that the higher tcr reduces the driving force of crystallization due to its smaller difference in degree of saturation than a lower tcr however this trend of kinetic parameter was more intensified in 30 c of tcr than 40 50 c according to sem analysis moreover the general trend observed in our study indicates that crystalline kinetics can be improved by decreasing tcr except for the critical condition which is 0 3 m s of feed cfv and 30 c of tcr because the critical condition may cause additional inorganic scaling causing the seeding effect by secondary nucleation from our results it may be suggested that tcr is a more influential parameter for controlling crystal productivity than is feed cfv 3 2 2 analysis of crystal size distribution the crystal size distribution csd was analyzed to evaluate the quality of formed crystals as summarized in fig 9 a no difference was observed in csd between 0 1 and 0 2 m s cfv however the increase of cfv to 0 3 m s resulted in increased mean crystal size and widened csd the coefficient of variation cv representing the scattering of crystal particle size around its mean showed a similar trend to that of csd more specifically cv was increased to 17 3 at 0 3 m s of feed cfv compared to 15 9 and 15 4 at 0 1 and 0 2 m s of cfv respectively the trend of csd and cv can be elucidated by the aforementioned crystal particle transfer and secondary nucleation in section 3 2 1 unlike the 0 1 and 0 2 m s of cfv additional particles formed by crystal particle transfer and secondary nucleation promote crystallization by functioning as seed particles under the critical condition the seeding effect leads to an increment of csd as shown in fig 9b csd and cv showed more dramatic changes with respect to tcr cv increased from 15 4 to 24 0 along with tcr increasing from 30 to 50 c moreover cvs under all operating conditions were below 50 which is ideal in industrial crystallizer quist jensen et al 2017 as a result crystal product quality was improved in terms of csd and cv when the feed cfv was smaller than the critical cfv 0 3 m s with the lowered tcr in accordance with the crystalline kinetics analysis tcr is more effective in controlling the quality of crystals than is feed cfv the overall results indicate that mdc can effectively recover high quality of minerals from sgpw 3 2 3 crystal identification by xrd and si modelling x ray diffraction xrd analysis was conducted to characterize the components of the crystals formed in the crystallizer as shown in fig 10 xrd patterns of earlier stage sample identified the crystals to be calcite calcium carbonate and halite sodium chloride the crystal components identical with those of the scales formed on the md membrane surface figs 4 and 7 more specifically by analyzing the peaks of the xrd patterns the composition of crystals was found to be 94 4 calcite and 5 6 halite on the contrary xrd patterns of latter stage sample identified the most of the crystal to be halite in the earlier stage the majority of the formation occurred as calcite a divalent calcium based crystal of high crystallinity and in the latter stage after continuous concentration halite a monovalent ion of low crystallinity was formed as the major crystalline to further investigation of formed crystalline saturation index si modelling was conducted by using phreeqc program kim et al 2017 parkhurst and appelo 1999 the concentration for si modelling is the concentration when normalized flux is 0 8 investigation of the si modelling results showed calcite and halite to have a si value of close to or over 0 specifically the si values of the two precipitates ranged 0 92 0 98 and 0 94 1 39 respectively as the tcr value changed from 30 to 50 c in the case of calcite the si value decreased with the decrease in tcr value but was the opposite in the case of halite and the extent of fluctuation was larger for halite than calcite furthermore parallel to the xrd analyses presented above calcite showed higher crystallinity than halite in accordance to such results it can be considered that calcite crystallization occurs precedingly and halite crystallization occurs subsequently after further concentration this conclusion corresponds with the sem membrane surface analysis in the previous section results of the analysis showed calcite and halite scaling and it can be assumed that the scaling was well controlled in the crystallization stage additionally due to low calcium concentration in sgpw calcite crystallization did not have a severe impact on the performance degradation of mdc but after continuous concentration induced performance degradation at the high recovery stage when halite of high concentration crystallized table 1 conclusively the point when crystallization controls md scaling is at the high recovery condition in which mdc reaches steady state and so at the high recovery condition the primary controlling factor can be considered to be halite this observation indicated that the potential scalants on md membranes were effectively removed by the crystallizer and thus the total recovery rate could be improved significantly via the mdc process as a result the additional crystallization in the crystallizer was forced by raised degree of super saturation due to decreasing tcr the inorganic scalant loading on the membrane was decreased to such an extent that the mdc process could be operated much longer without performance degradation 3 2 4 implications of crystal analysis according to the results shown in fig 13a the recovery rate was increased with increasing the feed cfv until 0 2 m s however a further increase of feed cfv to 0 3 m s could significantly decrease the recovery rate in the case of tcr the recovery rate was increased with decreasing tcr contrary to this trend the water recovery rate sharply declined to 75 under 0 3 m s feed cfv and 30 c tcr in principle it is expected that increasing the feed cfv and decreasing tcr could prevent scale formation on membranes through reducing the deposition and forcing the crystallization in the crystallizer eventually increasing the total recovery rate however further increasing cfv over the critical condition with low tcr could cause more crystal particle transfer from the crystallizer to the membrane module and increase inorganic scaling by secondary nucleation leading to a decline in the recovery rate this result is supported by the observation that the large inorganic crystals were visible only at the critical condition as identified by the sem eds analysis kinetic parameters csd and microscopic images presented in figs 3 4 6 7 and 9 and table 5 the mechanisms of inorganic scaling by the crystal particle transfer phenomenon are shown in fig 11 transferred crystal particles from the crystallizer are used to the seed the homogeneous nucleation in the membrane module the formed nuclei accelerate the secondary nucleation by excessive flow motion under high hydraulic force condition i e high cfv so that the nuclei can grow to the inorganic scale in the membrane module which can result in inorganic scaling and cause performance degradation of the mdc process consequently contrary to the principle the recovery rate was dramatically decreased under the critical condition which is low tcr producing crystal sufficient to transfer from the crystallizer to the membrane module and high feed cfv to expedite the secondary nucleation however although crystal particle transfer occurred under a high tcr condition the transferred crystal particle could not affect performance such as recovery rate due to their small amount fig 13 table 5 3 3 energy consumption by mdc for sgpw management md based technologies are controversial energy wise because they are temperature gradient driven processes mdc requires extra energy for both cooling and heating due to crystallization therefore sec modelling was conducted to estimate the suitability of mdc for sgpw management on the basis of energy requirement the estimated secs of the mdc process were increased in tandem with the feed cfv increment fig 12 a this is attributed to the fixed membrane area 9 7 m2 which limits the water recovery in md modules and increases the overall sec conversely the secs were decreased with increased tcr because the required energy is proportional to the temperature difference between the md module outlet and crystallizer fig 12b when a heat exchanger hx was employed the sec values of the mdc process were reduced by about half with optimal operating conditions in terms of energy consumption 0 1 m s of feed cfv and 50 c of tcr with hx the sec value could be lowered to 21 2 kwh m3 previous studies reported that the specific energy needed for mdc was estimated to be about 15 20 kwh m3 drioli et al 2006 in previous studies a continuous system which did not cool the feed brine at moderate operating temperatures feed 35 c distillate 15 c crystallizer 25 c achieved a lower sec on the contrary in this work a batch system which may be appropriate for zero liquid discharge was evaluated at typical sgpw operating temperatures feed 60 c distillate 20 c crystallizer 30 50 c to facilitate mdc management of the sgpw for cooling the feed solution nearly double the energy is required compared to that of a continuous system based on eqs 9 11 thus it is noteworthy that we first performed a practical evaluation of the energy required for mdc additionally we found that 96 99 of the energy required in the mdc system is thermal energy related to warming up and cooling down the solution which is consistent with previous simulation results using the aspen flowsheet program guan et al 2012 mdc can serve as a cost effective option to treat sgpw due to low energy requirements especially if waste heat or inherent geothermal heat are utilized for its operation lokare et al 2017 it is worthwhile to note that the calculated sec is only theoretically achievable as a result of the many idealities assumed in the estimation so there are limitations to find an optimal operating condition for the minimum sec regardless as aforementioned it is always preferable to operate the md system at low cfv and tcr as it always yields the lowest energy consumption for a given condition consequently our simulation suggested that mdc with optimized operating parameters has a great potential for recovering water and minerals from sgpw with low energy consumption compared to other conventional zld processes such as 25 kwh m3 of mvc tong and elimelech 2016 furthermore this value can be lowered by employing the available heat source 3 4 optimization for effective operation of mdc previously the effects of the main operating parameters on mdc performance were examined based on water production mineral recovery and energy consumption respectively however each optimal operating condition was different thus optimization of the operating conditions by comparing the performance indicators was performed based on the purpose of the mdc process performance indicators under each operating parameter are shown in fig 13 recovery rate was increased with low tcr and high cfv causing a reduction of scalant loading onto the membrane module and scale deposition onto the membrane surface fig 13a however under the critical condition 0 3 m s of cfv and 30 c of tcr the recovery rate was sharply decreased contrary to the trend as previously mentioned this is attributed to the acceleration of inorganic scaling by crystal particle transfer in addition spr was increased with decreasing tcr fig 13b cfv has no relation with the spr value unless under the critical condition in this case spr was increased due to the seed effect from crystal particle transfer in the case of the sec a trend similar to the recovery rate s was identified except for the critical condition fig 13c in this study aiming for a high water recovery rate for sgpw management with a near zld the recommended optimal operating conditions are 0 2 m s of feed cfv and 30 c of tcr with a maximum recovery rate of 84 it is mandatory though to select the optimal operating parameters for a high rate of water recovery mineral recovery from wastewater and low energy desalination as a result it was revealed that the crystal particle transfer can significantly affect the performance degradation of mdc there are two options to prevent performance degradation of the mdc process the first one is the control of operating parameters below the critical condition to avoid crystal particle transfer the other is an additional process which can separate the transferred crystal particles from the crystallizer to the membrane module for example a physical filtration process which has been used in the water treatment field could be a first option because it has been verified by csd analysis that most of the crystal particles are larger than 1 μm fig 9 additionally a sedimentation process can be another option based on the xrd result that the crystal components are identified as caco3 and nacl which have larger densities than water fig 10 4 conclusions although the mdc process has several advantages for sgpw management its technological feasibility is largely determined by operational obstacles membrane scaling energy consumption and its complexity of operation in this work the feasibility of a mdc process for sgpw management was systemically evaluated in the aspects of water production mineral recovery and energy consumption the main conclusions drawn from this study are summarized as follows the water productivity of the mdc process from sgpw was evaluated by optimizing the main operating parameters maximum recovery rate was 84 under 0 2 m s of feed cfv and 30 c of tcr conditions however the rejection rate for vocs which have a low molecular weight such as methylene chloride was only 3 85 this suggests that an adequate pretreatment for vocs prior to mdc is mandatory in case of scale up or long time operation for actual application in terms of mineral recovery mdc could adequately recover calcite and halite from sgpw with 2 72 kg m2day tcr was identified as a more important parameter than feed cfv which decides crystallization performance sustainable operation of mdc could be acquired by optimizing the operating parameters via controlling the crystal particle transfer and consequently minimizing scale formation the sec of mdc was increased by increasing feed cfv and decreasing tcr at optimal operating conditions the sec of mdc was 28 2 kwh m3 with a 74 recovery rate which shows the potential to be economically competitive with the conventional zld process mdc performance was maximized by appropriate control of operating parameters in the case of not only water recovery but also for other purposes such as mineral recovery and low energy desalination crystal particle transfer and secondary nucleation are the main causes of the mdc performance degradation it can be considered that these are effectively controlled by optimizing the operating parameters and or adding a crystal particle separation process such as physical filtration or sedimentation based on the conclusion it should be considered that practical application of mdc process for sgpw management could be possible only with employing and appropriate process control strategy and or developing novel module which integrates md and crystallizer together in one unit with effective scale collection and control

seongbuk gu seoul 136 713 republic of korea school of civil environmental architectural engineering korea university 1 5 ga anam dong seongbuk gu seoul 136 713 republic of korea corresponding author shale gas produced water sgpw treatment imposes greater technical challenges because of its high concentration of various contaminants membrane distillation crystallization mdc has a great potential to manage sgpw since it is capable of recovering both water and minerals at high rates up to near a zero liquid discharge zld condition to evaluate the feasibility of mdc for sgpw treatment mdc performance indicators such as water recovery rate solid production rate spr and specific energy consumption sec were systematically investigated to our knowledge for the first time by using actual sgpw from eagle ford shale usa the main operating parameters including feed cross flow velocity cfv and crystallization temperature tcr were optimized by performing a series of mdc experiments the results reported that water and minerals were effectively recovered with 84 of recovery rate and 2 72 kg m2day of spr under respective optimal operating conditions furthermore the scale mechanism was firstly identified as limiting factor for mdc performance degradation lastly sec of mdc was estimated to be as low as 28 2 kwh m3 under ideal optimal operating conditions our experimental observations demonstrated that mdc could sustainably and effectively recover water and mineral with low energy consumption from sgpw by optimizing operating condition graphical abstract image keywords shale gas produced water sgpw membrane distillation crystallization mdc zero liquid discharge zld water production mineral recovery energy consumption 1 introduction the global water shortage is one of the biggest challenges humans face primarily due to climate change in recent years water reuse has emerged as the most economically viable and environmentally friendly solution to this crisis rasul et al 2006 liu et al 2012 furthermore the concept of zero liquid discharge zld has been adopted by industrial waste management not only to recycle wastewater but also to recover precious resources from it pérez gonzález et al 2012 tong and elimelech 2016 such a new strategy could be applied to the newly rising shale gas and oil industry administration and kuuskraa 2011 shaffer et al 2013 the extraction of shale gas and oil using a hydraulic fracturing produces large amounts of aqueous waste often called shale gas produced water sgpw that can pose serious environmental risks the current trend of sgpw management has focused on the increase of its internal reuse for resolving economic and environmental issues however the discharge of sgpw into the environment imposes much greater technical challenges because of ever increasingly stringent environmental regulations sgpw typically contains high concentrations of mineral and organic constituents dissolved from shale formations as well as chemicals used for shale gas and oil extraction gregory et al 2011 vidic et al 2013 various processes such as thermal evaporation and mechanical vapor compression have been proposed and developed for sgpw reuse and treatment however the main drawbacks associated with them including high cost large footprint and the use of toxic chemicals have hampered their applications recently membrane processes have been examined as promising options because of their superior applicability and cost effectiveness alkhudhiri et al 2013 macedonio et al 2014 the membrane processes newly developed for sgpw management include membrane distillation md mcginnis et al 2013 md technology can be further integrated with crystallization and thus offer an attractive technical advancement suitable for spgw management specifically such a membrane distillation crystallization mdc process can desalinate highly concentrated minerals produce high quality treated water recover valuable minerals from sgpw and possibly utilize the inherent geothermal heat of sgpw kim et al 2017 mdc technology could achieve even a zld requirement if necessary however mdc is still an immature technology and research into it remains at a basic level based on an extensive literature review it can be concluded that the existing mdc studies suffered greatly from critical deficiencies in i evaluation of fundamental performance indicators ii optimization of operating parameters iii analysis of scaling mechanisms and iv estimation of energy consumption furthermore real application studies are rarely found in the current literature previous mdc studies have focused on two objectives mineral recovery and production and high salinity water treatment possibly achieving zld as summarized in table 1 most mdc studies were performed using synthetic solutions such as nacl edwie and chung 2013 chen et al 2014 rather than investigating various real water resources including industrial wastewaters julian et al 2016 due to a lack of knowledge and experience with this process critical operating conditions were not fundamentally evaluated and systematically optimized according feed water characteristics moreover the scaling issue which is the key problem for actual operation has not been sufficiently considered and addressed lastly few studies have evaluated energy consumption in the mdc process even though the mdc process relies on a heat source as its driving force kim et al 2017 therefore it is of paramount importance to elucidate and optimize the critical factors affecting the mdc process and to analyze its energy consumption for real applications this paper presents our efforts to develop mdc technology for spgw management which would be the first mdc application study using real industrial wastewaters specifically the objective of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of the mdc process for water and mineral recovery from sgpw under various operating conditions the mdc process was systematically assessed not only by monitoring md performance including water productivity and contaminant removal but also by elucidating fundamental crystallization mechanisms including growth nucleation and solid production rates specific energy consumption sec was also estimated to determine the economic viability of the mdc the scaling mechanism in mdc process was elucidated and delineated as a limiting factor lastly the main operating parameters i e feed cross flow velocity cfv and temperature of crystallization tcr were optimized to determine the technological applicability of mdc to sgpw management in view of water and mineral production as well as energy consumption 2 material and methods 2 1 shale gas produced water sgpw the composition of sgpw is complicated varying from well to well it mainly consists of chemical additives for fracturing dissolved salts from shale formation and solid particles the sgpw sample used in this study was collected from multi wells being drilled in the eagle ford shale formation which is one of the major shale plays in the usa sgpw collected from the eagle ford shale in texas by truck was used in this study the water quality characteristics of the sgpw are summarized in table 2 the sgpw fed to mdc was prepared by an mf pretreatment with a pes membrane of 150 kda for the following mdc experiments 2 2 membrane distillation crystallization mdc experiments mdc experiments were carried out using the unit shown in fig 1 for all mdc experiments 10 l of sgpw pretreated by mf was prepared at a typical sgpw temperature i e 60 1 0 c while the 4 l of permeate water was cool deionized water retained at 20 1 0 c by thermostatic bath kim et al 2017 the pretreated sgpw was circulated by pump from the crystallizer into the membrane module and returned to the crystallizer additionally the permeate was circulated between the permeate reservoir and membrane module to evaluate the performance of mdc under different operating conditions the feed cfv was controlled at 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m s and tcr was set at 30 40 and 50 c the permeate flux and conductivity were continuously monitored to estimate water productivity and quality using electrical balance and a conductivity meter hach hq40d respectively the crystallizer had an internal stirrer constantly rotating at 100 rpm 2 2 1 md membrane and module hydrophobic hollow fiber membranes accurel pp s6 2 membrana gmbh made of polypropylene pp were employed in the study the principal characteristics of the hollow fiber membranes as specified by the manufacturer were the pore size with maximum and nominal diameters of 0 55 and 0 22 μm respectively and a porosity of 72 the acrylic membrane module was equipped with 45 hollow fibers with a total membrane area of 0 12 m2 2 2 2 characterization of the crystal formation the growth g and nucleation b rates of the formed crystals in the mdc process were calculated to evaluate the productivity of crystal formation ji et al 2010 the growth g rate is defined as the change of the average crystal length l t r with increasing residence time tr as shown in eqs 1 3 1 g d l t r d t r l t r n 1 l t r n t r n 1 t r n 2 l t r i 1 k α i t r l i 3 α i t r n i t r n t o t a l t r the nucleation b rate was determined by the change of the total number of crystals ntotal tr with increasing residence time tr divided by the

methodology for energy calculation in the mdc process some assumptions are made as follows naidu et al 2014 eleiwi and laleg kirati 2016 1 the temperature of the feed and permeate solutions inside the modules is kept at a constant 2 the energy required for agitation and the heat energy from crystallization in the crystallizer is neglected 3 the heat capacity of solutions is kept at a constant 4 the pressure drop through pipelines and modules is negligible despite these simplifying assumptions especially the ignoring of the heat loss inside the modules this approach can provide approximate energy consumption according to operating conditions energy consumption in a mdc system includes the thermal energy to heat up and cool down the feed along with the electrical energy to operate the circulation pumps we assumed that no energy was needed to cool down the permeate stream due to the fact that i no heat loss across the module is assumed ii unnoticeable changes of temperature between inlet and outlet module were found during the lab scale tests and iii the heated up distillate stream is a very small part of the total water volume for fracturing in the shale gas industry and hence cannot heat a massive amount of fracturing water in the reservoir epa 2015 7 e t o t a l w e e e t where ee is the electrical energy to operate the circulation pumps and et is the thermal energy necessary to heat up the feed from the crystal reactor tank and to cool down the md brine from the membrane module the required electrical energy of the circulation pumps is calculated as 8 e e e f f i c i e n c y δ p q where delta p is the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet of the circulation pump and q is the volumetric feed flow rate in this study the feed and permeate were

energy the heat exchanger recovers the heat energy from the hot md brine streams at the outlet of the module the recovered heat is used to preheat the cold feed streams at the outlet of the crystallizer before they enter the membrane module sec is defined as the energy required to produce a cubic meter of distillate accordingly the sec for the mdc process is given by 15 s e c e t o t a l

crystallization temperature on water productivity sgpw is extremely difficult to treat and discharge due to its high concentration of various toxic components which can adversely affect human health and the environment therefore it is essential to select a suitable sgpw management option such as the mdc process to achieve the near zld goal in this section the performance of mdc was firstly evaluated in terms of water production from sgpw two main operating parameters i e feed cfv and tcr were investigated to elucidate the critical factors affecting the total water recovery rate tcr was firstly examined to evaluate its effect on mdc s water productivity in fig 2 various tcr conditions were investigated based on process performance with the fixed feed cfv initial flux was identical at 2 5 lmh for all ranges of tcr and sustained with permeate conductivity at 10 μs cm tcr did not affect the initial water flux as shown in fig 2a flux decline occurred after 1500 min of experiment time and delayed as decreasing tcr from 50 to 30 c permeate conductivity was increased in line with flux decline and also delayed by decreasing tcr identical to the trend of flux decline although mdc effectively recovered fresh water from sgpw eventually performance degradation was observed at high water recovery condition over the entire experiment this clearly corresponds with our previous research concerning the water flux and rejection behaviors of mdc under membrane scaling conditions kim et al 2017 besides a direct comparison of water recovery performance is additionally required for a more accurate analysis for that reason water recovery rate was employed as a new performance indicator it was defined as the recovery rate when the normalized flux is 0 8 representing the performance degradation of the mdc process as a result water recovery rates were 84 80 and 76 under a tcr of 30 40 and 50 c respectively fig 2b to sum up the lower tcr of mdc can easily lead to quantitative water production to investigate the accurate cause of the performance degradation scanning electron microscopy sem analysis was conducted after each mdc experiment fig 3 compared to the virgin membrane fig 3a scales in the membrane pores were observed in every membrane coupon obtained from each mdc experiment fig 3b d the scales were formed under all tcr conditions lower tcr causes less scale formation on the membrane surface this trend was more intensified in 30 than 40 50 c since this trend of scale formation is parallel to the previous results of flux and rejection behaviors for tcr inorganic scaling could be considered a main limiting factor of water recovery rate which is the performance indicator as a result the reason for the performance degradation of mdc under high recovery rate conditions is inorganic scaling which can be effectively controlled by decreasing the tcr parameter to further understand the configuration of formed scales an energy dispersive spectroscopy eds analysis was performed according to the eds analysis the scales on the membrane surface fig 3 were calcium and sodium based scales fig 4 the spherical and cubic shape of the scales were identical to the basic shape of calcium carbonate and sodium chloride respectively ji et al 2010 rodriguez blanco et al 2011 3 1 2 effects of cross flow velocity on water productivity fig 5 shows the water production of mdc under various cross flow velocity conditions specifically initial flux varied from 2 1 to 2 8 lmh while feed cfv was adjusted at 0 1 0 3 m s fig 5a this result is attributed to the increment of driving force along with cfv from reducing the temperature polarization a decisive factor for flux which results in improved water flux eykens et al 2016 a much earlier flux decline was observed with increasing cfv permeate conductivity was also increased sharply at operating times of 1 400 1 600 and 1800 min with 0 1 0 3 m s of cfv respectively indicating the deterioration of permeate water quality in fig 5b the water fluxes remained stable until the recovery rate reached 70 with low permeate conductivity and then drastically decreased in conjunction with sharply increasing permeate conductivity finally the total recovery rates were 78 84 and 75 under cfvs of 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m s respectively as a result the optimal feed cfv was found to be 0 2 m s an intermediate velocity in view of quantitative water production in the case of other cfv conditions the performance degradation of mdc was accelerated and consequently the recovery rate was decreased this result is explained possibly by the secondary nucleation by excessive flow motion under high feed cfv the secondary nucleation is the dominant nucleation mechanism and initiated by fluid shear or contact with other existing crystal such as seed particles agrawal and paterson 2015 the condition of the membrane module under 0 3 m s of cfv is favorable to secondary nucleation so that crystal nuclei from the crystallizer can be easily formed by the collision of transferred crystal particles under high hydraulic shear force and other sufficient existing crystal particle conditions the crystal nuclei formed by the secondary nucleation promote bulk crystallization in the membrane module which might lead to increased inorganic scaling shin and sohn 2016 the more detailed mechanism will be discussed in the next section according to sem image analysis a spherical scale which is similar to the scale of the tcr experiments was observed to be 0 1 0 2 m s of cfv condition fig 6 b c importantly the scale was observed not only in the membrane pore but also on the membrane surface under 0 3 m s of cfv fig 6d this result is attributed to the crystal particle transfer will be discussed in 3 2 4 section with crystalline kinetics the amount of scale was minimized at 0 2 m s of cfv fig 6b this trend corresponds with the flux and rejection behavior under various cfvs sem eds and mapping analysis were conducted to identify the scale fig 7 calcium carbonate scale which is identical to that in tcr experiments was observed under all cfv conditions however under 0 3 m s of cfv sodium scales were also observed along with the calcium mapping analysis revealed that most of the sodium based scale is adhering to the calcium scale the sodium based scale which covered the membrane surface under 0 3 m s of cfv condition was not observed in every tcr conditions these results correspond with the previous trend of flux and rejection by inorganic scaling and are attributed to only calcium ions being crystallized under 0 1 0 2 m s of cfv which is due to its multivalent charge s relatively high scaling potential the calcium ions could be easily crystallized with nearby almost saturated sodium ions because of accelerated secondary nucleation and crystal nuclei collision via excessive flow motion under 0 3 m s of cfv in brief the additional crystallization of sodium ions at such critical cfv conditions could decrease the water recovery rate due to intensified inorganic scaling as a consequence optimization of the mdc process operating parameters is required for performance maximization this optimization will be discussed in the last section of this paper consequently optimal cfv and tcr to reduce scale formation were 0 2 m s and 30 c with respect to water recovery rate respectively however these interpretations are solely based on the water productivity mineral recovery which is another advantage of mdc will be discussed in the following section 3 2 3 1 3 contaminant removal by the mdc process apart from the aforementioned conducted quantitative analysis the quality of the water recovered from sgpw by mdc will be discussed in this section because the removal rate of volatile organic compounds vocs of typical sgpw in the mdc process is expected to be low primarily from the inherent fundamental separation mechanism which utilizes vapor pressure differences the vocs in sgpw were traced in each treatment step to qualitatively assess the feasibility of mdc for sgpw treatment since the main operating parameters of the mdc process had no significant effect on the rejection in md boubakri et al 2015 contaminant removal analysis was conducted under 0 2 m s of cfv and 30 c of tcr condition which was concluded to be optimal in terms of water production in the previous section the sampling was performed before the normalized flux was 0 8 in each experiment as shown in figs 1 2 and 8 4 trimethylbenzene 1 3 5 trimethylbenzene n propylbenzene isopropylbenzene and o xylene which have relatively large molecular size and weight among vocs were rejected more than other vocs by the mf pretreatment step the removal rate differences were not significant however 4 methyl 2 pentanone mibk tert butyl alcohol tba 2 butanone mek and methylene chloride were not rejected and completely passed through the membrane of the final treatment step mdc in particular the rejection of methylene chloride was only 3 85 these results are attributed to the vapor pressure of 4 methyl 2 pentanone mibk tert butyl alcohol tba 2 butanone mek and methylene chloride which have relatively low boiling points lower than or similar to that of water i e 23 77 mmhg at 25 c speight 2005 thus they can pass through the membrane pores as pure vapor and cause the deterioration of permeate water quality table 4 even though the aforesaid vocs do not largely affect water quality our findings suggest that an adequate pretreatment process prior to mdc to remove vocs is mandatory for real scale applications in summary sgpw was successfully treated by the mdc process achieving an 84 water recovery rate under optimum operating conditions the majority of the inorganic and organic contaminants in sgpw were effectively removed by mdc however it still remains a challenge to control inorganic scaling on md membranes at a high recovery rate and to improve the rejection of organic contaminants with low vapor pressure 3 2 mineral recovery by mdc from sgpw 3 2 1 analysis of crystalline kinetics mdc can not only produce water at a high recovery rate but can also recover minerals from sgpw various analyses of crystal samples formed in a crystallizer were performed to evaluate the applicability of mdc for mineral recovery from sgpw crystal sampling was conducted in concentration equivalent to sgpw based on eqs 1 6 the primary kinetic parameters of crystallization growth rate g nucleation rate b and solid production rate spr were evaluated under various operating conditions the results are listed in table 5 though the feed cfv was increased from 0 1 to 0 2 m s the effects to crystallization kinetic parameters were not significant however further increase of feed cfv to 0 3 m s might cause secondary nucleation by excessive flow motion and seeding effect via crystal particle transfer from crystallizer to membrane module shin and sohn 2016 lokare et al 2017 the seeding effect is an acceleration of crystallization by existing crystal seed particle or nuclei it can occur under sufficient crystal particle transfer with low tcr and secondary nucleation with high feed cfv these two conditions complicatedly affect the scale foaming in the membrane module the formed scale could reduce the water recovery rate and cause the seeding effect by returning to the crystallizer thus these kinetic parameters were significantly increased spr also improved from 2 12 to 2 72 kg m2day when the feed cfv was increased from 0 1 to 0 3 m s however to accurately determine the critical condition both water production and crystallization kinetics should be considered total implications of the analysis will be discussed in section 3 2 4 on the contrary both growth and nucleation rates gradually decreased when tcr was increased from 30 to 50 c accordingly the spr declined from 2 04 to 0 74 kg m2day it can be postulated that the higher tcr reduces the driving force of crystallization due to its smaller difference in degree of saturation than a lower tcr however this trend of kinetic parameter was more intensified in 30 c of tcr than 40 50 c according to sem analysis moreover the general trend observed in our study indicates that crystalline kinetics can be improved by decreasing tcr except for the critical condition which is 0 3 m s of feed cfv and 30 c of tcr because the critical condition may cause additional inorganic scaling causing the seeding effect by secondary nucleation from our results it may be suggested that tcr is a more influential parameter for controlling crystal productivity than is feed cfv 3 2 2 analysis of crystal size distribution the crystal size distribution csd was analyzed to evaluate the quality of formed crystals as summarized in fig 9 a no difference was observed in csd between 0 1 and 0 2 m s cfv however the increase of cfv to 0 3 m s resulted in increased mean crystal size and widened csd the coefficient of variation cv representing the scattering of crystal particle size around its mean showed a similar trend to that of csd more specifically cv was increased to 17 3 at 0 3 m s of feed cfv compared to 15 9 and 15 4 at 0 1 and 0 2 m s of cfv respectively the trend of csd and cv can be elucidated by the aforementioned crystal particle transfer and secondary nucleation in section 3 2 1 unlike the 0 1 and 0 2 m s of cfv additional particles formed by crystal particle transfer and secondary nucleation promote crystallization by functioning as seed particles under the critical condition the seeding effect leads to an increment of csd as shown in fig 9b csd and cv showed more dramatic changes with respect to tcr cv increased from 15 4 to 24 0 along with tcr increasing from 30 to 50 c moreover cvs under all operating conditions were below 50 which is ideal in industrial crystallizer quist jensen et al 2017 as a result crystal product quality was improved in terms of csd and cv when the feed cfv was smaller than the critical cfv 0 3 m s with the lowered tcr in accordance with the crystalline kinetics analysis tcr is more effective in controlling the quality of crystals than is feed cfv the overall results indicate that mdc can effectively recover high quality of minerals from sgpw 3 2 3 crystal identification by xrd and si modelling x ray diffraction xrd analysis was conducted to characterize the components of the crystals formed in the crystallizer as shown in fig 10 xrd patterns of earlier stage sample identified the crystals to be calcite calcium carbonate and halite sodium chloride the crystal components identical with those of the scales formed on the md membrane surface figs 4 and 7 more specifically by analyzing the peaks of the xrd patterns the composition of crystals was found to be 94 4 calcite and 5 6 halite on the contrary xrd patterns of latter stage sample identified the most of the crystal to be halite in the earlier stage the majority of the formation occurred as calcite a divalent calcium based crystal of high crystallinity and in the latter stage after continuous concentration halite a monovalent ion of low crystallinity was formed as the major crystalline to further investigation of formed crystalline saturation index si modelling was conducted by using phreeqc program kim et al 2017 parkhurst and appelo 1999 the concentration for si modelling is the concentration when normalized flux is 0 8 investigation of the si modelling results showed calcite and halite to have a si value of close to or over 0 specifically the si values of the two precipitates ranged 0 92 0 98 and 0 94 1 39 respectively as the tcr value changed from 30 to 50 c in the case of calcite the si value decreased with the decrease in tcr value but was the opposite in the case of halite and the extent of fluctuation was larger for halite than calcite furthermore parallel to the xrd analyses presented above calcite showed higher crystallinity than halite in accordance to such results it can be considered that calcite crystallization occurs precedingly and halite crystallization occurs subsequently after further concentration this conclusion corresponds with the sem membrane surface analysis in the previous section results of the analysis showed calcite and halite scaling and it can be assumed that the scaling was well controlled in the crystallization stage additionally due to low calcium concentration in sgpw calcite crystallization did not have a severe impact on the performance degradation of mdc but after continuous concentration induced performance degradation at the high recovery stage when halite of high concentration crystallized table 1 conclusively the point when crystallization controls md scaling is at the high recovery condition in which mdc reaches steady state and so at the high recovery condition the primary controlling factor can be considered to be halite this observation indicated that the potential scalants on md membranes were effectively removed by the crystallizer and thus the total recovery rate could be improved significantly via the mdc process as a result the additional crystallization in the crystallizer was forced by raised degree of super saturation due to decreasing tcr the inorganic scalant loading on the membrane was decreased to such an extent that the mdc process could be operated much longer without performance degradation 3 2 4 implications of crystal analysis according to the results shown in fig 13a the recovery rate was increased with increasing the feed cfv until 0 2 m s however a further increase of feed cfv to 0 3 m s could significantly decrease the recovery rate in the case of tcr the recovery rate was increased with decreasing tcr contrary to this trend the water recovery rate sharply declined to 75 under 0 3 m s feed cfv and 30 c tcr in principle it is expected that increasing the feed cfv and decreasing tcr could prevent scale formation on membranes through reducing the deposition and forcing the crystallization in the crystallizer eventually increasing the total recovery rate however further increasing cfv over the critical condition with low tcr could cause more crystal particle transfer from the crystallizer to the membrane module and increase inorganic scaling by secondary nucleation leading to a decline in the recovery rate this result is supported by the observation that the large inorganic crystals were visible only at the critical condition as identified by the sem eds analysis kinetic parameters csd and microscopic images presented in figs 3 4 6 7 and 9 and table 5 the mechanisms of inorganic scaling by the crystal particle transfer phenomenon are shown in fig 11 transferred crystal particles from the crystallizer are used to the seed the homogeneous nucleation in the membrane module the formed nuclei accelerate the secondary nucleation by excessive flow motion under high hydraulic force condition i e high cfv so that the nuclei can grow to the inorganic scale in the membrane module which can result in inorganic scaling and cause performance degradation of the mdc process consequently contrary to the principle the recovery rate was dramatically decreased under the critical condition which is low tcr producing crystal sufficient to transfer from the crystallizer to the membrane module and high feed cfv to expedite the secondary nucleation however although crystal particle transfer occurred under a high tcr condition the transferred crystal particle could not affect performance such as recovery rate due to their small amount fig 13 table 5 3 3 energy consumption by mdc for sgpw management md based technologies are controversial energy wise because they are temperature gradient driven processes mdc requires extra energy for both cooling and heating due to crystallization therefore sec modelling was conducted to estimate the suitability of mdc for sgpw management on the basis of energy requirement the estimated secs of the mdc process were increased in tandem with the feed cfv increment fig 12 a this is attributed to the fixed membrane area 9 7 m2 which limits the water recovery in md modules and increases the overall sec conversely the secs were decreased with increased tcr because the required energy is proportional to the temperature difference between the md module outlet and crystallizer fig 12b when a heat exchanger hx was employed the sec values of the mdc process were reduced by about half with optimal operating conditions in terms of energy consumption 0 1 m s of feed cfv and 50 c of tcr with hx the sec value could be lowered to 21 2 kwh m3 previous studies reported that the specific energy needed for mdc was estimated to be about 15 20 kwh m3 drioli et al 2006 in previous studies a continuous system which did not cool the feed brine at moderate operating temperatures feed 35 c distillate 15 c crystallizer 25 c achieved a lower sec on the contrary in this work a batch system which may be appropriate for zero liquid discharge was evaluated at typical sgpw operating temperatures feed 60 c distillate 20 c crystallizer 30 50 c to facilitate mdc management of the sgpw for cooling the feed solution nearly double the energy is required compared to that of a continuous system based on eqs 9 11 thus it is noteworthy that we first performed a practical evaluation of the energy required for mdc additionally we found that 96 99 of the energy required in the mdc system is thermal energy related to warming up and cooling down the solution which is consistent with previous simulation results using the aspen flowsheet program guan et al 2012 mdc can serve as a cost effective option to treat sgpw due to low energy requirements especially if waste heat or inherent geothermal heat are utilized for its operation lokare et al 2017 it is worthwhile to note that the calculated sec is only theoretically achievable as a result of the many idealities assumed in the estimation so there are limitations to find an optimal operating condition for the minimum sec regardless as aforementioned it is always preferable to operate the md system at low cfv and tcr as it always yields the lowest energy consumption for a given condition consequently our simulation suggested that mdc with optimized operating parameters has a great potential for recovering water and minerals from sgpw with low energy consumption compared to other conventional zld processes such as 25 kwh m3 of mvc tong and elimelech 2016 furthermore this value can be lowered by employing the available heat source 3 4 optimization for effective operation of mdc previously the effects of the main operating parameters on mdc performance were examined based on water production mineral recovery and energy consumption respectively however each optimal operating condition was different thus optimization of the operating conditions by comparing the performance indicators was performed based on the purpose of the mdc process performance indicators under each operating parameter are shown in fig 13 recovery rate was increased with low tcr and high cfv causing a reduction of scalant loading onto the membrane module and scale deposition onto the membrane surface fig 13a however under the critical condition 0 3 m s of cfv and 30 c of tcr the recovery rate was sharply decreased contrary to the trend as previously mentioned this is attributed to the acceleration of inorganic scaling by crystal particle transfer in addition spr was increased with decreasing tcr fig 13b cfv has no relation with the spr value unless under the critical condition in this case spr was increased due to the seed effect from crystal particle transfer in the case of the sec a trend similar to the recovery rate s was identified except for the critical condition fig 13c in this study aiming for a high water recovery rate for sgpw management with a near zld the recommended optimal operating conditions are 0 2 m s of feed cfv and 30 c of tcr with a maximum recovery rate of 84 it is mandatory though to select the optimal operating parameters for a high rate of water recovery mineral recovery from wastewater and low energy desalination as a result it was revealed that the crystal particle transfer can significantly affect the performance degradation of mdc there are two options to prevent performance degradation of the mdc process the first one is the control of operating parameters below the critical condition to avoid crystal particle transfer the other is an additional process which can separate the transferred crystal particles from the crystallizer to the membrane module for example a physical filtration process which has been used in the water treatment field could be a first option because it has been verified by csd analysis that most of the crystal particles are larger than 1 μm fig 9 additionally a sedimentation process can be another option based on the xrd result that the crystal components are identified as caco3 and nacl which have larger densities than water fig 10 4 conclusions although the mdc process has several advantages for sgpw management its technological feasibility is largely determined by operational obstacles membrane scaling energy consumption and its complexity of operation in this work the feasibility of a mdc process for sgpw management was systemically evaluated in the aspects of water production mineral recovery and energy consumption the main conclusions drawn from this study are summarized as follows the water productivity of the mdc process from sgpw was evaluated by optimizing the main operating parameters maximum recovery rate was 84 under 0 2 m s of feed cfv and 30 c of tcr conditions however the rejection rate for vocs which have a low molecular weight such as methylene chloride was only 3 85 this suggests that an adequate pretreatment for vocs prior to mdc is mandatory in case of scale up or long time operation for actual application in terms of mineral recovery mdc could adequately recover calcite and halite from sgpw with 2 72 kg m2day tcr was identified as a more important parameter than feed cfv which decides crystallization performance sustainable operation of mdc could be acquired by optimizing the operating parameters via controlling the crystal particle transfer and consequently minimizing scale formation the sec of mdc was increased by increasing feed cfv and decreasing tcr at optimal operating conditions the sec of mdc was 28 2 kwh m3 with a 74 recovery rate which shows the potential to be economically competitive with the conventional zld process mdc performance was maximized by appropriate control of operating parameters in the case of not only water recovery but also for other purposes such as mineral recovery and low energy desalination crystal particle transfer and secondary nucleation are the main causes of the mdc performance degradation it can be considered that these are effectively controlled by optimizing the operating parameters and or adding a crystal particle separation process such as physical filtration or sedimentation based on the conclusion it should be considered that practical application of mdc process for sgpw management could be possible only with employing and appropriate process control strategy and or developing novel module which integrates md and crystallizer together in one unit with effective scale collection and control
