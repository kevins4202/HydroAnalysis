9365,alfalfa medicago sativa l has played an important role in the grain for green program across the chinese loess plateau but has characteristically high water consumption long term growth significantly reduces soil water storage in the 0 1500 cm profile and results in an obvious decline of alfalfa yield fields planted with alfalfa for more than 8 years are often converted to annual crops winter wheat or corn but these annual crops planted after alfalfa suffer from low yield due to the reduced soil water content the objectives of this study were to determine the time required for soil water recovery in the 0 1500 cm profile after fields cropped for 15 years with alfalfa are converted to annual crops and to evaluate the impacts of cropping systems inter annual climatic variation and future climate change on the recovery time hydraulic parameters for six soil materials in the 0 1500 cm soil profile were calibrated using the measured soil water content in alfalfa fields from 2005 to 2020 and validated using soil water stable isotopic measurements in 2020 using the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate soil water dynamics in the 0 1500 cm profile and determine the recovery time in two cropping systems alfalfa wheat and alfalfa corn with 53 climatic realizations generated using random non repeat sequences drawn from 53 years of observed climatic data 1968 2020 and 20 future climate data series projected by 10 gcm models under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios 2021 2100 respectively the results showed that under the 53 climatic realizations the recovery time ranged from 14 to 44 years with a median of 27 years for the alfalfa wheat system and from 11 to 31 years with a median of 18 years for the alfalfa corn system under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the median recovery times were 37 5 and 42 5 years for the alfalfa wheat system and 30 and 31 5 years for the alfalfa corn system respectively considering the long term effects of alfalfa growth on land productivity planting areas and growing time of alfalfa should be restricted to maintain sustainable agriculture in the study region keywords loess plateau soil water recovery cropping system inter annual climatic variations future climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction alfalfa medicago sativa l a leguminous plant has been planted for more than 2000 years on the chinese loess plateau clp li and huang 2008 mainly in an alfalfa crop rotation alfalfa has a deep rooted system that can make use of water in the deep soil and therefore has excellent drought resistance fan et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 2019 as such it was often used as the preferred grass species for soil and water conservation in the arid and semi arid loess plateau alfalfa is also a high quality and productive forage crop with yields of up to 48 t ha 1 y 1 during its peak growth period 2 8 years under natural conditions on the clp li 2002 to reduce soil erosion improve environmental quality and meet livestock requirements the area cropped with alfalfa has significantly increased on the clp since the 1990 s under the promotion of the grain for green program li and huang 2008 compared to annual crops alfalfa grows vigorously in summer and has developed deep rooted high yield high water consumption caiserman and faour 2021 jiang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 li and huang 2008 noted that the yield of rotated alfalfa was strongly affected by its age and the soil water deficit with the yield decreasing at a rate of 0 629 t ha 1 y 1 soil water storage in the 0 500 cm profile decreasing by 33 5 mm y 1 and yield after more than 8 years having a strong response to seasonal precipitation variation successive years of planting alfalfa not only reduces alfalfa yields but also further depletes soil water content consequently resulting in the formation of deep dry soil layers ali et al 2021 li and huang 2008 land use change is an effective means of soil water recovery which can impact the regional hydrological cycle especially soil water content and ground water recharge huang et al 2016 yu et al 2020 li et al 2019 to better meet livestock requirements improve dry soil conditions and replenish deep soil water alfalfa older than 8 years is often cut and the land reconverted to cropland corn or winter wheat however corn and winter wheat planted after alfalfa usually suffer from low yields due to reduced available soil water li and huang 2008 mccallum et al 2001 after replacing alfalfa with corn or winter wheat determining the time required for soil water recovery by field experiments is difficult and requires considerable time and effort the recovery time is defined as the amount of time required for a field just cut of alfalfa to recover to the same soil water content as a field that has instead been cropped with wheat or corn numerical modelling is an efficient and alternative approach to determine the recovery time after cutting alfalfa by simulating soil water dynamics and comparing the results to values in areas planted with winter wheat or corn among several possible models including shaw flerchinger 2000 soil jansson and halldin 1980 seep w geo slope international ltd 2018 geotop endrizzi et al 2014 and coup jansson and karlberg 2001 the hydrus 1d model was selected as an effective tool for modelling one dimensional soil moisture dynamics following land use change on the clp bai et al 2020 2021 hansson et al 2004 li et al 2019 the main reasons are that the hydrus 1d model is not limited to any particular spatial or temporal scale and has been widely evaluated and applied on the clp li et al 2019 bai et al 2020 the recovery time after cutting alfalfa is affected by the cropping system used for comparison continuously planting winter wheat or corn in this study inter annual climatic variations and future climate change the growth periods of corn and winter wheat are very different on the clp with corn from april to october and winter wheat from september to june of the following year the different growth times for corn and winter wheat will directly lead to different water consumption by the plants which will affect the soil water recovery time the clp has a large inter annual climatic variations based on climate data from 1968 to 2020 the minimum and maximum annual precipitation values for this period are 296 mm 1995 and 954 3 mm 2003 respectively with a coefficient of variation of 23 0 the minimum and maximum annual potential evapotranspiration pet values are 846 9 mm 1989 and 1243 8 mm 1995 respectively with a coefficient of variation of 9 2 these large inter annual variations make it challenging to determine the soil water recovery time after cutting alfalfa on the clp previous studies show the temperature in china is expected to increase by 1 3 5 c by the end of this century chen and sun 2015 with the clp climate already showing an obvious warmer and wetter trend over several decades due to the influence of global warming li and jin 2017 xin et al 2011 the higher temperature lead to an increasing rate of pet which can prolong the soil water recovery time after cutting alfalfa therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the time of soil water recovery in the 0 1500 cm profile after areas planted for 15 years with alfalfa are converted to annual crops and 2 assess the impacts of cropping systems alfalfa wheat alfalfa converted to winter wheat and alfalfa corn alfalfa converted to corn inter annual climatic variations and future climate change on the recovery time 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the wangdonggou catchment changwu county shanxi province 35 13 n 107 40 e fig 1 this catchment is in a gully region of the loess plateau and covers an area of 8 3 km2 with elevations ranging from 937 to 1239 m above sea level this area has a continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature and precipitation of 9 8 and 592 5 mm 1981 2020 respectively precipitation has large inter annual variability and most falls from june to september a weather station was installed in the tableland of the wangdonggou catchment to monitor air temperature relative humidity wind speed radiation etc crops and alfalfa are not irrigated in this area the groundwater level is about 80 m below the soil surface without any upward capillary flow into the root zone 2 2 field experiments a long term alfalfa experimental plot was established in 2005 to investigate the impact of alfalfa growth on soil water depletion the length and width of the plot are both 1000 cm before the plot was established the land was cropped for more than 60 years from 2005 2020 soil water measurements in the 0 1500 cm soil profile were conducted five times august 20 2005 august 19 2007 october 13 2009 october 19 2012 and september 17 2020 the stable isotope profile of soil water from 0 to 1500 cm depth was measured one time on september 17 2020 in addition three temporary alfalfa experimental plots were chosen to measure root distribution and its change with growing age in august 2021 the continuous growing durations of alfalfa at the three plots were 3 6 and 15 years respectively fig 2 the lai values of alfalfa were measured during the growing seasons using an lai 2200 c plant canopy analyzer soil profile samples were taken using a hand auger 4 cm in diameter in 10 cm increments at depths from 0 to 100 cm and in 20 cm increments at depths from 100 to 1500 cm soil water content was determined using the gravimetric method samples taken from each layer on september 17 2020 were separated into three batches of subsamples the first for determining water content the second to measure particle size distribution using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments england and the third for determining soil water isotopic composition the third batch of subsamples were placed into 10 ml glass vials sealed with parafilm kept frozen 20 c and returned to the laboratory for soil water 2h and 18o measurements the measured soil water stable isotope profile was used to validate the hydraulic parameters stumpp and hendry 2012 huang et al 2015 in the laboratory soil water was extracted from the third batch of subsamples by the cryogenic vacuum distillation method at a temperature of 105 for 180 min which ensured more than 99 of the water was extracted the extracted water samples were measured by an isotopic liquid water analyzer gla431 tlwia with a precision of 0 2 for δ2h and 0 03 for δ18o the isotopic compositions of δ18o and δ2h are expressed as an isotope ratio 1 δ sample r sample r vsmow 1 where δ sample is the isotopic composition δ2h or δ18o of the sample and r sample and r vsmow are the 18o 16o or 2h 1h ratios in the sample and standard respectively the isotopic compositions 2h to 1h and 18o to 16o ratios of the samples were normalized relative to the vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water standard set by the international atomic energy agency alfalfa roots were sampled using the soil coring method inside diameter 90 mm as suggested by zhou and shangguan 2007 at 10 cm increments in the upper 100 cm soil layer and at 20 cm increments in the 100 1000 cm soil layer three soil cores were randomly sampled in each study plot roots were separated from the soil by washing them over a sieve under running tap water dead roots were identified based on color and discarded roots were collected and placed on transparent plastic paper for scanning at 300 dpi canon lide 120 canon inc tokyo japan root surface area was measured with winrhizo regent instruments inc canada fine root area density frad surface area of root per unit soil volume m2 m 3 was determined for every 20 cm soil layer 2 3 numerical modelling 2 3 1 controlling equations the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate soil water dynamics in the alfalfa study plots from august 20 2005 to september 17 2020 and soil water recovery in the 0 1500 cm profile after cutting alfalfa the governing equation was the richards equation for one

is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and s is a source sink term representing root water uptake transport of soil water stable isotopes in plots cropped with alfalfa was simulated using a modified version of hydrus 1d for isotope transport stumpp et al 2012 huang et al 2015 in the modified version isotopic fractionation was simply assumed not to occur at the upper boundary due to evaporation i e both water isotopes evaporate at the same rate stumpp et al 2012 the governing equation for stable isotope transport is described as follows 3 θ c t z θ d c z qc z sc where c is the isotope concentration q is the soil water flux cm d 1 and d is the dispersion coefficient cm2 d 1 which is defined by bear 1972 4 d λ l q θ d w τ w where λ l is the longitudinal dispersity which is

soil hydraulic parameters a root water uptake function and specific initial and boundary conditions 2 3 2 soil hydraulic parameters the water retention characteristic θ h and hydraulic conductivity

parameters affecting the shape of the retention curves in this study the value of l is fixed to 0 5 2 3 3 root water uptake the sink term in eqs 2 and 3 represents the volume of water taken up by plant roots per unit bulk volume of the soil per unit time the rate is limited by the potential transpiration rate tp water stress response function μ h and root distribution function β z hydrus 1d incorporates these relationships and results in a root water uptake function as follows feddes et al 1974 8 s z t α h β z t p 9 α h h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 3 h h 4 1 h 3 h h 2 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 1 h h 2 0 h h 4

e µ lai where µ is an extinction coefficient and its value of 0 463 was used in this study ritchie 1972 the five pressure heads h1 h2 h3max h3min and h4 were determined based on previous studies on alfalfa taylor and ashcroft 1972 and had values of 15 30 1500 1500 and 8000 cm respectively β z for alfalfa was based on field measurements and varied with continuous growing time as shown in fig 2 we assumed that alfalfa root distribution did not change during the short periods the measured root distributions at aged of 3 6 and 15 years were used to represent the periods of 2005 2009 2009 2012 and 2012 2020 respectively 2 4 calibration and validation of hydraulic parameters the soil water profiles measured from 2005 to 2020 in the alfalfa plots were used to calibrate hydraulic parameters which were then validated using the measured profile of soil water stable isotopes according to the u s department of agriculture usda soil classification system iuss working group wrb 2015 only two soil textural types silt loam and silty clay loam were present in the 0 1500 cm profile with mean sand silt and clay contents of 7 7 66 2 and 26 2 respectively and corresponding standard deviations of 2 0 1 7 and 3 0 the measured bulk densities varied from 1 20 to 1 47 g cm 3 with a mean value of 1 33 g cm 3 xiang et al 2021 based on the variations of soil texture and bulk density in the 0 1500 cm soil profile we divided the whole profile into eight layers which were described using six soil materials silt loam 1 silt loam 2 silty clay loam 1 and silty clay loam 2 silt loam 3 and silt loam 4 table 1 the initial drying curves for all materials were estimated using the arya paris pedotransfer function arya and paris 1981 huang et al 2011b and then eq 5 was fitted to the data to obtain the other parameters θ r θ s α and n using the least square optimization program retc van genuchten et al 1991 the initial ks value for each material was calculated using the kozeny carman equation based on the measured soil particle distribution huang et al 2011c the initial values of θ r θ s α n and ks for six materials were then used in hydrus 1d to simulate soil water dynamics in sites cropped with alfalfa from 2005 to 2020 the measured soil water profile on september 20 2005 was used as the initial condition the upper boundary condition was set to be the atmospheric condition and the lower boundary condition was free drainage without any calibration the simulated soil water content profiles were not in good agreement with the measured values in order to improve calibration process we firstly conducted the uncertainty analysis for all 30 hydraulic parameters using morris screening method li et al 2018 based on the sensitivity order among 30 hydraulic parameters the values of θ r θ s α n and ks for each material were adjusted until the difference between measured and simulated water contents for alfalfa plots was minimized the objective function was the least square error lse between the measured and simulated soil water contents 13 lse i 1 n θ m θ e 2 where θ m and θ e are the measured and estimated soil water contents and n is the total number of measurements equal to 332 the transport of soil water stable isotopes in the alfalfa plots was simulated based on eq 3 using the calibrated hydraulic parameters for each material and specified initial and boundary conditions long term measurements of the stable isotopes of water in precipitation were not available for the study site so the monthly weighted averages for 1985 1992 from xian and 2005 and 2009 2013 from changwu were used for modelling li et al 2017 as shown in fig 3 the local meteoric water line for the study site is δ 2 h 7 40 δ 18 o 4 41 because the initial profile water stable isotope was not available when the cropland was converted to alfalfa a spin up mode was used to determine the initial profile of the water stable isotopes with meteorological data from 1957 to 2005 and average monthly isotope values thornton and rosenbloom 2005 from 1957 2005 the experimental plot was assumed to have been planted with winter wheat values of tp μ h and β z for winter wheat are provided in 2 5 in the spin up mode long term climate data were repeated until the final profile of water stable isotopes reached a steady state with respect to a particular combination of atmospheric forces average monthly isotope values physiological parameters and the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters comparison of the simulated and measured water stable isotope profiles was used to validate the calibrated hydraulic parameters the mean error me root mean square error rmse and determining coefficient r2 were used to estimate the precision of the simulated values with respect the measured values 2 5 simulations of soil water recovery the calibrated and validated hydraulic parameters were then used to simulate soil water recovery under a series of hypothetical scenarios after cutting alfalfa including different cropping systems different inter annual climatic variations and future climate change the effects of cropping systems and climate change on the soil water recovery were analyzed 2 5 1 cropping system scenarios four cropping system scenarios were selected based on the actual practices of farmers in the study area the alfalfa wheat scenario assumed the land was cropped with winter wheat after cutting alfalfa the wheat wheat scenario assumed the land was continually cropped with winter wheat since september 20 2005 the alfalfa corn scenario assumed the land was cropped with corn after cutting alfalfa the corn corn scenario assumed the land was continually cropped with corn since september 20 2005 the wheat wheat and corn corn scenarios provide the basis for comparing soil water recovery in the alfalfa wheat and alfalfa corn scenarios after alfalfa cutting respectively 2 5 2 inter annual climatic variations inter annual climate on the clp is characterized by large variations with an 11 year climatic cycle observed shen 1991 in this study the impacts of inter annual climatic variations on the duration of soil water recovery were simulated using 53 climatic realizations generated using 53 years of climate data from 1968 to 2020 huang and gallichand 2006 each climatic realization was obtained by selecting without replacement a random sequence of 53 years assuming a uniform probability distribution the duration of 53 years was sufficiently long to cover all inter annual climatic variability the probability distribution for soil water recovery durations was analyzed based on 53 realizations which include almost all potential inter annual climatic variations 2 5 3 future climate change previous studies confirm an obvious warmer and wetter climatic trend on the loess plateau over several decades due to the influence of global warming li et al 2010 lu et al 2012 xin et al 2011 future climate change will have an obvious impact on the duration of soil water recovery after cutting alfalfa future climate data for 2021 2100 were from the world climate research programme wcrp s coupled model intercomparison program phase 6 cmip6 multi model dataset two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios with medium low rcp 4 5 and high rcp 8 5 emissions were selected to represent future climate scenarios from 2021 to 2100 to better predict the duration of soil water recovery after cutting alfalfa we compared the historical meteorological data simulated by 27 different general circulation models gcms with the actual meteorological data 1976 2005 and selected 10 future meteorological data series projected by the gcms including access cm2 acc1 access esm1 acc2 canesm5 canoe can2 cnrm cm6 1 hr cnr3 fgoals g3 fgoa inm cm4 8 inm1 inm cm5 0 inm2 mpi esm1 2 hr mpi1 mpi esm1 2 lr mpi2 and mri esm2 0 mtie 2 5 4 plant parameters and initial and boundary conditions a total of 252 models were generated including four cropping system scenarios 53 historic climatic realizations and 10 future climate projections 4 53 4 10 in each model lai was specified for winter wheat or corn and was not adjusted in response to inter annual climatic variation a fixed root system distribution in the 0 300 cm soil profile for winter wheat miao et al 1989 yang et al 2021 and in the 0 250 cm soil profile for corn lin et al 2016 thidar et al 2020 was used for the simulation of soil water recovery based on previous studies values of h1 h2 h3 max h3 min and h4 in eq 9 were 0 1 500 900 and 16000 cm for winter wheat and 15 30 325 600 and 8000 cm for corn respectively wesseling 1991 the initial soil water profiles for the different land use scenarios are shown in fig 4 soil water profiles for the alfalfa wheat and alfalfa corn scenarios were considered recovered when the absolute difference in profile averaged soil water content between the alfalfa wheat and wheat wheat scenarios and between the alfalfa corn and corn corn scenarios was equal to or less than 0 005 m3 m 3 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation 3 1 1 uncertainty analysis of hydraulic parameters uncertainty analysis can improve the reliability of model simulation wu et al 2021 uncertainty in hydrological models mainly results from model parameters model structure data inputs uncertainty and boundary conditions song et al 2011 the input data were based on field measurements whereas the model structure and boundary conditions of hydrus 1d have been widely evaluated and applied in the study area li et al 2019 bai et al 2020 therefore the uncertainty of hydraulic parameters was only estimated via sensitivity analysis in this study morris screening method was used to estimate the sensitivities of 30 hydraulic parameters table s1 and the detail steps of morris screening method could be found in li et al 2018 the sensitivity of 30 hydraulic parameters in descending order was n2 θs2 n1 n4 n5 n6 θr2 θs4 θs5 α2 θs6 θr1 θs3 θs1 α6 n3 α4 α1 θr5 θr4 α3 θr3 θr6 α5 ks6 ks4 ks2 ks3 ks1 and ks5 among each material the sensitivity of hydraulic parameters in the decreasing order was n θ s α θ r ks which were useful to improve the calibration and validation processes of hydraulic parameters 3 1 2 calibration and validation of hydraulic parameters the model calibration process involved the optimization of θ r θ s α n and ks values for each material by simulating soil water dynamics in the alfalfa plots to minimize the error between the measured and simulated θ values the optimized values of θ r θ s α n and ks for each soil material are shown in table 1 among the six materials the optimal θ s value varied from 0 454 to 0 493 cm3 cm 3 θ r value from 0 075 to 0 144 cm3 cm 3 α value from 0 007 to 0 064 cm 1 n value from 1 208 to 2 100 and ks value from 16 9 to 125 4 cm d 1 among the six materials the most clayey material in the profile was located at the 1000 1200 cm soil layer with the smallest ks and θ s values no 4 in table 1 a comparison of simulated and measured θ values in the 0 1500 cm profile is shown in fig 5 when using the optimal values of θ r θ s α n and ks for each material hydrus 1d can successfully capture the dynamic changes in θ in the profile small discrepancies occur in the 650 750 and 1000 1200 cm layers where θ changed rapidly these might be the result of soil textural change the natural soil profile typically reflects gradual changes between different soil textures however this is represented in the numerical model as a distinct break between two different materials which results in the discrepancies between the simulated and measured values the me rmse and r2 between the measured and simulated θ values are presented in table 2 the low me and rmse values and high r2 value indicate the simulated soil water profiles were in good agreement with the measured profiles using the calibrated values of θ r θ s α n and ks the δ 2 h profile in the alfalfa plot on september 17 2020 was simulated the comparison between the measured and simulated δ 2 h profiles in fig 6 shows the δ 2 h profile on september 17 2020 was simulated fairly accurately however large discrepancies between the simulated and measured δ2h values appeared in the 0 300 cm soil layer simulation of the δ2h profile was complicated by a number of factors the 0 300 cm soil layer is a zone of dynamic exchange of water and solutes driven by rainfall infiltration soil evaporation and plant transpiration some of which are not fully represented in this study the stable isotope composition of precipitation was not measured at the site during the study period and isotope fractionation was neglected in the model approach however given these limitations a reasonable fit was still achieved for the δ2h profile on september 17 2020 with low me and rmse values and a medium r2 value table 2 therefore the calibrated and validated hydraulic parameters for six materials in the 0 1500 cm profile were used to simulate soil water recovery after replacing alfalfa with different cropping systems and due to future climate change during the calibration and validation processes the relative error of water balance varied from 0 12 to 0 15 with a mean of 0 14 the water balance errors were much less than 1 the reasonable range requested for hydrological models wine et al 2015 which indicated that the hydrus 1d model with the calibrated hydraulic parameters had a high accuracy to simulate soil water dynamics with root uptake water 3 2 effects of inter annual climatic variations and cropping systems on recovery time under the same conditions of climate and initial soil water profile alfalfa grown for 15 years depleted more available soil water in the 0 1500 cm profile than winter wheat or corn fig 4 the average θ value in the 0 1500 cm profile on september 17 2020 was 0 20 cm3 cm 3 for alfalfa 0 24 cm3 cm 3 for winter wheat and 0 25 cm3 cm 3 for corn this corresponds to 662 8 and 872 8 mm less water in soils cropped with alfalfa compared to either winter wheat or corn respectively using the calibrated and validated hydraulic parameters for six materials hydrus 1d was used to simulate soil water variations in the 0 1500 cm profile under four scenarios with 53 random sequences of 53 climatic years 53 realizations the initial soil water profiles for alfalfa wheat alfalfa corn wheat wheat and corn corn scenarios are shown in fig 4 the recovery time was determined when the absolute difference in the profile average θ between the alfalfa wheat and wheat wheat scenarios and between the alfalfa corn and corn corn scenarios was less than 0 005 cm3 cm 3 fig 7 shows an example for which a 1500 cm deep soil profile took 26 years to recover from the depleting effect of alfalfa after replacing it with winter wheat beginning in september 2020 and 19 years after replacing it with corn beginning in april 2021 the simulations show the recovery time largely varies due to differences in cropping systems and inter annual climatic variations for the alfalfa wheat scenario the recovery time ranged from 14 to 44 years depending on which realization was used with a median of 27 years for the alfalfa corn scenario the recovery time varied from 11 to 31 years with a median of 18 years the cumulative frequency distributions of the recovery time for the alfalfa wheat and alfalfa corn scenarios are shown in fig 8 for the alfalfa wheat scenario the recovery time was from 25 to 29 years with a maximum probability of 35 and for the alfalfa corn scenario was from 17 to 20 years with a maximum probability of 40 under the 53 climatic realizations the relative error of water mass balance ranged from 0 04 to 0 06 with a mean of 0 05 for the alfalfa wheat system and from 0 06 to 0 08 with a mean of 0 07 for the alfalfa corn system the high accuracies indicated that the hydrus 1d model with the calibrated hydraulic parameters and historical climate data could provide reliable results for the soil water recovery time after cutting alfalfa the results obtained under these simulations show the important impact of cropping systems precipitation is the sole source of soil water replenishment on the clp this water infiltrates into the soil and is partly absorbed by plants and partly lost to evaporation and deep percolation different cropping systems change the eta deep percolation and soil water storage runoff is zero for the flat cropland and therefore impact the time of deep soil water recovery the cumulative probability distributions of annual eta and deep percolation for the alfalfa wheat and alfalfa corn scenarios during the period of soil water recovery are shown in fig 9 annual eta values in the alfalfa wheat scenario varied from 319 0 to 773 6 mm with a median of 552 6 mm n 1419 and in the alfalfa corn scenario from 326 2 to 724 2 mm with a median of 534 0 mm n 980 annual deep percolation in the alfalfa wheat scenario varied from 1 4 to 17 7 mm with a median of 2 9 mm n 1419 and in the alfalfa corn scenario from 1 6 to 61 4 mm with a median of 3 8 mm n 980 during the period of deep soil water recovery the alfalfa corn scenario stored 17 7 mm more water annually than the alfalfa wheat scenario which resulted in the alfalfa corn scenario requiring a shorter time than the alfalfa wheat scenario to achieve deep soil water recovery fig 8 in addition to cropping systems the growing duration of alfalfa also impacts the recovery time li and huang 2008 measured soil water changes in the 0 1000 cm soil profile for 16 years after alfalfa planting their results indicated that the average soil water content had a significant decreasing trend in the 0 1000 cm profile with the growing duration from an initial value of 0 258 cm3 cm 3 to 0 224 cm3 cm 3 in the 5th year 0 167 cm3 cm 3 in the 12th year and 0 156 cm3 cm 3 in the 16th year this means that the soil water recovery time will increase with the growing duration of alfalfa for the same cropping system due to decreasing soil water therefore fields planted with alfalfa for more than 8 years are recommended to convert to annual crops because alfalfa mass yield starts to decrease after growing more than 8 years li and huang 2008 3 3 future climate change projected by 10 gcm models the values of mean and standard deviation std of predicted annual precipitation ap annual average temperature aat and pet by 10 gcm models under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios are shown in fig 10 with the measured values for the period 1968 2020 provided for comparison from 1968 2100 the ap and aat show significantly increasing trends under both scenarios p 0 05 the increasing rates of ap and aat are 1 0 mm y 1 and 0 03 y 1 under the rcp 4 5 scenario and 1 6 mm y 1 and 0 05 y 1 under the rcp 8 5 scenario respectively the calculated pet only significantly increases from 1968 to 2100 under the rcp 8 5 scenario with a rate of 0 751 mm y 1 overall the gcm models indicate the climate at the study site will become warmer and wetter in the future in terms of changes in aat and ap under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the mean std values for ap aat and pet are 78 6 mm 1 3 and 62 4 mm under the rcp 4 5 scenario and 246 6 mm 1 8 and 98 4 mm under the rcp 8 5 scenario respectively the large std values indicate the climatic variables predicted under the 10 gcm models vary considerably among the 10 gcm models the largest ap was predicted by the can3 model while the smallest ap was from inm1 model under both scenarios the highest aat was predicted by the can2 model and the lowest aat by the mpi1 model the gcms are useful tools to describe dynamic oceanic and atmospheric processes which can simulate the important aspects of current and future climate because each climate model has its own uncertainty integrating more climate models is a way to obtain more accurate predictions therefore the climatic variables projected by 10 gcm models were used to predict the time of deep soil water recovery after replacing alfalfa with wheat or corn crops 3 4 effect of future climate change on soil water recovery climate change has an important impact on deep soil water recovery to further clarify the specific impact of climate change 10 future meteorological data series from 2021 2100 projected by different gcm models were used to simulate the time of deep soil water recovery with the validated hydraulic parameters and the same initial soil water profiles as shown in fig 4 the final recovery time depends on the rcp scenario gcm model and cropping system under the rcp 4 5 scenario the recovery time varies from 16 to 68 years with a median of 37 5 years for the alfalfa wheat scenario and from 13 to 56 years with a median of 30 years for the alfalfa corn scenario fig 11 under the rcp 8 5 scenario the recovery time varies from 15 to 67 years with a median of 42 5 years for the alfalfa wheat scenario and from 13 to 61 years with a median of 31 5 years for the alfalfa corn scenario fig 11 for the same cropping system the recovery time is longer under the rcp 8 5 scenario than under the rcp 4 5 scenario calculating the water balance components for the two cropping systems under both rcp scenarios shows both cropping systems have a larger eta under the rcp 8 5 scenario than under the rcp 4 5 scenario which is mainly driven by the larger pet value under the rcp 8 5 scenario table 3 under the rcp 4 5 scenario the median annual increases in soil water storage in the 0 1500 cm profile are 16 8 and 28 7 mm y 1 for the alfalfa wheat and alfalfa corn scenarios respectively under the rcp 8 5 scenario these values are 13 9 and 18 6 mm y 1 respectively the low annual increase in soil water storage under the rcp 8 5 scenario for both cropping systems results in more time needed for deep soil water recovery under future climate conditions the alfalfa wheat system needs 7 5 10 years more recovery time than the alfalfa corn system this is because the annual increase in soil water storage in the 0 1500 cm profile is larger for the alfalfa corn system 28 7 mm y 1 under the rcp 4 5 scenario and 18 6 mm y 1 under the rcp 8 5 scenario than for the alfalfa wheat system 16 8 mm y 1 under the rcp 4 5 scenario and 13 9 mm y 1 under the rcp 8 5 scenario under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the relative error of water balance ranged from 0 01 to 0 02 with a mean error of 0 01 for both cropping systems the low relative errors indicated that the hydrus 1d model with the calibrated hydraulic parameters and projected climate data provided confident predictions for the soil water recovery time under future climate conditions both cropping systems require a longer recovery time than would have been the case under historical climate conditions fig 8 vs fig 11 the main reason is that soil water storage depends on pet and ap li 2002 li and huang 2008 and the aridity index of pet ap is higher under future climate conditions compared to historical climate conditions for both cropping systems which results in a lower increase in soil water storage under historical climatic conditions the median of aridity index was 1 22 under the rcp 4 5 scenario the median of aridity index varies from 1 64 to 1 82 predicted by 10 gcm models under the rcp 8 5 scenario this value varies from 1 51 to 1 88 although the predicted ap increases in the future climate on clp compared with the historical climate the increasing trend in temperature is more than that in precipitation which plays an important role to impact on pet and consequently on the soil water recovery time recovery times for deep soil water profiles have been reported after converting apple trees or alfalfa into annual crops on the clp for example huang and gallichand 2006 found that it will take 6 5 19 5 years with a mean of 13 7 years to achieve soil water recovery in a 1000 cm soil profile after converting a 30 year apple orchard to winter wheat when a 22 year apple orchard was converted into annual crops the dry soil profile from 0 to 1500 cm required 26 years to recover water storage values similar to farmland zhang et al 2020 ali et al 2021 reported that it takes 23 years for the 0 1000 cm soil water profile to recover after converting a 10 year alfalfa crop into annual crops compared to previous works the findings of this study indicate even longer soil water recovery times especially under future climate conditions the recovery time depends on the initial soil water profile after converting alfalfa or apple orchards into annual crops climate conditions and cropping systems in this study after the 15 year old alfalfa was cut the soil water storage in the 0 1500 cm profile was 2936 9 mm less than the value of 3599 7 mm for plots cropped with winter wheat and 3819 5 mm in plots cropped with corn this difference in soil water storage between the alfalfa and annual crops is larger than reported in previous studies in this study 53 climatic realizations were used to simulate soil water recovery for two cropping systems with most of the inter annual climatic variabilities in the study area taken into consideration thus the median recovery times are more reasonable than previous results obtained using specific climate data zhang et al 2020 ali et al 2021 although future climate data projected by different gcm models under two rcp scenarios present large difference fan et al 2021 peng et al 2013 a warmer climate in the future for the loess plateau will result in a longer recovery time for deep soil water profile after cutting alfalfa than estimates based on historical climate conditions 4 conclusions the impacts of climate change and cropping systems on deep soil water recovery in 0 1500 cm soil profiles on the clp after converting alfalfa to annual crops were evaluated using the hydrus 1d model recovery time is defined as the amount of time required for a field just cut of alfalfa to recover to the same soil water content as a field that has been cropped with wheat or corn over the long term soil hydraulic parameters for six materials in the 0 1500 cm profile were calibrated using soil water measurements in alfalfa plots taken from 2005 to 2020 and validated using soil water stable isotopic measurements from samples taken on september 17 2020 from an alfalfa plot a total of 53 climatic realizations were generated using random non repeat sequences drawn from the observed 53 year climatic data 1968 2020 and used to simulate the impact of inter annual climate variability on soil water recovery time in addition 10 future climate data series projected by 10 gcm models under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios 2021 2100 were used to assess the impact of future climate change on soil water recovery time the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the results of 53 climatic realizations showed the recovery time for soil water in the 0 1500 cm soil profile ranged from 14 to 44 years with a median of 27 years for the alfalfa wheat system and 11 31 years with a median of 18 years for the alfalfa corn system 2 under the rcp 4 5 scenario the median recovery time based on 10 gcm models was 37 5 years for the alfalfa wheat system and 30 years for the alfalfa corn system under the rcp 8 5 scenario the corresponding values were 42 5 and 31 5 years 3 although these simulations do not replace local climate change predictions they do show the important impacts of inter annual climatic variations future climate change and cropping systems on deep soil water recovery considering the long term effects of alfalfa growth on land productivity planting areas and growing time of alfalfa should be restricted to maintain sustainable agriculture in the study region based on the changes of

9365,alfalfa medicago sativa l has played an important role in the grain for green program across the chinese loess plateau but has characteristically high water consumption long term growth significantly reduces soil water storage in the 0 1500 cm profile and results in an obvious decline of alfalfa yield fields planted with alfalfa for more than 8 years are often converted to annual crops winter wheat or corn but these annual crops planted after alfalfa suffer from low yield due to the reduced soil water content the objectives of this study were to determine the time required for soil water recovery in the 0 1500 cm profile after fields cropped for 15 years with alfalfa are converted to annual crops and to evaluate the impacts of cropping systems inter annual climatic variation and future climate change on the recovery time hydraulic parameters for six soil materials in the 0 1500 cm soil profile were calibrated using the measured soil water content in alfalfa fields from 2005 to 2020 and validated using soil water stable isotopic measurements in 2020 using the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate soil water dynamics in the 0 1500 cm profile and determine the recovery time in two cropping systems alfalfa wheat and alfalfa corn with 53 climatic realizations generated using random non repeat sequences drawn from 53 years of observed climatic data 1968 2020 and 20 future climate data series projected by 10 gcm models under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios 2021 2100 respectively the results showed that under the 53 climatic realizations the recovery time ranged from 14 to 44 years with a median of 27 years for the alfalfa wheat system and from 11 to 31 years with a median of 18 years for the alfalfa corn system under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the median recovery times were 37 5 and 42 5 years for the alfalfa wheat system and 30 and 31 5 years for the alfalfa corn system respectively considering the long term effects of alfalfa growth on land productivity planting areas and growing time of alfalfa should be restricted to maintain sustainable agriculture in the study region keywords loess plateau soil water recovery cropping system inter annual climatic variations future climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction alfalfa medicago sativa l a leguminous plant has been planted for more than 2000 years on the chinese loess plateau clp li and huang 2008 mainly in an alfalfa crop rotation alfalfa has a deep rooted system that can make use of water in the deep soil and therefore has excellent drought resistance fan et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 2019 as such it was often used as the preferred grass species for soil and water conservation in the arid and semi arid loess plateau alfalfa is also a high quality and productive forage crop with yields of up to 48 t ha 1 y 1 during its peak growth period 2 8 years under natural conditions on the clp li 2002 to reduce soil erosion improve environmental quality and meet livestock requirements the area cropped with alfalfa has significantly increased on the clp since the 1990 s under the promotion of the grain for green program li and huang 2008 compared to annual crops alfalfa grows vigorously in summer and has developed deep rooted high yield high water consumption caiserman and faour 2021 jiang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 li and huang 2008 noted that the yield of rotated alfalfa was strongly affected by its age and the soil water deficit with the yield decreasing at a rate of 0 629 t ha 1 y 1 soil water storage in the 0 500 cm profile decreasing by 33 5 mm y 1 and yield after more than 8 years having a strong response to seasonal precipitation variation successive years of planting alfalfa not only reduces alfalfa yields but also further depletes soil water content consequently resulting in the formation of deep dry soil layers ali et al 2021 li and huang 2008 land use change is an effective means of soil water recovery which can impact the regional hydrological cycle especially soil water content and ground water recharge huang et al 2016 yu et al 2020 li et al 2019 to better meet livestock requirements improve dry soil conditions and replenish deep soil water alfalfa older than 8 years is often cut and the land reconverted to cropland corn or winter wheat however corn and winter wheat planted after alfalfa usually suffer from low yields due to reduced available soil water li and huang 2008 mccallum et al 2001 after replacing alfalfa with corn or winter wheat determining the time required for soil water recovery by field experiments is difficult and requires considerable time and effort the recovery time is defined as the amount of time required for a field just cut of alfalfa to recover to the same soil water content as a field that has instead been cropped with wheat or corn numerical modelling is an efficient and alternative approach to determine the recovery time after cutting alfalfa by simulating soil water dynamics and comparing the results to values in areas planted with winter wheat or corn among several possible models including shaw flerchinger 2000 soil jansson and halldin 1980 seep w geo slope international ltd 2018 geotop endrizzi et al 2014 and coup jansson and karlberg 2001 the hydrus 1d model was selected as an effective tool for modelling one dimensional soil moisture dynamics following land use change on the clp bai et al 2020 2021 hansson et al 2004 li et al 2019 the main reasons are that the hydrus 1d model is not limited to any particular spatial or temporal scale and has been widely evaluated and applied on the clp li et al 2019 bai et al 2020 the recovery time after cutting alfalfa is affected by the cropping system used for comparison continuously planting winter wheat or corn in this study inter annual climatic variations and future climate change the growth periods of corn and winter wheat are very different on the clp with corn from april to october and winter wheat from september to june of the following year the different growth times for corn and winter wheat will directly lead to different water consumption by the plants which will affect the soil water recovery time the clp has a large inter annual climatic variations based on climate data from 1968 to 2020 the minimum and maximum annual precipitation values for this period are 296 mm 1995 and 954 3 mm 2003 respectively with a coefficient of variation of 23 0 the minimum and maximum annual potential evapotranspiration pet values are 846 9 mm 1989 and 1243 8 mm 1995 respectively with a coefficient of variation of 9 2 these large inter annual variations make it challenging to determine the soil water recovery time after cutting alfalfa on the clp previous studies show the temperature in china is expected to increase by 1 3 5 c by the end of this century chen and sun 2015 with the clp climate already showing an obvious warmer and wetter trend over several decades due to the influence of global warming li and jin 2017 xin et al 2011 the higher temperature lead to an increasing rate of pet which can prolong the soil water recovery time after cutting alfalfa therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the time of soil water recovery in the 0 1500 cm profile after areas planted for 15 years with alfalfa are converted to annual crops and 2 assess the impacts of cropping systems alfalfa wheat alfalfa converted to winter wheat and alfalfa corn alfalfa converted to corn inter annual climatic variations and future climate change on the recovery time 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the wangdonggou catchment changwu county shanxi province 35 13 n 107 40 e fig 1 this catchment is in a gully region of the loess plateau and covers an area of 8 3 km2 with elevations ranging from 937 to 1239 m above sea level this area has a continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature and precipitation of 9 8 and 592 5 mm 1981 2020 respectively precipitation has large inter annual variability and most falls from june to september a weather station was installed in the tableland of the wangdonggou catchment to monitor air temperature relative humidity wind speed radiation etc crops and alfalfa are not irrigated in this area the groundwater level is about 80 m below the soil surface without any upward capillary flow into the root zone 2 2 field experiments a long term alfalfa experimental plot was established in 2005 to investigate the impact of alfalfa growth on soil water depletion the length and width of the plot are both 1000 cm before the plot was established the land was cropped for more than 60 years from 2005 2020 soil water measurements in the 0 1500 cm soil profile were conducted five times august 20 2005 august 19 2007 october 13 2009 october 19 2012 and september 17 2020 the stable isotope profile of soil water from 0 to 1500 cm depth was measured one time on september 17 2020 in addition three temporary alfalfa experimental plots were chosen to measure root distribution and its change with growing age in august 2021 the continuous growing durations of alfalfa at the three plots were 3 6 and 15 years respectively fig 2 the lai values of alfalfa were measured during the growing seasons using an lai 2200 c plant canopy analyzer soil profile samples were taken using a hand auger 4 cm in diameter in 10 cm increments at depths from 0 to 100 cm and in 20 cm increments at depths from 100 to 1500 cm soil water content was determined using the gravimetric method samples taken from each layer on september 17 2020 were separated into three batches of subsamples the first for determining water content the second to measure particle size distribution using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments england and the third for determining soil water isotopic composition the third batch of subsamples were placed into 10 ml glass vials sealed with parafilm kept frozen 20 c and returned to the laboratory for soil water 2h and 18o measurements the measured soil water stable isotope profile was used to validate the hydraulic parameters stumpp and hendry 2012 huang et al 2015 in the laboratory soil water was extracted from the third batch of subsamples by the cryogenic vacuum distillation method at a temperature of 105 for 180 min which ensured more than 99 of the water was extracted the extracted water samples were measured by an isotopic liquid water analyzer gla431 tlwia with a precision of 0 2 for δ2h and 0 03 for δ18o the isotopic compositions of δ18o and δ2h are expressed as an isotope ratio 1 δ sample r sample r vsmow 1 where δ sample is the isotopic composition δ2h or δ18o of the sample and r sample and r vsmow are the 18o 16o or 2h 1h ratios in the sample and standard respectively the isotopic compositions 2h to 1h and 18o to 16o ratios of the samples were normalized relative to the vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water standard set by the international atomic energy agency alfalfa roots were sampled using the soil coring method inside diameter 90 mm as suggested by zhou and shangguan 2007 at 10 cm increments in the upper 100 cm soil layer and at 20 cm increments in the 100 1000 cm soil layer three soil cores were randomly sampled in each study plot roots were separated from the soil by washing them over a sieve under running tap water dead roots were identified based on color and discarded roots were collected and placed on transparent plastic paper for scanning at 300 dpi canon lide 120 canon inc tokyo japan root surface area was measured with winrhizo regent instruments inc canada fine root area density frad surface area of root per unit soil volume m2 m 3 was determined for every 20 cm soil layer 2 3 numerical modelling 2 3 1 controlling equations the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate soil water dynamics in the alfalfa study plots from august 20 2005 to september 17 2020 and soil water recovery in the 0 1500 cm profile after cutting alfalfa the governing equation was the richards equation for one

is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and s is a source sink term representing root water uptake transport of soil water stable isotopes in plots cropped with alfalfa was simulated using a modified version of hydrus 1d for isotope transport stumpp et al 2012 huang et al 2015 in the modified version isotopic fractionation was simply assumed not to occur at the upper boundary due to evaporation i e both water isotopes evaporate at the same rate stumpp et al 2012 the governing equation for stable isotope transport is described as follows 3 θ c t z θ d c z qc z sc where c is the isotope concentration q is the soil water flux cm d 1 and d is the dispersion coefficient cm2 d 1 which is defined by bear 1972 4 d λ l q θ d w τ w where λ l is the longitudinal dispersity which is equal to 3 cm in this study based on results reported by stumpp and hendry 2012 and huang et al 2015 d w is the molecular diffusion coefficient in free water cm2 d 1 and τ w is a tortuosity factor

soil hydraulic parameters a root water uptake function and specific initial and boundary conditions 2 3 2 soil hydraulic parameters the water retention characteristic θ h and hydraulic conductivity

parameters affecting the shape of the retention curves in this study the value of l is fixed to 0 5 2 3 3 root water uptake the sink term in eqs 2 and 3 represents the volume of water taken up by plant roots per unit bulk volume of the soil per unit time the rate is limited by the potential transpiration rate tp water stress response function μ h and root distribution function β z hydrus 1d incorporates these relationships and results in a root water uptake function as follows feddes et al 1974 8 s z t α h β z t p 9 α h h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 3 h h 4 1 h 3 h h 2 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 1 h h 2 0 h h 4

alfalfa taylor and ashcroft 1972 and had values of 15 30 1500 1500 and 8000 cm respectively β z for alfalfa was based on field measurements and varied with continuous growing time as shown in fig 2 we assumed that alfalfa root distribution did not change during the short periods the measured root distributions at aged of 3 6 and 15 years were used to represent the periods of 2005 2009 2009 2012 and 2012 2020 respectively 2 4 calibration and validation of hydraulic parameters the soil water profiles measured from 2005 to 2020 in the alfalfa plots were used to calibrate hydraulic parameters which were then validated using the measured profile of soil water stable isotopes according to the u s department of agriculture usda soil classification system iuss working group wrb 2015 only two soil textural types silt loam and silty clay loam were present in the 0 1500 cm profile with mean sand silt and clay contents of 7 7 66 2 and 26 2 respectively and corresponding standard deviations of 2 0 1 7 and 3 0 the measured bulk densities varied from 1 20 to 1 47 g cm 3 with a mean value of 1 33 g cm 3 xiang et al 2021 based on the variations of soil texture and bulk density in the 0 1500 cm soil profile we divided the whole profile into eight layers which were described using six soil materials silt loam 1 silt loam 2 silty clay loam 1 and silty clay loam 2 silt loam 3 and silt loam 4 table 1 the initial drying curves for all materials were estimated using the arya paris pedotransfer function arya and paris 1981 huang et al 2011b and then eq 5 was fitted to the data to obtain the other parameters θ r θ s α and n using the least square optimization program retc van genuchten et al 1991 the initial ks value for each material was calculated using the kozeny carman equation based on the measured soil particle distribution huang et al 2011c the initial values of θ r θ s α n and ks for six materials were then used in hydrus 1d to simulate soil water dynamics in sites cropped with alfalfa from 2005 to 2020 the measured soil water profile on september 20 2005 was used as the initial condition the upper boundary condition was set to be the atmospheric condition and the lower boundary condition was free drainage without any calibration the simulated soil water content profiles were not in good agreement with the measured values in order to improve calibration process we firstly conducted the uncertainty analysis for all 30 hydraulic parameters using morris screening method li et al 2018 based on the sensitivity order among 30 hydraulic parameters the values of θ r θ s α n and ks for each material were adjusted until the difference between measured and simulated water contents for alfalfa plots was minimized the objective function was the least square error lse between the measured and simulated soil water contents 13 lse i 1 n θ m θ e 2 where θ m and θ e are the measured and estimated soil water contents and n is the total number of measurements equal to 332 the transport of soil water stable isotopes in the alfalfa plots was simulated based on eq 3 using the calibrated hydraulic parameters for each material and specified initial and boundary conditions long term measurements of the stable isotopes of water in precipitation were not available for the study site so the monthly weighted averages for 1985 1992 from xian and 2005 and 2009 2013 from changwu were used for modelling li et al 2017 as shown in fig 3 the local meteoric water line for the study site is δ 2 h 7 40 δ 18 o 4 41 because the initial profile water stable isotope was not available when the cropland was converted to alfalfa a spin up mode was used to determine the initial profile of the water stable isotopes with meteorological data from 1957 to 2005 and average monthly isotope values thornton and rosenbloom 2005 from 1957 2005 the experimental plot was assumed to have been planted with winter wheat values of tp μ h and β z for winter wheat are provided in 2 5 in the spin up mode long term climate data were repeated until the final profile of water stable isotopes reached a steady state with respect to a particular combination of atmospheric forces average monthly isotope values physiological parameters and the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters comparison of the simulated and measured water stable isotope profiles was used to validate the calibrated hydraulic parameters the mean error me root mean square error rmse and determining coefficient r2 were used to estimate the precision of the simulated values with respect the measured values 2 5 simulations of soil water recovery the calibrated and validated hydraulic parameters were then used to simulate soil water recovery under a series of hypothetical scenarios after cutting alfalfa including different cropping systems different inter annual climatic variations and future climate change the effects of cropping systems and climate change on the soil water recovery were analyzed 2 5 1 cropping system scenarios four cropping system scenarios were selected based on the actual practices of farmers in the study area the alfalfa wheat scenario assumed the land was cropped with winter wheat after cutting alfalfa the wheat wheat scenario assumed the land was continually cropped with winter wheat since september 20 2005 the alfalfa corn scenario assumed the land was cropped with corn after cutting alfalfa the corn corn scenario assumed the land was continually cropped with corn since september 20 2005 the wheat wheat and corn corn scenarios provide the basis for comparing soil water recovery in the alfalfa wheat and alfalfa corn scenarios after alfalfa cutting respectively 2 5 2 inter annual climatic variations inter annual climate on the clp is characterized by large variations with an 11 year climatic cycle observed shen 1991 in this study the impacts of inter annual climatic variations on the duration of soil water recovery were simulated using 53 climatic realizations generated using 53 years of climate data from 1968 to 2020 huang and gallichand 2006 each climatic realization was obtained by selecting without replacement a random sequence of 53 years assuming a uniform probability distribution the duration of 53 years was sufficiently long to cover all inter annual climatic variability the probability distribution for soil water recovery durations was analyzed based on 53 realizations which include almost all potential inter annual climatic variations 2 5 3 future climate change previous studies confirm an obvious warmer and wetter climatic trend on the loess plateau over several decades due to the influence of global warming li et al 2010 lu et al 2012 xin et al 2011 future climate change will have an obvious impact on the duration of soil water recovery after cutting alfalfa future climate data for 2021 2100 were from the world climate research programme wcrp s coupled model intercomparison program phase 6 cmip6 multi model dataset two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios with medium low rcp 4 5 and high rcp 8 5 emissions were selected to represent future climate scenarios from 2021 to 2100 to better predict the duration of soil water recovery after cutting alfalfa we compared the historical meteorological data simulated by 27 different general circulation models gcms with the actual meteorological data 1976 2005 and selected 10 future meteorological data series projected by the gcms including access cm2 acc1 access esm1 acc2 canesm5 canoe can2 cnrm cm6 1 hr cnr3 fgoals g3 fgoa

cropping system scenarios 53 historic climatic realizations and 10 future climate projections 4 53 4 10 in each model lai was specified for winter wheat or corn and was not adjusted in response to inter annual climatic variation a fixed root system distribution in the 0 300 cm soil profile for winter wheat miao et al 1989 yang et al 2021 and in the 0 250 cm soil profile for corn lin et al 2016 thidar et al 2020 was used for the simulation of soil water recovery based on previous studies values of h1 h2 h3 max h3 min and h4 in eq 9 were 0 1 500 900 and 16000 cm for winter wheat and 15 30 325 600 and 8000 cm for corn respectively wesseling 1991 the initial soil water profiles for the different land use scenarios are shown in fig 4 soil water profiles for the alfalfa wheat and alfalfa corn scenarios were considered recovered when the absolute difference in profile averaged soil water content between the alfalfa wheat and wheat wheat scenarios and between the alfalfa corn and corn corn scenarios was equal to or less than 0 005 m3 m 3 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation 3 1 1 uncertainty analysis of hydraulic parameters uncertainty analysis can improve the reliability of model simulation wu et al 2021 uncertainty in hydrological models mainly results from model parameters model structure data inputs uncertainty and boundary conditions song et al 2011 the input data were based on field measurements whereas the model structure and boundary conditions of hydrus 1d have been widely evaluated and applied in the study area li et al 2019 bai et al 2020 therefore the uncertainty of hydraulic parameters was only estimated via sensitivity analysis in this study morris screening method was used to estimate the sensitivities of 30 hydraulic parameters table s1 and the detail steps of morris screening method could be found in li et al 2018 the sensitivity of 30 hydraulic parameters in descending order was n2 θs2 n1 n4 n5 n6 θr2 θs4 θs5 α2 θs6 θr1 θs3 θs1 α6 n3 α4 α1 θr5 θr4 α3 θr3 θr6 α5 ks6 ks4 ks2 ks3 ks1 and ks5 among each material the sensitivity of hydraulic parameters in the decreasing order was n θ s α θ r ks which were useful to improve the calibration and validation processes of hydraulic parameters 3 1 2 calibration and validation of hydraulic parameters the model calibration process involved the optimization of θ r θ s α n and ks values for each material by simulating soil water dynamics in the alfalfa plots to minimize the error between the measured and simulated θ values the optimized values of θ r θ s α n and ks for each soil material are shown in table 1 among the six materials the optimal θ s value varied from 0 454 to 0 493 cm3 cm 3 θ r value from 0 075 to 0 144 cm3 cm 3 α value from 0 007 to 0 064 cm 1 n value from 1 208 to 2 100 and ks value from 16 9 to 125 4 cm d 1 among the six materials the most clayey material in the profile was located at the 1000 1200 cm soil layer with the smallest ks and θ s values no 4 in table 1 a comparison of simulated and measured θ values in the 0 1500 cm profile is shown in fig 5 when using the optimal values of θ r θ s α n and ks for each material hydrus 1d can successfully capture the dynamic changes in θ in the profile small discrepancies occur in the 650 750 and 1000 1200 cm layers where θ changed rapidly these might be the result of soil textural change the natural soil profile typically reflects gradual changes between different soil textures however this is represented in the numerical model as a distinct break between two different materials which results in the discrepancies between the simulated and measured values the me rmse and r2 between the measured and simulated θ values are presented in table 2 the low me and rmse values and high r2 value indicate the simulated soil water profiles were in good agreement with the measured profiles using the calibrated values of θ r θ s α n and ks the δ 2 h profile in the alfalfa plot on september 17 2020 was simulated the comparison between the measured and simulated δ 2 h profiles in fig 6 shows the δ 2 h profile on september 17 2020 was simulated fairly accurately however large discrepancies between the simulated and measured δ2h values appeared in the 0 300 cm soil layer simulation of the δ2h profile was complicated by a number of factors the 0 300 cm soil layer is a zone of dynamic exchange of water and solutes driven by rainfall infiltration soil evaporation and plant transpiration some of which are not fully represented in this study the stable isotope composition of precipitation was not measured at the site during the study period and isotope fractionation was neglected in the model approach however given these limitations a reasonable fit was still achieved for the δ2h profile on september 17 2020 with low me and rmse values and a medium r2 value table 2 therefore the calibrated and validated hydraulic parameters for six materials in the 0 1500 cm profile were used to simulate soil water recovery after replacing alfalfa with different cropping systems and due to future climate change during the calibration and validation processes the relative error of water balance varied from 0 12 to 0 15 with a mean of 0 14 the water balance errors were much less than 1 the reasonable range requested for hydrological models wine et al 2015 which indicated that the hydrus 1d model with the calibrated hydraulic parameters had a high accuracy to simulate soil water dynamics with root uptake water 3 2 effects of inter annual climatic variations and cropping systems on recovery time under the same conditions of climate and initial soil water profile alfalfa grown for 15 years depleted more available soil water in the 0 1500 cm profile than winter wheat or corn fig 4 the average θ value in the 0 1500 cm profile on september 17 2020 was 0 20 cm3 cm 3 for alfalfa 0 24 cm3 cm 3 for winter wheat and 0 25 cm3 cm 3 for corn this corresponds to 662 8 and 872 8 mm less water in soils cropped with alfalfa compared to either winter wheat or corn respectively using the calibrated and validated hydraulic parameters for six materials hydrus 1d was used to simulate soil water variations in the 0 1500 cm profile under four scenarios with 53 random sequences of 53 climatic years 53 realizations the initial soil water profiles for alfalfa wheat alfalfa corn wheat wheat and corn corn scenarios are shown in fig 4 the recovery time was determined when the absolute difference in the profile average θ between the alfalfa wheat and wheat wheat scenarios and between the alfalfa corn and corn corn scenarios was less than 0 005 cm3 cm 3 fig 7 shows an example for which a 1500 cm deep soil profile took 26 years to recover from the depleting effect of alfalfa after replacing it with winter wheat beginning in september 2020 and 19 years after replacing it with corn beginning in april 2021 the simulations show the recovery time largely varies due to differences in cropping systems and inter annual climatic variations for the alfalfa wheat scenario the recovery time ranged from 14 to 44 years depending on which realization was used with a median of 27 years for the alfalfa corn scenario the recovery time varied from 11 to 31 years with a median of 18 years the cumulative frequency distributions of the recovery time for the alfalfa wheat and alfalfa corn scenarios are shown in fig 8 for the alfalfa wheat scenario the recovery time was from 25 to 29 years with a maximum probability of 35 and for the alfalfa corn scenario was from 17 to 20 years with a maximum probability of 40 under the 53 climatic realizations the relative error of water mass balance ranged from 0 04 to 0 06 with a mean of 0 05 for the alfalfa wheat system and from 0 06 to 0 08 with a mean of 0 07 for the alfalfa corn system the high accuracies indicated that the hydrus 1d model with the calibrated hydraulic parameters and historical climate data could provide reliable results for the soil water recovery time after cutting alfalfa the results obtained under these simulations show the important impact of cropping systems precipitation is the sole source of soil water replenishment on the clp this water infiltrates into the soil and is partly absorbed by plants and partly lost to evaporation and deep percolation different cropping systems change the eta deep percolation and soil water storage runoff is zero for the flat cropland and therefore impact the time of deep soil water recovery the cumulative probability distributions of annual eta and deep percolation for the alfalfa wheat and alfalfa corn scenarios during the period of soil water recovery are shown in fig 9 annual eta values in the alfalfa wheat scenario varied from 319 0 to 773 6 mm with a median of 552 6 mm n 1419 and in the alfalfa corn scenario from 326 2 to 724 2 mm with a median of 534 0 mm n 980 annual deep percolation in the alfalfa wheat scenario varied from 1 4 to 17 7 mm with a median of 2 9 mm n 1419 and in the alfalfa corn scenario from 1 6 to 61 4 mm with a median of 3 8 mm n 980 during the period of deep soil water recovery the alfalfa corn scenario stored 17 7 mm more water annually than the alfalfa wheat scenario which resulted in the alfalfa corn scenario requiring a shorter time than the alfalfa wheat scenario to achieve deep soil water recovery fig 8 in addition to cropping systems the growing duration of alfalfa also impacts the recovery time li and huang 2008 measured soil water changes in the 0 1000 cm soil profile for 16 years after alfalfa planting their results indicated that the average soil water content had a significant decreasing trend in the 0 1000 cm profile with the growing duration from an initial value of 0 258 cm3 cm 3 to 0 224 cm3 cm 3 in the 5th year 0 167 cm3 cm 3 in the 12th year and 0 156 cm3 cm 3 in the 16th year this means that the soil water recovery time will increase with the growing duration of alfalfa for the same cropping system due to decreasing soil water therefore fields planted with alfalfa for more than 8 years are recommended to convert to annual crops because alfalfa mass yield starts to decrease after growing more than 8 years li and huang 2008 3 3 future climate change projected by 10 gcm models the values of mean and standard deviation std of predicted annual precipitation ap annual average temperature aat and pet by 10 gcm models under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios are shown in fig 10 with the measured values for the period 1968 2020 provided for comparison from 1968 2100 the ap and aat show significantly increasing trends under both scenarios p 0 05 the increasing rates of ap and aat are 1 0 mm y 1 and 0 03 y 1 under the rcp 4 5 scenario and 1 6 mm y 1 and 0 05 y 1 under the rcp 8 5 scenario respectively the calculated pet only significantly increases from 1968 to 2100 under the rcp 8 5 scenario with a rate of 0 751 mm y 1 overall the gcm models indicate the climate at the study site will become warmer and wetter in the future in terms of changes in aat and ap under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the mean std values for ap aat and pet are 78 6 mm 1 3 and 62 4 mm under the rcp 4 5 scenario and 246 6 mm 1 8 and 98 4 mm under the rcp 8 5 scenario respectively the large std values indicate the climatic variables predicted under the 10 gcm models vary considerably among the 10 gcm models the largest ap was predicted by the can3 model while the smallest ap was from inm1 model under both scenarios the highest aat was predicted by the can2 model and the lowest aat by the mpi1 model the gcms are useful tools to describe dynamic oceanic and atmospheric processes which can simulate the important aspects of current and future climate because each climate model has its own uncertainty integrating more climate models is a way to obtain more accurate predictions therefore the climatic variables projected by 10 gcm models were used to predict the time of deep soil water recovery after replacing alfalfa with wheat or corn crops 3 4 effect of future climate change on soil water recovery climate change has an important impact on deep soil water recovery to further clarify the specific impact of climate change 10 future meteorological data series from 2021 2100 projected by different gcm models were used to simulate the time of deep soil water recovery with the validated hydraulic parameters and the same initial soil water profiles as shown in fig 4 the final recovery time depends on the rcp scenario gcm model and cropping system under the rcp 4 5 scenario the recovery time varies from 16 to 68 years with a median of 37 5 years for the alfalfa wheat scenario and from 13 to 56 years with a median of 30 years for the alfalfa corn scenario fig 11 under the rcp 8 5 scenario the recovery time varies from 15 to 67 years with a median of 42 5 years for the alfalfa wheat scenario and from 13 to 61 years with a median of 31 5 years for the alfalfa corn scenario fig 11 for the same cropping system the recovery time is longer under the rcp 8 5 scenario than under the rcp 4 5 scenario calculating the water balance components for the two cropping systems under both rcp scenarios shows both cropping systems have a larger eta under the rcp 8 5 scenario than under the rcp 4 5 scenario which is mainly driven by the larger pet value under the rcp 8 5 scenario table 3 under the rcp 4 5 scenario the median annual increases in soil water storage in the 0 1500 cm profile are 16 8 and 28 7 mm y 1 for the alfalfa wheat and alfalfa corn scenarios respectively under the rcp 8 5 scenario these values are 13 9 and 18 6 mm y 1 respectively the low annual increase in soil water storage under the rcp 8 5 scenario for both cropping systems results in more time needed for deep soil water recovery under future climate conditions the alfalfa wheat system needs 7 5 10 years more recovery time than the alfalfa corn system this is because the annual increase in soil water storage in the 0 1500 cm profile is larger for the alfalfa corn system 28 7 mm y 1 under the rcp 4 5 scenario and 18 6 mm y 1 under the rcp 8 5 scenario than for the alfalfa wheat system 16 8 mm y 1 under the rcp 4 5 scenario and 13 9 mm y 1 under the rcp 8 5 scenario under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the relative error of water balance ranged from 0 01 to 0 02 with a mean error of 0 01 for both cropping systems the low relative errors indicated that the hydrus 1d model with the calibrated hydraulic parameters and projected climate data provided confident predictions for the soil water recovery time under future climate conditions both cropping systems require a longer recovery time than would have been the case under historical climate conditions fig 8 vs fig 11 the main reason is that soil water storage depends on pet and ap li 2002 li and huang 2008 and the aridity index of pet ap is higher under future climate conditions compared to historical climate conditions for both cropping systems which results in a lower increase in soil water storage under historical climatic conditions the median of aridity index was 1 22 under the rcp 4 5 scenario the median of aridity index varies from 1 64 to 1 82 predicted by 10 gcm models under the rcp 8 5 scenario this value varies from 1 51 to 1 88 although the predicted ap increases in the future climate on clp compared with the historical climate the increasing trend in temperature is more than that in precipitation which plays an important role to impact on pet and consequently on the soil water recovery time recovery times for deep soil water profiles have been reported after converting apple trees or alfalfa into annual crops on the clp for example huang and gallichand 2006 found that it will take 6 5 19 5 years with a mean of 13 7 years to achieve soil water recovery in a 1000 cm soil profile after converting a 30 year apple orchard to winter wheat when a 22 year apple orchard was converted into annual crops the dry soil profile from 0 to 1500 cm required 26 years to recover water storage values similar to farmland zhang et al 2020 ali et al 2021 reported that it takes 23 years for the 0 1000 cm soil water profile to recover after converting a 10 year alfalfa crop into annual crops compared to previous works the findings of this study indicate even longer soil water recovery times especially under future climate conditions the recovery time depends on the initial soil water profile after converting alfalfa or apple orchards into annual crops climate conditions and cropping systems in this study after the 15 year old alfalfa was cut the soil water storage in the 0 1500 cm profile was 2936 9 mm less than the value of 3599 7 mm for plots cropped with winter wheat and 3819 5 mm in plots cropped with corn this difference in soil water storage between the alfalfa and annual crops is larger than reported in previous studies in this study 53 climatic realizations were used to simulate soil water recovery for two cropping systems with most of the inter annual climatic variabilities in the study area taken into consideration thus the median recovery times are more reasonable than previous results obtained using specific climate data zhang et al 2020 ali et al 2021 although future climate data projected by different gcm models under two rcp scenarios present large difference fan et al 2021 peng et al 2013 a warmer climate in the future for the loess plateau will result in a longer recovery time for deep soil water profile after cutting alfalfa than estimates based on historical climate conditions 4 conclusions the impacts of climate change and cropping systems on deep soil water recovery in 0 1500 cm soil profiles on the clp after converting alfalfa to annual crops were evaluated using the hydrus 1d model recovery time is defined as the amount of time required for a field just cut of alfalfa to recover to the same soil water content as a field that has been cropped with wheat or corn over the long term soil hydraulic parameters for six materials in the 0 1500 cm profile were calibrated using soil water measurements in alfalfa plots taken from 2005 to 2020 and validated using soil water stable isotopic measurements from samples taken on september 17 2020 from an alfalfa plot a total of 53 climatic realizations were generated using random non repeat sequences drawn from the observed 53 year climatic data 1968 2020 and used to simulate the impact of inter annual climate variability on soil water recovery time in addition 10 future climate data series projected by 10 gcm models under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios 2021 2100 were used to assess the impact of future climate change on soil water recovery time the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the results of 53 climatic realizations showed the recovery time for soil water in the 0 1500 cm soil profile ranged from 14 to 44 years with a median of 27 years for the alfalfa wheat system and 11 31 years with a median of 18 years for the alfalfa corn system 2 under the rcp 4 5 scenario the median recovery time based on 10 gcm models was 37 5 years for the alfalfa wheat system and 30 years for the alfalfa corn system under the rcp 8 5 scenario the corresponding values were 42 5 and 31 5 years 3 although these simulations do not replace local climate change predictions they do show the important impacts of inter annual climatic variations future climate change and cropping systems on deep soil water recovery considering the long term effects of alfalfa growth on land productivity planting areas and growing time of alfalfa should be restricted to maintain sustainable agriculture in the study region based on the changes of alfalfa mass yield with growing time fields planted with alfalfa for more than 8 years are recommended to convert to annual crops declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

9366,mediterranean watersheds are expected to face increased and more severe drought events due to climate change urgent action is needed to shift from a reactive approach to a proactive one for which drought risk assessment is fundamental nevertheless the current methodology to calculate composite risk indicators is still debated undermining the overall robustness and validity of drought risk assessments furthermore the diversity of socio ecological contexts spatiotemporal scales and data availability hamper the homogenization of assessment methods we present a complete drought risk assessment methodology applied to the agricultural systems of five italian coastal watersheds introducing a simple robustness evaluation method to validate the assessment tool and archetype analysis to link the outputs with adaptation strategies forty two 42 indicators were included to represent hazard exposure and vulnerability past and future drought hazards were estimated considering multiple types of droughts with data from public observatories the results show highest hazard for the southern part of the study region highest exposure in the coastal and high value wine producers municipalities while vulnerability patterns are less clear major adaptation efforts should target specific watersheds of the grosseto province which has the highest projected drought risk archetype analysis was then used to suggest possible context specific adaptation strategies the proposed methodology with the integration of a robustness evaluation and the archetype analysis represents an

severity duration and extent have typically been considered a natural phenomenon triggered by lack of precipitation zargar et al 2011 different types of droughts have been identified including a the meteorological drought a lack of precipitation over a region for a period of time b the agricultural drought a period with declining soil moisture and consequent crop failure c the hydrological drought a period with inadequate surface and subsurface water resources for established water uses and d the socioeconomic drought a failure of water resources systems to meet water demands mishra and singh 2010 in the past droughts were considered to propagate from meteorological to agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic droughts this approach has been recently questioned for its over simplification since it fails to account for i feedback and trade offs between social and physical processes ii direct effects of human induced climate change and iii long term environmental impacts of drought aghakouchak et al 2021 crausbay et al 2017 di baldassarre et al 2021 van loon et al 2016 as a result the terms ecological drought and human induced hydrological drought were recently introduced crausbay et al 2017 van loon et al 2016 a further step will need to be done to improve our understanding of anthropogenic drought a multidimensional and multiscale phenomenon that should be intended as a process rather than a product aghakouchak et al 2021 globally it is estimated that drought damages account for a fifth of the total damages caused by natural hazards world meteorological organization wmo and global water partnership gwp 2017 in europe the annual economic losses caused by droughts are estimated to be around 9 billion 1 4 billion for italy mostly related to the agricultural sector cammalleri et al 2020 with significant spatial variability between different regions garcía león et al 2021 the entity of the losses along with the expected increase due to climate change boosted the interest of researchers and decision makers in this topic hagenlocher et al 2019 to better deal with droughts recent studies call for a shift from the so called reactive approach taken in emergency situations and considered technically and economically inefficient towards a proactive approach including appropriate measures developed with the involvement of multiple stakeholders carrão et al 2016 murthy et al 2015 vogt et al 2018 in fact preparation and mitigation costs are by far lower compared to the relief costs which significantly surge in case of inaction vogt et al 2018 world meteorological organization wmo and global water partnership gwp 2017 to better prepare for droughts vulnerability and risk assessments are considered of major importance for developing sound and effective strategies world meteorological organization wmo and global water partnership gwp 2014 world bank 2019 commonly drought hazard is quantified by indicators of drought severity frequency intensity and duration many drought hazard indicators exist to describe meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts kchouk et al 2022 mishra and singh 2010 zargar et al 2011 which might refer directly to physical variables such as precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture or streamflow or can infer drought from vegetation health despite the availability of multiple hazard indicators drought risk assessments are generally carried out with the use of one or a few hazard indicators however considering hazard indicators of meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts can better embrace the complexity of drought hazards sun et al 2012 world bank 2019 furthermore the most common approach to represent drought hazard is by using historical data nevertheless many authors e g hagenlocher et al 2019 vogt et al 2018 claim the importance of including predictions of future droughts but at the cost of higher uncertainty mysiak et al 2018 two major limitations to the validity and practical use of drought risk assessments are commonly shared 1 only 11 of them conduct some form of validation and 2 they generally miss a link with possible adaptation strategies hagenlocher et al 2019 the robustness of the methodology applied can be evaluated with uncertainty or sensitivity analyses oecd 2008 sometimes referred to as internal validation carrão et al 2016 fontaine and steinemann 2009 or by comparing results with external information referred to also as external validation finding suitable data for external validation might be impossible in some regions of the world and when dealing with small scales additionally the validation with external datasets is complicated by the fact that composite indicators aim to represent complex past and future dynamics hence the validity of composite indicators is generally evaluated by performing uncertainty and sensitivity analyses oecd 2008 even if examples exist a shared simple but at the same time robust methodology for internal validation is still missing the main objective of this study is to propose a detailed and integrated drought risk assessment of mediterranean agricultural systems and present an application to the municipalities located in coastal watersheds of central and southern tuscany central italy these areas are susceptible to drought especially during the summer months due to the concurrent high water demands for domestic and agricultural uses key innovations introduced in this paper are 1 a complete robustness evaluation of the assessment by applying alternative methodologies in crucial steps of the drought risk assessment 2 the use of archetype analysis to streamline the identification of exposure and vulnerability patterns and propose a link with possible adaptation strategies 2 methodology the methodology of this study draws on the guidelines introduced by oecd 2008 and the approaches of other drought risk assessments

archetype analysis 2 1 conceptual framework a drought risk assessment needs to be clearly framed starting from its funding components of risk hazard exposure and vulnerability hagenlocher et al 2019 risk can be defined as the potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems ipcc 2022 hazard is the possible future occurrence of natural or human induced physical events that may have adverse effects on vulnerable and exposed elements exposure considers the inventory of elements in an area in which hazard events may occur vulnerability refers to the propensity of exposed elements to suffer adverse effects when impacted by hazard events determined by physical social economic and environmental factors cardona et al 2012 a drought hazard index dhi and a drought exposure index dei were calculated as the arithmetic mean of the selected indicators for the drought vulnerability index dvi the components proposed by meza et al 2020 2019 with some minor modifications were considered hence dvi was calculated with the equation 1 dvi ss es lcac 3 where ss es and lcac are social and ecological susceptibilities and lack of coping and adaptive capacity respectively similarly to prabnakorn et al 2019 the indexes were then aggregated to calculate the drought risk index dri with the equation 2 dri dhi dei dvi 100 due to temporal and spatial data gaps of the regional hydrological service sir of tuscany the assessment is based on drought hazard indicators derived from remote sensing still we included a higher number of indicators compared to other assessments representing more types of droughts and including both past and future conditions since the focus of the drought assessment is on agriculture the indicators selected to estimate exposure represented infrastructural social and economic features of agricultural systems the vulnerability was calculated through a composite indicator combining ss es and lcac meza et al 2020 by framing agroecosystems as social ecological systems hagenlocher et al 2019 we define susceptibility including both environmental and socio economic indicators we also include indicators of the current and future lack of coping and adaptative capacities to partially account for future vulnerability 2 2 study area the assessment was performed for five coastal watersheds of central and southern tuscany the cecina cornia bruna ombrone and albegna watersheds fig 1 to allow for a sufficient discretization of the watersheds and to provide more accurate information that can be used when planning adaptation and mitigation strategies municipalities local administrative units were considered as units of analysis a municipality was considered in the assessment if at least 10 of its area falls within any of the five watersheds with this criteria 58 municipalities were selected in the four provinces nuts3 of pisa livorno siena and grosseto coastal areas of tuscany are particularly prone to drought as they currently receive the lowest amount of precipitation in the region caporali et al 2021 magno et al 2018 which are likely to decrease in the future additionally the main coastal streams show very reduced discharges in late spring and summer rossetto et al 2013 the prevalent land uses of the inner areas are forests and rainfed agriculture mainly cereals and extensive rangeland märker et al 2008 orlandini et al 2011 the other main crops are olive groves and vineyards which are particularly widespread in the chianti hills the famous high value wine production area of central tuscany on the other hand irrigated crops are prevalent in the coastal plains with an important part of the irrigation supply pumped from the coastal aquifers rossetto et al 2013 additionally tourism and other activities further increase the water demand during the summer months and seawater intrusion and pollution of the aquifers affect the sustainability of groundwater barazzuoli et al 2008 1999 bianchi et al 2011 grassi et al 2007 various irrigated areas of the coastal plains already suffered a water deficit for six months per year and despite the adoption of more efficient irrigation systems farmers had to switch to less water demanding less profitable and salinity tolerant crops or leave their lands uncultivated bianchi et al 2011 rossetto et al 2013 particularly vulnerable is the situation of the cornia watershed which supplies also the elba island rossetto et al 2018 2 3 identification of indicators all the data used to calculate the indicators were extracted from public databases at regional national or european levels after a detailed literature review and after checking the availability and validity of the data 46 indicators were included in the analysis tables 1 2 and 3 report the lists of indicators of drought hazard exposure and vulnerability respectively past hazard indicators namely the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the vegetation health index vhi kogan 1995 were obtained from the drought observatory of the tuscany region magno et al 2018 similarly to express the future drought hazard the ready to use climate impact indicators smhi 2021 available in the copernicus climate data store were used representing mean temperature mt in c mean precipitation mp in mm day longest dry spell lds in number of days and total number of dry spells tds of more than five days for 30 years periods spi is the most used drought hazard indicator kchouk et al 2022 it proved to be reliable and convenient since it can be easily calculated at multiple time scales by using only precipitation data furthermore it allows comparisons between different locations due to its standardization the main drawback of this index is that it considers only precipitation and does not include temperature which is fundamental in drought analyses and even more so in the context of climate warming di lena et al 2014 the drought observatory of the tuscany region calculates the spi with accumulation periods of 3 6 and 12 months using validated daily chirps data from 1981 magno et al 2018 which were included in our study to consider different drought types and impacts di lena et al 2014 stagge et al 2015 the definitions of duration severity and frequency provided by vogt et al 2018 were used to calculate the hazard indicators duration is the total number of months below the threshold the severity is the algebraic sum of the spi values below the threshold level as in di lena et al 2014 and the frequency is the number of drought events of one or more months duration identified when spi dropped below the selected threshold drought onset was considered when the spi value was below 1 0 the threshold of moderate drought vhi is one of the most common agricultural drought hazard indicators widely used to study drought from the vegetation status the drought observatory of the tuscany region provides vhi values starting from 2010 magno et al 2018 the vhi is a combination of the temperature condition index tci calculated with land surface temperature data and the vegetation condition index vci calculated with ndvi data similar definitions of duration severity and frequency used for the spi were also applied for the vhi the threshold value below which vegetation is considered stressed is 40 kogan 2001 the climate impact indicators are produced with euro cordex bias corrected projections smhi 2021 mt mp lds and tds were used as future drought hazard indicators for the short 2011 2040 medium 2041 2070 and long 2071 2100 projection periods these indicators were extracted from four regional climate models cclm4 8 17 racmo22e rca4 remo2009 considering the representative concentration pathway 4 5 and the different realizations available smhi 2021 in total the simulations considered in the ensemble were eight considering the duration frequency and severity of spi3 spi6 spi12 and vhi and the short medium and long term future periods of mt mp lds and tds 24 indicators were finally considered to assess drought hazard table 1 five exposure indicators which represent infrastructural social and economic features of agriculture in the coastal watersheds of tuscany were selected table 2 share of agricultural area and volume of water used for irrigation were included to consider both rainfed and irrigated agriculture in many assessments irrigation is considered a measure to cope with drought carrão et al 2016 murthy et al 2015 while others considered it an asset exposed to drought meza et al 2020 indeed irrigated agriculture might not suffer negative impacts during flash droughts of a few months duration nevertheless it is highly impacted when prolonged droughts force authorities to restrict irrigation supplies gómez gómez and pérez blanco 2012 masia et al 2018 world bank 2019 for the economic dimension the value of agricultural products was included while for the social dimension the share of workers occupied in agriculture additionally share of horticulture and fruticulture was considered an exposure indicator since these crops are highly valuable irrigated and with high water requirements a total of 17 drought vulnerability indicators were selected representing ss es and lcac table 3 indicators of ss education of farmers age of farmers and unemployment are typically included in drought risk assessments for es soil quality indicators considering data extracted from the pedological database of the tuscany region were considered as well as the share of protected areas calculated from the network natura 2000 selected indicators of lcac refer to farm agricultural practices despite controversial research results and opinions about organic agriculture e g clark and tilman 2017 the share of organic agriculture was included as a vulnerability indicator as it is commonly assumed that organic farms are less dependent on external inputs apply good practices such as crop rotation and are more diversified which increases their resilience to adverse events such as drought märker et al 2008 sharafi et al 2020 in addition financial incentives to sustain organic agriculture decrease the vulnerability of organic farms soil conservation practices are also considered to improve the capacity to cope with drought hagenlocher et al 2019 sharafi et al 2020 hence the share of land with minimum or no tillage available for cereal crops was included other good practices linked to the informatization of farming were included with the indicators share of crops managed with the help of software and share of land irrigated with decision support systems the other indicators were related to irrigation namely irrigation system irrigation source and share of irrigable land including the latter which was used as a proxy for the possibility to perform supplemental irrigation might seem a contradiction with the decision to consider irrigated land as an exposed element however at the same time irrigable land or supplemental irrigation is a fundamental adaptation strategy 2 4 data acquisition and pre processing the selected indicators were transformed from absolute to relative values tables 2 and 3 to allow meaningful comparisons between municipalities of different sizes for this procedure the use of data from the same datasets was preferred the indicators in which data were divided into categories namely age of farmers education of farmers irrigation system and irrigation source were ranked according to their vulnerability and assigned the lowest value 0 to the less vulnerable category and the highest value 1 to the most vulnerable one young and educated farmers were considered less vulnerable regarding the irrigation system drip irrigation was considered the less vulnerable followed by sprinkler furrow and flood irrigation for the irrigation source groundwater within the farm was considered the less vulnerable followed by private reservoirs within the farm irrigation water from irrigation consortia and surface water outside of the farm to the category other was assigned the value 0 5 for both irrigation system and irrigation source the same procedure was applied to the indicators obtained from the pedological database of the tuscany region which were divided according to their quality into 8 or 4 classes for these indicators only the agricultural soils were considered few values were missing for the exposure and vulnerability indicators although methods exist to replace missing data oecd 2008 we decided to keep them to avoid further uncertainty in the model by estimating missing values hence for the three municipalities with missing data namely monteroni d arbia gaiole in chianti and radda in chianti results had to be evaluated even more cautiously 2 5 assessment of multicollinearities collinearity or multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables are linearly related dormann et al 2013 generally a multicollinearity analysis is performed to avoid the overrepresentation of the processes represented by the selected indicators ortega gaucin et al 2021 multicollinearity was assessed by applying the spearman correlation matrix for the relativized exposure and vulnerability indicators in line with meza et al 2020 compared to other similar studies a very restrictive threshold r 0 4 was considered to decide which indicators to further evaluate the rationale to decide whether to exclude an indicator was to assess if it expressed the same process as another one 2 6 normalization and weighted aggregation the normalization was performed with the max min method which can be used with all the weighting methods oecd 2008 since there is no consensus in the literature about the best weighting method here we use equal weights which is the most common weighting method in composite indicators oecd 2008 and has been already applied in other drought risk assessments brooks et al 2005 nauditt et al 2022 naumann et al 2014 prabnakorn et al 2019 the normalized values of the indicators were directly used in the calculation of dhi dei and dvi however it is important to notice that dhi dei and dvi had different numbers of indicators therefore for example exposure indicators contributed more compared to vulnerability indicators similarly dvi was calculated as the mean of ss es and lcac which are represented by 3 5 and 6 indicators respectively hence ss indicators contributed more to the final dri compared to es and lcac indicators 2 7 robustness evaluation ideally uncertainty and sensitivity analyses should evaluate all the potential sources of uncertainty including the selection of indicators normalization weighting and aggregation methods etc oecd 2008 in drought risk assessments the most uncertain parts of the methodology are the selection of individual indicators and weights murthy et al 2015 naumann et al 2014 which are generally evaluated by including and excluding single indicators and applying different weighting methods instead external validation has been performed in drought risk assessments using impact data crop yield losses population affected hagenlocher et al 2019 meza et al 2020 soil moisture data hoque et al 2021 consulting experts brooks et al 2005 fontaine and steinemann 2009 or comparing results with external datasets ortega gaucin et al 2021 to verify the robustness of our model both internal and external validations were considered however a good dataset could not be found for the selected study area at the municipality scale therefore a specific uncertainty analysis to account for the most sensible choices to develop the dri was performed by 1 excluding individual exposure and vulnerability indicators 2 including excluded indicators with the multicollinearity analysis 3 using different weighting schemes for the calculation of the dei and dvi 4 aggregating the dhi dei and dvi with arithmetic mean instead of using eq 2 two different weighting methods were considered proportional weights pw naumann et al 2014 were used by calculating the dvi without es ss and lcac and eq 1 also weights for both exposure and vulnerability indicators were calculated with an analytical hierarchical process ahp cantini et al 2019 finally the output of the uncertainty analysis i e the rank of the municipality assigned by the composite indicator rank ci m and the average shift in municipalities rankings r s were compared to evaluate the effect of these different methodologies naumann et al 2014 oecd 2008 the average shift was calculated as the average of the absolute differences in municipalities ranks to a reference ranking which in our case is the rank calculated with equal weights in the n municipalities with the equation 3 r s 1 n m 1 n rank ref ci m rank ci m 2 8 archetype analysis given the high number and diversity of indicators used in our drought risk assessment the interpretation of the results might be complicated affecting the potential usability of the insights provided in the assessment to address this problem we use archetype analysis which is an emerging methodology to find recurrent patterns within cases and provide a simplified but contextual interpretation of results eisenack et al 2019 oberlack et al 2019 akin to the approach used in other spatial archetypes research piemontese et al 2021 a hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to understand the recurrent patterns of drought indicators within the selected municipalities the municipalities were clustered with the ward method ward 1963 considering the whole set of normalized exposure and vulnerability indicators also including the missing data without further preprocessing the resulting clusters were compared with boxplots and other basic statistics finally considering that the ultimate objective of drought risk assessments is to provide the basis for developing drought management strategies hagenlocher et al 2019 hayes et al 2004 the archetypes were used to discuss specific adaptation measures in municipalities with similar drought risk profiles 3 results 3 1 multicollinearity analysis several significant multicollinearities were detected p value 0 05 as a result the indicator share of horticulture and fruticulture was excluded from exposure indicators since it was highly correlated with value of agricultural products and volume of water used for irrigation for the vulnerability indicators climate interference and water deficit were excluded since their variability was explained by other indicators namely soil erosion and soil fertility similarly share of land irrigated with decision support systems was excluded because of its high correlation with irrigable land in this case the decision was also based on the data quality which was lower for the excluded indicator on the other hand the indicator soil depth showed a relatively high and significant correlation with soil erosion but we decided to keep them both since they represent different processes therefore after the multicollinearity analysis one exposure and three vulnerability indicators were excluded and the definitive number of indicators used to calculate the dri was 42 3 2 robustness evaluation results in terms of r s fig 2 show that dri is more affected when individual exposure indicators were excluded with an average r s of 5 19 the indicator that was most impacting when excluded was the share of agricultural land with an r s of 6 45 this value was largely influenced by the extremely high difference in rankings of the monteroni d arbia municipality which is 43 since vulnerability indicators were 14 while the exposure indicators were only 4 their exclusion had a lower impact on dri a remarkable effect was also found by applying the ahp weighting method assigning weights based on personal opinions giving more importance to indicators related to the irrigation practice resulted in a r s of 4 62 with a maximum shift of 16 for the gaiole in chianti municipality finally the use of pw the inclusion of the indicators excluded after the multicollinearity analysis and the aggregation of dhi dei and dvi with arithmetic mean did not have a significant effect on r s summing up our study confirms the findings of other drought risk assessments murthy et al 2015 naumann et al 2014 which identified as major sources of uncertainty the selection of indicators and the weighting method analysing the shifts in rankings of the single municipalities with the alternative methods it is possible to affirm that with some exceptions the rankings were confirmed and the variations were minimal fig a 4 validating the assessment and confirming the robustness of the methodology the municipalities that show the highest r s were also those with missing data namely radda in chianti ranked 23rd and monteroni d arbia ranked 14th the other municipality with missing data is gaiole in chianti which was ranked 5th probably this explains why the r s was not as high as the others since shifts upwards in the ranking had a minimal effect 3 3 drought risk mapping and ranking maps of dhi dei dvi and dri are reported in fig 3 while the rankings of the municipalities are reported in the appendix maps and rankings are briefly discussed in this section while further analysis and discussion are performed when presenting the results of the cluster analysis results of the dhi clearly show that the southern and western coastal municipalities will likely experience the highest drought hazard in particular the province of grosseto will be the most affected including the albegna bruna and lower ombrone watersheds the most exposed municipalities were found along the coast emblematic is the case of campiglia marittima with a very large share of land cultivated with industrial tomatoes requiring high amounts of irrigation water and where high value wines are produced such as gaiole in chianti and montalcino when analysing the drought vulnerability it is necessary to consider that the indicators used to calculate dvi are 14 hence results were more diversified without clear patterns in general it is possible to affirm that inland municipalities located mostly in the provinces of pisa and siena farthest from the coast and the main urban centres were the most vulnerable combining the indexes dri provided an overall estimation of the risk as expected the coastal municipalities of the province of grosseto were found to be the most at risk 3 4 archetype analysis as a result of the hierarchical cluster analysis we divided the municipalities in seven clusters fig 4 the characteristics of exposure and vulnerability of the clusters are reported as boxplots in figs 5 and 6 while the main characteristics and the possible adaptation strategies are listed in table 4 the clusters identified were named according to the most distinctive characteristics of the municipalities included cluster 1 high coastal irrigation comprised coastal municipalities spread among the five watersheds considered cluster 2 high value products included the wine producers municipalities of the chianti hills in the upper ombrone watershed except sassetta cluster 3 high inland irrigation and 4 prevalence of agricultural land were mainly composed by inland municipalities of the provinces of siena and pisa cluster 6 prevalence of agricultural workers consisted in the inland municipalities closest to the coastal ones mainly in the grosseto province the municipalities of cluster 5 erosion prone and vulnerable irrigation sources and 7 erosion prone and vulnerable irrigation systems were spread among the provinces without an evident spatial pattern some patterns can be described by observing the dhi dei dvi and dri for each cluster fig 4 and the rankings of the municipalities in the appendix even though drought hazard indicators were not included in the cluster analysis the municipalities of clusters 1 and 6 ranked highest since they mostly represent the grosseto province considering the dei the highest ranked are municipalities of clusters 1 2 and 6 the values of the dvi were less stretched however there is a prevalence of the municipalities of clusters 3 4 5 and 7 in the highest ranks being dri the aggregation of dhi dei and dvi the prevalence of the municipalities of the clusters 1 and 6 except the municipality gaiole in chianti of cluster 2 among the highest ranked can be easily explained by analyzing the main characteristics of exposure and vulnerability of the seven clusters figs 5 and 6 possible adaptation strategies targeted to the specific characteristics of those clusters of municipalities can be suggested table 4 certainly further information needs to be considered when planning interventions but these indications can be considered as a starting point being the most prone to drought hazard and risk major efforts will have to be directed on the municipalities of cluster 1 and in particular the province of grosseto and the albegna bruna and lower ombrone watersheds 4 discussion 4 1 past and future drought hazard interesting results were found in the estimation of drought hazard correlations between the total severity duration and frequency calculated with spi3 spi6 spi12 and vhi in the 58 municipalities are poor implying that the use of only one of them would have resulted in a different pattern of drought hazard the non standardized indicators of future hazard showed very high correlations when considering the same indicator in the short medium and long term future while much worse correlations between different indicators however this was expected since these indicators do not directly estimate drought although many studies have been conducted on the drought hazard indicators these results confirm the need for further research to individuate the best indicators both used individually and in an ensemble to more accurately account for drought interestingly the correlation between the dhi calculated with past and future hazard indicators showed a coefficient of determination of 0 42 suggesting that past drought hazard dynamics are expected to be confirmed in the future the use of multiple drought hazard indicators to represent different drought types added value to the assessment and was theoretically sound since the impacts on agriculture are represented by different accumulation periods for spi stagge et al 2015 vergni and todisco 2011 even more so when including irrigated areas bachmair et al 2018 huang et al 2018 4 2 selection of indicators and limitations the choice of vulnerability and exposure indicators is critical and needs to be justified properly in the conceptual framework despite some authors consider that a fundamental characteristic of drought risk assessment is their objectivity and simplicity naumann et al 2014 we used a high number of indicators which resulted in unclear vulnerability patterns both in the mapping and in the cluster analysis however vulnerability is influenced by many processes thus over simplifications might lead to unrealistic estimates to sum up a good balance should be found in the number of indicators and multicollinearity analysis was useful to exclude redundant indicators furthermore we used some specific indicators in addition to the generic ones which is commonly advised against since specific vulnerability indicators should be linked to specific exposure indicators carrão et al 2016 for example irrigation indicators should be weighted more where volumes of irrigation water are higher but to account for these complex processes would further complicate the procedure again we argue that the benefits of the inclusion of a higher number of indicators outweigh these negative aspects certainly data limitation is a recurrent problem in many regions of the world and the selection of the indicators is a crucial step that needs to be carefully performed according to data availability objectives spatial scale unit of analysis etc hazard indicators can be calculated with remote sensing based products hence the problem is restricted to exposure and vulnerability indicators given that at least one representative indicator is available for the risk components of eqs 1 and 2 the approach can be replicated using either a sub set of the indicators we proposed or inferring them from other studies e g hagenlocher et al 2019 meza et al 2019 the inclusion of irrigated areas as an exposure indicator is highly recommended when dealing with developed countries in some global carrão et al 2016 continental naumann et al 2014 and regional murthy et al 2015 prabnakorn et al 2019 assessments it is considered a measure of coping capacity that reduces vulnerability but this can be considered true only in some lower income countries where irrigation is limited possibly the use of different irrigated and rainfed specific indicators to represent vulnerability as in meza et al 2020 is a more appropriate approach but in many cases rainfed and irrigated agriculture coexist making it difficult to perform separated analyses a recurrent problem in drought research is that drought hazard is used to predict risk instead of impact which in the end is what really matters enenkel et al 2020 furthermore the role of local stakeholders is crucial for developing sound and effective strategies to cope with extreme events and climate change hayes et al 2004 nguyen et al 2016 vogt et al 2018 world bank 2019 but the integration of local and expert knowledge in drought monitoring and adaptation is challenging due to the reciprocal scepticism giordano et al 2013 also farmers perceptions of drought do not always correspond to the commonly used drought indicators giordano et al 2013 stagge et al 2015 urquijo and de stefano 2016 including hard and soft data quantitative and qualitative data and local and expert knowledge might allow performing a more detailed and meaningful drought risk assessment and should be considered in further research 4 3 linking drought risk assessments with adaptation strategies comparing risk assessment outputs with similar assessments is difficult due to the context specific meaning of the results also no similar drought risk assessment has been performed for central and southern tuscany hence results were compared with more general climate risk analysis for multiple natural hazards performed at the national level with the provinces nuts3 as the units of analysis consistently with the results of our assessment mysiak et al 2018 found that the grosseto province has higher potential climate change impacts and lower adaptive capacity compared with the other provinces similarly spano et al 2020 reported a lower adaptive capacity to climate change for the same area furthermore the pnacc 2018 confirms our results in terms of risk patterns and the highest risk for the province of grosseto which has a medium high adaptive capacity and high potential impacts instead the province of livorno has a medium high adaptive capacity and medium low potential impacts while the provinces of pisa and siena have a high adaptive capacity with the first one with expected medium potential impacts and the latter with high potential impacts projected climate change impacts on yields of durum and common wheat and maize reported in spano et al 2020 do not show clear differences within the areas considered in our assessment overall negative impacts for maize and slight increases in yield for wheat are expected because of the high number of indicators used in the comprehensive risk assessment we used archetype analysis to link the results of the risk assessment with possible adaptation strategies archetype analysis by identifying municipalities with overall similar characteristics and risk profiles can help decision makers to better target the most relevant adaptation strategies to show the potential of the approach proposed in this research the suggested adaptation strategies for clusters 1 high coastal irrigation and 2 high value products which are the most representative are discussed in detail municipalities of cluster 1 have a high drought risk fig 7 driven by intense irrigation potential adaptation strategies include increasing water productivity and improving irrigation efficiency mantino et al 2017 as well as increasing storage with new reservoirs at the same time seawater intrusion and groundwater pollution and depletion need to be considered barazzuoli et al 2008 1999 grassi et al 2007 therefore the use of nature based solutions such as the managed aquifer recharge already tested in a pilot project in the cornia watershed rossetto et al 2019 2018 represents a very promising solution that could significantly reduce the vulnerability of groundwater based irrigation areas additionally these municipalities have the highest water demand in summer when the highest crop irrigation requirements overlap with the peak touristic water demand with the lowest precipitation and the highest evapotranspiration hence further interventions to reduce other water uses domestic and industrial and increase water supply e g desalination wastewater treatment could be beneficial mantino et al 2017 on the other hand municipalities of the second cluster show high exposure and low vulnerability to drought fig 7 in addition to the highest income related to agriculture this cluster has the youngest and most educated farmers who are the most likely to adopt innovative adaptation strategies one crucial intervention is supplemental or emergency irrigation matese et al 2018 which is still underdeveloped in the vineyards of tuscany because of the limited availability of irrigation water d bianchi et al 2021 a possible solution is represented by runoff harvesting structures such as farm ponds which have been already suggested for the hilly areas of central tuscany to overcome summer water shortages napoli et al 2014 in addition to the cluster specific adaptation strategies proposed in table 4 cross cutting strategies could be also considered to tackle drought these include a improved agronomic management b drought resistant varieties c cropping patterns change and diversification and d crop insurance win win solutions with negligible side effects can be achieved by upgrading surface irrigation systems in erosion prone areas suggested in particular for clusters 5 and 7 and using alternative water sources such as desalinization and wastewater treatment especially in cluster 1 recent initiatives of the italian government and other associations anbi and coldiretti strongly reintroduced the debate about the implementation of new reservoirs to cope with drought if properly designed respecting the ecosystems and ensuring sufficient environmental flows this strategy can significantly reduce the drought vulnerability in the context of climate change masia et al 2018 sordo ward et al 2019 however many examples of negative feedback exist linked to water infrastructures such as the increased water consumption and the sense of over reliance that increase vulnerability di baldassarre et al 2021 2018 similar unintended negative consequences might also be promoted by crop insurances deryugina and konar 2017 oecd 2021 furthermore the well known efficiency paradox shows how water savings at the field scale with improved irrigation efficiencies might lead to increased water consumption at the watershed scale dumont et al 2013 grafton et al 2018 these and other counterintuitive dynamics further complicate the planning of some drought adaptation strategies to deal with such complexity and uncertainty the involvement of multiple stakeholders is crucial 5 conclusion a complete drought risk assessment was conducted for 58 municipalities belonging to five coastal watersheds in tuscany central italy the proposed approach allowed to produce a policy relevant drought risk assessment even though adjustments could further improve the methodology the inclusion of multiple drought hazard indicators provided a more comprehensive analysis of drought risk the use of future projections to account for climate change impacts also confirmed the patterns of past hazards however future patterns of vulnerability and exposure should also be considered moreover the inclusion of social and environmental indicators improved the comprehensiveness of the assessment the robustness evaluation confirmed that the most uncertain parts of the methodology to calculate composite indicators are the choice of indicators and the weighting method finally archetype analysis was successfully used to link the results of the assessment with possible adaptation strategies southernmost municipalities of tuscany showed to be the most at risk in particular those belonging to the albegna bruna and lower ombrone watersheds also major efforts should be devoted to the coastal municipalities since multiple sectors use the water resource and the demand is particularly concentrated in the summer months the results of this assessment are meant to be used by local decision makers and experts to plan and promote more tailored and proof based adaptation strategies ideally the results of this drought risk assessment will be the base to fuel the discussion about drought management to involve farmers and the other interested stakeholders funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors declaration of competing interest

9366,mediterranean watersheds are expected to face increased and more severe drought events due to climate change urgent action is needed to shift from a reactive approach to a proactive one for which drought risk assessment is fundamental nevertheless the current methodology to calculate composite risk indicators is still debated undermining the overall robustness and validity of drought risk assessments furthermore the diversity of socio ecological contexts spatiotemporal scales and data availability hamper the homogenization of assessment methods we present a complete drought risk assessment methodology applied to the agricultural systems of five italian coastal watersheds introducing a simple robustness evaluation method to validate the assessment tool and archetype analysis to link the outputs with adaptation strategies forty two 42 indicators were included to represent hazard exposure and vulnerability past and future drought hazards were estimated considering multiple types of droughts with data from public observatories the results show highest hazard for the southern part of the study region highest exposure in the coastal and high value wine producers municipalities while vulnerability patterns are less clear major adaptation efforts should target specific watersheds of the grosseto province which has the highest projected drought risk archetype analysis was then used to suggest possible context specific adaptation strategies the proposed methodology with the integration of a robustness evaluation and the archetype analysis represents an

severity duration and extent have typically been considered a natural phenomenon triggered by lack of precipitation zargar et al 2011 different types of droughts have been identified including a the

severity frequency intensity and duration many drought hazard indicators exist to describe meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts kchouk et al 2022 mishra and singh 2010 zargar et al 2011 which might refer directly to physical variables such as precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture or streamflow or can infer drought from vegetation health despite the availability of multiple hazard indicators drought risk assessments are generally carried out with the use of one or a few hazard indicators however considering hazard indicators of meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts can better embrace the complexity of drought hazards sun et al 2012 world bank 2019 furthermore the most common approach to represent drought hazard is by using historical data nevertheless many authors e g hagenlocher et al 2019 vogt et al 2018 claim the importance of including predictions of future droughts but at the cost of higher uncertainty mysiak et al 2018 two major limitations to the validity and practical use of drought risk assessments are commonly shared 1 only 11 of them conduct some form of validation and 2 they generally miss a link with possible adaptation strategies hagenlocher et al 2019 the robustness of the methodology applied can be evaluated with uncertainty or sensitivity analyses oecd 2008 sometimes referred to as internal validation carrão et al 2016 fontaine and steinemann 2009 or by comparing results with external information referred to also as external validation finding suitable data for external validation might be impossible in some regions of the world and when dealing with small scales additionally the validation with external datasets is complicated by the fact that composite indicators aim to represent complex past and future dynamics hence the validity of composite indicators is generally evaluated by performing uncertainty and sensitivity analyses oecd 2008 even if examples exist a shared simple but at the same time robust methodology for internal validation is still missing the main objective of this study is to propose a detailed and integrated drought risk assessment of mediterranean agricultural systems and present an application to the municipalities located in coastal watersheds of central and southern tuscany central italy these areas are susceptible to drought especially during the summer months due to the concurrent high water demands for domestic and agricultural uses key innovations introduced in this paper are 1 a complete robustness evaluation of the assessment by applying alternative methodologies in crucial steps of the drought risk assessment 2 the use of archetype analysis to streamline the identification of exposure and vulnerability patterns and propose a link with possible adaptation strategies 2 methodology the methodology of this study draws on the guidelines introduced by oecd 2008 and the approaches of other drought risk assessments

have adverse effects on vulnerable and exposed elements exposure considers the inventory of elements in an area in which hazard events may occur vulnerability refers to the propensity of exposed elements to suffer adverse effects when impacted by hazard events determined by physical social economic and environmental factors cardona et al 2012 a drought hazard index dhi and a drought exposure index dei were calculated as the arithmetic mean of the selected indicators for the drought vulnerability index dvi the components proposed by meza et al 2020 2019 with some minor modifications were considered hence dvi was calculated with the equation 1 dvi ss es lcac 3 where ss es and lcac are social and ecological susceptibilities and lack of coping and adaptive capacity respectively similarly to prabnakorn et al 2019 the indexes were then aggregated to calculate the drought risk index dri with the equation 2 dri dhi dei dvi 100 due to temporal and spatial data gaps of the regional hydrological service sir of tuscany the assessment is based on drought hazard indicators derived from remote sensing still we included a higher number of indicators compared to other assessments representing more types of droughts and including both past and future conditions since the focus of the drought assessment is on agriculture the indicators selected to estimate exposure represented infrastructural social and economic features of agricultural systems the vulnerability was calculated through a composite indicator combining ss es and lcac meza et al 2020 by framing agroecosystems as social ecological systems hagenlocher et al 2019 we define susceptibility including both environmental and socio economic indicators we also include indicators of the current and future lack of coping and adaptative capacities to partially account for future vulnerability 2 2 study area the assessment was performed for five coastal watersheds of central and southern tuscany the cecina cornia bruna ombrone and albegna watersheds fig 1 to allow for a sufficient discretization of the watersheds and to provide more accurate information that can be used when planning adaptation and mitigation strategies municipalities local administrative units were considered as units of analysis a municipality was considered in the assessment if at least 10 of its area falls within any of the five watersheds with this criteria 58 municipalities were selected in the four provinces nuts3 of pisa livorno siena and grosseto coastal areas of tuscany are particularly prone to drought as they currently receive the lowest amount of precipitation in the region caporali et al 2021 magno et al 2018 which are likely to decrease in the future additionally the main coastal streams show very reduced discharges in late spring and summer rossetto et al 2013 the prevalent land uses of the inner areas are forests and rainfed agriculture mainly cereals and extensive rangeland märker et al 2008 orlandini et al 2011 the other main crops are olive groves and vineyards which are particularly widespread in the chianti hills the famous high value wine production area of central tuscany on the other hand irrigated crops are prevalent in the coastal plains with an important part of the irrigation supply pumped from the coastal aquifers rossetto et al 2013 additionally tourism and other activities further increase the water demand during the summer months and seawater intrusion and pollution of the aquifers affect the sustainability of groundwater barazzuoli et al 2008 1999 bianchi et al 2011 grassi et al 2007 various irrigated areas of the coastal plains already suffered a water deficit for six months per year and despite the adoption of more efficient irrigation systems farmers had to switch to less water demanding less profitable and salinity tolerant crops or leave their lands uncultivated bianchi et al 2011 rossetto et al 2013 particularly vulnerable is the situation of the cornia watershed which supplies also the elba island rossetto et al 2018 2 3 identification of indicators all the data used to calculate the indicators were extracted from public databases at regional national or european levels after a detailed literature review and after checking the availability and validity of the data 46 indicators were included in the analysis tables 1 2 and 3 report the lists of indicators of drought hazard exposure and vulnerability respectively past hazard indicators namely the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the vegetation health index vhi kogan 1995 were obtained from the drought observatory of the tuscany region magno et al 2018 similarly to express the future drought hazard the ready to use climate impact indicators smhi 2021 available in the copernicus climate data store were used representing mean temperature mt in c mean precipitation mp in mm day longest dry spell lds in number of days and total number of dry spells tds of more than five days for 30 years periods spi is the most used drought hazard indicator kchouk et al 2022 it proved to be reliable and convenient since it can be easily calculated at multiple time scales by using only precipitation data furthermore it allows comparisons between different locations due to its standardization the main drawback of this index is that it considers only precipitation and does not include temperature which is fundamental in drought analyses and even more so in the context of climate warming di lena et al 2014 the drought observatory of the tuscany region calculates the spi with accumulation periods of 3 6 and 12 months using validated daily chirps data from 1981 magno et al 2018 which were included in our study to consider different drought types and impacts di lena et al 2014 stagge et al 2015 the definitions of duration severity and frequency provided by vogt et al 2018 were used to calculate the hazard indicators duration is the total number of months below the threshold the severity is the algebraic sum of the spi values below the threshold level as in di lena et al 2014 and the frequency is the number of drought events of one or more months duration identified when spi dropped below the selected threshold drought onset was considered when the spi value was below 1 0 the threshold of moderate drought vhi is one of the most common agricultural drought hazard indicators widely used to study drought from the vegetation status the drought observatory of the tuscany region provides vhi values starting from 2010 magno et al 2018 the vhi is a combination of the temperature condition index tci calculated with land surface temperature data and the vegetation condition index vci calculated with ndvi data similar definitions of duration severity and frequency used for the spi were also applied for the vhi the threshold value below which vegetation is considered stressed is 40 kogan 2001 the climate impact indicators are produced with euro cordex bias corrected projections smhi 2021 mt mp lds and tds were used as future drought hazard indicators for the short 2011 2040 medium 2041 2070 and long 2071 2100 projection periods these indicators were extracted from four regional climate models cclm4 8 17 racmo22e rca4 remo2009 considering the representative concentration pathway 4 5 and the different realizations available smhi 2021 in total the simulations considered in the ensemble were eight considering the duration frequency and severity of spi3 spi6 spi12 and vhi and the short medium and long term future periods of mt mp lds and tds 24 indicators were finally considered to assess drought hazard table 1 five exposure indicators which represent infrastructural social and economic features of agriculture in the coastal watersheds of tuscany were selected table 2 share of agricultural area and volume of water used for irrigation were included to consider both rainfed and irrigated agriculture in many assessments irrigation is considered a measure to cope with drought carrão et al 2016 murthy et al 2015 while others considered it an asset exposed to drought meza et al 2020 indeed irrigated agriculture might not suffer negative impacts during flash droughts of a few months duration nevertheless it is highly impacted when prolonged droughts force authorities to restrict irrigation supplies gómez gómez and pérez blanco 2012 masia et al 2018 world bank 2019 for the economic dimension the value of agricultural products was included while for the social dimension the share of workers occupied in agriculture additionally share of horticulture and fruticulture was considered an exposure indicator since these crops are highly valuable irrigated and with high water requirements a total of 17 drought vulnerability indicators were selected representing ss es and lcac table 3 indicators of ss education of farmers age of farmers and unemployment are typically included in drought risk assessments for es soil quality indicators considering data extracted from the pedological database of the tuscany region were considered as well as the share of protected areas calculated from the network natura 2000 selected indicators of lcac refer to farm agricultural practices despite controversial research results and opinions about organic agriculture e g clark and tilman 2017 the share of organic agriculture was included as a vulnerability indicator as it is commonly assumed that organic farms are less dependent on external inputs apply good practices such as crop rotation and are more diversified which increases their resilience to adverse events such as drought märker et al 2008 sharafi et al 2020 in addition financial incentives to sustain organic agriculture decrease the vulnerability of organic farms soil conservation practices are also considered to improve the capacity to cope with drought hagenlocher et al 2019 sharafi et al 2020 hence the share of land with minimum or no tillage available for cereal crops was included other good practices linked to the informatization of farming were included with the indicators share of crops managed with the help of software and share of land irrigated with decision support systems the other indicators were related to irrigation namely irrigation system irrigation source and share of irrigable land including the latter which was used as a proxy for the possibility to perform supplemental irrigation might seem a contradiction with the decision to consider irrigated land as an exposed element however at the same time irrigable land or supplemental irrigation is a fundamental adaptation strategy 2 4 data acquisition and pre processing the selected indicators were transformed from absolute to relative values tables 2 and 3 to allow meaningful comparisons between municipalities of different sizes for this procedure the use of data from the same datasets was preferred the indicators in which data were divided into categories namely age of farmers education of farmers irrigation system and irrigation source were ranked according to their vulnerability and assigned the lowest value 0 to the less vulnerable category and the highest value 1 to the most vulnerable one young and educated farmers were considered less vulnerable regarding the irrigation system drip irrigation was considered the less vulnerable followed by sprinkler furrow and flood irrigation for the irrigation source groundwater within the farm was considered the less vulnerable followed by private reservoirs within the farm irrigation water from irrigation consortia and surface water outside of the farm to the category other was assigned the value 0 5 for both irrigation system and irrigation source the same procedure was applied to the indicators obtained from the pedological database of the tuscany region which were divided according to their quality into 8 or 4 classes for these indicators only the agricultural soils were considered few values were missing for the exposure and vulnerability indicators although methods exist to replace missing data oecd 2008 we decided to keep them to avoid further uncertainty in the model by estimating missing values hence for the three municipalities with missing data namely monteroni d arbia gaiole in chianti and radda in chianti results had to be evaluated even more cautiously 2 5 assessment of multicollinearities collinearity or multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables are linearly related dormann et al 2013 generally a multicollinearity analysis is performed to avoid the overrepresentation of the processes represented by the selected indicators ortega gaucin et al 2021 multicollinearity was assessed by applying the spearman correlation matrix for the relativized exposure and vulnerability indicators in line with meza et al 2020 compared to other similar studies a very restrictive threshold r 0 4 was considered to decide which indicators to further evaluate the rationale to decide whether to exclude an indicator was to assess if it expressed the same process as another one 2 6 normalization and weighted aggregation the normalization was performed with the max min method which can be used with all the weighting methods oecd 2008 since there is no consensus in the literature about the best weighting method here we use equal weights which is the most common weighting method in composite indicators oecd 2008 and has been already applied in other drought risk assessments brooks et al 2005 nauditt et al 2022 naumann et al 2014 prabnakorn et al 2019 the normalized values of the indicators were directly used in the calculation of dhi dei and dvi however it is important to notice that dhi dei and dvi had different numbers of indicators therefore for example exposure indicators contributed more compared to vulnerability indicators similarly dvi was calculated as the mean of ss es and lcac which are represented by 3 5 and 6 indicators respectively hence ss indicators contributed more to the final dri compared to es and lcac indicators 2 7 robustness evaluation ideally uncertainty and sensitivity analyses should evaluate all the potential sources of uncertainty including the selection of indicators normalization weighting and aggregation methods etc oecd 2008 in drought risk assessments the most uncertain parts of the methodology are the selection of individual indicators and weights murthy et al 2015 naumann et al 2014 which are generally evaluated by including and excluding single indicators and applying different weighting methods instead external validation has been performed in drought risk assessments using impact data crop yield losses population affected hagenlocher et al 2019 meza et al 2020 soil moisture data hoque et al 2021 consulting experts brooks et al 2005 fontaine and steinemann 2009 or comparing results with external datasets ortega gaucin et al 2021 to verify the robustness of our model both internal and external validations were considered however a good dataset could not be found for the selected study area at the municipality scale therefore a specific uncertainty analysis to account for the most sensible choices to develop the dri was performed by 1 excluding individual exposure and vulnerability indicators 2 including excluded indicators with the multicollinearity analysis 3 using different weighting schemes for the calculation of the dei and dvi 4 aggregating the dhi dei and dvi with arithmetic mean instead of using eq 2 two different weighting methods were considered proportional weights pw naumann et al 2014 were used by calculating the dvi without es ss and lcac and eq 1 also weights for both exposure and vulnerability indicators were calculated with an analytical hierarchical process ahp cantini et al 2019 finally the output of the uncertainty analysis i e the rank of the municipality assigned by the composite indicator rank ci m and the average shift in municipalities rankings r s were compared to evaluate the effect of these different methodologies naumann et al 2014 oecd 2008 the average shift was calculated as the average of the absolute differences in municipalities ranks to a reference ranking which in our case is the rank calculated with equal weights in the n municipalities with the equation 3 r s 1 n m 1 n rank ref ci m rank ci m 2 8 archetype analysis given the high number and diversity of indicators used in our drought risk assessment the interpretation of the results might be complicated affecting the potential usability of the insights provided in the assessment to address this problem we use archetype analysis which is an emerging methodology to find recurrent patterns within cases and provide a simplified but contextual interpretation of results eisenack et al 2019 oberlack et al 2019 akin to the approach used in other spatial archetypes research piemontese et al 2021 a hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to understand the recurrent patterns of drought indicators within the selected municipalities the municipalities were clustered with the ward method ward 1963 considering the whole set of normalized exposure and vulnerability indicators also including the missing data without further preprocessing the resulting clusters were compared with boxplots and other basic statistics finally considering that the ultimate objective of drought risk assessments is to provide the basis for developing drought management strategies hagenlocher et al 2019 hayes et al 2004 the archetypes were used to discuss specific adaptation measures in municipalities with similar drought risk profiles 3 results 3 1 multicollinearity analysis several significant multicollinearities were detected p value 0 05 as a result the indicator share of horticulture and fruticulture was excluded from exposure indicators since it was highly correlated with value of agricultural products and volume of water used for irrigation for the vulnerability indicators climate interference and water deficit were excluded since their variability was explained by other indicators namely soil erosion and soil fertility similarly share of land irrigated with decision support systems was excluded because of its high correlation with irrigable land in this case the decision was also based on the data quality which was lower for the excluded indicator on the other hand the indicator soil depth showed a relatively high and significant correlation with soil erosion but we decided to keep them both since they represent different processes therefore after the multicollinearity analysis one exposure and three vulnerability indicators were excluded and the definitive number of indicators used to calculate the dri was 42 3 2 robustness evaluation results in terms of r s fig 2 show that dri is more affected when individual exposure indicators were excluded with an average r s of 5 19 the indicator that was most impacting when excluded was the share of agricultural land with an r s of 6 45 this value was largely influenced by the extremely high difference in rankings of the monteroni d arbia municipality which is 43 since vulnerability indicators were 14 while the exposure indicators were only 4 their exclusion had a lower impact on dri a remarkable effect was also found by applying the ahp weighting method assigning weights based on personal opinions giving more importance to indicators related to the irrigation practice resulted in a r s of 4 62 with a maximum shift of 16 for the gaiole in chianti municipality finally the use of pw the inclusion of the indicators excluded after the multicollinearity analysis and the aggregation of dhi dei and dvi with arithmetic mean did not have a significant effect on r s summing up our study confirms the findings of other drought risk assessments murthy et al 2015 naumann et al 2014 which identified as major sources of uncertainty the selection of indicators and the weighting method analysing the shifts in rankings of the single municipalities with the alternative methods it is possible to affirm that with some exceptions the rankings were confirmed and the variations were minimal fig a 4 validating the assessment and confirming the robustness of the methodology the municipalities that show the highest r s were also those with missing data namely radda in chianti ranked 23rd and monteroni d arbia ranked 14th the other municipality with missing data is gaiole in chianti which was ranked 5th probably this explains why the r s was not as high as the others since shifts upwards in the ranking had a minimal effect 3 3 drought risk mapping and ranking maps of dhi dei dvi and dri are reported in fig 3 while the rankings of the municipalities are reported in the appendix maps and rankings are briefly discussed in this section while further analysis and discussion are performed when presenting the results of the cluster analysis results of the dhi clearly show that the southern and western coastal municipalities will likely experience the highest drought hazard in particular the province of grosseto will be the most affected including the albegna bruna and lower ombrone watersheds the most exposed municipalities were found along the coast emblematic is the case of campiglia marittima with a very large share of land cultivated with industrial tomatoes requiring high amounts of irrigation water and where high value wines are produced such as gaiole in chianti and montalcino when analysing the drought vulnerability it is necessary to consider that the indicators used to calculate dvi are 14 hence results were more diversified without clear patterns in general it is possible to affirm that inland municipalities located mostly in the provinces of pisa and siena farthest from the coast and the main urban centres were the most vulnerable combining the indexes dri provided an overall estimation of the risk as expected the coastal municipalities of the province of grosseto were found to be the most at risk 3 4 archetype analysis as a result of the hierarchical cluster analysis we divided the municipalities in seven clusters fig 4 the characteristics of exposure and vulnerability of the clusters are reported as boxplots in figs 5 and 6 while the main characteristics and the possible adaptation strategies are listed in table 4 the clusters identified were named according to the most distinctive characteristics of the municipalities included cluster 1 high coastal irrigation comprised coastal municipalities spread among the five watersheds considered cluster 2 high value products included the wine producers municipalities of the chianti hills in the upper ombrone watershed except sassetta cluster 3 high inland irrigation and 4 prevalence of agricultural land were mainly composed by inland municipalities of the provinces of siena and pisa cluster 6 prevalence of agricultural workers consisted in the inland municipalities closest to the coastal ones mainly in the grosseto province the municipalities of cluster 5 erosion prone and vulnerable irrigation sources and 7 erosion prone and vulnerable irrigation systems were spread among the provinces without an evident spatial pattern some patterns can be described by observing the dhi dei dvi and dri for each cluster fig 4 and the rankings of the municipalities in the appendix even though drought hazard indicators were not included in the cluster analysis the municipalities of clusters 1 and 6 ranked highest since they mostly represent the grosseto province considering the dei the highest ranked are municipalities of clusters 1 2 and 6 the values of the dvi were less stretched however there is a prevalence of the municipalities of clusters 3 4 5 and 7 in the highest ranks being dri the aggregation of dhi dei and dvi the prevalence of the municipalities of the clusters 1 and 6 except the municipality gaiole in chianti of cluster 2 among the highest ranked can be easily explained by analyzing the main characteristics of exposure and vulnerability of the seven clusters figs 5 and 6 possible adaptation strategies targeted to the specific characteristics of those clusters of municipalities can be suggested table 4 certainly further information needs to be considered when planning interventions but these indications can be considered as a starting point being the most prone to drought hazard and risk major efforts will have to be directed on the municipalities of cluster 1 and in particular the province of grosseto and the albegna bruna and lower ombrone watersheds 4 discussion 4 1 past and future drought hazard interesting results were found in the estimation of drought hazard correlations between the total severity duration and frequency calculated with spi3 spi6 spi12 and vhi in the 58 municipalities are poor implying that the use of only one of them would have resulted in a different pattern of drought hazard the non standardized indicators of future hazard showed very high correlations when considering the same indicator in the short medium and long term future while much worse correlations between different indicators however this was expected since these indicators do not directly estimate drought although many studies have been conducted on the drought hazard indicators these results confirm the need for further research to individuate the best indicators both used individually and in an ensemble to more accurately account for drought interestingly the correlation between the dhi calculated with past and future hazard indicators showed a coefficient of determination of 0 42 suggesting that past drought hazard dynamics are expected to be confirmed in the future the use of multiple drought hazard indicators to represent different drought types added value to the assessment and was theoretically sound since the impacts on agriculture are represented by different accumulation periods for spi stagge et al 2015 vergni and todisco 2011 even more so when including irrigated areas bachmair et al 2018 huang et al 2018 4 2 selection of indicators and limitations the choice of vulnerability and exposure indicators is critical and needs to be justified properly in the conceptual framework despite some authors consider that a fundamental characteristic of drought risk assessment is their objectivity and simplicity naumann et al 2014 we used a high number of indicators which resulted in unclear vulnerability patterns both in the mapping and in the cluster analysis however vulnerability is influenced by many processes thus over simplifications might lead to unrealistic estimates to sum up a good balance should be found in the number of indicators and multicollinearity analysis was useful to exclude redundant indicators furthermore we used some specific indicators in addition to the generic ones which is commonly advised against since specific vulnerability indicators should be linked to specific exposure indicators carrão et al 2016 for example irrigation indicators should be weighted more where volumes of irrigation water are higher but to account for these complex processes would further complicate the procedure again we argue that the benefits of the inclusion of a higher number of indicators outweigh these negative aspects certainly data limitation is a recurrent problem in many regions of the world and the selection of the indicators is a crucial step that needs to be carefully performed according to data availability objectives spatial scale unit of analysis etc hazard indicators can be calculated with remote sensing based products hence the problem is restricted to exposure and vulnerability indicators given that at least one representative indicator is available for the risk components of eqs 1 and 2 the approach can be replicated using either a sub set of the indicators we proposed or inferring them from other studies e g hagenlocher et al 2019 meza et al 2019 the inclusion of irrigated areas as an exposure indicator is highly recommended when dealing with developed countries in some global carrão et al 2016 continental naumann et al 2014 and regional murthy et al 2015 prabnakorn et al 2019 assessments it is considered a measure of coping capacity that reduces vulnerability but this can be considered true only in some lower income countries where irrigation is limited possibly the use of different irrigated and rainfed specific indicators to represent vulnerability as in meza et al 2020 is a more appropriate approach but in many cases rainfed and irrigated agriculture coexist making it difficult to perform separated analyses a recurrent problem in drought research is that drought hazard is used to predict risk instead of impact which in the end is what really matters enenkel et al 2020 furthermore the role of local stakeholders is crucial for developing sound and effective strategies to cope with extreme events and climate change hayes et al 2004 nguyen et al 2016 vogt et al 2018 world bank 2019 but the integration of local and expert knowledge in drought monitoring and adaptation is challenging due to the reciprocal scepticism giordano et al 2013 also farmers perceptions of drought do not always correspond to the commonly used drought indicators giordano et al 2013 stagge et al 2015 urquijo and de stefano 2016 including hard and soft data quantitative and qualitative data and local and expert knowledge might allow performing a more detailed and meaningful drought risk assessment and should be considered in further research 4 3 linking drought risk assessments with adaptation strategies comparing risk assessment outputs with similar assessments is difficult due to the context specific meaning of the results also no similar drought risk assessment has been performed for central and southern tuscany hence results were compared with more general climate risk analysis for multiple natural hazards performed at the national level with the provinces nuts3 as the units of analysis consistently with the results of our assessment mysiak et al 2018 found that the grosseto province has higher potential climate change impacts and lower adaptive capacity compared with the other provinces similarly spano et al 2020 reported a lower adaptive capacity to climate change for the same area furthermore the pnacc 2018 confirms our results in terms of risk patterns and the highest risk for the province of grosseto which has a medium high adaptive capacity and high potential impacts instead the province of livorno has a medium high adaptive capacity and medium low potential impacts while the provinces of pisa and siena have a high adaptive capacity with the first one with expected medium potential impacts and the latter with high potential impacts projected climate change impacts on yields of durum and common wheat and maize reported in spano et al 2020 do not show clear differences within the areas considered in our assessment overall negative impacts for maize and slight increases in yield for wheat are expected because of the high number of indicators used in the comprehensive risk assessment we used archetype analysis to link the results of the risk assessment with possible adaptation strategies archetype analysis by identifying municipalities with overall similar characteristics and risk profiles can help decision makers to better target the most relevant adaptation strategies to show the potential of the approach proposed in this research the suggested adaptation strategies for clusters 1 high coastal irrigation and 2 high value products which are the most representative are discussed in detail municipalities of cluster 1 have a high drought risk fig 7 driven by intense irrigation potential adaptation strategies include increasing water productivity and improving irrigation efficiency mantino et al 2017 as well as increasing storage with new reservoirs at the same time seawater intrusion and groundwater pollution and depletion need to be considered barazzuoli et al 2008 1999 grassi et al 2007 therefore the use of nature based solutions such as the managed aquifer recharge already tested in a pilot project in the cornia watershed rossetto et al 2019 2018 represents a very promising solution that could significantly reduce the vulnerability of groundwater based irrigation areas additionally these municipalities have the highest water demand in summer when the highest crop irrigation requirements overlap with the peak touristic water demand with the lowest precipitation and the highest evapotranspiration hence further interventions to reduce other water uses domestic and industrial and increase water supply e g desalination wastewater treatment could be beneficial mantino et al 2017 on the other hand municipalities of the second cluster show high exposure and low vulnerability to drought fig 7 in addition to the highest income related to agriculture this cluster has the youngest and most educated farmers who are the most likely to adopt innovative adaptation strategies one crucial intervention is supplemental or emergency irrigation matese et al 2018 which is still underdeveloped in the vineyards of tuscany because of the limited availability of irrigation water d bianchi et al 2021 a possible solution is represented by runoff harvesting structures such as farm ponds which have been already suggested for the hilly areas of central tuscany to overcome summer water shortages napoli et al 2014 in addition to the cluster specific adaptation strategies proposed in table 4 cross cutting strategies could be also considered to tackle drought these include a improved agronomic management b drought resistant varieties c cropping patterns change and diversification and d crop insurance win win solutions with negligible side effects can be achieved by upgrading surface irrigation systems in erosion prone areas suggested in particular for clusters 5 and 7 and using alternative water sources such as desalinization and wastewater treatment especially in cluster 1 recent initiatives of the italian government and other associations anbi and coldiretti strongly reintroduced the debate about the implementation of new reservoirs to cope with drought if properly designed respecting the ecosystems and ensuring sufficient environmental flows this strategy can significantly reduce the drought vulnerability in the context of climate change masia et al 2018 sordo ward et al 2019 however many examples of negative feedback exist linked to water infrastructures such as the increased water consumption and the sense of over reliance that increase vulnerability di baldassarre et al 2021 2018 similar unintended negative consequences might also be promoted by crop insurances deryugina and konar 2017 oecd 2021 furthermore the well known efficiency paradox shows how water savings at the field scale with improved irrigation efficiencies might lead to increased water consumption at the watershed scale dumont et al 2013 grafton et al 2018 these and other counterintuitive dynamics further complicate the planning of some drought adaptation strategies to deal with such complexity and uncertainty the involvement of multiple stakeholders is crucial 5 conclusion a complete drought risk assessment was conducted for 58 municipalities belonging to five coastal watersheds in tuscany central italy the proposed approach allowed to produce a policy relevant drought risk assessment even though adjustments could further improve the methodology the inclusion of multiple drought hazard indicators provided a more comprehensive analysis of drought risk the use of future projections to account for climate change impacts also confirmed the patterns of past hazards however future patterns of vulnerability and exposure should also be considered moreover the inclusion of social and environmental indicators improved the comprehensiveness of the assessment the robustness evaluation confirmed that the most uncertain parts of the methodology to calculate composite indicators are the choice of indicators and the weighting method finally archetype analysis was successfully used to link the results of the assessment with possible adaptation strategies southernmost municipalities of tuscany showed to be the most at risk in particular those belonging to the albegna bruna and lower ombrone watersheds also major efforts should be devoted to the coastal municipalities since multiple sectors use the water resource and the demand is particularly concentrated in the summer months the results of this assessment are meant to be used by local decision makers and experts to plan and promote more tailored and proof based adaptation strategies ideally the results of this drought risk assessment will be the base to fuel the discussion about drought management to involve farmers and

9367,desertification and salinization are both threats to the ecosystem services in inland river oases of arid regions previous studies focus on either desertification or salinization and there is a lack of joint studies on the two issues the essential cause of desertification in a transition zone is usually concentrated irrigation water use which leads to shrink of the subsurface flow field of groundwater decline of the groundwater level and loss of groundwater supply to the vegetation the salinization problem in an oasis area is mainly caused by the local excess groundwater in the oasis referring to secondary salinization which leads to salt migration with the groundwater level rise to form salt crystallization at the land surface thus the processes of desertification and secondary salinization are connected and the solutions to the two problems can be complementary i e by transporting the excess groundwater in the local secondary salinization area to the transition zone area where water is scarce this paper taking luocheng irrigation district in the heihe river basin of northwestern china as an example estimates 1 76 4 70 million m3 of excess groundwater that can be extracted in the salinized area using this amount of water through engineering regulation it is estimated that the transition zone nearby the irrigation district which is under desertification threat can be restored with an area of 23 212 km2 an engineering system is designed for coordinated groundwater regulation and the implementation with an experimental farm in the irrigation district is demonstrated keywords groundwater regulation desertification secondary salinization transition zone restoration 1 introduction oases in arid areas are the carrier of human activities providing land and water resources and living environment for human beings irrigation is a common form of water resources development and utilization in arid areas which enables the process of water concentration in oases having a significant impact on oasis ecosystems yi et al 2015 on the one hand due to the concentrated use of water in an oasis the groundwater level at the outer edge of the subsurface flow field drops resulting in the degradation and disappearance of vegetation in the transition zone between the oasis and the nearby desert furthermore the transition zone declines and desert advances towards the oasis doble et al 2006 on the other hand poor drainage in an irrigation district leads to a sharp rise in the groundwater level resulting in soil salinization leaney et al 2010 desertification and salinization are dual problems commonly co existing in oases located in arid areas and are both caused by improper use of water especially groundwater and both are related to the groundwater depth desertification with declining groundwater depth and salinization with increasing groundwater depth however previous studies focus on either desertification or salinization and there is a lack of joint studies on the two issues which motivates the purpose of this study salinization in arid areas is generally characterized into natural salinization and secondary salinization rengasamy 2006 metternicht et al 2010 mastrocicco et al 2020 oasis basins are featured with low terrains and strong evaporation and soil salt is easy to accumulate within the soil layers and on the soil surface long with groundwater movement this process is defined as natural salinization which is usually difficult to control the secondary salinization is usually caused by human interventions such as e concentrated use of water lack of drainage and irrigation return water percolation which leads to the uplift of the groundwater level and crystallization at the soil surface via soil water evaporation irrigation sustains crop production in much of the world s drylands however in oases irrigation practices fed by both groundwater directly bring up salt in groundwater to the crop root zone kim et al 2003 the practices fed by surface water increase groundwater level and bring up salt from groundwater or directly carry salt to soil from surface water sources with high salt concentration secondary salinization can lead to soil compaction and reduced crop yields which can eventually end with soil barrenness zhou et al 2013 current management practices include flushing and washing salt with large amount of water which not only wastes water but also aggravates the expansion of salinization within the oasis mekonnen et al 1993 darwish et al 2005 current control measures are also to lower the groundwater level adopt water conservancy improvement measures e g using advanced irrigation systems and drainage and silting systems agricultural system improvement e g land leveling tillage and crop pattern biological engineering measures e g planting salt tolerant plants and pastures and soil chemical improvement e g application of gypsum phosphogypsum and other substances liang et al 2005 kitamura et al 2006 swallow and o sullivan 2019 however the cost of biological and chemical improvements is extremely high in the current practices and controlling groundwater level is a relatively realistic method to control secondary salinization the main reason for desertification in the transition zone around an oasis area is the extra amount of groundwater pumping usually for irrigation which leads to the retreat of the groundwater subsurface flow field and the decline of the groundwater level in the transition zone wang et al 2020 2021 when the vegetation in the transition zone cannot access the groundwater the transition zone start to shrink and desert moves to the oasis with the cao et al 2021 desertification is another major ecological issue in arid regions which seriously threatens the ecological safety schlesinger et al 1990 ding et al 2002 for example in the heihe river basin of northwestern china from the 1970 s to the 1990 s the natural oases shrunk the area of the transition zone decreased by 6972 km2 and the desert expanded by 14 281 km2 from the 1990 s to the 2010 s the area of artificial oases increased by 732 km2 but the transition zone further decreased by 4127 km2 as a result the desert area continued to expand tang et al 2015 among the areas in the region gaotai county of zhangye city lost land to desert which is 2 2 times of the land restored in the county li 2003 the growing desertification problem in the region is associated with over pumping of groundwater and river depletion with uncontrolled water resources development and utilization in the heihe river basin resulting in severe ecological degradation remote sensing shows that during the period of 1950 2000 the area of natural populus euphratica and tamarind trees decreased at a rate of 14 3 km2 per year high coverage forests shrubs and meadows decreased by 78 meanwhile the desert area increased by 68 zhao et al 2008 although the restoration efforts during the past two decades have curbed the trend of ecological deterioration the threat of desertification has always been a concern in the region avni 2005 wei et al 2021 desertification and secondary salinization in the transition zone of arid regions have been mostly studied as separate problems in the current literature and it is rare to study the two problems together the processes with both problems are closely related to groundwater level and phreatic evaporation in an arid area bennetts et al 2006 singh et al 2012 eamus et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 this study adopts two critical groundwater depths derived by wang et al 2020 the depth of critical groundwater level causing salinization dcgs within an oasis area the depth of critical groundwater level causing desertification dcgd the principle to jointly control desertification and secondary salinization is to maintain the threshold groundwater depth in the waterlogging area below dcgs and maintain the threshold groundwater depth in the boundary of transition zone and desert above dcgd based on the calculation of the two critical groundwater depths the amount of groundwater extracted from the oasis and transported to the transition zone will be quantified which will be the basis for restoration engineering design following this principle engineering measures can be undertaken to drain the waterlogging area restoring the groundwater depth in the area to be below dcgs and transport the excess water to the transition zone restoring the groundwater depth in the boundary area between the transition zone and the desert to be above dcgd this is supposed to stabilize groundwater depth in the transition zone and prevent desertification development in the boundary area through the complementary measures for dealing with secondary salinization in oasis and desertification in the transition zone a systematic approach will be designed jointly resolve the two problems to sustain crop productivity in the oasis area and prevent desertification in the nearby transition zones as a demonstration example the proposed method will be applied to the luocheng irrigation area located in the oasis of the heihe river basin an inland basin in the arid region of northwestern china 2 methodology maintaining the stability of the boundary between transition zone and desert is the key to control desertification expansion naumburg et al 2005 eamus et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the critical condition at the boundary is a minimum groundwater depth that enables phreatic evaporation for vegetation however the critical condition within an oasis area is a maximum groundwater depth that prevents the salt lifting and salt crystallization these two upper and lower groundwater depth thresholds are connected via groundwater flow in the ecosystem composing of oasis transition zone and desert excessive groundwater pumping and concentrated water use in the system can break the natural equilibrium of water table and cause the dual problems desertification and secondary salinization therefore the two problems can be solved complementarily using an ecosystem approach simultaneously satisfying multiple objectives such as water use for human activities in the oasis area environmental sustainability with the two problems under control and affordable engineering and management costs the idea of the approach is to transport the excess groundwater within the oasis area to the transition zone through engineering means this is based on the hydrological ecological connection of desertification and secondary salinization as well as the landscape characteristics i e the distance between the oasis and the transition zone is generally in the range within ten kilometers the difference in elevation of the plain area is between a few meters and ten meters the control scheme to support the ecosystem approach is shown in fig 1 to implement the control scheme the following questions will be addressed first what is the maximum groundwater depth that prevents secondary salinization within the oasis area h 0 in fig 1 what is the estimated excess water to drain and how to reduce water table to the critical depth via appropriate layout of pumping wells usually with small capacity and drainage channels to drain the excess saline alkali water second what is the minimum groundwater depth that enables phreatic evaporation for vegetation h 2 in fig 1 at the transition zone desert boundary in addition how to adopt the saline water for the vegetation types in the transition zone and in the boundary area considering the salt tolerance of the various vegetation communities third what is the most effective engineering project to transport the water from the oasis to the transition zone desert boundary considering capital cost operation and maintenance cost and the service life of the project aerial pipelines or high altitude pipelines can be used for the water transportation to the transition to the zone desert boundary area at the water receiving area a network of ditches or small scale recharging wells can be used to distribute and recharge the water 2 1 calculating the threshold groundwater depths the threshold groundwater depths the maximum groundwater depth that prevents secondary salinization h 0 eq 1 in the oasis area and the minimum groundwater depth that enables phreatic evaporation for vegetation h 2 eq 2 in the transition zone desert boundary were derived by wang et al 2020 referring to dcgs and dcgd respectively 1 h 0 2 σ t 1 ρ w g 1 6 n 39 5 0 0774 d 2 h 2 2 σ t 2 ρ w g 1 6 n 39 5 0 0774 d d max where σ denotes the surface tension n m ρ w is the water density kg m3 g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 t 1 is the mean temperature in 0 2 m soil layer at the time right before the irrigation season t 2 is the mean temperature in 0 5 m soil layer during the irrigation season d is the he effective grain size n is the soil porosity d max is the maximum thickness of plant root system these equations were validated for the luocheng irrigation district wang et al 2020 which is also the case study area of the current study 2 2 estimating the volume of water causing secondary salinization q secondary salinization occurs in the oasis area when the actual groundwater depth is above the maximum groundwater depth that prevents secondary salinization dcgs the volume of water causing secondary salinization refers to that existing between the actual groundwater depth upper boundary and h0 lower boundary fig 2 the salinization zone is usually located in a low lying area or a closed artesian area of an oasis thus the salinization zone is taken as the calculation unit and a lumped groundwater volume calculation model i e task model is used to conduct the calculation the main parameters required are area of the salinization zone s in km2 the required groundwater level drawdown h in m below h0 and the water yield α no dimension from the aquifer layer the amount of water q in minion m3 is calculated as follows 3 q s h α 2 3 estimating the recovered area in the transition zone with the excess saline groundwater transported to the transition zone and desert boundary the area that can be recovered from ongoing desertification a in km2 can be estimated by the following formula 4 a η q n e t where net is the multiple year mean net evapotranspiration mm requirement gross et minus precipitation η is water loss coefficient during the water delivery 3 a case study in the inland arid region of northwestern china in the inland arid region of northwestern china groundwater is of vital importance to ecology and food security sun et al 2018 in particular groundwater supports the ecosystem that is composed of oasis transition zone and desert in the plains the earliest vegetation survey in the region went back to the 1930 s liu 1934 the china academy of science cas established desert vegetation survey stations in the 1950 s since then cas has conducted systematic surveys observations and experiments on the vegetation and hydrogeology in the region the transition zone between oasis and desert represents a fragile ecosystem in the region especially with the large scale development of irrigated agriculture in the 1980 s the over exploitation of groundwater has led to large scale degradation of vegetation in transition zones and desert has approached to oases in the region due to the situation scholars from china called for restoring ecological water in the region xu et al 1990 followed by policy design for protecting the ecological environment tang 1995 with the advancement of remote sensing technology a water driven oasis transition zone desert ecosphere structure was proposed chen et al 2004 based on the analysis of the eco hydrological mechanism in the transition zone subsequently studies were carried out on the ecological water requirement estimate in transition zones chen 2007 the response relationship between vegetation and groundwater in arid areas and the stability of oasis ecosphere structures wang et al 2002 however desertification in transition zones has always been a major threat to the ecological security and stability of oases for example the irrigated area amount of irrigation water and desert area increase in the middle reach of the heihe river basin a major inland basin in northwestern china are plotted in fig 3 3 1 introduction of the case study area the case study area the luocheng irrigation district lid is located at the junction of the middle and lower reaches of the heihe river basin bordering the badain jaran desert in the north the monthly precipitation during 2005 2020 is shown in fig s1 of the appendix a transition zone with a width of about 0 5 5 0 km exists between the oasis and the desert the problem of secondary salinization caused by improper irrigation and drainage is serious in the area according to the analysis of land use types in the area the salinization area in the lid increased from 2260 ha ha in 1990 3153 ha in 2026 by 40 table 1 shows the irrigated area irrigation water area of transition zone salinization area and desert area appearing in the transition zone the typical hydrogeology conditions in zhangye city lingze county and gaotai county are shown in fig s2 of the appendix 3 2 amount of water to be transported from the oasis to the transition zone the critical depth of groundwater to prevent secondary salinization h0 in the case study area is calculated using eq 1 with a value of 1 3 1 5 m that to prevent desertification h2 is calculated using eq 2 with a value of 8 0 13 0 m by field investigation the current groundwater depth in the salinized area of the irrigation district is 0 0 0 3 m thus to control salinization the groundwater depth needs to be reduced below the critical level by 1 0 1 5 m the main soil type of the area is sandy soil and water yield coefficient is in the range of 0 06 0 16 with silt fine sand medium sand and coarse sand the actual annual evaporation from water surface in the area is 1100 mm qi 2017 the annual evapotranspiration et from the bare land is about 220 mm chen 2007 which is used as the range of et using eq 3 it is estimated that the volume of water that can be transported from the oasis to the transition zone in the lid is in the range of 1 76 4 70 million m3 about 10 of the total irrigation water table 1 3 3 the recovered area in the transition zone the annual ecological water requirement of vegetation in the transition zone of the lid is 80 150 mm depending on the density of vegetation coverage chen 2007 the average annual rainfall in the area is about 70 90 mm the net evapotranspiration net is estimated as 20 mm 40 mm and 70 mm in the recoverable area of the transition zone for the various vegetation communities assuming the water delivery efficiency is 90 with a pipe system the ditch in the receiving area uses a depth l that is less than h2 the critical depth for preventing desertification with these assumptions the recoverable area in the transition zone is estimated by using eq 4 as 23 60 km2 40 106 km2 and 79 212 km2 respectively the final area to recover depends on the vegetation types and density level as well as the quantity and quality i e the salinity level of the saline water transported based on the estimates stated above an area in the transition zone can be recovered with a width of 0 85 2 37 km and an area of 23 0 212 0 km2 by using the water transported from the waterlogging areas of the oasis in the lid as shown in table 2 and fig 4 fig 5 3 4 engineering implementation demonstration the proposed plan including water extraction from the waterlogging area transportation of the water and application of water in the transition zone is demonstrated via engineering implementation at an experimental farm operated by the water management center of the lid the farm located in the middle reach of the lid e 99 65 n 39 65 was built in 1991 covering an area of about 66 67 ha a typical transition zone that can be seen in the region is 2 3 km away from the farm the representative vegetation type is nitraria tangutorum bobr in year 2011 another farm was built in the transition zones on the north south and east sides of the case study farm the establishment of the new farm in 2011started the secondary salinization in the lid experimental farm so far about 20 ha of the farm land has been affected and mostly abandoned the problem is mainly caused by the return water from the irrigation in the new farm water flows from high lying areas the new farm to low lying areas the lid farm that has a poor drainage system which raises the groundwater depth inside the lid farms and resulting in secondary salinization the primary restoration system includes two drainage channels one on the north side of the farm and the other on the south side to control salinization fig 6a the north channel with a depth of 2 m does not collect any water the south channel with a depth of 1 5 m collects water but there is no way to discharge the water in addition five drainage wells were set up in the area where the secondary salinization was particularly serious however the distribution of the drainage wells is not appropriate and the drainage was discharged to neighbor areas and affected other farms thus the primary restoration system does not solve the problem the new restoration system was designed based on the method described in this paper for coordinated mitigation of secondary salinization and desertification around the farm which includes the water transportation via a pump and a pipeline from the saline alkali area within the farm to the nearby transition zone fig 6b the major cost of the new scheme is with the pipeline table 2 however compared with the old scheme the annual operation cost can be saved significantly the drainage pump works within a period of three months before irrigation starts but stops when the groundwater depth drops below 1 5 m the drained water is transported to the transition zone fig 6b shows the engineering layout of the restoration scheme this new system significantly mitigates the secondary salinization within the farm and desertification problem nearby the farm since the operation of the system starting in 2018 the area affected by secondary salinization 20 ha has been restored to land suitable for crop production in the farm meanwhile the vegetation in the transition zone shows a trend of increasing density according to field observation fig 7 and the secondary salinization of the irrigation area has slowed fig 8 due to the hysteresis effect with vegetation changes continuous observations will identify more vegetation change in the transition zone the vegetation restoration in the transition zone depends on salt tolerance of the vegetation community as well as water quantity and water quality i e salt concentration zedler et al 1986 ghorbanalizadeh 2020 the vegetation communities in the transition zone of the study area include nitraria tangutorum bobr plus calligonum mongolicum turcz and glycyrrhiza uralensis fisch community tamarix chinensis lour plus alhagi sparsifolia shap haloxylon ammodendron c a mey bunge and agriophyllum squarrosum l moqcommunity nitraria tangutorum bobr belongs to short shrubs a popular cold toleran and salt tolerant vegetation in deserts calligonum mongolicum turcz is shrub that grows in sandy soils and is strongly xerophyte and salinity tolerant which is widely distributed in desert steppes and desert areas semi mobile sandy land sand covered gobi sandy gravel slope and dry riverbed calligonum mongolicum turcz has strong resistance to drought wind and a sand burial environment tamarix chinensis lour is a salt tolerant xerophytic mesophytic shrub a main species of shrubs in the desert zone especially the sandy steppe or lowland between the dunes tamarix chinensis lour grows best when the groundwater depth is 2 3 m its growth is inhibited when the groundwater depth is 5 7 m and dies if the when the groundwater depth is deeper than 10 m it is suitable for growing in chloride sulfate saline soil containing 1 2 or more soluble salt 1 2 organic matter content and 15 20 topsoil salinity haloxylon ammodendron is a shrub growing on sand dunes saline alkali soil deserts sandy land by rivers etc with the taproot of 1 9 7 0 m alhagi sparsifolia shap is a semi shrub belonging to the transition community from mesophyte to xerophyte and a plant with strong resistance to drought salinity and waterlogging which can grow in salinized desert soil sandy and loamy saline soil and locations with high groundwater level the main root of camel thorn is thick and strong and reaches the water table with a depth of 12 m chen 2001 cai et al 2015 qiu et al 2011 zhao et al 2018 overall the vegetation communities in the transition zone are drought tolerant and saline alkali tolerant shrubs and sub shrubs with well developed root systems and they can use the brackish water delivered to the transition zone 4 discussions 4 1 effect on groundwater and soil moisture in surrounding areas the restoration plan is to transport the excess groundwater in the secondary salinization area to the transition zone area to at least partially satisfy the vegetation evapotranspiration requirement thus in the entire system water is transported from one part of the system to the other and will not cause new water requirement per se however reducing the water table in areas with secondary salinization can if not controlled cause the decline of water table and soil moisture in surrounding areas this potential problem was addressed by optimizing the draining well scheme based on dynamic influence of drainage extraction on the water table wang et al 2021 specifically an appropriate distance 213 m was chosen between draining wells when water table is below the critical burial depth of groundwater in the secondary salinization area the draining wells will stop work through simulation analysis and field observation this scheme can effectively maintain the groundwater level in the areas with secondary salinization below the critical burial depth without significant impact on groundwater availability in the surrounding cultivated lands wang et al 2021 in addition the basis of the proposed coordinated control of the two ecosystems i e oasis and transition zone is based on a premise that there is no physical space barrier between the two ecosystems the water regulation within the study area is thus complimentary to the two ecosystems 4 2 groundwater salinity change in the water logged area and the transition zone about 10 of the entire cultivated land in the heihe river basin is affected by secondary salinization field measurement shows that the maximum level of soil water salinity is 5 35 g l in the water logged area which belongs to saltwater with salt concentration of 3 10 g l or brine with salt concentration of 10 50 g l see table s1 on groundwater sources in appendix the excess water transported from the secondary salinization area is not directly used for vegetation but recharged to the aquifer with the depth between d max and d max h the maximum thickness of plant root system the thickness of phreatic influence zone through recharging wells in this way part of the salt content will be filtered by soil in the filtration process following some sampling analysis the height of salt moving up with water does not exceed h generally less than 2 m in addition although the salt content in the soil after the regulation may increase to some extent it does not affect the vegetation in the transition zone since it is more salt tolerant that the vegetation in an oasis area this issue was also addressed by wang et al 2020 the salt accumulation varies with the groundwater burial depth it is noticed that the depths from the peak salt concentration point to the groundwater surface under the various groundwater burial depths are all less than 2 m the larger the groundwater burial depth the less the peak salt concentration see fig s3 in appendix therefore when we transport the excess water in the secondary salinization area to the transition zone and recharge it by wells to the depth below the vegetation root system the maximum root depth is 6 m wang et al 2020 the salinity of soil water will be reduced due to soil filtering which makes the soil water suitable for vegetation via water absorption from soil meanwhile it will not cause new secondary salinization in the transition zone according to wang et al 2020 the critical burial depth of groundwater to prevent secondary salinization is 1 5 1 8 m moreover since the amount of water transferred from the salinized area to the transition zone is limited compared to the amount of groundwater availability in the transition zone the transfer does not significantly change the salt concentration to the water receiving area according to the observations from two monitoring wells established by zhangye water affairs bureau after the regulation in 2018 the change of groundwater salinity in the irrigation area with neither station 3 nearby the stream nor the transition zone with station 10 with a distance from the stream was not obvious fig 9 however long term monitoring is needed for the salinity change issue in both water logged oasis area and the transition zone receiving the water transfer especially when large scale implementation of the regulation measure is undertaken 5 conclusion and future work based on the hydrological connectedness of the dual problems desertification and salinization commonly co existing in the oasis and the transition zone of an arid area an approach for synergistically solving the two problems is proposed this approach is supported by the estimates of two threshold groundwater depths depth of critical groundwater level causing salinization dcgs within the oasis area and depth of critical groundwater level causing desertification dcgd at the boundary between the transition zone and desert dcgs is used to estimate the volume of water to be drained to prevent salinization in the oasis dcgd is used to estimate the area that can be recovered from desertification by using the water transported from the waterlogging area of the oasis vegetation under the consideration of vegetation community characteristics as well as the quantity and quality i e the salinity level of the water delivered the proposed approach is applied to lid located in the heihe river basin in northwestern china resulting in estimated amount of water to be drained in the salinized area 1 76 4 70million m3 and area of land to be recovered from desertification in the transition zone 23 212 km2 the approach was also implemented in the lid experimental farm to demonstrate the engineering scheme with cost and environmental benefits restored salinized area and restored area under desertification threat this paper shows the feasibility of the proposed method and engineering scheme that is essentially based on groundwater level controls within the oasis area and at the boundary between the transition zone and the desert further research is needed to assess the environmental and economic impacts in a more comprehensive way in order to extend the approach and engineering scheme demonstrated in this study to a larger area specific studies are needed to assess any unintended effects on water resources availability and use and ecosystem services when the regulation is realized extensively this can be realized by monitoring the changes of the groundwater levels in the oasis and transition zone areas the changes in the areas of salinization land transition zone and desertification land in the transition zone and the changes of the vegetation types coverage quantity in the transition zone economic cost and benefit assessment should consider broader social and environmental cost and benefit in addition the more effective use of the saline water resources for desertification prevention should be conducted by taking advantage of vegetation community characteristics e g diversity and

9367,desertification and salinization are both threats to the ecosystem services in inland river oases of arid regions previous studies focus on either desertification or salinization and there is a lack of joint studies on the two issues the essential cause of desertification in a transition zone is usually concentrated irrigation water use which leads to shrink of the subsurface flow field of groundwater decline of the groundwater level and loss of groundwater supply to the vegetation the salinization problem in an oasis area is mainly caused by the local excess groundwater in the oasis referring to secondary salinization which leads to salt migration with the groundwater level rise to form salt crystallization at the land surface thus the processes of desertification and secondary salinization are connected and the solutions to the two problems can be complementary i e by transporting the excess groundwater in the local secondary salinization area to the transition zone area where water is scarce this paper taking luocheng irrigation district in the heihe river basin of northwestern china as an example estimates 1 76 4 70 million m3 of excess groundwater that can be extracted in the salinized area using this amount of water through engineering regulation it is estimated that the transition zone nearby the irrigation district which is under desertification threat can be restored with an area of 23 212 km2 an engineering system is designed for coordinated groundwater regulation and the implementation with an experimental farm in the irrigation district is demonstrated keywords groundwater regulation desertification secondary salinization transition zone restoration 1 introduction oases in arid areas are the carrier of human activities providing land and water resources and living environment for human beings irrigation is a common form of water resources development and utilization in arid areas which enables the process of water concentration in oases having a significant impact on oasis ecosystems yi et al 2015 on the one hand due to the concentrated use of water in an oasis the groundwater level at the outer edge of the subsurface flow field drops resulting in the degradation and disappearance of vegetation in the transition zone between the oasis and the nearby desert furthermore the transition zone declines and desert advances towards the oasis doble et al 2006 on the other hand poor drainage in an irrigation district leads to a sharp rise in the groundwater level resulting in soil salinization leaney et al 2010 desertification and salinization are dual problems commonly co existing in oases located in arid areas and are both caused by improper use of water especially groundwater and both are related to the groundwater depth desertification with declining groundwater depth and salinization with increasing groundwater depth however previous studies focus on either desertification or salinization and there is a lack of joint studies on the two issues which motivates the purpose of this study salinization in arid areas is generally characterized into natural salinization and secondary salinization rengasamy 2006 metternicht et al 2010 mastrocicco et al 2020 oasis basins are featured with low terrains and strong evaporation and soil salt is easy to accumulate within the soil layers and on the soil surface long with groundwater movement this process is defined as natural salinization which is usually difficult to control the secondary salinization is usually caused by human interventions such as e concentrated use of water lack of drainage and irrigation return water percolation which leads to the uplift of the groundwater level and crystallization at the soil surface via soil water evaporation irrigation sustains crop production in much of the world s drylands however in oases irrigation practices fed by both groundwater directly bring up salt in groundwater to the crop root zone kim et al 2003 the practices fed by surface water increase groundwater level and bring up salt from groundwater or directly carry salt to soil from surface water sources with high salt concentration secondary salinization can lead to soil compaction and reduced crop yields which can eventually end with soil barrenness zhou et al 2013 current management practices include flushing and washing salt with large amount of water which not only wastes water but also aggravates the expansion of salinization within the oasis mekonnen et al 1993 darwish et al 2005 current control measures are also to lower the groundwater level adopt water conservancy improvement measures e g using advanced irrigation systems and drainage and silting systems agricultural system improvement e g land leveling tillage and crop pattern biological engineering measures e g planting salt tolerant plants and pastures and soil chemical improvement e g application of gypsum phosphogypsum and other substances liang et al 2005 kitamura et al 2006 swallow and o sullivan 2019 however the cost of biological and chemical improvements is extremely high in the current practices and controlling groundwater level is a relatively realistic method to control secondary salinization the main reason for desertification in the transition zone around an oasis area is the extra amount of groundwater pumping usually for irrigation which leads to the retreat of the groundwater subsurface flow field and the decline of the groundwater level in the transition zone wang et al 2020 2021 when the vegetation in the transition zone cannot access the groundwater the transition zone start to shrink and desert moves to the oasis with the cao et al 2021 desertification is another major ecological issue in arid regions which seriously threatens the ecological safety schlesinger et al 1990 ding et al 2002 for example in the heihe river basin of northwestern china from the 1970 s to the 1990 s the natural oases shrunk the area of the transition zone decreased by 6972 km2 and the desert expanded by 14 281 km2 from the 1990 s to the 2010 s the area of artificial oases increased by 732 km2 but the transition zone further decreased by 4127 km2 as a result the desert area continued to expand tang et al 2015 among the areas in the region gaotai county of zhangye city lost land to desert which is 2 2 times of the land restored in the county li 2003 the growing desertification problem in the region is associated with over pumping of groundwater and river depletion with uncontrolled water resources development and utilization in the heihe river basin resulting in severe ecological degradation remote sensing shows that during the period of 1950 2000 the area of natural populus euphratica and tamarind trees decreased at a rate of 14 3 km2 per year high coverage forests shrubs and meadows decreased by 78 meanwhile the desert area increased by 68 zhao et al 2008 although the restoration efforts during the past two decades have curbed the trend of ecological deterioration the threat of desertification has always been a concern in the region avni 2005 wei et al 2021 desertification and secondary salinization in the transition zone of arid regions have been mostly studied as separate problems in the current literature and it is rare to study the two problems together the processes with both problems are closely related to groundwater level and phreatic evaporation in an arid area bennetts et al 2006 singh et al 2012 eamus et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 this study adopts two critical groundwater depths derived by wang et al 2020 the depth of critical groundwater level causing salinization dcgs within an oasis area the depth of critical groundwater level causing desertification dcgd the principle to jointly control desertification and secondary salinization is to maintain the threshold groundwater depth in the waterlogging area below dcgs and maintain the threshold groundwater depth in the boundary of transition zone and desert above dcgd based on the calculation of the two critical groundwater depths the amount of groundwater extracted from the oasis and transported to the transition zone will be quantified which will be the basis for restoration engineering design following this principle engineering measures can be undertaken to drain the waterlogging area restoring the groundwater depth in the area to be below dcgs and transport the excess water to the transition zone restoring the groundwater depth in the boundary area between the transition zone and the desert to be above dcgd this is supposed to stabilize groundwater depth in the transition zone and prevent desertification development in the boundary area through the complementary measures for dealing with secondary salinization in oasis and desertification in the transition zone a systematic approach will be designed jointly resolve the two problems to sustain crop productivity in the oasis area and prevent desertification in the nearby transition zones as a demonstration example the proposed method will be applied to the luocheng irrigation area located in the oasis of the heihe river basin an inland basin in the arid region of northwestern china 2 methodology maintaining the stability of the boundary between transition zone and desert is the key to control desertification expansion naumburg et al 2005 eamus et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the critical condition at the boundary is a minimum groundwater depth that enables phreatic evaporation for vegetation however the critical condition within an oasis area is a maximum groundwater depth that prevents the salt lifting and salt crystallization these two upper and lower groundwater depth thresholds are connected via groundwater flow in the ecosystem composing of oasis transition zone and desert excessive groundwater pumping and concentrated water use in the system can break the natural equilibrium of water table and cause the dual problems desertification and secondary salinization therefore the two problems can be solved complementarily using an ecosystem approach simultaneously satisfying multiple objectives such as water use for human activities in the oasis area environmental sustainability with the two problems under control and affordable engineering and management costs the idea of the approach is to transport the excess groundwater within the oasis area to the transition zone through engineering means this is based on the hydrological ecological connection of desertification and secondary salinization as well as the landscape characteristics i e the distance between the oasis and the transition zone is generally in the range within ten kilometers the difference in elevation of the plain area is between a few meters and ten meters the control scheme to support the ecosystem approach is shown in fig 1 to implement the control scheme the following questions will be addressed first what is the maximum groundwater depth that prevents secondary salinization within the oasis area h 0 in fig 1 what is the estimated excess water to drain and how to reduce water table to the critical depth via appropriate layout of pumping wells usually with small capacity and drainage channels to drain the excess saline alkali water second what is the minimum groundwater depth that enables phreatic evaporation for vegetation h 2 in fig 1 at the transition zone desert boundary in addition how to adopt the saline water for the vegetation types in the transition zone and in the boundary area considering the salt tolerance of the various vegetation communities third what is the most effective engineering project to transport the water from the oasis to the transition zone desert boundary considering capital cost operation and maintenance cost and the service life of the project aerial pipelines or high altitude pipelines can be used for the water transportation to the transition to the zone desert boundary area at the water receiving area a network of ditches or small scale recharging wells can be used to distribute and recharge the water 2 1 calculating the threshold groundwater depths the threshold groundwater depths the maximum groundwater depth that prevents secondary salinization h 0 eq 1 in the oasis area and the minimum groundwater depth that enables phreatic evaporation for vegetation h 2 eq 2 in the transition zone desert boundary were derived by wang et al 2020 referring to dcgs and dcgd respectively 1 h 0 2 σ t 1 ρ w g 1 6 n 39 5 0 0774 d 2 h 2 2 σ t 2 ρ w g 1 6 n 39 5 0 0774 d d max where σ denotes the surface tension n m ρ w is the water density kg m3 g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 t 1 is the mean

soil porosity d max is the maximum thickness of plant root system these equations were validated for the luocheng irrigation district wang et al 2020 which is also the case study area of the current study 2 2 estimating the volume of water causing secondary salinization q secondary salinization occurs in the oasis area when the actual groundwater depth is above the maximum groundwater depth that prevents secondary salinization dcgs the volume of water causing secondary salinization refers to that existing between the actual groundwater depth upper boundary and h0 lower boundary fig 2 the salinization zone is usually located in a low lying area or a closed artesian area of an oasis thus the salinization zone is taken as the calculation unit and a lumped groundwater volume calculation model i e task model is used to conduct the calculation the main parameters required are area of the salinization zone s in km2 the required groundwater level drawdown h in m below h0 and the water yield α no dimension from the aquifer layer the amount of water q in minion m3 is calculated as follows 3 q s h α 2 3 estimating the recovered area in the transition zone with the excess saline groundwater transported to the transition zone and desert boundary the area that can be recovered from ongoing desertification a in km2 can be estimated by the following formula 4 a η q n e t where net is the multiple year mean net evapotranspiration mm requirement gross et minus precipitation η is water loss coefficient during the water delivery 3 a case study in the inland arid region of northwestern china in the inland arid region of northwestern china groundwater is of vital importance to ecology and food security sun et al 2018 in particular groundwater supports the ecosystem that is composed of oasis transition zone and desert in the plains the earliest vegetation survey in the region went back to the 1930 s liu 1934 the china academy of science cas established desert vegetation survey stations in the 1950 s since then cas has conducted systematic surveys observations and experiments on the vegetation and hydrogeology in the region the transition zone between oasis and desert represents a fragile ecosystem in the region especially with the large scale development of irrigated agriculture in the 1980 s the over exploitation of groundwater has led to large scale degradation of vegetation in transition zones and desert has approached to oases in the region due to the situation scholars from china called for restoring ecological water in the region xu et al 1990 followed by policy design for protecting the ecological environment tang 1995 with the advancement of remote sensing technology a water driven oasis transition zone desert ecosphere structure was proposed chen et al 2004 based on the analysis of the eco hydrological mechanism in the transition zone subsequently studies were carried out on the ecological water requirement estimate in transition zones chen 2007 the response relationship between vegetation and groundwater in arid areas and the stability of oasis ecosphere structures wang et al 2002 however desertification in transition zones has always been a major threat to the ecological security and stability of oases for example the irrigated area amount of irrigation water and desert area increase in the middle reach of the heihe river basin a major inland basin in northwestern china are plotted in fig 3 3 1 introduction of the case study area the case study area the luocheng irrigation district lid is located at the junction of the middle and lower reaches of the heihe river basin bordering the badain jaran desert in the north the monthly precipitation during 2005 2020 is shown in fig s1 of the appendix a transition zone with a width of about 0 5 5 0 km exists between the oasis and the desert the problem of secondary salinization caused by improper irrigation and drainage is serious in the area according to the analysis of land use types in the area the salinization area in the lid increased from 2260 ha ha in 1990 3153 ha in 2026 by 40 table 1 shows the irrigated area irrigation water area of transition zone salinization area and desert area appearing in the transition zone the typical hydrogeology conditions in zhangye city lingze county and gaotai county are shown in fig s2 of the appendix 3 2 amount of water to be transported from the oasis to the transition zone the critical depth of groundwater to prevent secondary salinization h0 in the case study area is calculated using eq 1 with a value of 1 3 1 5 m that to prevent desertification h2 is calculated using eq 2 with a value of 8 0 13 0 m by field investigation the current groundwater depth in the salinized area of the irrigation district is 0 0 0 3 m thus to control salinization the groundwater depth needs to be reduced below the critical level by 1 0 1 5 m the main soil type of the area is sandy soil and water yield coefficient is in the range of 0 06 0 16 with silt fine sand medium sand and coarse sand the actual annual evaporation from water surface in the area is 1100 mm qi 2017 the annual evapotranspiration et from the bare land is about 220 mm chen 2007 which is used as the range of et using eq 3 it is estimated that the volume of water that can be transported from the oasis to the transition zone in the lid is in the range of 1 76 4 70 million m3 about 10 of the total irrigation water table 1 3 3 the recovered area in the transition zone the annual ecological water requirement of vegetation in the transition zone of the lid is 80 150 mm depending on the density of vegetation coverage chen 2007 the average annual rainfall in the area is about 70 90 mm the net evapotranspiration net is estimated as 20 mm 40 mm and 70 mm in the recoverable area of the transition zone for the various vegetation communities assuming the water delivery efficiency is 90 with a pipe system the ditch in the receiving area uses a depth l that is less than h2 the critical depth for preventing desertification with these assumptions the recoverable area in the transition zone is estimated by using eq 4 as 23 60 km2 40 106 km2 and 79 212 km2 respectively the final area to recover depends on the vegetation types and density level as well as the quantity and quality i e the salinity level of the saline water transported based on the estimates stated above an area in the transition zone can be recovered with a width of 0 85 2 37 km and an area of 23 0 212 0 km2 by using the water transported from the waterlogging areas of the oasis in the lid as shown in table 2 and fig 4 fig 5 3 4 engineering implementation demonstration the proposed plan including water extraction from the waterlogging area transportation of the water and application of water in the transition zone is demonstrated via engineering implementation at an experimental farm operated by the water management center of the lid the farm located in the middle reach of the lid e 99 65 n 39 65 was built in 1991 covering an area of about 66 67 ha a typical transition zone that can be seen in the region is 2 3 km away from the farm the representative vegetation type is nitraria tangutorum bobr in year 2011 another farm was built in the transition zones on the north south and east sides of the case study farm the establishment of the new farm in 2011started the secondary salinization in the lid experimental farm so far about 20 ha of the farm land has been affected and mostly abandoned the problem is mainly caused by the return water from the irrigation in the new farm water flows from high lying areas the new farm to low lying areas the lid farm that has a poor drainage system which raises the groundwater depth inside the lid farms and resulting in secondary salinization the primary restoration system includes two drainage channels one on the north side of the farm and the other on the south side to control salinization fig 6a the north channel with a depth of 2 m does not collect any water the south channel with a depth of 1 5 m collects water but there is no way to discharge the water in addition five drainage wells were set up in the area where the secondary salinization was particularly serious however the distribution of the drainage wells is not appropriate and the drainage was discharged to neighbor areas and affected other farms thus the primary restoration system does not solve the problem the new restoration system was designed based on the method described in this paper for coordinated mitigation of secondary salinization and desertification around the farm which includes the water transportation via a pump and a pipeline from the saline alkali area within the farm to the nearby transition zone fig 6b the major cost of the new scheme is with the pipeline table 2 however compared with the old scheme the annual operation cost can be saved significantly the drainage pump works within a period of three months before irrigation starts but stops when the groundwater depth drops below 1 5 m the drained water is transported to the transition zone fig 6b shows the engineering layout of the restoration scheme this new system significantly mitigates the secondary salinization within the farm and desertification problem nearby the farm since the operation of the system starting in 2018 the area affected by secondary salinization 20 ha has been restored to land suitable for crop production in the farm meanwhile the vegetation in the transition zone shows a trend of increasing density according to field observation fig 7 and the secondary salinization of the irrigation area has slowed fig 8 due to the hysteresis effect with vegetation changes continuous observations will identify more vegetation change in the transition zone the vegetation restoration in the transition zone depends on salt tolerance of the vegetation community as well as water quantity and water quality i e salt concentration zedler et al 1986 ghorbanalizadeh 2020 the vegetation communities in the transition zone of the study area include nitraria tangutorum bobr plus calligonum mongolicum turcz and glycyrrhiza uralensis fisch community tamarix chinensis lour plus alhagi sparsifolia shap haloxylon ammodendron c a mey bunge and agriophyllum squarrosum l moqcommunity nitraria tangutorum bobr belongs to short shrubs a popular cold toleran and salt tolerant vegetation in deserts calligonum mongolicum turcz is shrub that grows in sandy soils and is strongly xerophyte and salinity tolerant which is widely distributed in desert steppes and desert areas semi mobile sandy land sand covered gobi sandy gravel slope and dry riverbed calligonum mongolicum turcz has strong resistance to drought wind and a sand burial environment tamarix chinensis lour is a salt tolerant xerophytic mesophytic shrub a main species of shrubs in the desert zone especially the sandy steppe or lowland between the dunes tamarix chinensis lour grows best when the groundwater depth is 2 3 m its growth is inhibited when the groundwater depth is 5 7 m and dies if the when the groundwater depth is deeper than 10 m it is suitable for growing in chloride sulfate saline soil containing 1 2 or more soluble salt 1 2 organic matter content and 15 20 topsoil salinity haloxylon ammodendron is a shrub growing on sand dunes saline alkali soil deserts sandy land by rivers etc with the taproot of 1 9 7 0 m alhagi sparsifolia shap is a semi shrub belonging to the transition community from mesophyte to xerophyte and a plant with strong resistance to drought salinity and waterlogging which can grow in salinized desert soil sandy and loamy saline soil and locations with high groundwater level the main root of camel thorn is thick and strong and reaches the water table with a depth of 12 m chen 2001 cai et al 2015 qiu et al 2011 zhao et al 2018 overall the vegetation communities in the transition zone are drought tolerant and saline alkali tolerant shrubs and sub shrubs with well developed root systems and they can use the brackish water delivered to the transition zone 4 discussions 4 1 effect on groundwater and soil moisture in surrounding areas the restoration plan is to transport the excess groundwater in the secondary salinization area to the transition zone area to at least partially satisfy the vegetation evapotranspiration requirement thus in the entire system water is transported from one part of the system to the other and will not cause new water requirement per se however reducing the water table in areas with secondary salinization can if not controlled cause the decline of water table and soil moisture in surrounding areas this potential problem was addressed by optimizing the draining well scheme based on dynamic influence of drainage extraction on the water table wang et al 2021 specifically an appropriate distance 213 m was chosen between draining wells when water table is below the critical burial depth of groundwater in the secondary salinization area the draining wells will stop work through simulation analysis and field observation this scheme can effectively maintain the groundwater level in the areas with secondary salinization below the critical burial depth without significant impact on groundwater availability in the surrounding cultivated lands wang et al 2021 in addition the basis of the proposed coordinated control of the two ecosystems i e oasis and transition zone is based on a premise that there is no physical space barrier between the two ecosystems the water regulation within the study area is thus complimentary to the two ecosystems 4 2 groundwater salinity change in the water logged area and the transition zone about 10 of the entire cultivated land in the heihe river basin is affected by secondary salinization field measurement shows that the maximum level of soil water salinity is 5 35 g l in the water logged area which belongs to saltwater with salt concentration of 3 10 g l or brine with salt concentration of 10 50 g l see table s1 on groundwater sources in appendix the excess water transported from the secondary salinization area is not directly used for vegetation but recharged to the aquifer with the depth between d max and d max h the maximum thickness of plant root system the thickness of phreatic influence zone through recharging wells in this way part of the salt content will be filtered by soil in the filtration process following some sampling analysis the height of salt moving up with water does not exceed h generally less than 2 m in addition although the salt content in the soil after the regulation may increase to some extent it does not affect the vegetation in the transition zone since it is more salt tolerant that the vegetation in an oasis area this issue was also addressed by wang et al 2020 the salt accumulation varies with the groundwater burial depth it is noticed that the depths from the peak salt concentration point to the groundwater surface under the various groundwater burial depths are all less than 2 m the larger the groundwater burial depth the less the peak salt concentration see fig s3 in appendix therefore when we transport the excess water in the secondary salinization area to the transition zone and recharge it by wells to the depth below the vegetation root system the maximum root depth is 6 m wang et al 2020 the salinity of soil water will be reduced due to soil filtering which makes the soil water suitable for vegetation via water absorption from soil meanwhile it will not cause new secondary salinization in the transition zone according to wang et al 2020 the critical burial depth of groundwater to prevent secondary salinization is 1 5 1 8 m moreover since the amount of water transferred from the salinized area to the transition zone is limited compared to the amount of groundwater availability in the transition zone the transfer does not significantly change the salt concentration to the water receiving area according to the observations from two monitoring wells established by zhangye water affairs bureau after the regulation in 2018 the change of groundwater salinity in the irrigation area with neither station 3 nearby the stream nor the transition zone with station 10 with a distance from the stream was not obvious fig 9 however long term monitoring is needed for the salinity change issue in both water logged oasis area and the transition zone receiving the water transfer especially when large scale implementation of the regulation measure is undertaken 5 conclusion and future work based on the hydrological connectedness of the dual problems desertification and salinization commonly co existing in the oasis and the transition zone of an arid area an approach for synergistically solving the two problems is proposed this approach is supported by the estimates of two threshold groundwater depths depth of critical groundwater level causing salinization dcgs within the oasis area and depth of critical groundwater level causing desertification dcgd at the boundary between the transition zone and desert dcgs is used to estimate the volume of water to be drained to prevent salinization in the oasis dcgd is used to estimate the area that can be recovered from desertification by using the water transported from the waterlogging area of the oasis vegetation under the consideration of vegetation community characteristics as well as the quantity and quality i e the salinity level of the water delivered the proposed approach is applied to lid located in the heihe river basin in northwestern china resulting in estimated amount of water to be drained in the salinized area 1 76 4 70million m3 and area of land to be recovered from desertification in the transition zone 23 212 km2 the approach was also implemented in the lid experimental farm to demonstrate the engineering scheme with cost and environmental benefits restored salinized area and restored area under desertification threat this paper shows the feasibility of the proposed method and engineering scheme that is essentially based on groundwater level controls within the oasis area and at the boundary between the transition zone and the desert further research is needed to assess the environmental and economic impacts in a more comprehensive way in order to extend the approach and engineering scheme demonstrated in this study to a larger area specific studies are needed to assess any unintended effects on water resources availability and use and ecosystem services when the regulation is realized extensively this can be realized by monitoring the changes of the groundwater levels in the oasis and transition zone areas the changes in the areas of salinization land transition zone and desertification land in the transition zone and the changes of the vegetation types coverage quantity in the transition zone economic cost and benefit assessment should consider broader social and environmental cost and benefit in addition the more effective use of the saline water resources for desertification prevention should be conducted by taking advantage of vegetation community characteristics e g diversity and

9368,surface irrigation worldwide exhibits low efficiency due to excessively deep percolation and runoff to optimize surface irrigation practice two questions must be answered simultaneously when to irrigate and how to irrigate what stream size to use and for how long to meet crop water requirements current surface irrigation optimization models are one dimensional meaning they can only simulate surface water flow neglecting subsurface flow they therefore indicate only how to irrigate not when to irrigate furthermore the required depth of irrigation is needed as input data for optimization though this parameter is difficult to establish accurately in addition the effects of different irrigation practices on crop transpiration and yield and variations in these across an irrigated field are unknown the present study adopts two one dimensional simulation models winsrfr for surface flow and swap for subsurface flow to determine when and how best to irrigate in a blocked end furrow irrigation system for sugarcane cultivation in southwestern iran swap is used to determine irrigation schedule required irrigation depth and crop transpiration along furrows while winsrfr is used to determine the soil infiltration function and evaluate and optimize irrigation practice the results of the combined model approach indicate that some 2 7 times more water is applied than required in current practice imposing high waterlogging stress on sugarcane crops according to the swap simulations the required irrigation depth is some 75 mm and the number of irrigation applications can be reduced from 26 to 19 the irrigation optimization in winsrfr indicates that irrigation depth can be reduced from 162 mm to 81 mm resulting in application efficiency increasing from 47 to 92 furthermore as furrow slope increases from 0 02 to 0 12 optimized stream size decreases from 3 0 to 1 6 l s and optimized irrigation cutoff times increase from 3 2 to 6 5 hrs overall optimization of irrigation practice using the combined model approach could result in 63 water conservation and 22 higher sugarcane yield keywords application efficiency blocked end furrow soil infiltration stream size cutoff time sugarcane 1 introduction surface irrigation is the most commonly used irrigation method throughout the world due largely to its applicability and low cost in khuzestan province southwestern iran blocked end furrow irrigation is used to irrigate more than 100 000 ha of sugarcane fields irrigation of sugarcane crops in this arid region relies almost entirely on water from the karun river in the spring and summer seasons however this period of high sugarcane water demand coincides with decreased river discharge in the context of climate change this has led to serious conflicts over river water allocations overirrigation of sugarcane in khuzestan province has resulted in low irrigation efficiency and excessively deep percolation akram et al 2013 estimated the overall irrigation efficiency of three sugarcane units of southern khuzestan to be around 41 abbasi and sheini dashtegol 2017 found the irrigation efficiency of four sugarcane units in khuzestan province to be 42 5 on average in blocked end furrow irrigation systems water loss occurs in the form of deep percolation in sugarcane production excessively deep percolation not only wastes water but also leaches nitrate and other agrochemicals into groundwater or drainage water causing environmental problems optimized irrigation management can increase both water use efficiency and crop production in sugarcane cultivation to optimize surface irrigation practice two main questions must be answered simultaneously when to irrigate and how to irrigate in other words for surface irrigation optimization we need to know what is an optimum irrigation schedule irrigation dates and required irrigation depths to meet crop water requirements and what are optimum stream sizes and cutoff times to provide the required irrigation depths in the field the surface irrigation simulation models currently used cannot simultaneously answer the questions of when and how to irrigate limitations and uncertainties also remain regarding the credibility of their results although surface and subsurface water flows are inherently connected surface irrigation simulation models are one dimensional meaning they can only simulate surface water flow neglecting subsurface flow major issues both logical e g time scales and technical e g analytical and computational solvability have limited ability to implement coupled simulations of surface and subsurface flows in two and three dimensional models in soil furman 2008 existing surface irrigation models such as srfr strelkoff et al 1998 surdev jurriëns et al 2001 sirmod walker 2003 zimod abbasi et al 2003 and winsrfr bautista and schlegel 2019 simulate only one dimensional surface flow and simplify the simulation of subsurface flow to a set of empirical equations which may make the results of optimizations uncertain in addition the required depth of irrigation which is a key input parameter in these models is simply passed to users to determine though this parameter is often difficult to establish with sufficient accuracy furthermore the effects of different irrigation practices on crop transpiration and yield and variations in such effects across fields are unknown finally while these models can help optimize irrigation in a single furrow border or basin they can only indicate how to irrigate not when to irrigate lacking unified two and three dimensional simulation models for surface irrigation a combined model approach using available one dimensional surface flow models with subsurface crop models offers an alternative approach for more reliable evaluation and optimization of surface irrigation contributing to accurate determination of both optimum irrigation schedules and required irrigation depths so far no research has combined use of a surface simulation flow model with a detailed crop model to optimize blocked end furrow irrigation practice the present study uses swap a one dimensional vertically oriented detailed crop model together with winsrfr a model that simulates one dimensional surface flow in order to simulate surface and subsurface water flow at the same time and answer both the questions of when and how best to irrigate swap soil water atmosphere and plant is a computer model that simulates transport of water and solutes in the vadose zone it can be used to calculate crop transpiration on the field scale based on meteorological conditions crop development stages soil moisture and salinity conditions van dam et al 2008 irrigation schedule can be reliably determined in swap as the model can take into account all relevant processes in the field to calculate evapotranspiration however the computer programs frequently used to obtain optimum irrigation schedules such as cropwat smith 1992 and criwar bos et al 1996 have limitations cropwat for example does not consider relevant field factors such as different water holding capacities of soil layers crop root distribution pattern groundwater fluctuations drainage conditions and the salinity of soil and irrigation water swap version 4 0 was chosen for the present study as our focus was on the field scale and the model is capable of calculating accurate irrigation schedules the model employs the richards equation including root water uptake to simulate soil moisture movement in variably saturated soil conditions and can consider almost all relevant field factors affecting evapotranspiration soil water movement and drainage kroes et al 2017 winsrfr is a one dimensional computer model for hydraulic analysis of surface irrigation systems winsrfr simulates the unsteady surface flow of water and estimates subsurface flow from soil infiltration equations bautista and schlegel 2019 for this study winsrfr version 5 1 was chosen for the surface flow simulation as this model offers different analysis worlds to evaluate and optimize irrigation practice has more advanced process description more functionalities and better users friendly graphical interface it also provides a new method evalue bautista and schlegel 2017 to estimate the soil infiltration function based on field data evalue produces more reliable results than other volume balance methods such as the two point method elliott and walker 1982 and the post irrigation volume balance method merriam and keller 1978 because surface and subsurface shape factors can be updated after each estimation of infiltration parameters and the volume balance can be recalculated many times to obtain the best fit with the field data the present study uses swap together with winsrfr to simulate surface and subsurface water flow at the same time the aim of the combined model approach is to optimize surface irrigation practice specifically in a blocked end furrow irrigation system for sugarcane cultivation in southwestern iran we set out to reliably determine the best irrigation schedule and the optimum stream sizes and cutoff times of irrigations to improve irrigation water use efficiency and answer the questions of when and how best to irrigate 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the present study considers first year ratoon sugarcane cultivation cultivar cp69 1062 at farm l7 5 of salman farsi sugarcane agro industry company in khuzestan province iran fig 1 sugarcane crops in the area are predominantly reliant on irrigation water the region is almost flat with an elevation of 4 7 m above sea level the salman farsi weather station is located 3 km from the study farm at latitude 30 59 n and longitude 48 28 e the farm used a blocked end furrow irrigation system 1000 240 m2 with a 1000 m gated pipe for water conveyance during usual irrigation operations the farm was divided into 12 subsections with each subsection irrigated for approximately 8 hrs a complete round was usually accomplished in 4 days irrigation was usually stopped around 2 hrs after the water front reached the downstream end of the furrow the irrigation water source was the karun river with river water supplied to the fields via a network of pump stations canals and pipes subsurface drainpipes were also installed at a depth of approximately 2 m primarily to leach away the extra salts accumulated in the crop root zone due to brackish irrigation water and capillary rise of saline groundwater these irrigation and drainage practices produced huge quantities of saline drainage water which ultimately reached large water bodies or evaporation pans near the persian gulf causing serious social and environmental problems over irrigation is common in the region resulting from lack of knowledge about physical processes of evapotranspiration and drainage poor supervision of irrigation practices and the belief that extra water will better leach salts away from the root zone thus increasing crop yields 2 2 the combined model approach this study tested the combined model approach to answer the questions of when and how best to irrigate sugarcane using a blocked end furrow system swap was used to determine the irrigation schedule and required depth of irrigation in addition swap was used to estimate crop transpiration along furrows irrigation depths used in swap to estimate transpiration along the furrows were obtained from infiltration depths simulated in winsrfr winsrfr was used for three purposes first the event analysis world of winsrfr was used to estimate the soil infiltration function based on field data from a water advance experiment second the simulation world of winsrfr was used to evaluate current and optimized irrigation practices third the operations analysis world of winsrfr was used to optimize stream sizes and cutoff times for furrow irrigation applications for evaluation and optimization of irrigation applications in winsrfr the required depth of irrigation and soil infiltration function were used as input data all input data for the model calibrations and simulations were collected in the field or obtained from the literature fig 2 presents the modeling procedure for optimization of furrow irrigation 2 3 swap model 2 3 1 ideal irrigation scheduling one interesting feature of swap is the option of calculating an irrigation schedule this is achieved by selecting one of the available six irrigation time criteria to trigger irrigations we selected the transpiration ratio of actual to potential transpiration t act t pot among other irrigation time criteria such as depletion of a certain fraction of available water in the root zone because this criterion allows the user to indicate a specific plant stress level considering the effects of salts and different root capacities to uptake water on transpiration the transpiration ratio of 0 85 was found to be the optimum value for maximizing actual transpiration as well as making irrigation intervals more realistic during irrigation calculations in swap when this ratio fell to 0 85 irrigation was triggered to increase soil moisture to field capacity fc since swap is a vertically oriented model it only prescribes irrigation depths to meet the soil water deficit in the root zone therefore the application efficiency of the prescribed irrigation applications is 100 and the resulting irrigation schedule is ideal the leaching requirement is not explicitly calculated in swap prescribed irrigation schedules rather the model uses an overirrigation depth as defined by the user to generate extra leaching to leach salts away from the root zone during each irrigation application and keep soil salinity within an acceptable range we calculated the leaching requirement using the equation proposed by ayers and westcott 1985 as follows 1 lr lf d ir lf ec iw 5 ec e ec iw where lr mm is the leaching requirement lf is the leaching fraction d ir mm is the irrigation depth ec iw ds m is the electrical conductivity of irrigation water and ec e ds m is the desired salinity of the saturated paste extract of soil the electrical conductivities of irrigation water ec iw were measured in the field during the irrigation period and the irrigation depth d ir was assumed as the average irrigation depth prescribed in swap in the ideal irrigation schedule without applying leaching depth 2 3 2 weather and crop data for weather and crop data we input into swap daily meteorological data from the salman farsi weather station and ratoon sugarcane crop data from the study area in 2020 fig 3a and b to simulate evapotranspiration for the sugarcane crop we used the penman monteith equation with appropriate weather data and crop factors the daily weather data included maximum and minimum temperatures air humidity short wave solar radiation precipitation and wind speed at 2 m height rainfall interception was simulated using the formula of von hoyningen hüne 1983 and braden 1985 based on daily precipitation values and canopy interception the crop factors k c were derived from a five year study by sheini dashtegol 2019 on the sugarcane cultivar cp69 1062 in khuzestan province while some global studies have evaluated the depth and distribution pattern of sugarcane roots few local studies exist on sugarcane root systems in the study area in ratoon cultivation the root system of a sugarcane crop remains active for several months after harvest eventually developing new plant shoots glover 1968 we therefore assumed a constant root depth of 100 cm corresponding to the subsoil depth of 90 cm observed in land preparation operations in addition we assumed a sugarcane root distribution pattern in conformance with the cumulative root fraction y and root depth d cm proposed by gale and grigal 1987 with the extinction coefficient of root distribution β equal to 0 96 fig 3c 2 y 1 0 96 d waterlogging and drought stress were simulated as a function of a reduction coefficient of the potential transpiration α rw according to feddes et al 1978 during root water uptake in high and low transpiration fig 3d additionally the reduction function of maas and hoffman 1977 was employed to calculate the reduction in root water uptake due to salinity with ec max and ec slope of the sugarcane crop respectively 1 7 ds m and 0 059 m ds maas 1990 the relative crop yield y act y pot was determined based on the relative transpiration for the entire crop growth period moene and dam 2014 as follows 3 y act y pot t act t pot where y act is actual yield y pot is potential yield t act is actual transpiration and t pot is potential transpiration 2 3 3 soil and drainage data to describe the hydraulic characteristics of the soil layers and simulate water movement swap uses the soil hydraulic functions of mualem 1976 and van genuchten 1980 as follows 4 θ θ re s θ sat θ res 1 α h n m 5 m 1 1 n 6 k k sat s e λ 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 7 s e θ θ res θ sat θ res where θ is volumetric water content cm3 cm3 θ res is the residual water content cm3 cm3 θ sat is the saturated water content cm3 cm3 h is soil water pressure head cm α 1 cm n and m are empirical shape factors k is hydraulic conductivity cm d k sat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d λ is a shape parameter and s e is the relative degree of saturation to determine mualem van genuchten parameters we first measured the percentages of soil layer particles in a soil layering experiment in which field samples were obtained using an auger to the depth of the impermeable layer next we estimated soil textures and bulk densities using the soil water characteristics program saxton 1985 based on the percentages of sand and clay and assuming 15 soil compaction to match the local bulk density data finally the mualem van genuchten parameters of soil hydraulic functions were determined using the rosetta lite program schaap et al 2001 according to the percentages of sand silt and clay and soil bulk densities additionally we measured the characteristics of subsurface drains and drainage conditions in the field the depth and distances of subsurface drains were determined from a field survey to measure the hydraulic conductivities of the soil layers above and below drain level we used the auger hole method van beers 1970 in swap all drainage fluxes were calculated with lateral drainage in a free drainage condition therefore we defined no water fluxes at the bottom boundary of the soil profile the initial soil moisture was estimated assuming hydrostatic equilibrium with the initial groundwater level at 2 m depth equal to drain level salt transport was assumed to be only convective fluxes in the simulations the initial salt concentrations were measured in the field based on soil or groundwater samplings 2 3 4 calibration and validation of the swap model water table depth was measured in the field to calibrate the swap model and verify the results six observation wells were installed midway between drains with a depth of 2 2 m and at distances 125 250 and 375 m from the upstream end of farm daily water table fluctuations in the observation wells were recorded from march to october 2020 water table depths measured from march to july were used for swap calibration while the data set from august to october was used for model validation the measured hydraulic conductivities of the soil layers above and below drain level were used as the initial values for swap model calibration and adjusted in a trial and error process until the simulated water table depths matched the measured values three statistical parameters were used to evaluate the calibration and validate performance namely mean absolute error mae eq 8 the root mean squared error rmse eq 9 and the coefficient of residual mass crm eq 10 8 mae 1 n i 1 n p i o i 9 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 10 crm i 1 n o i i 1 n p i i

with outcomes closer to 0 indicating better agreement between observed and simulated values crm indicates a model s tendency to overestimate crm 0 or underestimate crm 0 a parameter 2 4 winsrfr model to evaluate irrigation performance we used the simulation world of winsrfr for a current irrigation application with a cutoff time of 8 hrs we used real furrow slopes to estimate the infiltration function and evaluate current irrigation performance however we assumed furrow slope to be uniform in the optimized irrigation system and the minimum infiltration depth along the furrow was taken to be equal to the required depth the required depth of 75 mm was selected to evaluate and optimize irrigation practice 2 4 1 calibration of the winsrfr model infiltration function to use winsrfr to evaluate or optimize current surface irrigation practice the model must first be calibrated with field data calibration in winsrfr is achieved when the simulated infiltration function matches the soil infiltration function from the field data in the present study the modified kostiakov formula was chosen to estimate the soil infiltration function as follows 11 z k t a bt c where z mm is the cumulative infiltration depth k mm hr a and a are empirical fitting parameters b mm hr is the basic infiltration rate t hr is time of infiltration and c mm is the initial rapid infiltration into cracks the infiltration parameters k a b and c in the modified kostiakov formula were estimated in evalue based on the water front advance time observed in the field the infiltration parameters were manually adjusted such that the simulated infiltration volumes graphically and statistically matched the observed infiltration volumes to make our determination of the modified kostiakov parameters more reliable the basic infiltration rate b was measured in the field and the term c was assumed to be negligible compared to the other parameters the soil was assumed to be homogeneous along the entire furrow length and manning s roughness coefficient of the furrow surface was assumed to be 0 04 as recommended by usda 1974 2 4 1 1 field data measurement a data collection plan was performed in the field to obtain the measurement data needed for the winsrfr calibration and evaluation of current irrigation practice in total seven representative adjacent furrows were selected on the study farm in these furrows lengths were marked with five wooden posts at distances of 0 60 120 180 and 240 m from the furrow upstream end fig 4a to ensure that each furrow received separate discharge from the gated pipe the furrow ridges were reformed and heightened at the upstream end the water front advance time to the wooden posts was recorded during the irrigation event on june 26 2020 the previous irrigation event was seven days earlier the inflow discharge to the furrows was measured using a scaled bucket and stopwatch fig 4b and the experiment was terminated after 8 hrs the basic infiltration rate of soil b was determined a day before the water front advance experiment using double ring infiltrometers fig 4a and c the infiltrometers were installed on the bed of the central furrow f m in fig 4a at distances of 60 120 and 180 m from the upstream furrow end an average cross sectional geometry of furrows was obtained by measurements in selected furrows and the longitudinal slopes of the furrows were surveyed along the furrows at 20 m intervals 2 4 2 performance indicators performance of the irrigation applications was evaluated in the simulation world of winsrfr by the following indicators 12 application efficiency ae d rz d app 100 13 distribution uniformity du min d min d app 14 low quarter adequacy ad lq d lq d req 15 deep percolation dp d dp d app 100 16 cutoff ratio xr t

2 4 3 optimization of furrow irrigation stream size and cutoff times for furrow irrigation were optimized using the operations analysis world in winsrfr optimization was performed for uniform slopes in the range typically found in the study area i e 0 02 0 12 input data were the required irrigation depth geometry of the furrow length shape slope the soil infiltration function and the optimization ranges of stream size 1 0 4 0 l s and cutoff time 0 20 hrs the output was curves of optimized stream sizes and cutoff times for application uniformity distribution uniformity and deep percolation when the minimum irrigation depth was equal to the required irrigation depth of 75 mm the stream size and the cutoff time that maximized the application efficiency and distribution uniformity were selected as optimized irrigation practice 3 results 3 1 properties of the soil and drainage table 1 presents the mualem and van genuchten parameters as determined for the measured soil layers subsurface drains were at a depth of 2 m and 60 m distance in the field the hydraulic conductivities of the soil layers were measured at approximately 1 87 m day above the drain level and approximately 3 39 m day below the drain level the initial soil salinity was 2 4 ds m on average from the soil surface to the drain level soil salinity then increased linearly to 14 ds m below the groundwater level to the depth of the impermeable layer approx 4 m 3 2 calibration and validation of swap results of the swap model simulating water table depth during the validation period correlated very well with the average of observed values the best correlation was found when the hydraulic conductivity of the soil above and below the drain level were adjusted to 1 5 and 4 0 m day respectively fig 5a this is statistically proven by the small mae of 6 12 cm and rmse of 7 98 cm table 2 results of swap model performance in predicting water table depth during the validation period also showed good agreement between the observed and simulated values with the small mae of 10 42 cm and rmse of 24 41 cm fig 5b the negative crm values being 0 88 and 1 11 respectively during calibration and validation showed a small tendency of swap model to overestimate water table depths 3 3 ideal irrigation schedule irrigation at farm l7 5 started in early march and ended in early october 2020 table 3 during this seven month period 26 irrigation applications were recorded with the minimum irrigation interval being five days in june and july the applied depth of irrigation was estimated at 162 mm based on the field experiment measurements with the cutoff time of 8 hrs the ideal irrigation schedule was simulated in swap without applying leaching requirements for the same irrigation period as observed in the field while also considering local experiences in sugarcane cultivation in khuzestan province which suggest the need for irrigation intervals to be seven days or less in june and july to protect crops from scorching summer winds the leaching fraction lf was obtained as 0 33 from eq 1 for the average irrigation water salinity of 2 1 ds m and the threshold of the saturated paste extract of 1 7 for no sugarcane yield reduction maas 1990 the leaching requirement lr then was calculated as 18 mm for the average prescribed irrigation depth of 54 mm finally the ideal irrigation schedule was determined by adding the leaching requirement depth to prescribed irrigation depths table 3 swap calculated 19 irrigation applications with an average and maximum required depth of 72 mm and 76 mm respectively the required depth of 75 mm was selected for evaluation and optimization of irrigation practice 3 4 properties of the furrow irrigation system the basic infiltration rate of soil was measured in infiltrometers as 3 mm hr on average after about six hours table 4 in addition furrow depth was 10 15 cm with a bottom width of approximately 90 cm and a top width of approximately 110 cm fig 6a the stable cross sectional geometry of the furrows was defined in winsrfr as a power law function with the top width of flow tw being a function of the furrow water depth y 17 tw 569 4 y 0 1329 furthermore furrow slope was measured as 0 3 on average in the first 40 m and 0 05 on average for the rest of the furrow lengths fig 6b 3 5 estimation of the soil infiltration function the parameters k and a of the modified kostiakov formula were estimated for all lengths of furrows f 1 f 2 f 3 and f m while the estimation was done only for the first 180 m of the furrow length in f 3 f 2 and f 1 table 5 shortly after completion of the water advance phase in f 1 f 2 f 3 and f m water overflowed from the downstream end of these furrows to f 1 f 2 and f 3 one after another as a result an inverse water front advance proceeded from the downstream end to the upstream end of the latter furrows disrupting the advance phase to the 240 m wooden post surprisingly the water fronts from the upstream and downstream ends of f 2 and f 3 reached the 180 m wooden post at almost the same time the advance phase was completed at around 5 6 hrs for all of the test furrows and the experiment ended at 8 hrs the infiltration function of the modified kostiakov formula was estimated in two categories for the test furrows a higher infiltration function was estimated for furrows f 3 f 2 and f 1 corresponding to natural resources conservation service nrcs intake soil family 0 5 0 7 and a silty loam soil type fig 7 however a lower infiltration function was estimated for f 1 f 2 f 3 and f m corresponding to nrcs intake family 0 2 0 35 and a clay loam soil type since the topsoil 0 40 cm was measured as clay loam in the field we derived the modified kostiakov equation only from the average infiltration parameters of furrows with lower infiltration rates as follows 18 z 50 6t 0 194 3t 3 6 evaluation of current irrigation practice to evaluate the performance of current irrigation practice we used the test furrows in which the advance phase reached the end of the furrow intact water was found to have infiltrated much deeper 162 mm here than the required depth 75 mm fig 8 and table 6 even at one quarter length of the furrows with lower infiltration depth 1 8 times more water on average was received than needed the efficiency of current irrigation practice was 47 on average meaning that more than half of the irrigation water was lost by deep percolation the crop transpiration simulation in swap however showed a marked difference in yield values along the furrow lengths table 7 in f 2 and f 3 for example yield at the downstream end of the furrow was 30 lower than at the upstream end 3 7 optimization of current irrigation practice the curves of optimized stream sizes and cutoff times for three performance indicators were obtained in winsrfr for uniform slopes of 0 02 0 12 fig 9 the results indicate that current blocked end furrow irrigation practice is optimized by larger stream size and shorter cutoff times for milder furrow slopes and smaller stream size and longer cutoff times for steeper slopes for example a stream size of around 3 0 l s and a cutoff time of 3 2 hrs was found to be suitable for a slope of 0 02 while a 1 6 l s stream size and 6 5 hrs cutoff time was more optimum for a slope of 0 12 moreover in furrows with slopes less than 0 05 the minimum and maximum infiltration depth occurred respectively at the downstream end and the upstream end fig 10 however in furrows with slopes greater than 0 05 the maximum infiltration depth occurred at the downstream end with the position of minimum infiltration depth shifting gradually from 0 5 l to 0 75 l as slope increased from 0 05 to 0 12 with milder slopes the advance and recession phases were found to be completed sooner with higher application efficiency and distribution uniformity table 8 application efficiencies in the optimized irrigation practice were found to be 95 and 88 for slopes of 0 02 and 0 12 respectively and irrigation application should be stopped the same time and around 25 min after completion of the advance phase respectively the swap crop growth simulation showed no significant difference in yield along the furrows under optimized irrigation practice table 9 4 discussion three furrows f 3 f 2 and f 1 were omitted from the infiltration estimations using the modified kostiakov equation and from the evaluation of current irrigation practice due to a too long advance phase and irrigation water overflow the higher infiltration rate simulated for these furrows compared to the expected rate can be explained by water overflow during the advance phase in the first 180 m of the furrow lengths considering the uneven bed elevation along these furrows fig 6 it is highly likely that during the advance phase the water depth in some regions exceeded the furrow ridges and a fraction of stream size overflowed out of the furrows since winsrfr does not consider overflow in simulations the model estimated higher infiltration rates to compensate for the longer measured advance times a longer advance phase was found especially for furrows f 3 and f 2 indicating that application efficiency and distribution uniformity in the field could be lower than the results found in the present study also it should be noted that seepage from the gated pipe which affects water conveyance efficiency to furrows is not considered in application efficiencies markedly different advance phases observed between furrows in this study points to the need for proper land levelling and frequent maintenance of furrow shapes to achieve high irrigation efficiencies and distribution uniformities in furrow irrigation systems supervision and maintenance of furrow ridges during irrigation applications and ensuring that furrows receive the same individual stream size are crucial to avoid overflow and achieve uniform advance phases across furrows however changes in furrow shape bed elevation and infiltration rate are usually inevitable during cultivation especially in mechanized agriculture as a result some furrows may have a longer advance phase our field observations of the water front during the advance phase suggest that connecting the downstream end of irrigation furrows to a ditch might promote greater irrigation efficiency in mildly sloping furrows this strategy especially in furrows with uneven beds and overflow problems would help the advance phase to complete sooner thus increasing application efficiency and distribution uniformity in practice in the field the irrigation schedule currently practiced in the study area having 26 applications and a combined water depth of 4212 mm was optimized in swap to an ideal irrigation schedule having 19 applications and a combined water depth of 1362 mm see table 3 in other words according to the swap simulations the current irrigation frequencies were 37 more than needed mostly because irrigation began two months earlier and the quantity of water applied was 3 1 times greater than needed however to be realistically applicable in the field surface irrigation application efficiencies need to be considered in the swap prescribed ideal irrigation schedule the optimized stream sizes and cutoff times for furrow irrigation in winsrfr indicate that the applied water depth in current irrigation practice 162 mm could be reduced to 81 mm for a slope of 0 06 under field conditions table 8 therefore the water applied in the current schedule was actually 2 7 times greater than what a realistic water application would be 1539 mm and thus can be decreased by 63 we found that application efficiency for a particular slope was especially affected by the combination of stream size and cutoff time while distribution uniformity was more affected by the uniformity of the slope and the presence of rises and depressions in bed elevation along the length of the furrows considering the 0 06 overall average slope of the tested furrows the current practice application efficiency 47 was found to be much lower than optimized practice 92 mostly because the cutoff time was 78 greater than optimized practice the lower distribution uniformity found for current irrigation practice especially in f 2 and f 3 0 61 and 0 58 respectively compared to optimized practice 0 93 was due mainly to a steeper furrow slope 0 3 in the first 40 m compared to the rest of the furrows 0 05 and accumulation of extra water in the downstream region of the furrows this lower distribution uniformity resulted in 30 lower yield at the downstream end of the furrows compared to the upstream end regarding yield the swap simulations suggest that an optimized irrigation schedule could increase actual yield by 22 compared to the current schedule fig 11 our results furthermore indicate that the lower actual yield observed under current practice was due mainly to a 2 7 times greater waterlogging stress on crops during irrigation applications while the water depths prescribed in the ideal schedule would sufficiently leach salts away from the root zone application of greater irrigation depths would not further decrease salt stress significantly though it would increase waterlogging and may therefore diminish yield these results reveal the fallacy of the common conception in the study area that overirrigation will better leach salts away from the root zone and lead to higher sugarcane yield swap however is likely to simulate slightly lower yields than those which might be observed in the field under actual conditions of a furrow irrigation system this is because swap is a one dimensional model which assumes irrigation applications in a flat basin however in furrow irrigation systems only part of the soil becomes fully saturated thus only part of the crop roots may be affected by waterlogging therefore no yield reduction or lesser yield reductions than predicted by the swap simulations can be expected under real furrow irrigation field conditions the suggested optimized stream sizes in this study for furrow slopes of 0 02 0 12 correspond to the maximum non erosive stream size of 3 l s recommended by fao for furrow slopes of 0 1 or less fao 2021 the results of the present study differ from those of mazarei et al 2020 who used winsrfr to optimize sugarcane irrigation practice for a blocked end furrow irrigation system in the same study area with the same soil type clay loam and the same furrow shape they recommended the optimal stream size of 3 l s and a cutoff time of 6 3 hrs for a furrow length of 200 m and slope of 0 05 their recommended optimal irrigation practice had an application efficiency of 78 and irrigation depth of 186 mm however our results suggest the lower optimal stream size and cutoff time of 2 2 l s and 4 5 hrs respectively for the same slope and a longer furrow length of 240 m we would suggest that their overestimation of required depth 100 mm as the key input parameter to winsrfr resulted in an overestimation of stream size and cutoff time in their optimization 5 conclusions the present study adopts two one dimensional simulation models winsrfr and swap in an effort to optimize surface irrigation practice and overcome some limitations of the simulation models currently used for surface irrigation optimization the results of this study demonstrate the value of combining a surface flow simulation model and a subsurface crop model to derive an optimized irrigation schedule and optimized irrigation applications the optimized irrigation schedule suggests that the number of irrigation applications and the volume of applied water in current practice can be reduced by 27 and 63 respectively our results also indicate that the optimized irrigation schedule can efficiently leach salts away from the root zone furthermore the crop growth simulation in swap indicates that the optimized irrigation schedule could produce a sugarcane yield 22 higher than current practice with no significant variation in yield along the furrows we attribute the lower yields obtained under current practice to high waterlogging stress due to overirrigation our optimization of blocked end furrow irrigation in winsrfr for the required depth of 75 mm suggests that the stream size and cutoff time of 2 5 l s and 8 hrs in current practice should be reduced to 2 2 l s and 4 5 hrs respectively application efficiency and distribution uniformity would then increase from 47 and 0 68 92 and 0 93 respectively our results also indicate that as furrow slope increases from 0 02 0 12 optimized stream size decreases from 3 0 to 1 6 l s while cutoff times increase from 3 2 to 6 5 hrs our study points to the importance of land levelling and furrow shapes to achieve high irrigation efficiency and distribution uniformity to compensate for the inevitably poor land leveling and furrow maintenance we recommend connecting the downstream end of furrows to a ditch further study is needed to better determine crop root properties and the soil infiltration function as these are key factors affecting irrigation schedule and application the root depth and distribution pattern and soil water pressure heads during water uptake by crop roots particularly merit closer investigation determination of the soil infiltration function however is perhaps still the most challenging step in surface irrigation optimization future studies could therefore focus on spatial and temporal changes in soil infiltration

9368,surface irrigation worldwide exhibits low efficiency due to excessively deep percolation and runoff to optimize surface irrigation practice two questions must be answered simultaneously when to irrigate and how to irrigate what stream size to use and for how long to meet crop water requirements current surface irrigation optimization models are one dimensional meaning they can only simulate surface water flow neglecting subsurface flow they therefore indicate only how to irrigate not when to irrigate furthermore the required depth of irrigation is needed as input data for optimization though this parameter is difficult to establish accurately in addition the effects of different irrigation practices on crop transpiration and yield and variations in these across an irrigated field are unknown the present study adopts two one dimensional simulation models winsrfr for surface flow and swap for subsurface flow to determine when and how best to irrigate in a blocked end furrow irrigation system for sugarcane cultivation in southwestern iran swap is used to determine irrigation schedule required irrigation depth and crop transpiration along furrows while winsrfr is used to determine the soil infiltration function and evaluate and optimize irrigation practice the results of the combined model approach indicate that some 2 7 times more water is applied than required in current practice imposing high waterlogging stress on sugarcane crops according to the swap simulations the required irrigation depth is some 75 mm and the number of irrigation applications can be reduced from 26 to 19 the irrigation optimization in winsrfr indicates that irrigation depth can be reduced from 162 mm to 81 mm resulting in application efficiency increasing from 47 to 92 furthermore as furrow slope increases from 0 02 to 0 12 optimized stream size decreases from 3 0 to 1 6 l s and optimized irrigation cutoff times increase from 3 2 to 6 5 hrs overall optimization of irrigation practice using the combined model approach could result in 63 water conservation and 22 higher sugarcane yield keywords application efficiency blocked end furrow soil infiltration stream size cutoff time sugarcane 1 introduction surface irrigation is the most commonly used irrigation method throughout the world due largely to its applicability and low cost in khuzestan province southwestern iran blocked end furrow irrigation is used to irrigate more than 100 000 ha of sugarcane fields irrigation of sugarcane crops in this arid region relies almost entirely on water from the karun river in the spring and summer seasons however this period of high sugarcane water demand coincides with decreased river discharge in the context of climate change this has led to serious conflicts over river water allocations overirrigation of sugarcane in khuzestan province has resulted in low irrigation efficiency and excessively deep percolation akram et al 2013 estimated the overall irrigation efficiency of three sugarcane units of southern khuzestan to be around 41 abbasi and sheini dashtegol 2017 found the irrigation efficiency of four sugarcane units in khuzestan province to be 42 5 on average in blocked end furrow irrigation systems water loss occurs in the form of deep percolation in sugarcane production excessively deep percolation not only wastes water but also leaches nitrate and other agrochemicals into groundwater or drainage water causing environmental problems optimized irrigation management can increase both water use efficiency and crop production in sugarcane cultivation to optimize surface irrigation practice two main questions must be answered simultaneously when to irrigate and how to irrigate in other words for surface irrigation optimization we need to know what is an optimum irrigation schedule irrigation dates and required irrigation depths to meet crop water requirements and what are optimum stream sizes and cutoff times to provide the required irrigation depths in the field the surface irrigation simulation models currently used cannot simultaneously answer the questions of when and how to irrigate limitations and uncertainties also remain regarding the credibility of their results although surface and subsurface water flows are inherently connected surface irrigation simulation models are one dimensional meaning they can only simulate surface water flow neglecting subsurface flow major issues both logical e g time scales and technical e g analytical and computational solvability have limited ability to implement coupled simulations of surface and subsurface flows in two and three dimensional models in soil furman 2008 existing surface irrigation models such as srfr strelkoff et al 1998 surdev jurriëns et al 2001 sirmod walker 2003 zimod abbasi et al 2003 and winsrfr bautista and schlegel 2019 simulate only one dimensional surface flow and simplify the simulation of subsurface flow to a set of empirical equations which may make the results of optimizations uncertain in addition the required depth of irrigation which is a key input parameter in these models is simply passed to users to determine though this parameter is often difficult to establish with sufficient accuracy furthermore the effects of different irrigation practices on crop transpiration and yield and variations in such effects across fields are unknown finally while these models can help optimize irrigation in a single furrow border or basin they can only indicate how to irrigate not when to irrigate lacking unified two and three dimensional simulation models for surface irrigation a combined model approach using available one dimensional surface flow models with subsurface crop models offers an alternative approach for more reliable evaluation and optimization of surface irrigation contributing to accurate determination of both optimum irrigation schedules and required irrigation depths so far no research has combined use of a surface simulation flow model with a detailed crop model to optimize blocked end furrow irrigation practice the present study uses swap a one dimensional vertically oriented detailed crop model together with winsrfr a model that simulates one dimensional surface flow in order to simulate surface and subsurface water flow at the same time and answer both the questions of when and how best to irrigate swap soil water atmosphere and plant is a computer model that simulates transport of water and solutes in the vadose zone it can be used to calculate crop transpiration on the field scale based on meteorological conditions crop development stages soil moisture and salinity conditions van dam et al 2008 irrigation schedule can be reliably determined in swap as the model can take into account all relevant processes in the field to calculate evapotranspiration however the computer programs frequently used to obtain optimum irrigation schedules such as cropwat smith 1992 and criwar bos et al 1996 have limitations cropwat for example does not consider relevant field factors such as different water holding capacities of soil layers crop root distribution pattern groundwater fluctuations drainage conditions and the salinity of soil and irrigation water swap version 4 0 was chosen for the present study as our focus was on the field scale and the model is capable of calculating accurate irrigation schedules the model employs the richards equation including root water uptake to simulate soil moisture movement in variably saturated soil conditions and can consider almost all relevant field factors affecting evapotranspiration soil water movement and drainage kroes et al 2017 winsrfr is a one dimensional computer model for hydraulic analysis of surface irrigation systems winsrfr simulates the unsteady surface flow of water and estimates subsurface flow from soil infiltration equations bautista and schlegel 2019 for this study winsrfr version 5 1 was chosen for the surface flow simulation as this model offers different analysis worlds to evaluate and optimize irrigation practice has more advanced process description more functionalities and better users friendly graphical interface it also provides a new method evalue bautista and schlegel 2017 to estimate the soil infiltration function based on field data evalue produces more reliable results than other volume balance methods such as the two point method elliott and walker 1982 and the post irrigation volume balance method merriam and keller 1978 because surface and subsurface shape factors can be updated after each estimation of infiltration parameters and the volume balance can be recalculated many times to obtain the best fit with the field data the present study uses swap together with winsrfr to simulate surface and subsurface water flow at the same time the aim of the combined model approach is to optimize surface irrigation practice specifically in a blocked end furrow irrigation system for sugarcane cultivation in southwestern iran we set out to reliably determine the best irrigation schedule and the optimum stream sizes and cutoff times of irrigations to improve irrigation water use efficiency and answer the questions of when and how best to irrigate 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the present study considers first year ratoon sugarcane cultivation cultivar cp69 1062 at farm l7 5 of salman farsi sugarcane agro industry company in khuzestan province iran fig 1 sugarcane crops in the area are predominantly reliant on irrigation water the region is almost flat with an elevation of 4 7 m above sea level the salman farsi weather station is located 3 km from the study farm at latitude 30 59 n and longitude 48 28 e the farm used a blocked end furrow irrigation system 1000 240 m2 with a 1000 m gated pipe for water conveyance during usual irrigation operations the farm was divided into 12 subsections with each subsection irrigated for approximately 8 hrs a complete round was usually accomplished in 4 days irrigation was usually stopped around 2 hrs after the water front reached the downstream end of the furrow the irrigation water source was the karun river with river water supplied to the fields via a network of pump stations canals and pipes subsurface drainpipes were also installed at a depth of approximately 2 m primarily to leach away the extra salts accumulated in the crop root zone due to brackish irrigation water and capillary rise of saline groundwater these irrigation and drainage practices produced huge quantities of saline drainage water which ultimately reached large water bodies or evaporation pans near the persian gulf causing serious social and environmental problems over irrigation is common in the region resulting from lack of knowledge about physical processes of evapotranspiration and drainage poor supervision of irrigation practices and the belief that extra water will better leach salts away from the root zone thus increasing crop yields 2 2 the combined model approach this study tested the combined model approach to answer the questions of when and how best to irrigate sugarcane using a blocked end furrow system swap was used to determine the irrigation schedule and required depth of irrigation in addition swap was used to estimate crop transpiration along furrows irrigation depths used in swap to estimate transpiration along the furrows were obtained from infiltration depths simulated in winsrfr winsrfr was used for three purposes first the event analysis world of winsrfr was used to estimate the soil infiltration function based on field data from a water advance experiment second the simulation world of winsrfr was used to evaluate current and optimized irrigation practices third the operations analysis world of winsrfr was used to optimize stream sizes and cutoff times for furrow irrigation applications for evaluation and optimization of irrigation applications in winsrfr the required depth of irrigation and soil infiltration function were used as input data all input data for the model calibrations and simulations were collected in the field or obtained from the literature fig 2 presents the modeling procedure for optimization of furrow irrigation 2 3 swap model 2 3 1 ideal irrigation scheduling one interesting feature of swap is the option of calculating an irrigation schedule this is achieved by selecting one of the available six irrigation time criteria to trigger irrigations we selected the transpiration ratio of actual to potential transpiration t act t pot among other irrigation time criteria such as depletion of a certain fraction of available water in the root zone because this criterion allows the user to indicate a specific plant stress level considering the effects of salts and different root capacities to uptake water on transpiration the transpiration ratio of 0 85 was found to be the optimum value for maximizing actual transpiration as well as making irrigation intervals more realistic during irrigation calculations in swap when this ratio fell to 0 85 irrigation was triggered to increase soil moisture to field capacity fc since swap is a vertically oriented model it only prescribes irrigation depths to meet the soil water deficit in the root zone therefore the application efficiency of the prescribed irrigation applications is 100 and the resulting irrigation schedule is ideal the leaching requirement is not explicitly calculated in swap prescribed irrigation schedules rather the model uses an overirrigation depth as defined by the user to generate extra leaching to leach salts away from the root zone during each irrigation application and keep soil salinity within an acceptable range we calculated the leaching requirement using the equation proposed by ayers and westcott 1985 as follows 1 lr lf d ir lf ec iw 5 ec e ec iw where lr mm is the leaching requirement lf is the leaching fraction d ir mm is the irrigation depth ec iw ds m is the electrical conductivity of irrigation water and ec e ds m is the desired salinity of the saturated paste extract of soil the electrical conductivities of irrigation water ec iw were measured in the field during the irrigation period and the irrigation depth d ir was assumed as the average irrigation depth prescribed in swap in the ideal irrigation schedule without applying leaching depth 2 3 2 weather and crop data for weather and crop data we input into swap daily meteorological data from the salman farsi weather station and ratoon sugarcane crop data from the study area in 2020 fig 3a and b to simulate evapotranspiration for the sugarcane crop we used the penman monteith equation with appropriate weather data and crop factors the daily weather data included maximum and minimum temperatures air humidity short wave solar radiation precipitation and wind speed at 2 m height rainfall interception was simulated using the formula of von hoyningen hüne 1983 and braden 1985 based on daily precipitation values and canopy interception the crop factors k c were derived from a five year study by sheini dashtegol 2019 on the sugarcane cultivar cp69 1062 in khuzestan province while some global studies have evaluated the depth and distribution pattern of sugarcane roots few local studies exist on sugarcane root systems in the study area in ratoon cultivation the root system of a sugarcane crop remains active for several months after harvest eventually developing new plant shoots glover 1968 we therefore assumed a constant root depth of 100 cm corresponding to the subsoil depth of 90 cm observed in land preparation operations in addition we assumed a sugarcane root distribution pattern in conformance with the cumulative root fraction y and root depth d cm proposed by gale and grigal 1987 with the extinction coefficient of root distribution β equal to 0 96 fig 3c 2 y 1 0 96 d waterlogging and drought stress were simulated as a function of a reduction coefficient of the potential transpiration α rw according to feddes et al 1978 during root water uptake in high and low transpiration fig 3d additionally the reduction function of maas and hoffman 1977 was employed to calculate the reduction in root water uptake due to salinity with ec max and ec slope of the sugarcane crop respectively 1 7 ds m and 0 059 m ds maas 1990 the relative crop yield y act y pot was determined based on the relative transpiration for the entire crop growth period moene and dam 2014 as follows 3 y act y pot t act t pot where y act is actual yield y pot is potential yield t act is actual transpiration and t pot is potential transpiration 2 3 3 soil and drainage data to describe the hydraulic characteristics of the soil layers and simulate water movement swap uses the soil hydraulic functions of mualem 1976 and van genuchten 1980 as follows 4 θ θ re s θ sat θ res 1 α h n m 5 m 1 1 n 6 k k sat s e λ 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 7 s e θ θ res θ sat θ res where θ is volumetric water content cm3 cm3 θ res is the residual water content cm3 cm3 θ sat is the saturated water content cm3 cm3 h is soil water pressure head cm α 1 cm n and m are empirical shape factors k is hydraulic conductivity cm d k sat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d λ is a shape parameter and s e is the relative degree of saturation to determine mualem van genuchten parameters we first measured the percentages of soil layer particles in a soil layering experiment in which field samples were obtained using an auger to the depth of the impermeable layer next we estimated soil textures and bulk densities using the soil water characteristics program saxton 1985 based on the percentages of sand and clay and assuming 15 soil compaction to match the local bulk density data finally the mualem van genuchten parameters of soil hydraulic functions were determined using the rosetta lite program schaap et al 2001 according to the percentages of sand silt and clay and soil bulk densities additionally we measured the characteristics of subsurface drains and drainage conditions in the field the depth and distances of subsurface drains were determined from a field survey to measure the hydraulic conductivities of the soil layers above and below drain level we used the auger hole method van beers 1970 in swap all drainage fluxes were calculated with lateral drainage in a free drainage condition therefore we defined no water fluxes at the bottom boundary of the soil profile the initial soil moisture was estimated assuming hydrostatic equilibrium with the initial groundwater level at 2 m depth equal to drain level salt transport was assumed to be only convective fluxes in the simulations the initial salt concentrations were measured in the field based on soil or groundwater samplings 2 3 4 calibration and validation of the swap model water table depth was measured in the field to calibrate the swap model and verify the results six observation wells were installed midway between drains with a depth of 2 2 m and at distances 125 250 and 375 m from the upstream end of farm daily water table fluctuations in the observation wells were recorded from march to october 2020 water table depths measured from march to july were used for swap calibration while the data set from august to october was used for model validation the measured hydraulic conductivities of the soil layers above and below drain level were used as the initial values for swap model calibration and adjusted in a trial and error process until the simulated water table depths matched the measured values three statistical parameters were used to evaluate the calibration and validate performance namely mean absolute error mae eq 8 the root mean squared error rmse eq 9 and the coefficient of residual mass crm eq 10 8 mae 1 n i 1 n p i o i 9 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 10 crm i 1 n o i i 1 n p i i

with outcomes closer to 0 indicating better agreement between observed and simulated values crm indicates a model s tendency to overestimate crm 0 or underestimate crm 0 a parameter 2 4 winsrfr model to evaluate irrigation performance we used the simulation world of winsrfr for a current irrigation application with a cutoff time of 8 hrs we used real furrow slopes to estimate the infiltration function and evaluate current irrigation performance however we assumed furrow slope to be uniform in the optimized irrigation system and the minimum infiltration depth along the furrow was taken to be equal to the required depth the required depth of 75 mm was selected to evaluate and optimize irrigation practice 2 4 1 calibration of the winsrfr model infiltration function to use winsrfr to evaluate or optimize current surface irrigation practice the model must first be calibrated with field data calibration in winsrfr is achieved when the simulated infiltration function matches the soil infiltration function from the field data in the present study the modified kostiakov formula was chosen to estimate the soil infiltration function as follows 11 z k t a bt c where z mm is the cumulative infiltration depth k mm hr a and a are empirical fitting parameters b mm hr is the basic infiltration rate t hr is time of infiltration and c mm is the initial rapid infiltration into cracks the infiltration parameters k a b and c in the modified kostiakov formula were estimated in evalue based on the water front advance time observed in the field the infiltration parameters were manually adjusted such that the simulated infiltration volumes graphically and statistically matched the observed infiltration volumes to make our determination of the modified kostiakov parameters more reliable the basic infiltration rate b was measured in the field and the term c was assumed to be negligible compared to the other parameters the soil was assumed to be homogeneous along the entire furrow length and manning s roughness coefficient of the furrow surface was assumed to be 0 04 as recommended by usda 1974 2 4 1 1 field data measurement a data collection plan was performed in the field to obtain the measurement data needed for the winsrfr calibration and evaluation of current irrigation practice in total seven representative adjacent furrows were selected on the study farm in these furrows lengths were marked with five wooden posts at distances of 0 60 120 180 and 240 m from the furrow upstream end fig 4a to ensure that each furrow received separate discharge from the gated pipe the furrow ridges were reformed and heightened at the upstream end the water front advance time to the wooden posts was recorded during the irrigation event on june 26 2020 the previous irrigation event was seven days earlier the inflow discharge to the furrows was measured using a scaled bucket and stopwatch fig 4b and the experiment was terminated after 8 hrs the basic infiltration rate of soil b was determined a day before the water front advance experiment using double ring infiltrometers fig 4a and c the infiltrometers were installed on the bed of the central furrow f m in fig 4a at distances of 60 120 and 180 m from the upstream furrow end an average cross sectional geometry of furrows was obtained by measurements in selected furrows and the longitudinal slopes of the furrows were surveyed along the furrows at 20 m intervals 2 4 2 performance indicators performance of the irrigation applications was evaluated in the simulation world of winsrfr by the following indicators 12 application efficiency ae d rz d app 100 13 distribution uniformity du min d min d app 14 low quarter adequacy ad lq d lq d req 15 deep percolation dp d dp d app 100 16 cutoff ratio xr t co t adv if t co t adv xr x adv l otherwise where d rz is root zone infiltration depth d app is average depth of applied water d min is minimum infiltration depth d lq is the low quarter average infiltration depth d req is the required depth d dp is the average depth of deep percolation t co is the cutoff time t adv is the advance time x adv is the advance distance and l is the furrow length 2 4 3 optimization of furrow irrigation stream size and cutoff times for furrow irrigation were optimized using the operations analysis world in winsrfr optimization was performed for uniform slopes in the range typically found in the study area i e 0 02 0 12 input data were the required irrigation depth geometry of the furrow length shape slope the soil infiltration function and the optimization ranges of stream size 1 0 4 0 l s and cutoff time 0 20 hrs the output was curves of optimized stream sizes and cutoff times for application uniformity distribution uniformity and deep percolation when the minimum irrigation depth was equal to the required irrigation depth of 75 mm the stream size and the cutoff time that maximized the application efficiency and distribution uniformity were selected as optimized irrigation practice 3 results 3 1 properties of the soil and drainage table 1 presents the mualem and van genuchten parameters as determined for the measured soil layers subsurface drains were at a depth of 2 m and 60 m distance in the field the hydraulic conductivities of the soil layers were measured at approximately 1 87 m day above the drain level and approximately 3 39 m day below the drain level the initial soil salinity was 2 4 ds m on average from the soil surface to the drain level soil salinity then increased linearly to 14 ds m below the groundwater level to the depth of the impermeable layer approx 4 m 3 2 calibration and validation of swap results of the swap model simulating water table depth during the validation period correlated very well with the average of observed values the best correlation was found when the hydraulic conductivity of the soil above and below the drain level were adjusted to 1 5 and 4 0 m day respectively fig 5a this is statistically proven by the small mae of 6 12 cm and rmse of 7 98 cm table 2 results of swap model performance in predicting water table depth during the validation period also showed good agreement between the observed and simulated values with the small mae of 10 42 cm and rmse of 24 41 cm fig 5b the negative crm values being 0 88 and 1 11 respectively during calibration and validation showed a small tendency of swap model to overestimate water table depths 3 3 ideal irrigation schedule irrigation at farm l7 5 started in early march and ended in early october 2020 table 3 during this seven month period 26 irrigation applications were recorded with the minimum irrigation interval being five days in june and july the applied depth of irrigation was estimated at 162 mm based on the field experiment measurements with the cutoff time of 8 hrs the ideal irrigation schedule was simulated in swap without applying leaching requirements for the same irrigation period as observed in the field while also considering local experiences in sugarcane cultivation in khuzestan province which suggest the need for irrigation intervals to be seven days or less in june and july to protect crops from scorching summer winds the leaching fraction lf was obtained as 0 33 from eq 1 for the average irrigation water salinity of 2 1 ds m and the threshold of the saturated paste extract of 1 7 for no sugarcane yield reduction maas 1990 the leaching requirement lr then was calculated as 18 mm for the average prescribed irrigation depth of 54 mm finally the ideal irrigation schedule was determined by adding the leaching requirement depth to prescribed irrigation depths table 3 swap calculated 19 irrigation applications with an average and maximum required depth of 72 mm and 76 mm respectively the required depth of 75 mm was selected for evaluation and optimization of irrigation practice 3 4 properties of the furrow irrigation system the basic infiltration rate of soil was measured in infiltrometers as 3 mm hr on average after about six hours table 4 in addition furrow depth was 10 15 cm with a bottom width of approximately 90 cm and a top width of approximately 110 cm fig 6a the stable cross sectional geometry of the furrows was defined in winsrfr as a power law function with the top width of flow tw being a function of the furrow water depth y 17 tw 569 4 y 0 1329 furthermore furrow slope was measured as 0 3 on average in the first 40 m and 0 05 on average for the rest of the furrow lengths fig 6b 3 5 estimation of the soil infiltration function the parameters k and a of the modified kostiakov formula were estimated for all lengths of furrows f 1 f 2 f 3 and f m while the estimation was done only for the first 180 m of the furrow length in f 3 f 2 and f 1 table 5 shortly after completion of the water advance phase in f 1 f 2 f 3 and f m water overflowed from the downstream end of these furrows to f 1 f 2 and f 3 one after another as a result an inverse water front advance proceeded from the downstream end to the upstream end of the latter furrows disrupting the advance phase to the 240 m wooden post surprisingly the water fronts from the upstream and downstream ends of f 2 and f 3 reached the 180 m wooden post at almost the same time the advance phase was completed at around 5 6 hrs for all of the test furrows and the experiment ended at 8 hrs the infiltration function of the modified kostiakov formula was estimated in two categories for the test furrows a higher infiltration function was estimated for furrows f 3 f 2 and f 1 corresponding to natural resources conservation service nrcs intake soil family 0 5 0 7 and a silty loam soil type fig 7 however a lower infiltration function was estimated for f 1 f 2 f 3 and f m corresponding to nrcs intake family 0 2 0 35 and a clay loam soil type since the topsoil 0 40 cm was measured as clay loam in the field we derived the modified kostiakov equation only from the average infiltration parameters of furrows with lower infiltration rates as follows 18 z 50 6t 0 194 3t 3 6 evaluation of current irrigation practice to evaluate the performance of current irrigation practice we used the test furrows in which the advance phase reached the end of the furrow intact water was found to have infiltrated much deeper 162 mm here than the required depth 75 mm fig 8 and table 6 even at one quarter length of the furrows with lower infiltration depth 1 8 times more water on average was received than needed the efficiency of current irrigation practice was 47 on average meaning that more than half of the irrigation water was lost by deep percolation the crop transpiration simulation in swap however showed a marked difference in yield values along the furrow lengths table 7 in f 2 and f 3 for example yield at the downstream end of the furrow was 30 lower than at the upstream end 3 7 optimization of current irrigation practice the curves of optimized stream sizes and cutoff times for three performance indicators were obtained in winsrfr for uniform slopes of 0 02 0 12 fig 9 the results indicate that current blocked end furrow irrigation practice is optimized by larger stream size and shorter cutoff times for milder furrow slopes and smaller stream size and longer cutoff times for steeper slopes for example a stream size of around 3 0 l s and a cutoff time of 3 2 hrs was found to be suitable for a slope of 0 02 while a 1 6 l s stream size and 6 5 hrs cutoff time was more optimum for a slope of 0 12 moreover in furrows with slopes less than 0 05 the minimum and maximum infiltration depth occurred respectively at the downstream end and the upstream end fig 10 however in furrows with slopes greater than 0 05 the maximum infiltration depth occurred at the downstream end with the position of minimum infiltration depth shifting gradually from 0 5 l to 0 75 l as slope increased from 0 05 to 0 12 with milder slopes the advance and recession phases were found to be completed sooner with higher application efficiency and distribution uniformity table 8 application efficiencies in the optimized irrigation practice were found to be 95 and 88 for slopes of 0 02 and 0 12 respectively and irrigation application should be stopped the same time and around 25 min after completion of the advance phase respectively the swap crop growth simulation showed no significant difference in yield along the furrows under optimized irrigation practice table 9 4 discussion three furrows f 3 f 2 and f 1 were omitted from the infiltration estimations using the modified kostiakov equation and from the evaluation of current irrigation practice due to a too long advance phase and irrigation water overflow the higher infiltration rate simulated for these furrows compared to the expected rate can be explained by water overflow during the advance phase in the first 180 m of the furrow lengths considering the uneven bed elevation along these furrows fig 6 it is highly likely that during the advance phase the water depth in some regions exceeded the furrow ridges and a fraction of stream size overflowed out of the furrows since winsrfr does not consider overflow in simulations the model estimated higher infiltration rates to compensate for the longer measured advance times a longer advance phase was found especially for furrows f 3 and f 2 indicating that application efficiency and distribution uniformity in the field could be lower than the results found in the present study also it should be noted that seepage from the gated pipe which affects water conveyance efficiency to furrows is not considered in application efficiencies markedly different advance phases observed between furrows in this study points to the need for proper land levelling and frequent maintenance of furrow shapes to achieve high irrigation efficiencies and distribution uniformities in furrow irrigation systems supervision and maintenance of furrow ridges during irrigation applications and ensuring that furrows receive the same individual stream size are crucial to avoid overflow and achieve uniform advance phases across furrows however changes in furrow shape bed elevation and infiltration rate are usually inevitable during cultivation especially in mechanized agriculture as a result some furrows may have a longer advance phase our field observations of the water front during the advance phase suggest that connecting the downstream end of irrigation furrows to a ditch might promote greater irrigation efficiency in mildly sloping furrows this strategy especially in furrows with uneven beds and overflow problems would help the advance phase to complete sooner thus increasing application efficiency and distribution uniformity in practice in the field the irrigation schedule currently practiced in the study area having 26 applications and a combined water depth of 4212 mm was optimized in swap to an ideal irrigation schedule having 19 applications and a combined water depth of 1362 mm see table 3 in other words according to the swap simulations the current irrigation frequencies were 37 more than needed mostly because irrigation began two months earlier and the quantity of water applied was 3 1 times greater than needed however to be realistically applicable in the field surface irrigation application efficiencies need to be considered in the swap prescribed ideal irrigation schedule the optimized stream sizes and cutoff times for furrow irrigation in winsrfr indicate that the applied water depth in current irrigation practice 162 mm could be reduced to 81 mm for a slope of 0 06 under field conditions table 8 therefore the water applied in the current schedule was actually 2 7 times greater than what a realistic water application would be 1539 mm and thus can be decreased by 63 we found that application efficiency for a particular slope was especially affected by the combination of stream size and cutoff time while distribution uniformity was more affected by the uniformity of the slope and the presence of rises and depressions in bed elevation along the length of the furrows considering the 0 06 overall average slope of the tested furrows the current practice application efficiency 47 was found to be much lower than optimized practice 92 mostly because the cutoff time was 78 greater than optimized practice the lower distribution uniformity found for current irrigation practice especially in f 2 and f 3 0 61 and 0 58 respectively compared to optimized practice 0 93 was due mainly to a steeper furrow slope 0 3 in the first 40 m compared to the rest of the furrows 0 05 and accumulation of extra water in the downstream region of the furrows this lower distribution uniformity resulted in 30 lower yield at the downstream end of the furrows compared to the upstream end regarding yield the swap simulations suggest that an optimized irrigation schedule could increase actual yield by 22 compared to the current schedule fig 11 our results furthermore indicate that the lower actual yield observed under current practice was due mainly to a 2 7 times greater waterlogging stress on crops during irrigation applications while the water depths prescribed in the ideal schedule would sufficiently leach salts away from the root zone application of greater irrigation depths would not further decrease salt stress significantly though it would increase waterlogging and may therefore diminish yield these results reveal the fallacy of the common conception in the study area that overirrigation will better leach salts away from the root zone and lead to higher sugarcane yield swap however is likely to simulate slightly lower yields than those which might be observed in the field under actual conditions of a furrow irrigation system this is because swap is a one dimensional model which assumes irrigation applications in a flat basin however in furrow irrigation systems only part of the soil becomes fully saturated thus only part of the crop roots may be affected by waterlogging therefore no yield reduction or lesser yield reductions than predicted by the swap simulations can be expected under real furrow irrigation field conditions the suggested optimized stream sizes in this study for furrow slopes of 0 02 0 12 correspond to the maximum non erosive stream size of 3 l s recommended by fao for furrow slopes of 0 1 or less fao 2021 the results of the present study differ from those of mazarei et al 2020 who used winsrfr to optimize sugarcane irrigation practice for a blocked end furrow irrigation system in the same study area with the same soil type clay loam and the same furrow shape they recommended the optimal stream size of 3 l s and a cutoff time of 6 3 hrs for a furrow length of 200 m and slope of 0 05 their recommended optimal irrigation practice had an application efficiency of 78 and irrigation depth of 186 mm however our results suggest the lower optimal stream size and cutoff time of 2 2 l s and 4 5 hrs respectively for the same slope and a longer furrow length of 240 m we would suggest that their overestimation of required depth 100 mm as the key input parameter to winsrfr resulted in an overestimation of stream size and cutoff time in their optimization 5 conclusions the present study adopts two one dimensional simulation models winsrfr and swap in an effort to optimize surface irrigation practice and overcome some limitations of the simulation models currently used for surface irrigation optimization the results of this study demonstrate the value of combining a surface flow simulation model and a subsurface crop model to derive an optimized irrigation schedule and optimized irrigation applications the optimized irrigation schedule suggests that the number of irrigation applications and the volume of applied water in current practice can be reduced by 27 and 63 respectively our results also indicate that the optimized irrigation schedule can efficiently leach salts away from the root zone furthermore the crop growth simulation in swap indicates that the optimized irrigation schedule could produce a sugarcane yield 22 higher than current practice with no significant variation in yield along the furrows we attribute the lower yields obtained under current practice to high waterlogging stress due to overirrigation our optimization of blocked end furrow irrigation in winsrfr for the required depth of 75 mm suggests that the stream size and cutoff time of 2 5 l s and 8 hrs in current practice should be reduced to 2 2 l s and 4 5 hrs respectively application efficiency and distribution uniformity would then increase from 47 and 0 68 92 and 0 93 respectively our results also indicate that as furrow slope increases from 0 02 0 12 optimized stream size decreases from 3 0 to 1 6 l s while cutoff times increase from 3 2 to 6 5 hrs our study points to the importance of land levelling and furrow shapes to achieve high irrigation efficiency and distribution uniformity to compensate for the inevitably poor land leveling and furrow maintenance we recommend connecting the downstream end of furrows to a ditch further study is needed to better determine crop root properties and the soil infiltration function as these are key factors affecting irrigation schedule and application the root depth and distribution pattern and soil water pressure heads during water uptake by crop roots particularly merit closer investigation determination of the soil infiltration function however is perhaps still the most challenging step in surface irrigation optimization future studies could therefore focus on spatial and temporal changes in soil infiltration

9369,recently the technology of combining vertical rotary sub soiling vrt with ridge furrow construction with plastic film mulching system rfms has become a promising solution to improve soil water characteristics and crop yields in the semi arid loess plateau china however the effect of this technique on deep soil moisture and rainfall utilization to enhance the crop yield is unclear to investigate this two field experiments 2016 2017 were set up with maize and potato as research objects there were four tillage practices under rfms for maize 1 mvt vrt to a depth of 40 cm 2 mst sub soiling to a depth of 40 cm 3 mtt rotary tillage to a depth of 15 cm and 4 mzt zero tillage there were three tillage practices under rfms for potato 1 pvt vrt to a depth of 40 cm 2 pst sub soiling to a depth of 40 cm and 3 ptt rotary tillage to a depth of 15 cm our results showed that the vrt under rfms mainly significantly reduced soil water storage sws in the 0 100 cm profile at the flowering stage and sws in the 100 300 cm profile of maize and sws in the 100 200 cm profile of potato at the harvest stage compared with other tillage practices this increased evapotranspiration et throughout the whole growth stage and indicated that vrt promoted the utilization of deep soil water below 100 cm for maize and potato the increase of et and utilization of deep soil water contributed to promote crop growth directly improved chlorophyll content accelerated dry matter accumulation and prolonged the duration of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate resulting in higher water use efficiency wue harvest index hi and yield the results suggested that vrt under rfms improved wue by 3 5 14 6 hi by 2 8 23 85 and yield by 12 1 47 4 of maize compared to the other treatments and correspondingly by 18 9 92 3 1 6 29 6 and 24 7 156 8 for potato in addition vrt significantly improved fallow efficiency by 56 3 133 1 and precipitation use efficiency pue by 12 1 47 4 for maize and correspondingly by 101 9 272 7 and 24 7 156 8 for potato compared with other treatments these data indicated vrt can improve the efficiency of precipitation preservation and utilization in rfms overall vrt can efficiently utilize deep soil moisture and rainfall to promote crop growth under rfms thereby significantly increased maize and potato yields keywords vertical rotary sub soiling ridge furrow construction with plastic film mulching system maize potato yield semi arid loess plateau 1 introduction improving the ability of crops to use soil moisture and rainfall is a necessary means to combat drought and increase yield for crops in semi arid areas annual rainfall of 250 600 mm wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2020a however this is influenced by a variety of external factors such as tillage practices cultural methods and environment of the soil tillage layer du et al 2011 zhang et al 2020a tillage measures can regulate the top layer of the soil environment and directly influence soil physical properties such as soil porosity compactness soil bulk density and water retention wang et al 2020a xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2020a a good top layer of the soil environment can increase soil permeability and soil oxygen content promoting the growth of crop roots which benefits crops by improving their ability to use soil moisture and rainfall colombi et al 2022 dagnew et al 2015 wang et al 2020b xu et al 2019 thus the topsoil layer directly affects crop growth and yield through above and below ground effects blum and arkin 1984 zhang et al 2020a maize zea mays l and potato solanum tuberosum l are the main sources of people s daily food and the main crops in the loess plateau and are also important throughout the world in the semi arid area of the loess plateau the ridge furrow cultivation combined with plastic film mulching system rfms is commonly used to grow maize and potato in most areas zhang et al 2020a zhou et al 2012 the rfms can effectively retain precipitation decrease soil surface runoff suppress surface evaporation in the field and achieve efficient utilization of natural precipitation in dry areas to significantly improve maize and potato water use efficiency wue and increase yields li et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a zhou et al 2009 however due to the uneven distribution of natural precipitation and the resulting stunted crop development seasonal drought is a major limiting factor to yield potential of potato and maize under rfms in this region hou et al 2015 liu et al 2009 shi and shao 2000 in the semi arid loess plateau ecological system dry farmland typically employs traditional shallow tillage with plowing to a depth of about 20 cm due to long term rotary tillage the plow layer becomes weak and a plow pan forms increasing bulk density and decreasing soil porosity and field capacity thus impeding rainfall infiltration and preventing the crop from making full use of the limited deep soil moisture zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2018 the growth and development of the crop root system is blocked which also is one of the main reasons for the low rainfall utilization efficiency of crops therefore under conditions of limited and unstable rainfall effective tillage measures are needed to optimize the top layer of the soil environment so that crops can make full use of rainfall and utilize deep soil moisture to alleviate the water limitation for crop growth zero tillage zt is a mature tillage technique widely used around the world and generally applied to crops such as maize and wheat sun et al 2018 wang et al 2020b use of zt can significantly reduce soil erosion and improve soil physical and chemical properties soil fertility and farmland productivity but long term zt will increase soil bulk density and soil compaction with negative impacts on soil water storage capacity and crop yield kumar et al 2013 wang et al 2020b for rfms some tillage measures are needed to remove loose soil in order to appropriately establish the ridge furrow structure however traditional tillage tt is rotating tillage to a depth of 20 cm without breaking the plow layer table 2 seriously hindering the movement of moisture and nutrients and growth of crop roots and over the long run results in the loss of soil nutrients and moisture hamza et al 2005 shi et al 2010 tian et al 2016 this leads to soil quality decline and inability to coping with seasonal drought stress so that the potential of crop production in the region cannot be effectively exploited hou et al 2015 sun et al 2018 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a sub soiling tillage st table 2 can break the plow layer by deep plowing improve soil water storage capacity and crop yield and in the long term increase soil nutrient enrichment in surface soil compared with tt wang et al 2020b xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 the st only breaks the plow layer without smashing the soil vertically so it fails to improve soil water characteristics and thus does not improve soil water supply capacity zhang et al 2018 the advantages of tt also have been ignored in scientific research in that tt can effectively reduce weeds by more than 50 compared to zt and the burial of residue is conducive to increasing nutrition in deep soil peigné et al 2018 in order to solve these agricultural production problems a new improved vertical rotary sub soiling tillage measure vrt has emerged in china in recent years zhai et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a differing from st and tt vrt fig 1 and table 2 uses a high speed rotating head to smash the soil vertically with a tillage depth of more than 40 cm and also does not change the vertical layering of the soil zhang et al 2020a this not only helps retain internal soil water and nutrients of the top layer and reduce weeds but also significantly decreases soil bulk density wilting point and compaction increases the content of soil aggregates total soil porosity and capillary porosity soil saturation moisture content and capillary moisture content as well as reduces weeds and improves soil available moisture wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2018 thus vrt could improve the soil water characteristics and optimize the topsoil layer making it conducive to rainfall infiltration and promotes well developed root systems which benefits crops to utilize soil water and improve their drought resistance the technology of combining rfms with vrt has been applied in the central region of the loess plateau at present it is mainly applied to cultivation of potato maize and some traditional chinese medicine crops and the yield increase exceeds 10 with the effect more obvious in dry years qin et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a however current research concerning vrt to promote yield increase mainly focuses on soil physical properties soil water characteristics and changes in soil total water content qin et al 2019 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2020a no detailed available reports have focused on the effects of vrt on rainfall utilization and deep soil water below 100 cm in the field therefore different tillage measures were combined with rfms and maize and potato were used as test crops in this study for experiments in the semi arid area of the loess plateau in 2016 and 2017 the objectives of this study were 1 to determine whether vrt significantly uses soil moisture under 100 cm in the process of growing crops 2 to explore whether vrt can improve rainfall storage efficiency and rainfall utilization efficiency in rfms 3 to clarify the effects of vrt on chlorophyll content and dry matter accumulation characteristics in the growth process of maize and potato and 4 to explore the effect of vrt to enhance crops yield of rfms by analyzing the comprehensive relationship between rainfall utilization changes in deep soil water dry matter accumulation characteristics and chlorophyll content the results are expected to provide theoretical support for the extension of the technology of combining vrt with rfms in northwest china to ensure regional food security 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment sites our field experiment was conducted at the dingxi experimental station of the gansu academy of agricultural sciences 35 35 n 104 36 e northwest loess plateau in central gansu province china over two years of 2016 2017 the site represents a typical rainfed semi arid area with an elevation of 1970 m annual rainfall of 415 mm and mean annual temperature of 6 2 c about 70 of the precipitation is concentrated in june

rainfall for potato from sowing april 20 to harvesting october 10 was 353 5 mm and for maize from planting april 20 to harvesting october 15 was 365 1 mm from the perspective of rainfall during the crop growth period 2016 was a severe drought year and 2017 was a normal year 2 2 ridge furrow and plastic film mulching 2 2 1 maize double ridge furrow and planting with plastic mulching the schematic diagram of maize double ridge furrow and planting with plastic mulching is shown in fig 3a the core configuration of this system is alternating ridges and furrows in this study each ridge furrow unit comprised a wide and low ridge 0 7 m in width and 0 10 m in height and a narrow and high ridge 0 4 m in width and 0 15 m in height and the naturally occurring furrows at the junction between the two ridge types could be used for collecting water after preparing the furrows transparent polyethylene film 0 01 mm thick and 1 2 m wide was spread on the plot two pieces of plastic film were connected at the mid line between wide and narrow ridges and soil was spread over the film to firmly fix the joints at the time of plastic mulching small holes of diameter about 0 01 cm were opened at the bottom of the furrow every 0 5 m which was conducive to concentrate rainfall and entry into the soil maize seeds were planted in the furrows 2 2 2 potato micro furrows on ridges and planting with plastic mulching the schematic diagram of potato micro furrows on ridges and planting with plastic mulching is shown in fig 3b in this study each ridge was 0 6 m in width and 0 15 m in height and the micro ditch within the ridge was 0 10 m in width and 0 05 m in depth upon preparing of the furrows black polyethylene film 0 01 mm thick and 1 2 m wide was spread on the plot two pieces of plastic film were connected at the mid line between wide and narrow ridges and soil was spread over the film to firmly fix the joints then small holes were placed every 0 5 m in each micro ditch for rainwater infiltration potato seeds were planted on top of the micro ditch of the ridge on either side 2 3 experimental design and field management two test crops were used maize variety xianyu335 and potato variety longshu10 maize was cultivated by double ridge furrow and planting with plastic mulching planting method fig 3a and with four tillage treatments 1 zero tillage mzt 2 traditional tillage mtt 3 sub soiling tillage mst and 4 vertically rotary sub soiling mvt details of the tillage treatment procedures are shown in table 2 the maize experiment was arranged in a randomized design with three replicates and the area of each plot was 15 m 7 m chemical fertilizers of urea n 46 0 diammonium phosphate n 18 0 p2o5 46 0 and potassium chloride k2o 55 were spread on the maize field at 150 120 and 45 kg ha 1 respectively with no topdressing during the whole maize growth period maize seeds were planted in furrows every 30 cm and row by row sowing was staggered fig 3a at 60 000 plants ha 1 by human powered seeder on 21 april 2016 and 20 april 2017 potato was cultivated using micro furrows on ridges and planting with plastic mulching planting method fig 3b with three tillage treatments 1 traditional tillage ptt 2 sub soiling tillage pst and 3 vertical rotary sub soiling pvt details of the tillage treatment operation procedures are shown in table 2 the potato experiment was arranged in a randomized design with three replicates and the area of each plot was 20 m 12 m chemical fertilizers of urea n 46 0 diammonium phosphate n 18 0 p2o5 46 0 and potassium chloride k2o 55 were spread on the potato field at 90 60 and 60 kg ha 1 before sowing respectively and 60 kg ha 1 urea was top dressed at the flowering stage by machine potato seeds were planted on top of the micro ditch of the ridge on either side every 30 cm and row by row sowing was staggered fig 3b at 60 000 plants ha 1 by manual seeder on 20 april 2016 and 20 april 2017 in this study no irrigation was applied during the whole growth period for maize and potato and field grass and insect pests were artificially controlled 2 4 measurements and methods 2 4 1 soil water storage sws according to previous studies in our test area zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b the growth process of maize and potato is closely related to the change of soil moisture in 0 300 and 0 200 cm soil layers respectively therefore soil gravimetric water content sgc of the maize field was measured at 20 cm increments to a depth of 300 cm and samples were randomly collected once from the furrows in each plot at sowing flowering and harvesting stages the sgc of the potato field was measured at 20 cm increments to a depth of 200 cm and was randomly collected once from the micro ditch on the ridge in each plot at sowing flowering and harvesting stages for each maize and potato plot sgc was determined by averaging the value from three random sampling points central between two plants before the ridges and furrows for each tillage practice were formed soil bulk density was determined for the soil profiles for maize 0 300 cm depth and for potato 0 200 cm depth using three random sampling points the soil water storage sws mm was calculated using the following formula sws sgc b d where b is soil bulk density g cm 3 and d is soil depth mm 2 4 2 fallow efficiency fe the fe is the retention rate of soil of natural precipitation during the fallow period calculated using the following formula fe swss swsh δpf where swss is sws before sowing of crops in the current season swsh is sws after harvest of the previous crop and δpf is rainfall during the fallow period 2 4 3 evapotranspiration et the experiment was carried out under rainfed conditions and no irrigation was provided during the crop growing periods our site observation showed no runoff in the experimental field as the single maximum rainfall was basically less than 30 mm and so surface runoff was ignored thus et mm was calculated using the following formula et δsws δp where δsws mm is the difference in sws between the beginning and the end of the measured stage and δp mm is total rainfall amount during the measured stage 2 4 4 chlorophyll content five maize plants were randomly selected from each plot and the second fully opened leaf from the topmost of each plant was sampled at the jointing flowering and filling stages between 9 00 11 30 a m on a sunny day five potato plants were randomly selected from each plot and the topmost leaf of the penultimate branch of each plant was sampled at the squaring flowering and tuber expanding stages between 9 00 11 30 a m on a sunny day all these leaves were used to measure chlorophyll content using a portable spad 502 plus konica minolta inc tokyo japan 2 4 5 dry matter accumulation every 15 20 days after emergence of maize and potato three plants with uniform growth were randomly selected from each plot leaving the below ground parts and then dried in an oven at 75 c until constant weight dry matter accumulation per ha was calculated using planting density 2 4 6 characteristics of dry matter accumulation growth rates of dry matter accumulation of the whole growth v avg pre flowering v a and post flowering v b periods all kg ha 1 d 1 were calculated using the following formulas v avg m t v a ma ta v b m ma t ta where m kg ha 1 is dry matter accumulation of the harvesting stage t is the total number of days of the whole growth period ma kg ha 1 is dry matter accumulation of the flowering stage and ta is the total number of days from sowing to flowering stage logistic equations can effectively simulate the crop growth process andersen et al 2007 logistic equations were used to fit the relevant parameters with time as the independent variable and dry matter accumulation as the dependent variable and then the equations of dry matter accumulation for maize and potato under different tillage measures were obtained finally logistic equations were used to calculate the maximum dry matter accumulation rate v max kg ha 1 d 1 and the days when the maximum accumulation rate appeared δt for different treatments 2 4 7 yield harvest index hi precipitation use efficiency pue and wue after the crop was harvested the yield of each plot was weighed and converted into a hectare yield y kg ha 1 here y refers to the grain yield of maize and tuber yield of potato the hi was determined as the ratio of the grain yield relative to the biomass yield the pue and wue both kg ha 1 mm 1 were calculated using the following equations pue y p wue y ets where ets mm is et for the whole growing season and p mm is total rainfall during the whole growth period 2 5 statistical analysis the software spss 19 0 ibm spss statistics 19 0 usa was used for data analysis of variance anova and correlation the average outcomes for each treatment were compared using the least significant difference test lsd this treatment differences were considered statistically significant if p 0 05 the excel 365 software microsoft office usa was used for graphical presentation of the results 3 results 3 1 sws effects of sws on different tillage practices in the 0 300 cm soil layer of maize in different periods are shown in fig 4 the two years of the maize experiment showed that at flowering stage compared with mst mtt and mzt the mvt significantly reduced sws in the 0 100 cm soil layer by 3 3 35 9 9 7 15 2 and 9 1 10 1 mm respectively and correspondingly in the 100 200 cm layer by 5 6 5 9 10 5 9 9 and 3 5 9 1 mm fig 4b and e at harvest stage sws of mvt in the 0 40 cm soil layer was significantly lower than that of mst mtt and mzt by 10 1 9 5 4 8 9 9 and 12 9 14 6 mm respectively and correspondingly in the 100 300 cm layer by 27 1 36 1 19 6 36 8 and 22 7 52 8 mm fig 4c and f at sowing stage in 2017 compared with mst mtt and mzt the sws of mvt in the 0 100 cm soil layer was significantly increased by 20 2 18 3 and 22 7 mm respectively fig 4d effects of sws on different tillage practices in the 0 300 cm soil layer of potato in different periods are shown in fig 5 at flowering stage sws of pvt in the 0 100 cm soil layer was significantly decreased by 32 1 and 38 3 mm compared with pst and ptt in 2016 fig 5b respectively for pvt in the 0 100 cm soil layer sws was 24 11 mm lower than in ptt and in the 100 200 cm soil layer sws was 7 3 and 8 8 mm lower than in pst and ptt in 2017 respectively fig 5e at harvesting stage sws of pvt in the 0 100 cm layer was significantly reduced by 51 2 and 36 1 mm in 2016 respectively compared with pst and ptt fig 5c in 2017 there was no significant difference between pvt and pst fig 5f due to sufficient rainfall after flowering which effectively supplemented the upper sws under deep tillage treatment at the harvest stage of both years the sws of pvt in the 100 200 cm layer was 19 9 27 1 and 4 9 19 6 mm lower than that of pst and ptt respectively fig 5c and f in 2017 at sowing stage there was no significant difference in sws for the 0 200 cm soil layer for different treatments fig 5d 3 2 fe there were significant differences in rainfall retention efficiency of potato and maize in the fallow period under different tillage treatments fig 6a and b for maize compared with mst mtt and mzt the fe of mvt treatment was significantly increased by 133 1 56 3 and 76 8 respectively fig 6a in the potato experiment the fe of pvt treatment was significantly increased by 272 7 and 101 9 compared with pst and ptt respectively fig 6b 3 3 et the rainfall and et in pre and post flowering periods and whole growth periods of maize and potato under different tillage treatments are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively two years of field experiments showed that mvt significantly increased the et of maize in the pre flowering period except for mst in 2017 fig 7a there was no significant difference in et of maize under each treatment when rainfall was only 62 6 mm in the post flowering period in 2016 in 2017 when the post flowering period rainfall was 203 6 mm mvt treatment significantly increased et compared with other treatments fig 7b there were no significant differences in et in the entire growth period among mvt mst and mtt but et for the entire growth period was significantly higher than for mvt than mzt with increases of 10 8 and 13 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 7c the two year potato field experiment showed that the pvt treatment had the highest et in the pre flowering period but et did not significantly differ in the post flowering period among treatments when precipitation was high 233 5 mm in 2017 fig 8a and b the et in the entire growth period of pvt was significantly higher than for pst and ptt by 33 5 and 24 0 in 2016 respectively but there were no significant differences among treatments in 2017 fig 8c these results suggest that vrt tillage practices promote et of maize and potato under rfms especially in dry years but the difference in et is closely related to precipitation and precipitation distribution 3 4 chlorophyll content the chlorophyll content spad value at different growth stages of maize and potato under different tillage treatments are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively the two year maize field experiment showed that mvt had the highest spad value at the jointing flowering and filling stages with significantly improved spad values by 16 6 and 15 5 at the flowering stage and 17 9 and 20 1 at filling stage compared to mst and mtt respectively in 2017 only at the filling stage was mvt significantly higher by 8 5 compared to mzt fig 9 two years of study on potato showed that pvt had the highest spad value at squaring flowering and tuber expanding stages and the spad value was 21 2 and 23 5 higher than that of pst and ptt at the tuber expanding stage respectively fig 10 the spad value of pvt was 18 6 higher at the flowering stage of 2016 compared other treatments generally vrt resulted in higher chlorophyll content in the post flowering period for maize and potato with rfms 3 5 dry matter accumulation with the advance of growth period the dry matter accumulation of maize and potato under different tillage treatments increased gradually figs 11 and 12 after two years of the experiment the dry matter accumulation of mvt at flowering stage was 5 4 17 6 and 26 1 higher than that of mst mtt and mzt respectively and correspondingly at harvest stage was 11 7 11 7 and 25 2 higher fig 11 two years of study on potato showed that dry matter accumulation of pvt at the flowering stage was 29 4 and 29 9 higher than that of pst and pzt respectively and correspondingly at harvest stage was 34 8 and 29 3 higher fig 12 in addition compared with 2017 2016 was a more arid year but the difference in post flowering dry matter accumulation of maize and potato under rfms treated with vrt in 2016 was more obvious than that of other treatments 3 6 characteristics of dry matter accumulation there were significant effects of different tillage treatments on characteristics of dry matter accumulation during growth periods for maize and potato table 3 the logistic regression equation had r2 0 9 thus it effectively reflected the change in dry matter accumulation of maize and potato under different tillage treatments andersen et al 2007 compared with other treatments the growth rate of dry matter accumulation in the mvt treatment in pre and post flowering periods of maize was 14 5 and 17 9 higher than that of other tillage treatments respectively the growth rate of dry matter accumulation of the pvt treatment in pre and post flowering periods of potato was 30 6 and 24 5 higher than for other tillage treatments respectively compared with other treatments the average and maximum growth rates of dry matter accumulation in the maize growth period under mvt were significantly increased by 16 2 and 14 4 respectively similarly the average and maximum growth rate of potato dry matter accumulation during the growth period under pvt were significantly increased by 29 3 and 31 4 respectively in addition compared with the tillage practices tt and zt vrt and st prolonged the duration of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate for maize of rfms in both years but only prolonged this duration for potato in the drought year 2016 3 7 yield and hi the vrt tillage practices mvt and pvt improved maize and potato yields table 4 compared with other tillage practices the maize yield of mvt was significantly increased by 29 8 in 2016 and 16 3 in 2017 on average the corresponding significant increases for potato yield under pvt were 102 3 and 32 8 thus the yield increases from vrt tillage practices for maize and potato were greater in the dry year of 2016 compared with other tillage practices vrt tillage practices contributed to the increase of maize and potato under rfms hi in dry years 2016 but there was no significant difference in hi among tillage treatments when rainfall was relatively good in 2017 table 4 3 8 pue and wue the mvt increased pue and wue of maize fig 13 the wue of mvt did not significantly differ with that of mst in 2016 but was significantly higher than for mtt and mzt the wue of mvt did not significantly differ with that of mst and mtt in 2017 but significantly increased by 9 7 compared with zt compared with mst mtt and mzt the pue of mvt was 12 5 23 7 and 35 7 higher respectively the pvt increased pue and wue of potato fig 14 the pvt significantly increased wue of pst and ptt by 92 3 and 19 2 in 2016 respectively and correspondingly by 18 9 and 26 6 in 2017 compared with pst and ptt the pue of pvt was significantly increased by 90 8 and 44 4 respectively hence vrt tillage practices improved wue and pue for maize and potato of rfms and this effect was greater in the drought year of 2016 the ranges of increases from vrt tillage practices for pue were significantly greater than for wue 3 9 correlation analysis precipitation had the highest correlation with the characteristics of dry matter accumulation yield hi pue and wue table 5 dry matter accumulation was significantly correlated with et the etb had a greater effect on yield than eta these results showed that rainfall was the main factor affecting yield and the main reason for increased yield of maize and potato the technology of combining vrt with rfms promoted et the key factors for achieving high yield and wue were water distribution and improved pue increasing soil water supply after flowering was more beneficial to increasing yield 4 discussion 4 1 sws and et the yield and wue of maize and potato in the semi arid area of the loess plateau have been shown increase effectively by rfms hou et al 2015 zhou et al 2012 2009 however in this region the effective rainfall during the growth period of maize and potato does not usually meet the water requirement for normal growth additionally due to the warming effect of plastic film mulching crops grow faster in the vegetative growth period consume soil moisture rapidly and often face the problem of rainfall shortage in the later growth period which intensifies the degree of drought stress and reduces yields hou et al 2015 zhou et al 2012 secondly shallow tillage resulted in a shallow soil surface layer increased soil bulk density and decreased soil porosity giving less space for root growth and poor soil aeration during the vegetative growth period which is not conducive to utilization of deep soil water to resist drought stress during low rainfall periods ball et al 2003 sun et al 2018 tracy et al 2011 some natural phenomena give us inspiration some saprophytes like earthworms loosen the soil structure increase soil aggregation and soil oxygen content so that plants can distribute more photosynthate to root systems and their better developed root systems can absorb soil water and nutrients more efficiently colombi et al 2022 at the same time practical research guan et al 2015 wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2021b shows that loosening soil by tillage measures can increase soil water capacity permanent wilting point and the water supply capacity which improves drought resistance of crops zhang et al 2021b and zhang et al 2018 showed that vrt could significantly reduce soil bulk density and soil wilting coefficient of the 0 40 cm layer increase soil porosity and saturation which significantly increased soil available water storage in potato compared with tt and st in our study vrt mainly significantly reduced the sws of the 0 100 cm soil layer at the flowering stage and the 100 300 cm layer of maize and the 100 200 cm layer of potato at the harvest stage resulting in the increase of et in pre flowering and post flowering periods compared to other tillage practices under rfms this phenomenon was more pronounced in the dry year 2016 there may be two reasons for this phenomenon one reason may be that vrt optimized the soil surface environment and improved the soil water supply characteristics increased soil porosity and more soil available water storage which was conducive to root growth in the period of crop nutrition zhai et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the developed root system promoted the full absorption of soil water and utilized deep soil water for crop growth when there was insufficient rainfall guan et al 2015 the other reason is that soil water declined in deeper layers and led to the water supply layer moving up which was especially true for the dry year our findings are supported by previous studies and this phenomenon may result from the movement of water and air under drought stress together these results suggest that vrt promotes crop depletion of deep soil water to resist drought stress in crop growing season however li et al 2013b showed that vrt did not increase et in the huang huai hai region of china mainly due to sufficient rainfall and lack of drought stress 4 2 precipitation preservation and utilization the effective use of rainfall is becoming increasingly important for improving yield and wue in semi arid areas table 5 also showed that precipitation was the factor most closely influencing yield the rainfall retention efficiency during the fallow period is closely related to the tillage practices during the crop growth season sun et al 2018 wang et al 2020b and improving the absorption and infiltration capacity of soil to rainfall and reducing surface runoff and evaporation loss are effective ways to solve the problem of water shortage in dryland agriculture tuure et al 2021 wang et al 2020b it has been reported that loose soil and improve soil water characteristics could speed up rainfall infiltration into the soil and reduce the exposure of rainfall on the surface and the retention time of shallow soil sun et al 2018 wang et al 2020b when coupled with the strong rainfall collecting capacity of rfms this water conservation effect is further enhanced we had also similar results fig 6 with vrt and tt increasing fe by better loosening the soil compared with st and zt at the same time the vrt increasing the depth of smashing the soil vertically is beneficial to increasing infiltration of rainwater deep into the soil profile and enhances capacity to retain rainwater thereby further improving fe compared to st thus vrt may also be indirectly beneficial for retaining rainwater efficiently in rfms during the crop growth season in addition vrt preserved soil moisture and nutrients better by vertically loosening soil and not turning it zhang et al 2021b the sws in the early growth stage is critical for maximizing grain yield wang et al 2020a which requires rainfall during the fallow period to supplement the water consumed by crops during the growing season sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 our results showed that vrt promoted soil water consumption during the entire growth period of crops under rfms and there was very little difference in sws among vrt tt and st at sowing throughout the two year experiment on maize and potato zhang et al 2020a also showed that vrt had no significant effect on soil water balance in the semi arid loess plateau in addition compared with other tillage measures vrt treatment helped improve wue and pue for maize and potato of rfms and increased pue more than wue figs 13 and 14 which also indicated that vrt improved sws capacity through improved rainfall infiltration and protection ability for crops under rfms sun et al 2018 also noted that both sub soiling and deep plowing could improve crop yield and wue increments especially in dry years mainly due to increases in rainfall storage levels therefore vrt has high rainfall conservation efficiency and utilization efficiency in rfms 4 3 chlorophyll content and characteristics of dry matter accumulation the chlorophyll content of plant leaves was closely related to the degree of water stress songsri et al 2009 our two year study showed that vrt most significantly increased the spad values at maize filling and potato tuber expanding stages compared with tt and st and significantly increased the spad values at the maize and potato flowering stages in the relatively dry 2016 figs 9 and 10 this may be mainly because the ability of plants to absorb phosphorus and nitrogen is weakened with the increase of drought stress during the post flowering period for tt and st and this would reduce their ability to produce chlorophyll thus reducing their chlorophyll content ahmed 2011 romero et al 2004 however in our maize experiment there was no significant difference between spad values of vrt and zt during the growth period of 2016 fig 10 this was mainly because the low growth rate of zt resulted in lower soil water consumption and the relatively good soil water condition made the plant less subject to water stress wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2017 in semi arid areas the chlorophyll content of plants is closely related to the ability of plant roots to obtain soil water and the soil water status which shows that the higher the chlorophyll content of the plant the better it is able to resist drought romero et al 2004 songsri et al 2009 the drought resistance can be enhanced by increasing the ability of plants to extract water from soil songsri et al 2009 enlarging the plant roots could improve the plant s ability to extract water from soil making it better able to cope with drought conditions ahmed 2011 li et al 2013a studies showed that vrt could significantly improve soil water characteristics and increase crop root biomass li et al 2013a zhai et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 and our study showed that vrt decreased sws of the deep soil layer at the harvesting stage and increased et thus allowing vrt to maintain a higher spad value in the post flowering period compared with other treatments in northeast china li et al 2013a also showed that vrt could increase the maize root system leading to improved activity of the maize leaf protective enzyme system and reducing membrane lipid peroxidation thus showing significant drought resistance in conclusion these studies on photosynthetic physiological characteristics of crops all confirmed that vrt is an effective measure to improve drought resistance thereby promoting photosynthesis of crops some studies have demonstrated that tillage measures can regulate the physical and chemical properties of soil improve soil available water and nutrients and lead to enhanced plant photosynthetic capacity which promotes dry matter accumulation for crops yue et al 2022 zhai et al 2021 previous research also showed that vrt could not only optimize the soil environment and improve sws capacity but also increase soil aggregation and soil available nutrient content significantly which could promote crop growth in the whole growth seasons zhang et al 2021a 2021b 2018 similar results were found in our two year study the vrt significantly improved the dry matter accumulation rate of the pre flowering and post flowering periods and the maximum dry matter accumulation rate over the entire growth period resulting in the increase of dry matter accumulation of maize and potato under rfms figs 11 and 12 and table 3 our findings are also supported by previous studies that demonstrated that tillage practices to break up the hardpan layer of soil increased root depth and expanded active absorbance zones to better utilize soil water and nutrients in deeper soil layers which greatly promote plant growth sun et al 2019 xu et al 2019 efficient rainwater harvesting capacity is also one of the key factors promoting rapid crop growth following vrt however vrt has different effects on the occurrence of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate possibly related to the different responses of various crop species to an arid environment fick et al 1988 maize as a thermophilic crop requires higher temperatures and water consumption to promote plant growth however this region is cold and dry with average daily temperature of 6 2 c and average annual rainfall usually less than 400 mm which have negative effects on the continuation of the critical growth period of maize in our two year maize of rfms experiment vrt and st prolonged the duration of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate compared to tt and zt this may be mainly because vrt and st added the root system to absorb more water and trapped more air in the space covered by plastic film to conduct heat from the outside to improve soil temperature by loosening the 0 40 cm soil layer sarkar et al 2007 sun et al 2019 such events can alleviate low temperature and drought stress and thereby prolong the duration of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate table 3 compared with maize potato is a chimonophilous crop which requires relatively low temperatures and moisture for plant growth is more suitable for planting in cold and dry regions thus vrt and st only prolonged the duration of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate of potato under rfms in the drought year of 2016 table 3 4 4 hi and yield during the reproductive growth period improving soil water supply could reduce the risk caused by seasonal drought to help ensure efficient pollination and normal fruit filling for crops to efficiently increase grain yield fao 2002 similar results from our study provide direct support for this conclusion as the et of post flowering had a greater impact on yield than the et of pre flowering table 5 in addition compared with st and tt vrt significantly improved the hi for maize and potato of rfms in the dry year 2016 but had no effect on hi in the better precipitation year 2017 a similar pattern was found in our yield results in which vrt more obviously raised the yield of maize and potato under rfms compared with other tillage practices in the dry year 2016 table 4 this was mainly because vrt efficiently utilized sws to increase dry matter accumulation and root development in the vegetative period and the developed roots could alleviate drought stress by efficient use of rainfall and deep soil moisture this ensured normal or lower drought risk growth at tasseling and filling stages of crops when there was a seasonal drought this also allowed plants to maintain higher spad values of maize and potato which was beneficial to maintain higher photosynthetic efficiency and prolong the grain filling and tuber expanding periods songsri et al 2009 thus promoting maize grain and potato tuber yields overall vrt significantly increased maize and potato yields in rfms compared to other tillage practices especially in dry years indicating that vrt with broken plow layers and an optimized root growth environment would contribute to plants making use of water and nutrients in deep soil layers at the reproductive growth stage to increase yields sun et al 2018 tuure et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 one limitation of the current study was that we only explored the effects of vrt tillage practices on the soil water content performance of crop growth and biomass and soil water characteristics on crop yield while the photosynthetic performance and physiological indexes related to the drought stress and growth of crops in rfms remain unknown further investigation could help explain the capability of crops to combat drought more from the perspective of physiological mechanisms 5 conclusion in response to the growing problem of food security there is an urgent need to upgrade traditional tillage practices to alleviate the contradiction between crops and soil drought stress to achieve higher grain yields in the semi arid area of the loess plateau our two year experiments showed that vrt tillage practices under rfms mainly significantly reduced sws in the 0 100 cm profile at the flowering stage and in the 100 300 cm profile of maize and the 100 200 cm profile of potato at harvest stage compared with other tillage practices thus et increased for the whole growth stage and indicated that vrt promoted the utilization of deep soil water below 100 cm for maize and potato of rfms during the reproductive growth period the increase of et and the utilization of deep soil water contributed to promote crop growth directly improved chlorophyll content accelerated dry matter accumulation and prolonged the duration of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate resulting in higher wue hi and yield in addition vrt significantly improved fe and pue for maize and potato compared to other treatments which indicated that vrt improved the efficiency of precipitation preservation and utilization in rfms in the short term vrt had no significant effect on the soil water balance of rfms in the semi arid loess plateau therefore vrt tillage practices may be an effective solution to enhance yield of crops in rfms and ensure regional food security currently and in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9369,recently the technology of combining vertical rotary sub soiling vrt with ridge furrow construction with plastic film mulching system rfms has become a promising solution to improve soil water characteristics and crop yields in the semi arid loess plateau china however the effect of this technique on deep soil moisture and rainfall utilization to enhance the crop yield is unclear to investigate this two field experiments 2016 2017 were set up with maize and potato as research objects there were four tillage practices under rfms for maize 1 mvt vrt to a depth of 40 cm 2 mst sub soiling to a depth of 40 cm 3 mtt rotary tillage to a depth of 15 cm and 4 mzt zero tillage there were three tillage practices under rfms for potato 1 pvt vrt to a depth of 40 cm 2 pst sub soiling to a depth of 40 cm and 3 ptt rotary tillage to a depth of 15 cm our results showed that the vrt under rfms mainly significantly reduced soil water storage sws in the 0 100 cm profile at the flowering stage and sws in the 100 300 cm profile of maize and sws in the 100 200 cm profile of potato at the harvest stage compared with other tillage practices this increased evapotranspiration et throughout the whole growth stage and indicated that vrt promoted the utilization of deep soil water below 100 cm for maize and potato the increase of et and utilization of deep soil water contributed to promote crop growth directly improved chlorophyll content accelerated dry matter accumulation and prolonged the duration of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate resulting in higher water use efficiency wue harvest index hi and yield the results suggested that vrt under rfms improved wue by 3 5 14 6 hi by 2 8 23 85 and yield by 12 1 47 4 of maize compared to the other treatments and correspondingly by 18 9 92 3 1 6 29 6 and 24 7 156 8 for potato in addition vrt significantly improved fallow efficiency by 56 3 133 1 and precipitation use efficiency pue by 12 1 47 4 for maize and correspondingly by 101 9 272 7 and 24 7 156 8 for potato compared with other treatments these data indicated vrt can improve the efficiency of precipitation preservation and utilization in rfms overall vrt can efficiently utilize deep soil moisture and rainfall to promote crop growth under rfms thereby significantly increased maize and potato yields keywords vertical rotary sub soiling ridge furrow construction with plastic film mulching system maize potato yield semi arid loess plateau 1 introduction improving the ability of crops to use soil moisture and rainfall is a necessary means to combat drought and increase yield for crops in semi arid areas annual rainfall of 250 600 mm wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2020a however this is influenced by a variety of external factors such as tillage practices cultural methods and environment of the soil tillage layer du et al 2011 zhang et al 2020a tillage measures can regulate the top layer of the soil environment and directly influence soil physical properties such as soil porosity compactness soil bulk density and water retention wang et al 2020a xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2020a a good top layer of the soil environment can increase soil permeability and soil oxygen content promoting the growth of crop roots which benefits crops by improving their ability to use soil moisture and rainfall colombi et al 2022 dagnew et al 2015 wang et al 2020b xu et al 2019 thus the topsoil layer directly affects crop growth and yield through above and below ground effects blum and arkin 1984 zhang et al 2020a maize zea mays l and potato solanum tuberosum l are the main sources of people s daily food and the main crops in the loess plateau and are also important throughout the world in the semi arid area of the loess plateau the ridge furrow cultivation combined with plastic film mulching system rfms is commonly used to grow maize and potato in most areas zhang et al 2020a zhou et al 2012 the rfms can effectively retain precipitation decrease soil surface runoff suppress surface evaporation in the field and achieve efficient utilization of natural precipitation in dry areas to significantly improve maize and potato water use efficiency wue and increase yields li et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a zhou et al 2009 however due to the uneven distribution of natural precipitation and the resulting stunted crop development seasonal drought is a major limiting factor to yield potential of potato and maize under rfms in this region hou et al 2015 liu et al 2009 shi and shao 2000 in the semi arid loess plateau ecological system dry farmland typically employs traditional shallow tillage with plowing to a depth of about 20 cm due to long term rotary tillage the plow layer becomes weak and a plow pan forms increasing bulk density and decreasing soil porosity and field capacity thus impeding rainfall infiltration and preventing the crop from making full use of the limited deep soil moisture zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2018 the growth and development of the crop root system is blocked which also is one of the main reasons for the low rainfall utilization efficiency of crops therefore under conditions of limited and unstable rainfall effective tillage measures are needed to optimize the top layer of the soil environment so that crops can make full use of rainfall and utilize deep soil moisture to alleviate the water limitation for crop growth zero tillage zt is a mature tillage technique widely used around the world and generally applied to crops such as maize and wheat sun et al 2018 wang et al 2020b use of zt can significantly reduce soil erosion and improve soil physical and chemical properties soil fertility and farmland productivity but long term zt will increase soil bulk density and soil compaction with negative impacts on soil water storage capacity and crop yield kumar et al 2013 wang et al 2020b for rfms some tillage measures are needed to remove loose soil in order to appropriately establish the ridge furrow structure however traditional tillage tt is rotating tillage to a depth of 20 cm without breaking the plow layer table 2 seriously hindering the movement of moisture and nutrients and growth of crop roots and over the long run results in the loss of soil nutrients and moisture hamza et al 2005 shi et al 2010 tian et al 2016 this leads to soil quality decline and inability to coping with seasonal drought stress so that the potential of crop production in the region cannot be effectively exploited hou et al 2015 sun et al 2018 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a sub soiling tillage st table 2 can break the plow layer by deep plowing improve soil water storage capacity and crop yield and in the long term increase soil nutrient enrichment in surface soil compared with tt wang et al 2020b xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 the st only breaks the plow layer without smashing the soil vertically so it fails to improve soil water characteristics and thus does not improve soil water supply capacity zhang et al 2018 the advantages of tt also have been ignored in scientific research in that tt can effectively reduce weeds by more than 50 compared to zt and the burial of residue is conducive to increasing nutrition in deep soil peigné et al 2018 in order to solve these agricultural production problems a new improved vertical rotary sub soiling tillage measure vrt has emerged in china in recent years zhai et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a differing from st and tt vrt fig 1 and table 2 uses a high speed rotating head to smash the soil vertically with a tillage depth of more than 40 cm and also does not change the vertical layering of the soil zhang et al 2020a this not only helps retain internal soil water and nutrients of the top layer and reduce weeds but also significantly decreases soil bulk density wilting point and compaction increases the content of soil aggregates total soil porosity and capillary porosity soil saturation moisture content and capillary moisture content as well as reduces weeds and improves soil available moisture wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2018 thus vrt could improve the soil water characteristics and optimize the topsoil layer making it conducive to rainfall infiltration and promotes well developed root systems which benefits crops to utilize soil water and improve their drought resistance the technology of combining rfms with vrt has been applied in the central region of the loess plateau at present it is mainly applied to cultivation of potato maize and some traditional chinese medicine crops and the yield increase exceeds 10 with the effect more obvious in dry years qin et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a however current research concerning vrt to promote yield increase mainly focuses on soil physical properties soil water characteristics and changes in soil total water content qin et al 2019 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2020a no detailed available reports have focused on the effects of vrt on rainfall utilization and deep soil water below 100 cm in the field therefore different tillage measures were combined with rfms and maize and potato were used as test crops in this study for experiments in the semi arid area of the loess plateau in 2016 and 2017 the objectives of this study were 1 to determine whether vrt significantly uses soil moisture under 100 cm in the process of growing crops 2 to explore whether vrt can improve rainfall storage efficiency and rainfall utilization efficiency in rfms 3 to clarify the effects of vrt on chlorophyll content and dry matter accumulation characteristics in the growth process of maize and potato and 4 to explore the effect of vrt to enhance crops yield of rfms by analyzing the comprehensive relationship between rainfall utilization changes in deep soil water dry matter accumulation characteristics and chlorophyll content the results are expected to provide theoretical support for the extension of the technology of combining vrt with rfms in northwest china to ensure regional food security 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment sites our field experiment was conducted at the dingxi experimental station of the gansu academy of agricultural sciences 35 35 n 104 36 e northwest loess plateau in central gansu province china over two years of 2016 2017 the site represents a typical rainfed semi arid area with an elevation of 1970 m annual rainfall of 415 mm and mean annual temperature of 6 2 c about 70 of the precipitation is concentrated in june

rainfall for potato from sowing april 20 to harvesting october 10 was 353 5 mm and for maize from planting april 20 to harvesting october 15 was 365 1 mm from the perspective of rainfall during the crop growth period 2016 was a severe drought year and 2017 was a normal year 2 2 ridge furrow and plastic film mulching 2 2 1 maize double ridge furrow and planting with plastic mulching the schematic diagram of maize double ridge furrow and planting with plastic mulching is shown in fig 3a the core configuration of this system is alternating ridges and furrows in this study each ridge furrow unit comprised a wide and low ridge 0 7 m in width and 0 10 m in height and a narrow and high ridge 0 4 m in width and 0 15 m in height and the naturally occurring furrows at the junction between the two ridge types could be used for collecting water after preparing the furrows transparent polyethylene film 0 01 mm thick and 1 2 m wide was spread on the plot two pieces of plastic film were connected at the mid line between wide and narrow ridges and soil was spread over the film to firmly fix the joints at the time of plastic mulching small holes of diameter about 0 01 cm were opened at the bottom of the furrow every 0 5 m which was conducive to concentrate rainfall and entry into the soil maize seeds were planted in the furrows 2 2 2 potato micro furrows on ridges and planting with plastic mulching the schematic diagram of potato micro furrows on ridges and planting with plastic mulching is shown in fig 3b in this study each ridge was 0 6 m in width and 0 15 m in height and the micro ditch within the ridge was 0 10 m in width and 0 05 m in depth upon preparing of the furrows black polyethylene film 0 01 mm thick and 1 2 m wide was spread on the plot two pieces of plastic film were connected at the mid line between wide and narrow ridges and soil was spread over the film to firmly fix the joints then small holes were placed every 0 5 m in each micro ditch for rainwater infiltration potato seeds were planted on top of the micro ditch of the ridge on either side 2 3 experimental design and field management two test crops were used maize variety xianyu335 and potato variety longshu10 maize was cultivated by double ridge furrow and planting with plastic mulching planting method fig 3a and with four tillage treatments 1 zero tillage mzt 2 traditional tillage mtt 3 sub soiling tillage mst and 4 vertically rotary sub soiling mvt details of the tillage treatment procedures are shown in table 2 the maize experiment was arranged in a randomized design with three replicates and the area of each plot was 15 m 7 m chemical fertilizers of urea n 46 0 diammonium phosphate n 18 0 p2o5 46 0 and potassium chloride k2o 55 were spread on the maize field at 150 120 and 45 kg ha 1 respectively with no topdressing during the whole maize growth period maize seeds were planted in furrows every 30 cm and row by row sowing was staggered fig 3a at 60 000 plants ha 1 by human powered seeder on 21 april 2016 and 20 april 2017 potato was cultivated using micro furrows on ridges and planting with plastic mulching planting method fig 3b with three tillage treatments 1 traditional tillage ptt 2 sub soiling tillage pst and 3 vertical rotary sub soiling pvt details of the tillage treatment operation procedures are shown in table 2 the potato experiment was arranged in a randomized design with three replicates and the area of each plot was 20 m 12 m chemical fertilizers of urea n 46 0 diammonium phosphate n 18 0 p2o5 46 0 and potassium chloride k2o 55 were spread on the potato field at 90 60 and 60 kg ha 1 before sowing respectively and 60 kg ha 1 urea was top dressed at the flowering stage by machine potato seeds were planted on top of the micro ditch of the ridge on either side every 30 cm and row by row sowing was staggered fig 3b at 60 000 plants ha 1 by manual seeder on 20 april 2016 and 20 april 2017 in this study no irrigation was applied during the whole growth period for maize and potato and field grass and insect pests were artificially controlled 2 4 measurements and methods 2 4 1 soil water storage sws according to previous studies in our test area zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b the growth process of maize and potato is closely related to the change of soil moisture in 0 300 and 0 200 cm soil layers respectively therefore soil gravimetric water content sgc of the maize field was measured at 20 cm increments to a depth of 300 cm and samples were randomly collected once from the furrows in each plot at sowing flowering and harvesting stages the sgc of the potato field was measured at 20 cm increments to a depth of 200 cm and was randomly collected once from the micro ditch on the ridge in each plot at sowing flowering and harvesting stages for each maize and potato plot sgc was determined by averaging the value from three random sampling points central between two plants before the ridges and furrows for each tillage practice were formed soil bulk density was determined for the soil profiles for maize 0 300 cm depth and for potato 0 200 cm depth using three random sampling points the soil water storage sws mm was calculated using the following formula sws sgc b d where b is soil bulk density g cm 3 and d is soil depth mm 2 4 2 fallow efficiency fe the fe is the retention rate of soil of natural precipitation during the fallow period calculated using the following formula fe swss swsh δpf where swss is sws before sowing of crops in the current season swsh is sws after harvest of the previous crop and δpf is rainfall during the fallow period 2 4 3 evapotranspiration et the experiment was carried out under rainfed conditions and no irrigation was provided during the crop growing periods our site observation showed no runoff in the experimental field as the single maximum rainfall was basically less than 30 mm and so surface runoff was ignored thus et mm was calculated using the following formula et δsws δp where δsws mm is the difference in sws between the beginning and the end of the measured stage and δp mm is total rainfall amount during the measured stage 2 4 4 chlorophyll content five maize plants were randomly selected from each plot and the second fully opened leaf from the topmost of each plant was sampled at the jointing flowering and filling stages between 9 00 11 30 a m on a sunny day five potato plants were randomly selected from each plot and the topmost leaf of the penultimate branch of each plant was sampled at the squaring flowering and tuber expanding stages between 9 00 11 30 a m on a sunny day all these leaves were used to measure chlorophyll content using a portable spad 502 plus konica minolta inc tokyo japan 2 4 5 dry matter accumulation every 15 20 days after emergence of maize and potato three plants with uniform growth were randomly selected from each plot leaving the below ground parts and then dried in an oven at 75 c until constant weight dry matter accumulation per ha was calculated using planting density 2 4 6 characteristics of dry matter accumulation growth rates of dry matter accumulation of the whole growth v avg pre flowering v a and post flowering v b periods all kg ha 1 d 1 were calculated using the following formulas v avg m t v a ma ta v b m ma t ta where m kg ha 1 is dry matter accumulation of the harvesting stage t is the total number of days of the whole growth period ma kg ha 1 is dry matter accumulation of the flowering stage and ta is the total number of days from sowing to flowering stage logistic equations can effectively simulate the crop growth process andersen et al 2007 logistic equations were used to fit the relevant parameters with time as the independent variable and dry matter accumulation as the dependent variable and then the equations of dry matter accumulation for maize and potato under different tillage measures were obtained finally logistic equations were used to calculate the maximum dry matter accumulation rate v max kg ha 1 d 1 and the days when the maximum accumulation rate appeared δt for different treatments 2 4 7 yield harvest index hi precipitation use efficiency pue and wue after the crop was harvested the yield of each plot was weighed and converted into a hectare yield y kg ha 1 here y refers to the grain yield of maize and tuber yield of potato the hi was determined as the ratio of the grain yield relative to the biomass yield the pue and wue both kg ha 1 mm 1 were calculated using the following equations pue y p wue y ets where ets mm is et for the whole growing season and p mm is total rainfall during the whole growth period 2 5 statistical analysis the software spss 19 0 ibm spss statistics 19 0 usa was used for data analysis of variance anova and correlation the average outcomes for each treatment were compared using the least significant difference test lsd this treatment differences were considered statistically significant if p 0 05 the excel 365 software microsoft office usa was used for graphical presentation of the results 3 results 3 1 sws effects of sws on different tillage practices in the 0 300 cm soil layer of maize in different periods are shown in fig 4 the two years of the maize experiment showed that at flowering stage compared with mst mtt and mzt the mvt significantly reduced sws in the 0 100 cm soil layer by 3 3 35 9 9 7 15 2 and 9 1 10 1 mm respectively and correspondingly in the 100 200 cm layer by 5 6 5 9 10 5 9 9 and 3 5 9 1 mm fig 4b and e at harvest stage sws of mvt in the 0 40 cm soil layer was significantly lower than that of mst mtt and mzt by 10 1 9 5 4 8 9 9 and 12 9 14 6 mm respectively and correspondingly in the 100 300 cm layer by 27 1 36 1 19 6 36 8 and 22 7 52 8 mm fig 4c and f at sowing stage in 2017 compared with mst mtt and mzt the sws of mvt in the 0 100 cm soil layer was significantly increased by 20 2 18 3 and 22 7 mm respectively fig 4d effects of sws on different tillage practices in the 0 300 cm soil layer of potato in different periods are shown in fig 5 at flowering stage sws of pvt in the 0 100 cm soil layer was significantly decreased by 32 1 and 38 3 mm compared with pst and ptt in 2016 fig 5b respectively for pvt in the 0 100 cm soil layer sws was 24 11 mm lower than in ptt and in the 100 200 cm soil layer sws was 7 3 and 8 8 mm lower than in pst and ptt in 2017 respectively fig 5e at harvesting stage sws of pvt in the 0 100 cm layer was significantly reduced by 51 2 and 36 1 mm in 2016 respectively compared with pst and ptt fig 5c in 2017 there was no significant difference between pvt and pst fig 5f due to sufficient rainfall after flowering which effectively supplemented the upper sws under deep tillage treatment at the harvest stage of both years the sws of pvt in the 100 200 cm layer was 19 9 27 1 and 4 9 19 6 mm lower than that of pst and ptt respectively fig 5c and f in 2017 at sowing stage there was no significant difference in sws for the 0 200 cm soil layer for different treatments fig 5d 3 2 fe there were significant differences in rainfall retention efficiency of potato and maize in the fallow period under different tillage treatments fig 6a and b for maize compared with mst mtt and mzt the fe of mvt treatment was significantly increased by 133 1 56 3 and 76 8 respectively fig 6a in the potato experiment the fe of pvt treatment was significantly increased by 272 7 and 101 9 compared with pst and ptt respectively fig 6b 3 3 et the rainfall and et in pre and post flowering periods and whole growth periods of maize and potato under different tillage treatments are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively two years of field experiments showed that mvt significantly increased the et of maize in the pre flowering period except for mst in 2017 fig 7a there was no significant difference in et of maize under each treatment when rainfall was only 62 6 mm in the post flowering period in 2016 in 2017 when the post flowering period rainfall was 203 6 mm mvt treatment significantly increased et compared with other treatments fig 7b there were no significant differences in et in the entire growth period among mvt mst and mtt but et for the entire growth period was significantly higher than for mvt than mzt with increases of 10 8 and 13 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 7c the two year potato field experiment showed that the pvt treatment had the highest et in the pre flowering period but et did not significantly differ in the post flowering period among treatments when precipitation was high 233 5 mm in 2017 fig 8a and b the et in the entire growth period of pvt was significantly higher than for pst and ptt by 33 5 and 24 0 in 2016 respectively but there were no significant differences among treatments in 2017 fig 8c these results suggest that vrt tillage practices promote et of maize and potato under rfms especially in dry years but the difference in et is closely related to precipitation and precipitation distribution 3 4 chlorophyll content the chlorophyll content spad value at different growth stages of maize and potato under different tillage treatments are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively the two year maize field experiment showed that mvt had the highest spad value at the jointing flowering and filling stages with significantly improved spad values by 16 6 and 15 5 at the flowering stage and 17 9 and 20 1 at filling stage compared to mst and mtt respectively in 2017 only at the filling stage was mvt significantly higher by 8 5 compared to mzt fig 9 two years of study on potato showed that pvt had the highest spad value at squaring flowering and tuber expanding stages and the spad value was 21 2 and 23 5 higher than that of pst and ptt at the tuber expanding stage respectively fig 10 the spad value of pvt was 18 6 higher at the flowering stage of 2016 compared other treatments generally vrt resulted in higher chlorophyll content in the post flowering period for maize and potato with rfms 3 5 dry matter accumulation with the advance of growth period the dry matter accumulation of maize and potato under different tillage treatments increased gradually figs 11 and 12 after two years of the experiment the dry matter accumulation of mvt at flowering stage was 5 4 17 6 and 26 1 higher than that of mst mtt and mzt respectively and correspondingly at harvest stage was 11 7 11 7 and 25 2 higher fig 11 two years of study on potato showed that dry matter accumulation of pvt at the flowering stage was 29 4 and 29 9 higher than that of pst and pzt respectively and correspondingly at harvest stage was 34 8 and 29 3 higher fig 12 in addition compared with 2017 2016 was a more arid year but the difference in post flowering dry matter accumulation of maize and potato under rfms treated with vrt in 2016 was more obvious than that of other treatments 3 6 characteristics of dry matter accumulation there were significant effects of different tillage treatments on characteristics of dry matter accumulation during growth periods for maize and potato table 3 the logistic regression equation had r2 0 9 thus it effectively reflected the change in dry matter accumulation of maize and potato under different tillage treatments andersen et al 2007 compared with other treatments the growth rate of dry matter accumulation in the mvt treatment in pre and post flowering periods of maize was 14 5 and 17 9 higher than that of other tillage treatments respectively the growth rate of dry matter accumulation of the pvt treatment in pre and post flowering periods of potato was 30 6 and 24 5 higher than for other tillage treatments respectively compared with other treatments the average and maximum growth rates of dry matter accumulation in the maize growth period under mvt were significantly increased by 16 2 and 14 4 respectively similarly the average and maximum growth rate of potato dry matter accumulation during the growth period under pvt were significantly increased by 29 3 and 31 4 respectively in addition compared with the tillage practices tt and zt vrt and st prolonged the duration of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate for maize of rfms in both years but only prolonged this duration for potato in the drought year 2016 3 7 yield and hi the vrt tillage practices mvt and pvt improved maize and potato yields table 4 compared with other tillage practices the maize yield of mvt was significantly increased by 29 8 in 2016 and 16 3 in 2017 on average the corresponding significant increases for potato yield under pvt were 102 3 and 32 8 thus the yield increases from vrt tillage practices for maize and potato were greater in the dry year of 2016 compared with other tillage practices vrt tillage practices contributed to the increase of maize and potato under rfms hi in dry years 2016 but there was no significant difference in hi among tillage treatments when rainfall was relatively good in 2017 table 4 3 8 pue and wue the mvt increased pue and wue of maize fig 13 the wue of mvt did not significantly differ with that of mst in 2016 but was significantly higher than for mtt and mzt the wue of mvt did not significantly differ with that of mst and mtt in 2017 but significantly increased by 9 7 compared with zt compared with mst mtt and mzt the pue of mvt was 12 5 23 7 and 35 7 higher respectively the pvt increased pue and wue of potato fig 14 the pvt significantly increased wue of pst and ptt by 92 3 and 19 2 in 2016 respectively and correspondingly by 18 9 and 26 6 in 2017 compared with pst and ptt the pue of pvt was significantly increased by 90 8 and 44 4 respectively hence vrt tillage practices improved wue and pue for maize and potato of rfms and this effect was greater in the drought year of 2016 the ranges of increases from vrt tillage practices for pue were significantly greater than for wue 3 9 correlation analysis precipitation had the highest correlation with the characteristics of dry matter accumulation yield hi pue and wue table 5 dry matter accumulation was significantly correlated with et the etb had a greater effect on yield than eta these results showed that rainfall was the main factor affecting yield and the main reason for increased yield of maize and potato the technology of combining vrt with rfms promoted et the key factors for achieving high yield and wue were water distribution and improved pue increasing soil water supply after flowering was more beneficial to increasing yield 4 discussion 4 1 sws and et the yield and wue of maize and potato in the semi arid area of the loess plateau have been shown increase effectively by rfms hou et al 2015 zhou et al 2012 2009 however in this region the effective rainfall during the growth period of maize and potato does not usually meet the water requirement for normal growth additionally due to the warming effect of plastic film mulching crops grow faster in the vegetative growth period consume soil moisture rapidly and often face the problem of rainfall shortage in the later growth period which intensifies the degree of drought stress and reduces yields hou et al 2015 zhou et al 2012 secondly shallow tillage resulted in a shallow soil surface layer increased soil bulk density and decreased soil porosity giving less space for root growth and poor soil aeration during the vegetative growth period which is not conducive to utilization of deep soil water to resist drought stress during low rainfall periods ball et al 2003 sun et al 2018 tracy et al 2011 some natural phenomena give us inspiration some saprophytes like earthworms loosen the soil structure increase soil aggregation and soil oxygen content so that plants can distribute more photosynthate to root systems and their better developed root systems can absorb soil water and nutrients more efficiently colombi et al 2022 at the same time practical research guan et al 2015 wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2021b shows that loosening soil by tillage measures can increase soil water capacity permanent wilting point and the water supply capacity which improves drought resistance of crops zhang et al 2021b and zhang et al 2018 showed that vrt could significantly reduce soil bulk density and soil wilting coefficient of the 0 40 cm layer increase soil porosity and saturation which significantly increased soil available water storage in potato compared with tt and st in our study vrt mainly significantly reduced the sws of the 0 100 cm soil layer at the flowering stage and the 100 300 cm layer of maize and the 100 200 cm layer of potato at the harvest stage resulting in the increase of et in pre flowering and post flowering periods compared to other tillage practices under rfms this phenomenon was more pronounced in the dry year 2016 there may be two reasons for this phenomenon one reason may be that vrt optimized the soil surface environment and improved the soil water supply characteristics increased soil porosity and more soil available water storage which was conducive to root growth in the period of crop nutrition zhai et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the developed root system promoted the full absorption of soil water and utilized deep soil water for crop growth when there was insufficient rainfall guan et al 2015 the other reason is that soil water declined in deeper layers and led to the water supply layer moving up which was especially true for the dry year our findings are supported by previous studies and this phenomenon may result from the movement of water and air under drought stress together these results suggest that vrt promotes crop depletion of deep soil water to resist drought stress in crop growing season however li et al 2013b showed that vrt did not increase et in the huang huai hai region of china mainly due to sufficient rainfall and lack of drought stress 4 2 precipitation preservation and utilization the effective use of rainfall is becoming increasingly important for improving yield and wue in semi arid areas table 5 also showed that precipitation was the factor most closely influencing yield the rainfall retention efficiency during the fallow period is closely related to the tillage practices during the crop growth season sun et al 2018 wang et al 2020b and improving the absorption and infiltration capacity of soil to rainfall and reducing surface runoff and evaporation loss are effective ways to solve the problem of water shortage in dryland agriculture tuure et al 2021 wang et al 2020b it has been reported that loose soil and improve soil water characteristics could speed up rainfall infiltration into the soil and reduce the exposure of rainfall on the surface and the retention time of shallow soil sun et al 2018 wang et al 2020b when coupled with the strong rainfall collecting capacity of rfms this water conservation effect is further enhanced we had also similar results fig 6 with vrt and tt increasing fe by better loosening the soil compared with st and zt at the same time the vrt increasing the depth of smashing the soil vertically is beneficial to increasing infiltration of rainwater deep into the soil profile and enhances capacity to retain rainwater thereby further improving fe compared to st thus vrt may also be indirectly beneficial for retaining rainwater efficiently in rfms during the crop growth season in addition vrt preserved soil moisture and nutrients better by vertically loosening soil and not turning it zhang et al 2021b the sws in the early growth stage is critical for maximizing grain yield wang et al 2020a which requires rainfall during the fallow period to supplement the water consumed by crops during the growing season sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 our results showed that vrt promoted soil water consumption during the entire growth period of crops under rfms and there was very little difference in sws among vrt tt and st at sowing throughout the two year experiment on maize and potato zhang et al 2020a also showed that vrt had no significant effect on soil water balance in the semi arid loess plateau in addition compared with other tillage measures vrt treatment helped improve wue and pue for maize and potato of rfms and increased pue more than wue figs 13 and 14 which also indicated that vrt improved sws capacity through improved rainfall infiltration and protection ability for crops under rfms sun et al 2018 also noted that both sub soiling and deep plowing could improve crop yield and wue increments especially in dry years mainly due to increases in rainfall storage levels therefore vrt has high rainfall conservation efficiency and utilization efficiency in rfms 4 3 chlorophyll content and characteristics of dry matter accumulation the chlorophyll content of plant leaves was closely related to the degree of water stress songsri et al 2009 our two year study showed that vrt most significantly increased the spad values at maize filling and potato tuber expanding stages compared with tt and st and significantly increased the spad values at the maize and potato flowering stages in the relatively dry 2016 figs 9 and 10 this may be mainly because the ability of plants to absorb phosphorus and nitrogen is weakened with the increase of drought stress during the post flowering period for tt and st and this would reduce their ability to produce chlorophyll thus reducing their chlorophyll content ahmed 2011 romero et al 2004 however in our maize experiment there was no significant difference between spad values of vrt and zt during the growth period of 2016 fig 10 this was mainly because the low growth rate of zt resulted in lower soil water consumption and the relatively good soil water condition made the plant less subject to water stress wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2017 in semi arid areas the chlorophyll content of plants is closely related to the ability of plant roots to obtain soil water and the soil water status which shows that the higher the chlorophyll content of the plant the better it is able to resist drought romero et al 2004 songsri et al 2009 the drought resistance can be enhanced by increasing the ability of plants to extract water from soil songsri et al 2009 enlarging the plant roots could improve the plant s ability to extract water from soil making it better able to cope with drought conditions ahmed 2011 li et al 2013a studies showed that vrt could significantly improve soil water characteristics and increase crop root biomass li et al 2013a zhai et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 and our study showed that vrt decreased sws of the deep soil layer at the harvesting stage and increased et thus allowing vrt to maintain a higher spad value in the post flowering period compared with other treatments in northeast china li et al 2013a also showed that vrt could increase the maize root system leading to improved activity of the maize leaf protective enzyme system and reducing membrane lipid peroxidation thus showing significant drought resistance in conclusion these studies on photosynthetic physiological characteristics of crops all confirmed that vrt is an effective measure to improve drought resistance thereby promoting photosynthesis of crops some studies have demonstrated that tillage measures can regulate the physical and chemical properties of soil improve soil available water and nutrients and lead to enhanced plant photosynthetic capacity which promotes dry matter accumulation for crops yue et al 2022 zhai et al 2021 previous research also showed that vrt could not only optimize the soil environment and improve sws capacity but also increase soil aggregation and soil available nutrient content significantly which could promote crop growth in the whole growth seasons zhang et al 2021a 2021b 2018 similar results were found in our two year study the vrt significantly improved the dry matter accumulation rate of the pre flowering and post flowering periods and the maximum dry matter accumulation rate over the entire growth period resulting in the increase of dry matter accumulation of maize and potato under rfms figs 11 and 12 and table 3 our findings are also supported by previous studies that demonstrated that tillage practices to break up the hardpan layer of soil increased root depth and expanded active absorbance zones to better utilize soil water and nutrients in deeper soil layers which greatly promote plant growth sun et al 2019 xu et al 2019 efficient rainwater harvesting capacity is also one of the key factors promoting rapid crop growth following vrt however vrt has different effects on the occurrence of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate possibly related to the different responses of various crop species to an arid environment fick et al 1988 maize as a thermophilic crop requires higher temperatures and water consumption to promote plant growth however this region is cold and dry with average daily temperature of 6 2 c and average annual rainfall usually less than 400 mm which have negative effects on the continuation of the critical growth period of maize in our two year maize of rfms experiment vrt and st prolonged the duration of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate compared to tt and zt this may be mainly because vrt and st added the root system to absorb more water and trapped more air in the space covered by plastic film to conduct heat from the outside to improve soil temperature by loosening the 0 40 cm soil layer sarkar et al 2007 sun et al 2019 such events can alleviate low temperature and drought stress and thereby prolong the duration of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate table 3 compared with maize potato is a chimonophilous crop which requires relatively low temperatures and moisture for plant growth is more suitable for planting in cold and dry regions thus vrt and st only prolonged the duration of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate of potato under rfms in the drought year of 2016 table 3 4 4 hi and yield during the reproductive growth period improving soil water supply could reduce the risk caused by seasonal drought to help ensure efficient pollination and normal fruit filling for crops to efficiently increase grain yield fao 2002 similar results from our study provide direct support for this conclusion as the et of post flowering had a greater impact on yield than the et of pre flowering table 5 in addition compared with st and tt vrt significantly improved the hi for maize and potato of rfms in the dry year 2016 but had no effect on hi in the better precipitation year 2017 a similar pattern was found in our yield results in which vrt more obviously raised the yield of maize and potato under rfms compared with other tillage practices in the dry year 2016 table 4 this was mainly because vrt efficiently utilized sws to increase dry matter accumulation and root development in the vegetative period and the developed roots could alleviate drought stress by efficient use of rainfall and deep soil moisture this ensured normal or lower drought risk growth at tasseling and filling stages of crops when there was a seasonal drought this also allowed plants to maintain higher spad values of maize and potato which was beneficial to maintain higher photosynthetic efficiency and prolong the grain filling and tuber expanding periods songsri et al 2009 thus promoting maize grain and potato tuber yields overall vrt significantly increased maize and potato yields in rfms compared to other tillage practices especially in dry years indicating that vrt with broken plow layers and an optimized root growth environment would contribute to plants making use of water and nutrients in deep soil layers at the reproductive growth stage to increase yields sun et al 2018 tuure et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 one limitation of the current study was that we only explored the effects of vrt tillage practices on the soil water content performance of crop growth and biomass and soil water characteristics on crop yield while the photosynthetic performance and physiological indexes related to the drought stress and growth of crops in rfms remain unknown further investigation could help explain the capability of crops to combat drought more from the perspective of physiological mechanisms 5 conclusion in response to the growing problem of food security there is an urgent need to upgrade traditional tillage practices to alleviate the contradiction between crops and soil drought stress to achieve higher grain yields in the semi arid area of the loess plateau our two year experiments showed that vrt tillage practices under rfms mainly significantly reduced sws in the 0 100 cm profile at the flowering stage and in the 100 300 cm profile of maize and the 100 200 cm profile of potato at harvest stage compared with other tillage practices thus et increased for the whole growth stage and indicated that vrt promoted the utilization of deep soil water below 100 cm for maize and potato of rfms during the reproductive growth period the increase of et and the utilization of deep soil water contributed to promote crop growth directly improved chlorophyll content accelerated dry matter accumulation and prolonged the duration of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate resulting in higher wue hi and yield in addition vrt significantly improved fe and pue for maize and potato compared to other treatments which indicated that vrt improved the efficiency of precipitation preservation and utilization in rfms in the short term vrt had no significant effect on the soil water balance of rfms in the semi arid loess plateau therefore vrt tillage practices may be an effective solution to enhance yield of crops in rfms and ensure regional food security currently and in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
