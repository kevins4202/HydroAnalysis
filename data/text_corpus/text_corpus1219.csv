6095,drought index is an important tool for drought research the development of a reliable and simple integrated drought index is a critical step of current drought monitoring and risk assessments the gringorten point position formula was adopted to develop a trivariate standardized drought index tsdi based on precipitation meteorology runoff hydrology and soil moisture agriculture information in this study this index can be used to characterize droughts from an integrated meteorological hydrological and agricultural point of view and explore drought evolution characteristics the possible driving forces of drought were explored by examining the associations between sunspot activities and large scale atmospheric circulation anomalies a typical loess plateau watershed the wei river basin wrb was selected as a case study results showed that 1 the tsdi is better at characterizing real drought conditions than other traditional single variable indices although it is similar to the parametric trivariate drought index based on copula function serinaldi and grimaldi 2007 yang et al 2018 it is much simpler to calculate and more suitable for characterizing drought of different regions 2 the value of integrated drought index gradually increased in all areas and its change point occurred in the early 1970s and 1990s mainly due to variations in runoff 3 the evolution of the integrated drought appeared to be strongly influenced by sunspot activities and abnormal atmospheric circulation factors where sunspots activities are dominant this study provides a valuable reference for the development of an integrated drought index which might be applied to local drought monitoring preparedness and mitigation keywords drought integrated drought index nonparametric distribution trivariate empirical frequency the gringorten point position formula 1 introduction drought is a kind of natural disaster with extremely detrimental effects which occurs frequently affecting a wide range of areas fang et al 2019a b c huang et al 2019 it not only affects agricultural production but can also hinder economic development ultimately leading to social instability ren et al 2019 china is drought prone since ancient times recently it has evolved in a big agricultural and developing country in this context drought detection and prevention are undoubtedly becoming priorities for the chinese government huang et al 2019 the 21st century environment is being threatened by global climate change zhao et al 2019 han et al 2019a b these alterations are accelerating the global water cycle milly et al 2002 and increasing the frequency of extreme hydrological events e g droughts and floods wang et al 2011 since the last century air temperature has increased by 0 85 c ipcc 2013 under the influence of global climate changes and human induced greenhouse gas emission consequently the world has been suffering severe droughts during the last decade whose frequency is expected to increase in many regions huang et al 2019 drought events have seriously affected the daily life of local residents and impeded the growth of crops in addition they significantly hindered industrial production and development eventually impacting national economic development and public health security sheffield and wood 2008 mussá et al 2015 hence it is urgent and necessary to conduct in depth research on this topic drought indices have been widely applied by drought researches being on the basis of numerous drought investigations and playing an important role in the assessment of drought parameters kao and govindaraju 2010 huang et al 2016a b a large number of drought indices has been developed in order to characterize different types of droughts shukla and wood 2008 hao and aghakouchak 2013 han et al 2019b which provide reliable indices for the realization of drought risk assessments and the formulation of disaster mitigation strategies droughts are generally divided into four categories meteorological droughts resulting from a precipitation deficit hydrologic droughts resulting from insufficient runoff agricultural droughts resulting from a shortage in soil moisture and socio economic droughts resulting from insufficient water supply with respect to water demand guo et al 2019a b the four types of droughts present some common characteristics huang et al 2017a as a matter of fact one type of drought can evolve into another type huang et al 2017a for example meteorological droughts may transform into hydrological or agricultural droughts wu et al 2018a b a variety of indices have been developed for these four types of droughts based on different elements and each with its own advantages and defects early drought indices were based on a single variable like the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 the standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 and the standardized soil moisture index ssi hao and aghakouchak 2013 which have all been extensively used in drought monitoring among them the spi has been especially applied to identification of early drought occurrences other drought indices like the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 the self calibrating pdsi sc pdsi liu et al 2017 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 have been also widely used nevertheless investigations based on a single variable are increasingly considered unreliable since droughts are influenced by multiple variables e g precipitation runoff soil moisture hao and aghakouchak 2013 kao and govindaraju 2010 mishra and singh 2010 in fact drought events are attributed to multiple elements of water shortages over different periods of time yang et al 2018 several integrated drought indices have been proposed with the aim of investigating drought events in a more integrated manner svoboda et al 2002 huang et al 2015 for example the linear weighted average was adopted to blend several drought indices the us drought monitor usdm developed by svoboda et al 2002 can contain information on climate indices numerical models and inputs from regional and local experts the aggregated drought index developed by keyantash and dracup 2004 can aggregate all the selected variables into a single time series through a correlation based principal component analysis pca however both of these aggregated indices have some weaknesses first pairs of drought variables are characterized by nonlinear relationships second the assumptions of the pca are not always met in real situations overall the use of these two methods may lead to information distortion subsequently the bivariate copula based joint index proposed by kao and govindaraju 2010 has been applied for the quantification of drought characters based on precipitation and streamflow information this type of drought indices is multivariate and hence more effective than those previously mentioned however this joint distribution method becomes too complicated to allow a rapid and effective calculating process of dependence structures among variables when it involves more than three variables based on the concept of copulas hao and aghakouchak 2013 developed the multivariate standardized drought index msdi this index is calculated based on the joint cumulative probability of precipitation and soil moisture content thus it is able to characterize drought conditions based on either of these two parameters unfortunately this index includes only meteorological and agricultural drought information among the four main types of droughts only three of them can be physically described in order to improve their characterization researchers should consider not only meteorological and agricultural droughts but also hydrological drought recently a trivariate drought index has been proposed by yang et al 2018 via employing copulas combining meteorological hydrological and agricultural variables which is referred to as nonparametric multivariate standardized drought index nmdi copulas strongly rely on the assumption that data samples follow a particular probability density function pdf fang et al 2019a b huang et al 2016a b however the given pdfs usually fail to reflect real drought conditions exactly huang et al 2016a leading to deviations from reality in addition the use of copulas involves many tedious steps and complex calculations therefore it is necessary to explore simpler ways to obtain a reliable and effective integrated drought index the empirical frequency plotting position formula proposed by gringorten 1963 proved to be suitable for the fitting of hydrological time series hence it has been widely applied to hydrological frequency analyses hao and aghakouchak 2014 huang et al 2016a b since it reflects a nonparametric empirical frequency distribution it can skilfully avoid fitting optimized parametric distribution this unbiased plotting position formula which works without following any specific distributions may solve the problems mentioned above in brief the main objectives of this study were to 1 develop a simple but effective tsdi verifying its reliability and superiority 2 analyse the temporal spatial evolution of the tsdi in the wei river basin wrb and 3 explore the driving forces of the evolution characteristics of droughts from an integrated perspective 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the wrb which represents a typical loess plateau watershed in an arid semi arid region of china was selected as the study area for this study fig 1 located between 33 5 37 5 n and 103 5 110 5 e the wei river is the largest tributary of the yellow river liu et al 2019 the altitude of the wrb gradually increases from southeast to northwest the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation over this area is very uneven which is one of the main triggers for the frequent droughts and waterlogging disasters in the region the wrb is currently one of the most important agricultural e g grain cotton and food oil and industrial production bases in china located near the border of western china it plays an important role in the development of this region liu et al 2018 notably under the joint influence of climate and human activities precipitation and runoff have decreased in the wrb huang et al 2014 2017b liu et al 2018 therefore it is of important significance to study the evolution characteristics of drought in an integrated manner in the wrb for its sustainable development of social economy 2 2 data source the digital data were collected from seven regions of the wrb referring to the river system and administrative division beidao bd linjiacun ljc xianyang xy zhangjiashan zjs lintong lt huaxian hx zhuangtou zt the monthly precipitation data obtained from 21 meteorological stations in the wrb and its surroundings were utilized as follows fig 1 the monthly runoff data relative to linjiacun zhangjiashan huaxian and other 4 hydrological stations in the wrb were obtained from the hydrologic manual the huaxian station is located in the lower reach of the basin and its catchment area accounts for 97 16 of the entire basin hence the total runoff registered at the huaxian and zhuangtou stations can be considered approximately equal to the runoff of the whole basin in the study area soil moisture data are very limited for in situ observations due to difficulties during the data collection process the monthly soil moisture data for depths about 10 cm had to be simulated using a variable infiltration capacity vic model sure it is well known that uncertainties exist in hydrological simulations nevertheless the vic model performed well in china with a high resolution of 0 25 0 25 because it employed a high density of meteorological observations from the china meteorological administration cma as model inputs and adopted streamflow observations from the hydrology bureau of china hbc for model calibration zhang et al 2014 the accuracy of soil moisture in this study area simulated by vic model can be guaranteed wu et al 2011 leng et al 2015 huang et al 2017b the considered meteorological hydrological and agricultural data covered the period between january 1960 and december 2010 moreover each time series included 612 specimens the agricultural drought induced yield losses data adopted in this paper were obtained from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china http zzys agri gov cn zaiqing aspx which include both the areas covered and affected by droughts 6 67 km2 between years 1960 and 2010 3 methodology the selected precipitation i e meteorological runoff i e hydrological and soil moisture i e agricultural data together with the empirical frequency cumulative probability distribution estimated through the gringorten plotting position formula 1963 were considered to calculate the combined probability distribution the developed tsdi could provide an integrated characterization of meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts 3 1 trivariate gringorten empirical frequency formula the joint probability distribution function was employed to combine different drought elements the precipitation runoff and soil moisture data at a specific time scale e g monthly or annual were represented by the random variables x y and z respectively the joint distribution of these three variables can be expressed as 1 p x x y y z z p where p denotes the joint probability of the precipitation runoff and soil moisture the tsdi can be defined based on the joint probability p as follows hao and aghakouchak 2013 2 tsdi ϕ 1 p where ϕ is the standard normal distribution function similar to the msdi the tsdi is also derived from the joint probability of the selected variables which can be used to obtain drought information in hao and aghakouchak 2014 the joint distribution expressed in eq 1 was also constructed using the gringorten plotting position formula but considering only two variables the alternative method proposed in this paper is based on the nonparametric joint distribution however we avoided making any assumptions on the distribution family and tried to alleviate the computational burden in fitting parametric distributions in order to address a higher dimension case the trivariate empirical joint probability can be estimated with the plotting position formula of gringorten 1963 as follows 3 h x i y i z i p x x i y y i z z i m i 0 44 n 0 12 where n is the number of the observations and m i is the number of occurrences of the pair x y for x xi y yi and z zi 1 i n the joint probability derived from eq 3 is then applied to eq 1 to obtain p finally the obtained p value should be applied to eq 2 substitute in order to obtain the tsdi 3 2 wavelet analysis and cross wavelet transform the cross wavelet transform xwt of the two time series xn and yn is defined as w xy w x w y where denotes the complex conjugation the cross wavelet power can be further defined as w xy the complex argument arg w xy can be interpreted as the local relative phase between xn and yn in the time frequency space huang et al 2016c the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of two time series with background power spectra p k x and p k y is given in torrence and compo 1998 as 4 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where zv p is the confidence level associated with the probability of a pdf defined as the square root of the product of two x2 distributions in this study the 5 significance level was calculated considering z2 95 3 999 further details on the cross wavelet transform can be found in torrence and compo 1998 and grinsted et al 2004 4 results 4 1 comparison between the developed tsdi and other indices one of the targets of this study was to verify the reliability and superiority of the developed tsdi by comparing it with other drought indices including traditional single variable and other multivariate integrated drought indices meanwhile the tsdi is compared with a trivariate integrated drought index based on copula function in order to further prove its convenience and reliability the results of the comparisons are displayed in the following sections 4 1 1 reliability of the developed tsdi fig 2 presents some general variations based on different drought indices the spi precipitation based sri runoff based ssi soil moisture based and the tsdi based on three previously mentioned variables generally these indicators present similar temporal changing patterns the correlation coefficients between spi sri ssi and tsdi are shown in table 1 the data indicate that drought characterization and monitoring performed using the tsdi can be considered reliable notably the red line representing the tsdi is slightly lower than the other lines suggesting that the drought conditions captured by the tsdi are a little more serious than those captured by single element drought index it can be seen for table 1 that all of them were 0 65 and most of them were 0 7 indicating that the developed tsdi is reliable compared with other drought indices 4 1 2 superiority of the developed tsdi the first advantage of the developed tsdi compared to other drought indices is its simpler calculation the copula is a popular method for the formulation of integrated drought indices e g the trivariate integrated drought index by serinaldi and grimaldi 2007 however the process of fitting the optimized distribution and choosing the appropriate copula function is complex and tedious would it be possible to obtain the same result in a simpler way for comparison purposes the frank copula was used to construct a trivariate integrated drought index msdi based on precipitation rainfall and soil humidity compared with the single variable drought index the tsdi has a significant higher correlation with the msdi 0 95 table 1 this indicates that the results of the empirical frequency method are not much different from those obtained from the copula function besides fig 3 shows how the tsdi and msdi have approximately the same trend and are highly overlapping hao and aghakouchak 2013 have already demonstrated the advantages of the msdi in capturing drought events it can be inferred that the tsdi possesses similar advantages the second advantage of the tsdi compared to other drought indices is its higher sensitivity to the occurrence of real droughts fig 2 it can be seen from fig 2 that the tsdi can integrate the advantages of the spi and sri accurately capturing the onset and the end of each drought the low index values with respect to the threshold occur at different times and with different frequency between the tsdi to spi sri and ssi the occurrence of a drought with a specific type does not indicate the occurrence of a drought in an integrated manner similarly when a drought in an integrated manner occurs a drought with a specific type may not occur for example a period characterized by a precipitation deficit can result in a meteorological drought however in case of a fast replenishment of the precipitation deficit following runoff surplus the drought in an integrated manner will not occur nor have adverse consequences on the human society it should be noted that a long term precipitation deficit would lead to decreasing runoff and soil moisture see the first rectangle in fig 4 the spi did not reach its threshold value indicating that meteorological drought did not occur nevertheless a drought in an integrated manner did occur under the effects of multiple factors the second rectangle in fig 4 highlights the deficits of precipitation runoff and soil moisture although none of their values reached the threshold of drought however a drought in an integrated manner had already occurred overall it can be observed that the drought conditions reflected by the tsdi were closer to the actual conditions of the wrb than those characterized by traditional single variable indices since the tsdi is reliable easy to calculate as well as effective it can be considered a superior tool for effective representation of actual drought conditions in an integrated framework which is closer to actual drought conditions usually droughts with different types occur asynchronously in time and space using single variable drought index cannot characterize drought condition in an integrated manner as shown in fig 5 a if only the drought index solely based on runoff or soil moisture is used droughts caused by precipitation deficits tend to be ignored conversely if the drought index solely based on precipitation droughts caused by runoff deficits are expected to be ignored fig 5 b the developed tsdi index can capture drought in these two cases therefore the comprehensive drought index integrating multiple variables is of important significance for local drought preparedness and mitigation since it can be used as an effective reference to guide drought prevention planning and management it should be noted that the tsdi is not intended to completely replace the traditional drought index it exhibits strong correlations with traditional drought index such as spi sri and ssi indicating a high reliability of the new developed integrated drought index in this study with multiple drought related variables therefore the proposed tsdi is convincing an operational drought index particularly in watershed drought planning and management from an integrated perspective 4 2 evolution characteristics of droughts in an integrated manner a more accurate assessment of the drought risk in the wrb can support local planning and sustainable development of water resources as well as drought early warning and mitigation therefore the tsdi was employed to analyse the temporal changing characteristics of drought in an integrated manner in the wrb 4 2 1 the tsdi trends in the wrb the tsdi trends during 1960 2010 were analysed using the mann kendall method zhao et al 2019 the correspondent results can be seen in table 2 and table 3 the tsdi showed a significant downward trend at the 99 confidence level in all the regions of the wrb table 2 during 1960 2010 the drought in an integrated manner in the wrb gradually intensified and its impacts became more serious in order to improve drought prevention resistance and governance it is necessary to arouse the attention of relevant governmental departments we further explored the factors influencing the trend changes by calculating the trends in precipitation streamflow and soil moisture over the whole basin the characteristic value of precipitation is z 1 67 1 96 indicating a nonsignificant decreasing trend at the 95 confidence level in precipitation in the wrb table 3 the mann kendall statistics regarding streamflow and soil moisture has values 1 96 indicating a significant decreasing trend in streamflow and soil moisture in the wrb at the 95 confidence level table 3 therefore the negative trending of precipitation streamflow and soil moisture jointly contributes to the significant decreasing trend of tsdi in the wrb 4 2 2 change points in the annual tsdi series a heuristic segmentation algorithm feng et al 2005 was utilized to ascertain the occurrence of change points in the annual tsdi msdi series of the wrb area the selected threshold value p 0 and the minimum step l 0 were 0 95 and 25 respectively the correspondent results are shown in fig 6 change points were detected in both annual tsdi and msdi series in the year of 1971 and 1993 the results indicate the occurrence of change points in the integrated drought of the wrb and hence the stationarity of the integrated drought series was invalid 4 3 climate driving forces of the evolution characteristics of the tsdi sunspot activity and climate oscillation change the current situation of global water circulation leading to the spatial and temporal redistribution of water resources and determining the upper limit of available water resources in a region of interest sofia and li 2001 solar radiation causes evaporation of water body and the formation of warm and moist airflow changes the moisture content in the atmosphere sofia and li 2001 thus the distribution characteristics of precipitation and regional hydrological cycle process change sofia and li 2001 zhai 2017 as for the phenomenon of climate oscillation nino3 4 ao etc they alter the general circulation situation and affect regional hydrological elements through the movement of rain belt and the transport of water vapor reid 1991 fu et al 2012 the study on climate driving forces of the evolution characteristics of the tsdi is of important scientific significance to the scientific management of regional water resources solar radiation can be represented by sunspots and atmospheric circulation can be represented by atmospheric circulation anomaly factors hence we mainly referred to climate change related phenomena i e sunspots and abnormal atmospheric circulation factors as the driving forces behind the evolution of drought conditions in an integrated manner which would be helpful for drought early warning 4 3 1 linkages between the tsdi and sunspots atmospheric circulation anomaly factors after examining the trends and change points of the tsdi it is necessary to explore the driving forces behind the observed drought changes in an integrated way in this study three driving factors are considered sunspot activities sea surface temperatures over the nino3 4 region and the arctic oscillation ao figs 7 9 show the wavelet correlation maps between sunspots atmospheric circulation anomaly factors and the tsdi series in the wrb for the period 1960 2010 the arrows indicate the phase differences those pointing rightwards indicate that the time sequence phase changed accordingly while those pointing leftwards indicate that the time sequence phase changed in an opposite way moreover the arrows pointing upwards at 90 indicate that the driving factor changed 3 months before the tsdi while those pointing downwards at 90 indicate that the driving factor changed 3 months after the tsdi finally higher wavelet transform coefficients correspond to stronger correlations between the factors and the tsdi the highest correlations are shown in red solar radiation affects the quantity of clouds in the earth s atmosphere regulating the cosmic ray flux and thus influences the climate sofia and li 2001 fig 7 shows the cross wavelet transform between sunspots and the tsdi it can be observed that a negative correlation between the occurrence of sunspots and the tsdi over a period of 7 11 years during 1967 1985 and a positive correlation over a period of 7 12 years during 1985 2005 exist el niño southern oscillation enso corresponds to the strongest inter annual change signal in the tropical air sea coupling system at low latitudes reid 1991 the abnormal changes in sst linked to the enso have profound effects on the global atmospheric circulation as well as on weather and climate variability in china especially over the nino3 4 region reid 1991 fig 8 shows the cross wavelet transform between the nino3 4 index and the tsdi it can be seen that negative correlations between the enso and the tsdi exist over a period of 1 4 years during 19621 1974 and 4 6 years during 19841 1993 the ao represents the main mode of low rate variation in the extratropical atmosphere of the northern hemisphere toreti et al 2010 climate anomalies in northern china are closely related to the ao wang et al 2013 fig 9 shows the cross wavelet transforms between the ao and tsdi it can be noticed a positive correlation between the ao and the tsdi over a first period of 1 4 years during 1960 1970 a second period of 7 8 years during 1980 1987 and a third period of 4 5 years during 1988 1992 exist overall the variation occurred within the range of the rough black line outline meanwhile the phase of the cross wavelet changed before and after the year of the change point of tsdi these observations further prove the reliability of the captured change points moreover they illustrate the relationship between the occurrence of variations in the tsdi sequence and that of environmental factors i e sunspots some differences could be observed between the cross wavelet graph of sunspot occurrence and those of the nino3 4 and ao indices sunspots have a stronger influence on the tsdi sequence both in term of time and degree hence sunspot activity was the dominant driving force on the drought in an integrated manner in the wrb to certain extent figs 7 and 9 suggest that the effects of different driving factors on the tsdi were different in the time and frequency domains for the same driving factor its effect is within different time and frequency domains and the phase and retardation time of the driving factor with the tsdi are different even in cases when their features are similar as shown in fig 7 between the 1970s and the year of 2005 the sunspot and the tsdi phases changed from negative to positive thus the influence mode of the sunspot on the tsdi possibly have changed 4 3 2 comparison between the tsdi and other single variable indices related with sunspots figs 7 and 10 illustrate the cross wavelet maps between sunspots and the tsdi as well as the single variable drought indices respectively comparing these figures we could notice how the tsdi effectively integrated precipitation runoff and soil moisture information and it is more integrated than the univariate drought index in fig 10 b and c the time domain 1987 1988 corresponded to a frequency domain of approximately 5 years both of them were included in the 95 confidence interval but could not be observed in fig 10 a moreover in fig 10 b the time domain 1998 2005 corresponded to a frequency domain of 8 12 years while in fig 10 c the time domain 1974 1980 corresponded to a frequency domain of 6 7 years these peculiar circumstances appeared all combined and offset in fig 7 the tsdi being based on different drought related variables is expected to characterize drought conditions more accurately than single variable drought indices 4 3 3 linkages between sunspots and atmospheric circulation anomaly factors sunspots tend to have a very strong influence on both the ao and nino3 4 indices fig 11 fig 11 a shows the existence of a negative correlation between sunspots and the ao over a period of 8 12 years during 1967 1980 and a positive correlation over a period of 7 14 years during 1980 2007 fig 11 b shows the existence of a positive correlation between sunspots and the ao index over a period of 10 14 years during 1967 1993 in addition the arrows in the black coil in fig 11 are mostly downward indicating that the ao and nino3 4 indices present a certain degree lagged with sunspot changes in other words sunspots appeared to have a strong influence on these indices thus indirectly influencing the tsdi overall sunspot activities had not only direct but also indirect impacts on the drought in an integrated manner in the wrb mainly by influencing atmospheric circulation anomaly factors besides sunspots seemed to have the strongest effect on the drought in an integrated way therefore among all teleconnection factors sunspot activities likely were the main driving force on the drought evolution in an integrated manner in the wrb 5 discussion 5 1 comparison between parametric and nonparametric indices associated with yield losses due to the lack of systematic and multifactor integrated drought data integrated drought indices like the tsdi and msdi cannot be directly compared with the measured data in order to quantify the difference between the parametric and nonparametric drought indices the ssi closely related to agricultural drought was compared with the drought induced yield losses data in this study the parametric ssi was referred to as ssip and the empirical ssi was referred to as ssie the ssie was based on the gringorten formula while the ssip was based on a generalized extreme distribution following a series of steps e g selecting different distributions estimating parameters and performing a fitting optimization test and standardized the result in order to develop the ssip four distributions i e weibull gaussian gamma and generalized extreme distributions were selected and the root mean squared error rmse was used to test the goodness of fit table 4 the gamma distribution recommended by the chinese national weather service for hydrological frequency analysis performed well but not as much as the generalized extreme distribution table 5 shows the correlation between the ssi and the drought induced yield losses data e g the ssip based on the gamma distribution the ssip based on the generalized extreme distribution and the ssie table 5 shows the linkage between the ssie and yield losses data is stronger than the ssip based on the gamma distribution with good fitting effect the results partly prove that a drought index based on an empirical frequency has a rather good performance hence it is possible to avoid numerous tedious calculation steps while maintaining a high level of reliability 5 2 analysis of the drought elements change points in the whole wrb to further analyse the causes of the observed change points in the tsdi series in the wrb we performed a change point identification for the three drought related variables fig 12 shows the results of the change point detection for precipitation streamflow and soil moisture in the wrb with the period during 1960 2010 no change points were identified in the precipitation sequence while some change points were detected in the annual streamflow series in corresponding year of 1969 and 1990 and in the soil moisture series in corresponding year of 1985 in the context of global warming no significant declining trends in precipitation is observed variations in streamflow occurred in the early 1970s when large scale water conservancy projects and irrigation ditches were constructed during the 1990s the water consumption of the national economy greatly increased an abrupt change in soil moisture occurred in 1985 which was perhaps related to the application of cultivated land policies and measures for the protection of forest lands huang et al 2015 the three drought related variables changed differently therefore the extrapolation of aberrances in drought from either of these conditions alone would not provide reliable results in this case the change points identified in the tsdi trend should provide a more realistic representation of the characteristics of drought variation than those identified in the msdi series in the 1990s the water consumption of residents national economy soil and water conservation and non use caused by evaporation linked to warming all increased huang et al 2015 these above factors could have all contributed to drought variability the hydrological sequence in the wrb became non stationary therefore it can be reasonably concluded that the variations in runoff and soil moisture were caused by both climate change and human activities huang et al 2015 in the case of the tsdi combining three factors the impact of human activities might account for a larger proportion the described quantitative methods can be used in the future study to further analyse the contributions to the variations in the tsdi series 5 3 the period of the tsdi the period of the tsdi has been obtained based on wavelet analysis rao and indhukumar 1996 the time frequency distribution of the annual tsdi series is shown in fig 13 in fig 13 different colours correspond to different phases red and blue indicate positive and negative phases respectively the interval between the same phases represents the period of the tsdi series in the wavelet analysis diagram the horizontal coordinate represents the period a primary period of up to 25 years and a secondary period of nearly 7 years over the whole wrb during 1960 2010 are identified similar results have been obtained by huang et al 2016a a careful observation of the 7 years period in fig 13 a shows that the phase changes significantly from one to the other side of the red vertical dotted line the two dotted lines corresponding to the year of 1971 and 1993 which are the two change points in the tsdi series fig 6 these observations confirm our previous analysis on the variation in tsdi additionally the periods of the tsdi tended to increase after the year of 1990 independently from the primary and secondary periods 6 conclusions a trivariate standardized integrated drought index based on the empirical frequency cumulative probability distribution was constructed in this study which combines the information of precipitation streamflow and soil moisture data this integrated drought index is developed on a multivariate joint distribution function whose marginal distributions are different thus avoiding subjective errors caused by subjective empowerment and the non linear distortions linked to the pca the use of copulas is avoided in the development of the drought index the calculation of tsdi is simple and reliable at the same time overall it is demonstrated that the developed tsdi is able to characterize meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts in an integrated manner although the tsdi was just applied to the wrb in this study its use can be extended to any other regions without limitation our main conclusions are as follows 1 the drought conditions reflected by the tsdi are closer to reality than those reflected by traditional single variable indices the results of the tsdi were similar to those of a trivariate drought index based on copula function which but was simpler to calculate and better applicable to different regions 2 a significant downward trend with strong persistence was observed for the tsdi in all regions of the wrb which indicated a gradual intensification of the drought in an integrated manner in the wrb during 1960 2010 3 two change points in the tsdi series were identified in the year of 1971 and 1993 indicating that the drought in an integrated manner in the wrb is non stationary this characteristic is probably linked to a combination of changing climate section 4 3 1 and human activities section 5 2 especially to human activities 4 a primary period of up to 25 years and a secondary period of approximately 7 years for the tsdi series are identified over the whole wrb during 1960 2010 moreover its period changed before and after the change points of the tsdi 5 the evolution of the drought in an integrated manner in the wrb was closely related to sunspot activities and atmospheric circulation anomaly factors among them sunspot activities exert the dominant influence sunspot activities show both direct and indirect impacts on the drought in an integrated framework such conclusions were confirmed by the results of the change point identification in which the relationships between sunspots atmospheric circulation anomaly factors and the tsdi before and after the year of variation changed considerably overall this study proved the simplicity and reliability of a new trivariate integrated drought index named tsdi which provided a valuable reference for drought index development declaration of competing interest the

6095,drought index is an important tool for drought research the development of a reliable and simple integrated drought index is a critical step of current drought monitoring and risk assessments the gringorten point position formula was adopted to develop a trivariate standardized drought index tsdi based on precipitation meteorology runoff hydrology and soil moisture agriculture information in this study this index can be used to characterize droughts from an integrated meteorological hydrological and agricultural point of view and explore drought evolution characteristics the possible driving forces of drought were explored by examining the associations between sunspot activities and large scale atmospheric circulation anomalies a typical loess plateau watershed the wei river basin wrb was selected as a case study results showed that 1 the tsdi is better at characterizing real drought conditions than other traditional single variable indices although it is similar to the parametric trivariate drought index based on copula function serinaldi and grimaldi 2007 yang et al 2018 it is much simpler to calculate and more suitable for characterizing drought of different regions 2 the value of integrated drought index gradually increased in all areas and its change point occurred in the early 1970s and 1990s mainly due to variations in runoff 3 the evolution of the integrated drought appeared to be strongly influenced by sunspot activities and abnormal atmospheric circulation factors where sunspots activities are dominant this study provides a valuable reference for the development of an integrated drought index which might be applied to local drought monitoring preparedness and mitigation keywords drought integrated drought index nonparametric distribution trivariate empirical frequency the gringorten point position formula 1 introduction drought is a kind of natural disaster with extremely detrimental effects which occurs frequently affecting a wide range of areas fang et al 2019a b c huang et al 2019 it not only affects agricultural production but can also hinder economic development ultimately leading to social instability ren et al 2019 china is drought prone since ancient times recently it has evolved in a big agricultural and developing country in this context drought detection and prevention are undoubtedly becoming priorities for the chinese government huang et al 2019 the 21st century environment is being threatened by global climate change zhao et al 2019 han et al 2019a b these alterations are accelerating the global water cycle milly et al 2002 and increasing the frequency of extreme hydrological events e g droughts and floods wang et al 2011 since the last century air temperature has increased by 0 85 c ipcc 2013 under the influence of global climate changes and human induced greenhouse gas emission consequently the world has been suffering severe droughts during the last decade whose frequency is expected to increase in many regions huang et al 2019 drought events have seriously affected the daily life of local residents and impeded the growth of crops in addition they significantly hindered industrial production and development eventually impacting national economic development and public health security sheffield and wood 2008 mussá et al 2015 hence it is urgent and necessary to conduct in depth research on this topic drought indices have been widely applied by drought researches being on the basis of numerous drought investigations and playing an important role in the assessment of drought parameters kao and govindaraju 2010 huang et al 2016a b a large number of drought indices has been developed in order to characterize different types of droughts shukla and wood 2008 hao and aghakouchak 2013 han et al 2019b which provide reliable indices for the realization of drought risk assessments and the formulation of disaster mitigation strategies droughts are generally divided into four categories meteorological droughts resulting from a precipitation deficit hydrologic droughts resulting from insufficient runoff agricultural droughts resulting from a shortage in soil moisture and socio economic droughts resulting from insufficient water supply with respect to water demand guo et al 2019a b the four types of droughts present some common characteristics huang et al 2017a as a matter of fact one type of drought can evolve into another type huang et al 2017a for example meteorological droughts may transform into hydrological or agricultural droughts wu et al 2018a b a variety of indices have been developed for these four types of droughts based on different elements and each with its own advantages and defects early drought indices were based on a single variable like the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 the standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 and the standardized soil moisture index ssi hao and aghakouchak 2013 which have all been extensively used in drought monitoring among them the spi has been especially applied to identification of early drought occurrences other drought indices like the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 the self calibrating pdsi sc pdsi liu et al 2017 and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 have been also widely used nevertheless investigations based on a single variable are increasingly considered unreliable since droughts are influenced by multiple variables e g precipitation runoff soil moisture hao and aghakouchak 2013 kao and govindaraju 2010 mishra and singh 2010 in fact drought events are attributed to multiple elements of water shortages over different periods of time yang et al 2018 several integrated drought indices have been proposed with the aim of investigating drought events in a more integrated manner svoboda et al 2002 huang et al 2015 for example the linear weighted average was adopted to blend several drought indices the us drought monitor usdm developed by svoboda et al 2002 can contain information on climate indices numerical models and inputs from regional and local experts the aggregated drought index developed by keyantash and dracup 2004 can aggregate all the selected variables into a single time series through a correlation based principal component analysis pca however both of these aggregated indices have some weaknesses first pairs of drought variables are characterized by nonlinear relationships second the assumptions of the pca are not always met in real situations overall the use of these two methods may lead to information distortion subsequently the bivariate copula based joint index proposed by kao and govindaraju 2010 has been applied for the quantification of drought characters based on precipitation and streamflow information this type of drought indices is multivariate and hence more effective than those previously mentioned however this joint distribution method becomes too complicated to allow a rapid and effective calculating process of dependence structures among variables when it involves more than three variables based on the concept of copulas hao and aghakouchak 2013 developed the multivariate standardized drought index msdi this index is calculated based on the joint cumulative probability of precipitation and soil moisture content thus it is able to characterize drought conditions based on either of these two parameters unfortunately this index includes only meteorological and agricultural drought information among the four main types of droughts only three of them can be physically described in order to improve their characterization researchers should consider not only meteorological and agricultural droughts but also hydrological drought recently a trivariate drought index has been proposed by yang et al 2018 via employing copulas combining meteorological hydrological and agricultural variables which is referred to as nonparametric multivariate standardized drought index nmdi copulas strongly rely on the assumption that data samples follow a particular probability density function pdf fang et al 2019a b huang et al 2016a b however the given pdfs usually fail to reflect real drought conditions exactly huang et al 2016a leading to deviations from reality in addition the use of copulas involves many tedious steps and complex calculations therefore it is necessary to explore simpler ways to obtain a reliable and effective integrated drought index the empirical frequency plotting position formula proposed by gringorten 1963 proved to be suitable for the fitting of hydrological time series hence it has been widely applied to hydrological frequency analyses hao and aghakouchak 2014 huang et al 2016a b since it reflects a nonparametric empirical frequency distribution it can skilfully avoid fitting optimized parametric distribution this unbiased plotting position formula which works without following any specific distributions may solve the problems mentioned above in brief the main objectives of this study were to 1 develop a simple but effective tsdi verifying its reliability and superiority 2 analyse the temporal spatial evolution of the tsdi in the wei river basin wrb and 3 explore the driving forces of the evolution characteristics of droughts from an integrated perspective 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the wrb which represents a typical loess plateau watershed in an arid semi arid region of china was selected as the study area for this study fig 1 located between 33 5 37 5 n and 103 5 110 5 e the wei river is the largest tributary of the yellow river liu et al 2019 the altitude of the wrb gradually increases from southeast to northwest the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation over this area is very uneven which is one of the main triggers for the frequent droughts and waterlogging disasters in the region the wrb is currently one of the most important agricultural e g grain cotton and food oil and industrial production bases in china located near the border of western china it plays an important role in the development of this region liu et al 2018 notably under the joint influence of climate and human activities precipitation and runoff have decreased in the wrb huang et al 2014 2017b liu et al 2018 therefore it is of important significance to study the evolution characteristics of drought in an integrated manner in the wrb for its sustainable development of social economy 2 2 data source the digital data were collected from seven regions of the wrb referring to the river system and administrative division beidao bd linjiacun ljc xianyang xy zhangjiashan zjs lintong lt huaxian hx zhuangtou zt the monthly precipitation data obtained from 21 meteorological stations in the wrb and its surroundings were utilized as follows fig 1 the monthly runoff data relative to linjiacun zhangjiashan huaxian and other 4 hydrological stations in the wrb were obtained from the hydrologic manual the huaxian station is located in the lower reach of the basin and its catchment area accounts for 97 16 of the entire basin hence the total runoff registered at the huaxian and zhuangtou stations can be considered approximately equal to the runoff of the whole basin in the study area soil moisture data are very limited for in situ observations due to difficulties during the data collection process the monthly soil moisture data for depths about 10 cm had to be simulated using a variable infiltration capacity vic model sure it is well known that uncertainties exist in hydrological simulations nevertheless the vic model performed well in china with a high resolution of 0 25 0 25 because it employed a high density of meteorological observations from the china meteorological administration cma as model inputs and adopted streamflow observations from the hydrology bureau of china hbc for model calibration zhang et al 2014 the accuracy of soil moisture in this study area simulated by vic model can be guaranteed wu et al 2011 leng et al 2015 huang et al 2017b the considered meteorological hydrological and agricultural data covered the period between january 1960 and december 2010 moreover each time series included 612 specimens the agricultural drought induced yield losses data adopted in this paper were obtained from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china http zzys agri gov cn zaiqing aspx which include both the areas covered and affected by droughts 6 67 km2 between years 1960 and 2010 3 methodology the selected precipitation i e meteorological runoff i e hydrological and soil moisture i e agricultural data together with the empirical frequency cumulative probability distribution estimated through the gringorten plotting position formula 1963 were considered to calculate the combined probability distribution the developed tsdi could provide an integrated characterization of meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts 3 1 trivariate gringorten empirical frequency formula the joint probability distribution function was employed to combine different drought elements the precipitation runoff and soil moisture data at a specific time scale e g monthly or annual were represented by the random variables x y and z respectively the joint distribution of these three variables can be expressed as 1 p x x y y z z p where p denotes the joint probability of the precipitation runoff and soil moisture the tsdi can be defined based on the joint probability p as follows hao and aghakouchak 2013 2 tsdi ϕ 1 p where ϕ is the standard normal distribution function similar to the msdi the tsdi is also derived from the joint probability of the selected variables which can be used to obtain drought information in hao and aghakouchak 2014 the joint distribution expressed in eq 1 was also constructed using the gringorten plotting position formula but considering only two variables the alternative method proposed in this paper is based on the nonparametric joint distribution however we avoided making any assumptions on the distribution family and tried to alleviate the computational burden in fitting parametric distributions in order to address a higher dimension case the trivariate empirical joint probability can be estimated with the plotting position formula of gringorten 1963 as follows 3 h x i y i z i p x x i y y i z z i m i 0 44 n 0 12 where n is the number of the observations and m i is the number of occurrences of the pair x y for x xi y yi and z zi 1 i n the joint probability derived from eq 3 is then applied to eq 1 to obtain p finally the obtained p value should be applied to eq 2 substitute in order to obtain the tsdi 3 2 wavelet analysis and cross wavelet transform the cross wavelet transform xwt of the two time series xn and yn is defined as w xy w x w y where denotes the complex conjugation the cross wavelet power can be further defined as w xy the complex argument arg w xy can be interpreted as the local relative phase between xn and yn in the time frequency space huang et al 2016c the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of two time series with background power spectra p k x and p k y is given in torrence and compo 1998 as 4 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where zv p is the confidence level associated with the probability of a pdf defined as the square root of the product of two x2 distributions in this study the 5 significance level was calculated considering z2 95 3 999 further details on the cross wavelet transform can be found in torrence and compo 1998 and grinsted et al 2004 4 results 4 1 comparison between the developed tsdi and other indices one of the targets of this study was to verify the reliability and superiority of the developed tsdi by comparing it with other drought indices including traditional single variable and other multivariate integrated drought indices meanwhile the tsdi is compared with a trivariate integrated drought index based on copula function in order to further prove its convenience and reliability the results of the comparisons are displayed in the following sections 4 1 1 reliability of the developed tsdi fig 2 presents some general variations based on different drought indices the spi precipitation based sri runoff based ssi soil moisture based and the tsdi based on three previously mentioned variables generally these indicators present similar temporal changing patterns the correlation coefficients between spi sri ssi and tsdi are shown in table 1 the data indicate that drought characterization and monitoring performed using the tsdi can be considered reliable notably the red line representing the tsdi is slightly lower than the other lines suggesting that the drought conditions captured by the tsdi are a little more serious than those captured by single element drought index it can be seen for table 1 that all of them were 0 65 and most of them were 0 7 indicating that the developed tsdi is reliable compared with other drought indices 4 1 2 superiority of the developed tsdi the first advantage of the developed tsdi compared to other drought indices is its simpler calculation the copula is a popular method for the formulation of integrated drought indices e g the trivariate integrated drought index by serinaldi and grimaldi 2007 however the process of fitting the optimized distribution and choosing the appropriate copula function is complex and tedious would it be possible to obtain the same result in a simpler way for comparison purposes the frank copula was used to construct a trivariate integrated drought index msdi based on precipitation rainfall and soil humidity compared with the single variable drought index the tsdi has a significant higher correlation with the msdi 0 95 table 1 this indicates that the results of the empirical frequency method are not much different from those obtained from the copula function besides fig 3 shows how the tsdi and msdi have approximately the same trend and are highly overlapping hao and aghakouchak 2013 have already demonstrated the advantages of the msdi in capturing drought events it can be inferred that the tsdi possesses similar advantages the second advantage of the tsdi compared to other drought indices is its higher sensitivity to the occurrence of real droughts fig 2 it can be seen from fig 2 that the tsdi can integrate the advantages of the spi and sri accurately capturing the onset and the end of each drought the low index values with respect to the threshold occur at different times and with different frequency between the tsdi to spi sri and ssi the occurrence of a drought with a specific type does not indicate the occurrence of a drought in an integrated manner similarly when a drought in an integrated manner occurs a drought with a specific type may not occur for example a period characterized by a precipitation deficit can result in a meteorological drought however in case of a fast replenishment of the precipitation deficit following runoff surplus the drought in an integrated manner will not occur nor have adverse consequences on the human society it should be noted that a long term precipitation deficit would lead to decreasing runoff and soil moisture see the first rectangle in fig 4 the spi did not reach its threshold value indicating that meteorological drought did not occur nevertheless a drought in an integrated manner did occur under the effects of multiple factors the second rectangle in fig 4 highlights the deficits of precipitation runoff and soil moisture although none of their values reached the threshold of drought however a drought in an integrated manner had already occurred overall it can be observed that the drought conditions reflected by the tsdi were closer to the actual conditions of the wrb than those characterized by traditional single variable indices since the tsdi is reliable easy to calculate as well as effective it can be considered a superior tool for effective representation of actual drought conditions in an integrated framework which is closer to actual drought conditions usually droughts with different types occur asynchronously in time and space using single variable drought index cannot characterize drought condition in an integrated manner as shown in fig 5 a if only the drought index solely based on runoff or soil moisture is used droughts caused by precipitation deficits tend to be ignored conversely if the drought index solely based on precipitation droughts caused by runoff deficits are expected to be ignored fig 5 b the developed tsdi index can capture drought in these two cases therefore the comprehensive drought index integrating multiple variables is of important significance for local drought preparedness and mitigation since it can be used as an effective reference to guide drought prevention planning and management it should be noted that the tsdi is not intended to completely replace the traditional drought index it exhibits strong correlations with traditional drought index such as spi sri and ssi indicating a high reliability of the new developed integrated drought index in this study with multiple drought related variables therefore the proposed tsdi is convincing an operational drought index particularly in watershed drought planning and management from an integrated perspective 4 2 evolution characteristics of droughts in an integrated manner a more accurate assessment of the drought risk in the wrb can support local planning and sustainable development of water resources as well as drought early warning and mitigation therefore the tsdi was employed to analyse the temporal changing characteristics of drought in an integrated manner in the wrb 4 2 1 the tsdi trends in the wrb the tsdi trends during 1960 2010 were analysed using the mann kendall method zhao et al 2019 the correspondent results can be seen in table 2 and table 3 the tsdi showed a significant downward trend at the 99 confidence level in all the regions of the wrb table 2 during 1960 2010 the drought in an integrated manner in the wrb gradually intensified and its impacts became more serious in order to improve drought prevention resistance and governance it is necessary to arouse the attention of relevant governmental departments we further explored the factors influencing the trend changes by calculating the trends in precipitation streamflow and soil moisture over the whole basin the characteristic value of precipitation is z 1 67 1 96 indicating a nonsignificant decreasing trend at the 95 confidence level in precipitation in the wrb table 3 the mann kendall statistics regarding streamflow and soil moisture has values 1 96 indicating a significant decreasing trend in streamflow and soil moisture in the wrb at the 95 confidence level table 3 therefore the negative trending of precipitation streamflow and soil moisture jointly contributes to the significant decreasing trend of tsdi in the wrb 4 2 2 change points in the annual tsdi series a heuristic segmentation algorithm feng et al 2005 was utilized to ascertain the occurrence of change points in the annual tsdi msdi series of the wrb area the selected threshold value p 0 and the minimum step l 0 were 0 95 and 25 respectively the correspondent results are shown in fig 6 change points were detected in both annual tsdi and msdi series in the year of 1971 and 1993 the results indicate the occurrence of change points in the integrated drought of the wrb and hence the stationarity of the integrated drought series was invalid 4 3 climate driving forces of the evolution characteristics of the tsdi sunspot activity and climate oscillation change the current situation of global water circulation leading to the spatial and temporal redistribution of water resources and determining the upper limit of available water resources in a region of interest sofia and li 2001 solar radiation causes evaporation of water body and the formation of warm and moist airflow changes the moisture content in the atmosphere sofia and li 2001 thus the distribution characteristics of precipitation and regional hydrological cycle process change sofia and li 2001 zhai 2017 as for the phenomenon of climate oscillation nino3 4 ao etc they alter the general circulation situation and affect regional hydrological elements through the movement of rain belt and the transport of water vapor reid 1991 fu et al 2012 the study on climate driving forces of the evolution characteristics of the tsdi is of important scientific significance to the scientific management of regional water resources solar radiation can be represented by sunspots and atmospheric circulation can be represented by atmospheric circulation anomaly factors hence we mainly referred to climate change related phenomena i e sunspots and abnormal atmospheric circulation factors as the driving forces behind the evolution of drought conditions in an integrated manner which would be helpful for drought early warning 4 3 1 linkages between the tsdi and sunspots atmospheric circulation anomaly factors after examining the trends and change points of the tsdi it is necessary to explore the driving forces behind the observed drought changes in an integrated way in this study three driving factors are considered sunspot activities sea surface temperatures over the nino3 4 region and the arctic oscillation ao figs 7 9 show the wavelet correlation maps between sunspots atmospheric circulation anomaly factors and the tsdi series in the wrb for the period 1960 2010 the arrows indicate the phase differences those pointing rightwards indicate that the time sequence phase changed accordingly while those pointing leftwards indicate that the time sequence phase changed in an opposite way moreover the arrows pointing upwards at 90 indicate that the driving factor changed 3 months before the tsdi while those pointing downwards at 90 indicate that the driving factor changed 3 months after the tsdi finally higher wavelet transform coefficients correspond to stronger correlations between the factors and the tsdi the highest correlations are shown in red solar radiation affects the quantity of clouds in the earth s atmosphere regulating the cosmic ray flux and thus influences the climate sofia and li 2001 fig 7 shows the cross wavelet transform between sunspots and the tsdi it can be observed that a negative correlation between the occurrence of sunspots and the tsdi over a period of 7 11 years during 1967 1985 and a positive correlation over a period of 7 12 years during 1985 2005 exist el niño southern oscillation enso corresponds to the strongest inter annual change signal in the tropical air sea coupling system at low latitudes reid 1991 the abnormal changes in sst linked to the enso have profound effects on the global atmospheric circulation as well as on weather and climate variability in china especially over the nino3 4 region reid 1991 fig 8 shows the cross wavelet transform between the nino3 4 index and the tsdi it can be seen that negative correlations between the enso and the tsdi exist over a period of 1 4 years during 19621 1974 and 4 6 years during 19841 1993 the ao represents the main mode of low rate variation in the extratropical atmosphere of the northern hemisphere toreti et al 2010 climate anomalies in northern china are closely related to the ao wang et al 2013 fig 9 shows the cross wavelet transforms between the ao and tsdi it can be noticed a positive correlation between the ao and the tsdi over a first period of 1 4 years during 1960 1970 a second period of 7 8 years during 1980 1987 and a third period of 4 5 years during 1988 1992 exist overall the variation occurred within the range of the rough black line outline meanwhile the phase of the cross wavelet changed before and after the year of the change point of tsdi these observations further prove the reliability of the captured change points moreover they illustrate the relationship between the occurrence of variations in the tsdi sequence and that of environmental factors i e sunspots some differences could be observed between the cross wavelet graph of sunspot occurrence and those of the nino3 4 and ao indices sunspots have a stronger influence on the tsdi sequence both in term of time and degree hence sunspot activity was the dominant driving force on the drought in an integrated manner in the wrb to certain extent figs 7 and 9 suggest that the effects of different driving factors on the tsdi were different in the time and frequency domains for the same driving factor its effect is within different time and frequency domains and the phase and retardation time of the driving factor with the tsdi are different even in cases when their features are similar as shown in fig 7 between the 1970s and the year of 2005 the sunspot and the tsdi phases changed from negative to positive thus the influence mode of the sunspot on the tsdi possibly have changed 4 3 2 comparison between the tsdi and other single variable indices related with sunspots figs 7 and 10 illustrate the cross wavelet maps between sunspots and the tsdi as well as the single variable drought indices respectively comparing these figures we could notice how the tsdi effectively integrated precipitation runoff and soil moisture information and it is more integrated than the univariate drought index in fig 10 b and c the time domain 1987 1988 corresponded to a frequency domain of approximately 5 years both of them were included in the 95 confidence interval but could not be observed in fig 10 a moreover in fig 10 b the time domain 1998 2005 corresponded to a frequency domain of 8 12 years while in fig 10 c the time domain 1974 1980 corresponded to a frequency domain of 6 7 years these peculiar circumstances appeared all combined and offset in fig 7 the tsdi being based on different drought related variables is expected to characterize drought conditions more accurately than single variable drought indices 4 3 3 linkages between sunspots and atmospheric circulation anomaly factors sunspots tend to have a very strong influence on both the ao and nino3 4 indices fig 11 fig 11 a shows the existence of a negative correlation between sunspots and the ao over a period of 8 12 years during 1967 1980 and a positive correlation over a period of 7 14 years during 1980 2007 fig 11 b shows the existence of a positive correlation between sunspots and the ao index over a period of 10 14 years during 1967 1993 in addition the arrows in the black coil in fig 11 are mostly downward indicating that the ao and nino3 4 indices present a certain degree lagged with sunspot changes in other words sunspots appeared to have a strong influence on these indices thus indirectly influencing the tsdi overall sunspot activities had not only direct but also indirect impacts on the drought in an integrated manner in the wrb mainly by influencing atmospheric circulation anomaly factors besides sunspots seemed to have the strongest effect on the drought in an integrated way therefore among all teleconnection factors sunspot activities likely were the main driving force on the drought evolution in an integrated manner in the wrb 5 discussion 5 1 comparison between parametric and nonparametric indices associated with yield losses due to the lack of systematic and multifactor integrated drought data integrated drought indices like the tsdi and msdi cannot be directly compared with the measured data in order to quantify the difference between the parametric and nonparametric drought indices the ssi closely related to agricultural drought was compared with the drought induced yield losses data in this study the parametric ssi was referred to as ssip and the empirical ssi was referred to as ssie the ssie was based on the gringorten formula while the ssip was based on a generalized extreme distribution following a series of steps e g selecting different distributions estimating parameters and performing a fitting optimization test and standardized the result in order to develop the ssip four distributions i e weibull gaussian gamma and generalized extreme distributions were selected and the root mean squared error rmse was used to test the goodness of fit table 4 the gamma distribution recommended by the chinese national weather service for hydrological frequency analysis performed well but not as much as the generalized extreme distribution table 5 shows the correlation between the ssi and the drought induced yield losses data e g the ssip based on the gamma distribution the ssip based on the generalized extreme distribution and the ssie table 5 shows the linkage between the ssie and yield losses data is stronger than the ssip based on the gamma distribution with good fitting effect the results partly prove that a drought index based on an empirical frequency has a rather good performance hence it is possible to avoid numerous tedious calculation steps while maintaining a high level of reliability 5 2 analysis of the drought elements change points in the whole wrb to further analyse the causes of the observed change points in the tsdi series in the wrb we performed a change point identification for the three drought related variables fig 12 shows the results of the change point detection for precipitation streamflow and soil moisture in the wrb with the period during 1960 2010 no change points were identified in the precipitation sequence while some change points were detected in the annual streamflow series in corresponding year of 1969 and 1990 and in the soil moisture series in corresponding year of 1985 in the context of global warming no significant declining trends in precipitation is observed variations in streamflow occurred in the early 1970s when large scale water conservancy projects and irrigation ditches were constructed during the 1990s the water consumption of the national economy greatly increased an abrupt change in soil moisture occurred in 1985 which was perhaps related to the application of cultivated land policies and measures for the protection of forest lands huang et al 2015 the three drought related variables changed differently therefore the extrapolation of aberrances in drought from either of these conditions alone would not provide reliable results in this case the change points identified in the tsdi trend should provide a more realistic representation of the characteristics of drought variation than those identified in the msdi series in the 1990s the water consumption of residents national economy soil and water conservation and non use caused by evaporation linked to warming all increased huang et al 2015 these above factors could have all contributed to drought variability the hydrological sequence in the wrb became non stationary therefore it can be reasonably concluded that the variations in runoff and soil moisture were caused by both climate change and human activities huang et al 2015 in the case of the tsdi combining three factors the impact of human activities might account for a larger proportion the described quantitative methods can be used in the future study to further analyse the contributions to the variations in the tsdi series 5 3 the period of the tsdi the period of the tsdi has been obtained based on wavelet analysis rao and indhukumar 1996 the time frequency distribution of the annual tsdi series is shown in fig 13 in fig 13 different colours correspond to different phases red and blue indicate positive and negative phases respectively the interval between the same phases represents the period of the tsdi series in the wavelet analysis diagram the horizontal coordinate represents the period a primary period of up to 25 years and a secondary period of nearly 7 years over the whole wrb during 1960 2010 are identified similar results have been obtained by huang et al 2016a a careful observation of the 7 years period in fig 13 a shows that the phase changes significantly from one to the other side of the red vertical dotted line the two dotted lines corresponding to the year of 1971 and 1993 which are the two change points in the tsdi series fig 6 these observations confirm our previous analysis on the variation in tsdi additionally the periods of the tsdi tended to increase after the year of 1990 independently from the primary and secondary periods 6 conclusions a trivariate standardized integrated drought index based on the empirical frequency cumulative probability distribution was constructed in this study which combines the information of precipitation streamflow and soil moisture data this integrated drought index is developed on a multivariate joint distribution function whose marginal distributions are different thus avoiding subjective errors caused by subjective empowerment and the non linear distortions linked to the pca the use of copulas is avoided in the development of the drought index the calculation of tsdi is simple and reliable at the same time overall it is demonstrated that the developed tsdi is able to characterize meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts in an integrated manner although the tsdi was just applied to the wrb in this study its use can be extended to any other regions without limitation our main conclusions are as follows 1 the drought conditions reflected by the tsdi are closer to reality than those reflected by traditional single variable indices the results of the tsdi were similar to those of a trivariate drought index based on copula function which but was simpler to calculate and better applicable to different regions 2 a significant downward trend with strong persistence was observed for the tsdi in all regions of the wrb which indicated a gradual intensification of the drought in an integrated manner in the wrb during 1960 2010 3 two change points in the tsdi series were identified in the year of 1971 and 1993 indicating that the drought in an integrated manner in the wrb is non stationary this characteristic is probably linked to a combination of changing climate section 4 3 1 and human activities section 5 2 especially to human activities 4 a primary period of up to 25 years and a secondary period of approximately 7 years for the tsdi series are identified over the whole wrb during 1960 2010 moreover its period changed before and after the change points of the tsdi 5 the evolution of the drought in an integrated manner in the wrb was closely related to sunspot activities and atmospheric circulation anomaly factors among them sunspot activities exert the dominant influence sunspot activities show both direct and indirect impacts on the drought in an integrated framework such conclusions were confirmed by the results of the change point identification in which the relationships between sunspots atmospheric circulation anomaly factors and the tsdi before and after the year of variation changed considerably overall this study

6096,a moving multi front mmf method is developed and tested for solving the richards equation governing unsaturated flow in vertical homogeneous porous columns the mmf model is a gridless method it can be viewed as a generalization of the green ampt piston flow approach which models flow as a single abrupt moving front separating saturated and dry regions during infiltration the mmf model further generalizes this concept using a parametrization of unsaturated water retention and conductivity pressure curves it reduces the richards pde to an ode system governing m moving front positions different tests are developed to validate this approach for 1d transient downwards upwards flows submitted to constant and time varying pressure boundary conditions they include i infiltration to deep water tables ii infiltration to shallow water tables iii capillary rise from fixed water tables iv gradual water table rise partially saturated column with evolving pressure condition at bottom the mmf results are compared favorably to finely discretized fixed grid solutions of richards pde analyses of error and accuracy show satisfactory results in terms of water content profiles and boundary fluxes e g infiltration rate keywords moving multi front model green ampt model richards equation unsaturated flow infiltration nonlinear ode system 1 introduction vertical water flows through porous media like soils are of great interest for hydrologists and geotechnical scientists and engineers in general these water flows take place in the presence of air and they are modeled based on a generalized darcy approach darcy buckingham where the water content as well as the pore pressure are taken into account in the unsaturated porous medium unsaturated flows include important phenomena such as downward infiltration and capillary rise due for instance to a rise of the water table infiltration is a downward water flow process through which water penetrates the soil surface and flows towards drier soil due to capillary gradients and gravitational force capillary rise involves a rise of moisture driven upwards by capillary gradients and partially counteracted by the downwards gravity force researchers have developed a number of analytical semi analytical and numerical models or solvers to simulate infiltration and more generally unsaturated flow processes the darcy based richards equation richards 1931 is still the most frequently used equation to describe unsaturated flow and it can be generalized to deal with partially saturated as well as unsaturated porous media and to include other effects like compressibility the richards equation is mathematically a quasi linear pde partial differential equation with nonlinear coefficients numerical solvers have been developed for solving the partially saturated unsaturated richards pde with implicit discretization in time finite volume bigflow3d ababou and bagtzoglou 1993 or galerkin finite element hydrus1d 2d 3d

iterations in hydrus1d 2d 3d these two codes will be used here for benchmarking the highly nonlinear nature of the richards pde has attracted the attention of many researchers with the aim of improving or adapting nonlinear iteration methods along with time stepping methods see for instance islam et al 2017 and references therein specifically in islam et al 2017 the authors propose a lookup table method to enhance the performance of picard and newton iterations for highly nonlinear constitutive relationships by sampling adaptively the pressure h at points where the capacity curve c h varies most rapidly in order to avoid divergence of the picard or newton solvers on the other hand due to the complexity and non linear nature of the richards pde analytical and semi analytical solutions to infiltration type problems were developed under special constraints and limitations usually for 1d vertical flow in spite of their limitations the analytical models are useful in several ways for approximate analyses of real infiltration processes but also for evaluating the accuracy of numerical solutions validation benchmarking the literature involves many analytical and quasi analytical models that have been developed over the past years to tackle infiltration problem green and ampt 1911 horton 1933 philip 1957 morel seytoux and khanji 1974 smith and parlange 1978 warrick et al 1991 ghotbi et al 2011 parlange et al 1999 srivastava and yeh 1991 su et al 2017 triadis and broadbridge 2010 wang et al 2009 wu and zhang 2009 among many others morbidelli et al 2018 present a review on infiltration modeling accommodating constant or variable rainfall rate ponding and post ponding infiltration for homogeneous or 2 layered soils they review several such models some of them related to or extensions of the classical green ampt approach see references therein the review paper by morbidelli et al 2018 also points out other infiltration models including the semi analytical model of corradini et al 2000 which models infiltration redistribution in a 2 layer soil their model can be considered as a simplified conceptual model of the richards equation it yields a system of ode s governing suctions vs time at interface and or boundary points when the two layers are identical their model reduces to the green ampt infiltration model under zero ponding depth the green ampt ga piston flow model green and ampt 1911 is one of the most simplified analytical and physically based models that was developed initially for water infiltration under ponded conditions into initially dry homogeneous soils far above the water table the piston flow assumption in the ga model approximates the soil moisture distribution with an abrupt moving front separating a wetted saturated region above the front and a dry region belowit this model implies a constant hydraulic conductivity k s and water content θ s within the wetted zone and it assumes that the abrupt wetting front can be characterized by a constant suction ψ f driving the flow bouwer 1964 bouwer 1966 bouwer 1969 the model assumes that the front suction ψ f is a parameter that characterizes the soil and does not depend on other factors such as initial water content and top boundary condition the ga model has been the focus of many interests because of its simplicity and adaptability for a variety of applications in soil and watershed hydrology other works in the literature extended or analyzed the ga approximation in various ways e g infiltration under time varying conditions chu 1978 warrick et al 2005 layered and heterogeneous soils liu et al 2008 selker et al 1999 yanwei et al 2015 and kacimov et al 2010 sloping soil surfaces chen and young 2006 and gavin and xue 2008 air flow and air compression effects on infiltration morel seytoux 1973 nonuniform initial moisture liu et al 2008 moisture redistribution after infiltration musy and soutter 1991 horizontal imbibition instead of vertical infiltration cao et al 2019 prevedello and armindo 2016 zhang et al 2019 the latter work by zhang et al 2019 also proposes a parametric extension of ga based on a piecewise linear approximation of moisture profiles with two linear zones for horizontal flow similarly meng and yang 2019 present an extended ga model for vertical flow comprising a partition between a saturated zone and an unsaturated zone with assumed linear pressure profile in the unsaturated zone the wet unsaturated partition function is fitted empirically using a neural network in addition the paper by ali et al 2016 presents an extensive review and performance analyses of various explicit approximations of the classical ga solution in comparison with the exact implicit ga equation at this point in comparison with the ga piston flow model it is useful to consider a technical mathematical issue concerning the space time discretization methods used for solving numerically the nonlinear unsaturated flow equations richards pde for example in the numerical based method like finite elements hydrus or finite volumes bigflow the nonlinear richards pde partial differential equation is discretized in both space and time in contrast the ga equation avoids discretizing space z by assuming that the vertical moisture pressure profile is a step function with only one sharp wetting front located at position z t at any given timet warrick et al 2005 used a slightly modified form of the ga infiltration equation under a boundary condition of time variable ponded depth at soil surface they proposed to discretize the ga model in time with relatively coarse time steps and to reformulate it as a classical ga model under piecewise constant boundary conditions over time lee et al 2004 applied the method of lines mol for unsaturated flow problems governed by richards pde this method is based on a fixed discretization of the spatial domain while keeping the time domain continuous this results in a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ode that can be easily solved by available numerical time integrator schemes matthews et al 2004 further considered the mol for multi layered soils and proposed methods to handle the discontinuity of water content and hydraulic conductivity at interfaces between soil layers talbot and ogden 2008 proposed a solution method for 1d vertical infiltration and redistribution based on the ga approximation where they discretize the water content domain θ into equal bins δθ instead of discretizing the vertical spatial dimension this is equivalent to discretizing the water content profiles θ z into vertical bins of width δθ the vertical water movement is decomposed at every time step into a two step process the so called infiltration step is followed by a redistribution step the latter being based on capillary forces ogden et al 2015 subsequently built on the finite water content discretization of talbot and ogden 2008 however this time they used the method of lines mol and they approximate the partial derivative q θ by neglecting a term that contributes to capillary suction gradient ogden et al 2015 their eq 10 they also criticized the previous paper by talbot and ogden 2008 stating that the redistribution sub step used in infiltration simulation was incorrect and they renamed and reformulated this sub step as capillary relaxation which moves water from low to high capillary bin s or region s it has come to our attention while revising this paper that two particle based schemes for solving the richards equation were tested in beaudoin et al 2011 both schemes are lagrangian the mmf method can also be qualified as lagrangian but each of them is different from mmf the first scheme is a particle strength exchange or weighted particle method where each particle has variable mass m t and the second scheme is based on the concept of diffusion velocity or rather pseudo velocity it is based on a transformation from nonlinear capillary diffusion to strongly nonlinear convection haq et al 2010 present a meshless method of lines for solving a 1d nonlinear fourth order pde known as the kuramoto sivashinsky equation their method could potentially be adapted to solve the nonlinear second order richards pde in spite of its name the method is based on a fixed grid of nodes x i and then on an approximate linear decomposition of the unknown u x t on a basis of functions ψ j x with time dependent coefficients λ j t j 1 n the unknowns u x i t are nodal although the unknown coefficients λ j t themselves are indeed meshless and these coefficients are finally used to solve a system of ode s for the nodal unknowns u i t u x i t by the mol approach evoked earlier the objective of this paper is to propose a new quasi analytical efficient alternative model named moving multi fronts mmf we will focus here on a one dimensional 1d vertical system taking into account both saturated and unsaturated flow dynamics in the porous domain we will propose to improve on the classical g a approach by discretizing the state variables themselves the pressure head and consequently the water contents and the hydraulic conductivity along the soil profile such that the nonlinear behavior can easily be accounted for the resulting nonlinear odes can then be solved either by numerical integration or say by explicit runge kutta finite differences in time 1 1 note in all such cases when the resulting equations boil down to single integrals or to integrable 1rst order ode s we refer to these as quasi analytical or semi analytical solutions the mmf tracks movable multi fronts instead of a single ga moving front in similar lagrangian manner in comparison with the meshless mol of haq et al 2010 the mmf method proposed here is completely meshless on the other hand in comparison to the method of discretized moisture content domain by talbot and ogden 2008 and ogden et al 2015 the mmf method to be presented here does not require the two steps process used in their model all processes in the present mmf model capillary gradients and gravity forces are treated at once in a fully coupled manner furthermore their model also neglects some contributions of the non gravitational part containing d θ θ z d is the soil water diffusivity whereas the mmf model does not finally the present mmf can handle as easily co gravity and anti gravity flows examples including downwards infiltration capillary rise sudden and gradual rise or drop of water table will be presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model uniform and a nonuniform initial soil water profiles constant or time dependent pressure head boundary conditions will also be considered 2 method the moving multi front model 2 1 the classical green ampt ga model single moving front the classical ga model is a simplified representation of vertical water infiltration in a dry soil away from the water table deep water table the ga model assumes a saturated piston type flow into the dry soil i e flow is modeled as the displacement of a single sharp wetting front into a uniformly dry homogeneous soil the front abruptly separates two distinct regions a fully saturated region upstream above and a very dry region downstream below the sharp wetting front is pulled downwards by gravity and capillary suction forces as shown in fig 1 this model is also called single front model because as in the classical ga approach it is based on the movement of a single front z f t accordingly based on the usual green ampt piston flow hypotheses we assume that there exists a well defined wetting front separating the fully saturated and the totally dry regions as shown in fig 1 where the dashed line represents the ga approximation the wetting front is assumed to be characterized by some effective constant suction head ψ f or pressure head h f ψ f considered to be a characteristic parameter of the soil the ga model approximation divides the soil column into two zones each zone having apriori its own hydraulic conductivity and water content k θ top zone this zone is totally saturated according ga approximation it extends from the ground surface z 0 to the moving wetting front z z f t in this zone we have k k s θ θ s bottom zone this zone is the totally dry region extending from the moving wetting front z z f t up to infinite depth it is a semi infinite zone the flux is null in this zone since the initial soil is totally dry k 0 θ θ d where θ d is also denoted θ r residual water content let us now develop the governing equations under these assumptions using darcy s flux gradient law and mass conservation principles global darcy equation and ga infiltration rate first one develops a global approximation of darcy s law q z t k h z g for the entire saturated region this is obtained by integrating q z t vertically at any fixed timet through the saturated region i e from the ponded surface at z 0 to the wetting front at depth z z f t this procedure necessarily assumes the existence of an effective front pressure h f or front suction ψ f parameter in terms of pressure head h and with z downwards the global version of the pressure gradient h z is δ h δ z h f h p z f t also since the transmission zone is saturated in the ga model we have k k s in that zone this yields finally the ga relation for the global integrated flux q t or infiltration rate f t in terms of pressure heads 1a f t q t k s h f h p z f t g or equivalently in terms of suction heads ψ h a n d ψ f h f 1b f t q t k s ψ f h p z f t g note that h p represents the positive pressure condition due to ponded water depth at soil surface h p 0 the other variables and parameters are defined as follows f t m s is the infiltration rate at a given time t k s m s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the saturated transition zone z f t m is the depth of the moving wetting front at time t it is also the vertical extent of the saturated zone ψ f m is the capillary suction head at the wetting front g dimensionless represents normalized gravity g g z g with g 1 if the oz axis is directed downwards as is the case here note that the global darcy flux density q t obtained by integration through the saturated region is assumed to represent also the infiltration rate at soil surface denoted f t m s the above relations for the single front ga infiltration rate can also be generalized in terms of the gravity vector g as follows simply by changing the oz axis direction let g 1 in the present case for water infiltration with z directed downwards let g 1 with z directed upwards e g to treat capillary rise or water table rise let g 0 e g for horizontal flow model and or in the absence of gravity global mass balance and closure of ga infiltration equations the previous relation of eq 1 is not closed because it contains two unknowns the infiltration rate f t and the wetting front depth z f t the closure of this problem is obtained by applying a global mass balance principle at the scale of the transmission zone thus neglecting the flux in the initially dry zone just below the wetting front q d k d 0 the depth of the wetting front z f t can be related to the cumulative infiltration f t by the following mass conservation principle 2 f t θ s θ d z f t taking the derivative of the cumulative infiltration f t with respect to time yields 3 f t df dt θ s θ d d z f dt where f t m is the cumulative infiltration at time t θ s is the saturated water content or porosity θ d is the dry initial water content if the soil is initially very dry then we have ideally θ d θ r the initially dry water content is the residual water content of the soil in that case the initial conductivity of the soil vanishes k θ d k d 0 and for this reason the flux q d below the wetting front is negligible or null at all times note also that eq 3 can also be obtained by applying mass conservation around the moving front z f t as follows 4a q top t q bot t θ top θ bot d z f dt where q top t f t q bot t 0 θ top θ s and θ bot θ d θ r the approximate equalities become exact if θ d θ r exactly implying q bot t 0 q top t f t whence 4b f t θ s θ d d z f dt now finally combining eq 1 and eq 3 leads to the governing equation of the ga model 5 d z f dt k s θ s θ d ψ f h p z f t 1 eq 5 is a nonlinear ordinary differential equation ode it can be solved for the unknown wetting front depth z f t using semi analytical procedures which are briefly described in appendix 1 for the sake of completeness alternatively eq 5 could also be solved directly numerically in discrete time t n using any available robust ode solver based for instance on explicit runge kutta methods or more general combinations of explicit implicit temporal discretization methods which are available for example in matlab once z f t is determined eq 1 or eq 4b can be used to obtain the infiltration rate f t finally this single front approach can be considered also for other unsaturated flow processes such as upwards flow and other flow conditions such as redistribution however the single front approximation is not accurate in general except if the soil is very coarse grained with a narrow range of pore sizes and initially very dry outside the wetted zone otherwise the single front approach is inaccurate 2 2 the moving multi fronts mmf model in this article the approximate green ampt ga model is generalized to the new moving multi front mmf model in order to deal efficiently and accurately with 1d vertical flows in partially saturated unsaturated porous media taking into account both gravity and capillary effects on the process as realistically as possible in the new mmf model the 1d flow process governed by richards pde is represented more accurately for example the water content and pressure profiles cannot be reduced to the movement of a single sharp front in cases such as water infiltration in a fine grained soil and or an initially wet soil and or in the presence of a shallow water table the main idea underlying the mmf approach is to extend the classical ga model by introducing more moving fronts in order to allow a better representation of the vertical spatial distribution of state variables vertical moisture and pressure profiles thus at any given time t water content θ z will varied with depth in a more realistic step by step or gradual fashion and similarly for pressure head h z and hydraulic conductivity k z k h z therefore in the mmf method the unsaturated profiles k z and θ z are approximated by m moving fronts this is shown schematically in fig 2 for the moisture profile θ z with this parametrization of the multi front model we expect that the accuracy of the results will be improved as the soil column is divided approximated by a larger number of moving fronts over depth accordingly a set of iso values or fronts of the state variables such as suction ψ f will be selected within a range that depends on initial boundary conditions and then tracked through time based on their positions z f ψ f t position of a given iso value or front ψ f given a time discretization this formulation implies that we are looking at each new time step for the new position z f t n δ t n of the state variable s iso value or front clearly no spatial discretization is required for simplicity and clarity we describe now the mmf model specifically for the case of downwards infiltration in a very dry soil other cases of 1d flow are treated with the same mmf model by changing initial and boundary conditions see test problems in section 4 assume we have defined m fronts each characterized by its own suction value subscript f refers to front ψ f ψ f 1 ψ f 2 ψ fm the main objective of the mmf model is to find the positions of the fronts z f i t at each time step z f t z f 1 t z f 2 t z f 3 t z fm t according to fig 2 the multi front approximation divides the 1d column into m 1 zones 2 2 zones are inter frontal regions conductivity k and flux q are zonal or mid frontal quantities accordingly the zonal quantities like the conductivity k of zone i will be later subscripted by i 1 2 zones 1 to m these zones are comprised between the ground surface z 0 and the last mth moving front z z f m t they are the m transition zones from the totally saturated zone to the totally dry one the parameters of each zone number i are k i k s θ i θ s zone m 1 this is the totally dry region it is a semi infinite dry zone below the mth moving front z z f m t the flux in this zone is null and the parameters are k m 1 0 θ m 1 θ d the flow in each zone i e between each pair of successive fronts is governed by darcy s equation while a mass conservation equation is satisfied around each moving front let us now develop the governing equations using darcy s flux gradient law and mass conservation principles we will use the suction head ψ z t as the main state variable recalling that pressure head h z t is just the opposite of suction head h ψ the advantage of using suction ψ is that it is positive in the unsaturated zone which is our main concern here recall also that z indicates depth downwards darcy s law applied between pairs of moving fronts applying darcy s equation for zone i where 1 i m 6 q i 1 2 t k i 1 2 h z g k i 1 2 ψ f i ψ f i 1 z f i t z f i 1 t 1 where quantities q i 1 2 t are mid frontal fluxes defined at intermediate positions between fronts z f i 1 t and z f i t equivalently each flux q i 1 2 t approximates the flux in the mobile zone z f i 1 t z f i t similarly quantities like k i 1 2 are mid frontal or zonal hydraulic conductivities note that k i 1 2 does not depend on time because it is a function solely of the two iso values ψ f i ψ f i 1 through the conductivity suction curve k ψ in the case of infiltration in a dry soil the mid front flux is assumed to be null through the bottom dry zone i e between the next to last front m and the last front m 1 this emulates the case of a semi infinite initially dry soil column q m 1 2 t 0 mass conservation around each moving front moreover applying mass conservation equation around each of the m moving fronts z f i t we obtain 7 q i 1 2 t q i 1 2 t θ i 1 2 θ i 1 2 d z i dt where again q i 1 2 t represents a mid frontal flux and θ i 1 2 is the mid frontal water content between fronts z i 1 t and z i t note that θ i 1 2 does not depend on time because it is a function solely of the two iso values ψ f i ψ f i 1 through the water retention curve θ ψ recall that the bottom mid front flux is null q m 1 2 t 0 in addition for the same reasons the bottom water content is equal to the initial dry water content that is θ m 1 2 θ d where we usually take θ d θ r residual moisture for infiltration in a very dry semi infinite soil column as explained earlier the mass conservation eq 7 combined with darcy s eq 6 applied to the moving fronts yields a system of 1rst order nonlinear ordinary differential equations ode s or more generally here a system of algebraic differential equations this system can be solved numerically for the unknown front positions z f i t subject to initial condition z f i 0 the numerical solution of such a system can be accomplished in discrete time t n using robust ode solvers based for instance on explicit runge kutta methods or more general combinations of explicit implicit temporal discretization methods a suite of robust and reliable ode solvers is available in matlab with possible choices including stiff systems and also systems that may require computationally more intensive implicit methods in this article an explicit stiff matlab ode solver function was used mainly ode15s in order to solve the system and obtain the evolving front positions z f i t once the evolution of front positions z f i t is determined the darcy eq 6 can be applied to calculate fluxes between the moving fronts including the top flux q 1 1 2 t which represents the infiltration rate f t the bottom flux is null for the infiltration problem in dry soil but it can be nonnull and may need to be calculated e g in the case of initially wet soils and or in the presence of a shallow water table indeed various types of unsaturated flow problems will be treated with the mmf model see next section 4 for instance in the case of infiltration to a shallow water table the position of front ψ 0 is fixed at bottom because the water table is fixed at some finite depth and because it corresponds physically to iso value ψ 0 in that case the bottom mid frontal flux q m 1 2 t is not null and it can be computed as a function of time using the mid frontal darcy eq 6 3 parametrization of the mmf model generalized green ampt as in the classical ga model the performance of the proposed mmf models depends on a suitable estimation of the model parameters these parameters are the constant suction head ψ fi at each front f i the mid front unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k i 1 2 and the mid front water content θ i 1 2 between successive fronts for clarity we start with the parametrization of the simpler single front model ga before developing the parametrization of the multi front model mmf 3 1 parametrization of the single front model classical ga model in the classical ga or single front model the main parameter is the front suction ψ f which needs to be related to soil hydraulic characteristics several expressions for ψ f have been suggested in the literature e g panikar and nanjappa 1977 musy and soutter 1991 here we select the following two expressions 1 the first expression for ψ f proposed here corresponds to the point of the inflection of the water retention curve θ h or θ ψ at which the specific moisture capacity c h θ h h is maximum as shown in fig 3 the suction head at this inflection point can be treated as a global capillary length scale of the porous medium for the van genuchten model ψ f it can be easily calculated analytically e g ababou 1991 and alastal et al 2010 8 ψ f 1 α 1 1 n 1 n where α and n are the van genuchten parameters of the water retention curve θ ψ 1 the second proposed estimate of wetting front suction ψ f is the following modified from neuman 1976 and originally proposed by bouwer bouwer 1964 bouwer 1966 under the name critical pressure 9 ψ f 0 k r ψ d ψ where k r ψ k ψ k s is the relative conductivity curve vs suction this estimation of ψ f is illustrated graphically in fig 4 in the case of the exponential gardner conductivity curve k r ψ e x p α g ψ the resulting front suction is simply ψ f 1 α g 3 2 parametrization of the multi front model the parameters k i 1 2 and θ i 1 2 of the multi front model can be determined by different methods we propose here two possible classes of parametrization methods the first method is the one used in section 4 on test problems 1 the first parametrization method is a simple approach based on discretizing the water content θ and the hydraulic conductivity k into m 1 frontal values θ i and k i defining m equally spaced segments alternatively a variant of this method consists in discretizing directly the suction head ψ ψ i and then obtain the corresponding θ i and k i after this discretization average mid frontal values of water content θ i 1 2 and hydraulic conductivity k i 1 2 are calculated for each inter frontal zone z i 1 t z i t based on the frontal values θ i 1 θ i and k i 1 k i which do not depend on time but only on the corresponding suction iso values ψ i in the four test problems of section 4 the selected averaging method is the arithmetic mean for θ and the harmonic mean for k accordingly the mid frontal values are calculated as follows θ i 1 2 θ i 1 θ i 2 k i 1 2 k i 1 1 k i 1 2 1 the second method uses an integral criterion to calculate the fronts suctions ψ i based on pre selected values of mid frontal conductivities k i 1 2 this approach generalizes the parametrization method described in eq 9 where the front suction ψ f of the single front ga model is obtained from an integral of the relative hydraulic conductivity curve k r ψ for multiple fronts a generalization of this method consists in maintaining equal areas under the curve k r ψ an illustration of this method for m 4 fronts is shown in fig 5 this parametrization method keeps the area under the curve k r ψ equal to the area under the discrete front model approximation defined by m discrete frontal suction values ψ i and the corresponding frontal conductivities k i for example to find or adjust the front suction ψ f 2 the area under the k r ψ curve between ψ inter 2 and ψ inter 3 is set equal to the area under the discrete approximation between ψ inter 2 and ψ inter 3 this step is repeated between each two pairs of intermediate suctions in order to obtain the corresponding suction pressure at each front ψ f i note the notation ψ inter i in fig 5 corresponds to inter frontal or mid front suction values also denoted ψ i 1 2 in the mmf equations at which inter frontal water contents θ i 1 2 and hydraulic conductivities k i 1 2 are also calculated 4 test problems validation and performance of mmf model to evaluate the proposed mmf model the solutions obtained from the gridless mmf system of ode s are compared to other solutions obtained by classical numerical solvers of the richards pde in order to provide benchmark tests for our gridless mmf model our choice here is to use extremely refined space time grids in the classical richards pde solvers in order to use their numerical solutions as surrogate true solutions typically the number m of fronts in our tests will be one order of magnitude less in the mmf model than the number of grid nodes used in the richards pde solvers specifically in this article we compare our model to both hydrus1d and bigflow3d codes hydrus1d is a well documented and tested numerical model for simulating the 1d movement of water heat and multiple solutes in variably saturated unsaturated porous media it numerically solves the richards pde for saturated unsaturated water flow coupled to fickian based advection dispersion equations for heat and solute transport hydrus1d is based on an implicit discretization in time and 1d galerkin finite elements discretization in space simunek et al 2013 the linearization of the space time discretized system is handled with newton raphson iterations in hydrus1d hydrus 1d also solves advective diffusive dispersive solute and several other transport processes coupled to unsaturated water flow bigflow3d is a 3d finite volume flow code that has been widely documented tested and benchmarked ababou and bagtzoglou 1993 ababou et al 1992 bigflow3d solves the 3d richards pde based on a generalized darcy type flux law with a mixed pressure moisture formulation of mass conservation it uses an implicit discretization in time and finite volume discretization in space the linearization of the discretized space time system is handled with a modified picard iteration loop in bigflow3d it is capable of simulating various types of partially saturated flows and solves other flow problems such as planar groundwater flow seawater intrusion and surface flow governed by the diffusive wave equation there are several reasons for using two different classical codes for comparisons with the new mmf approach first we do not wish to rely entirely on a single code secondly there is some value added to these comparisons given that the two selected codes are quite different finite elements vs finite volumes infact our auxiliary benchmark tests show that hydrus bigflow s responses are undistinguishable although presenting these auxiliary results is not the purpose of this paper thirdly there also minor technical reasons for using one code or the other depending on post processing needs to sumup the validation of the mmf model proposed in this study is based on comparisons with the classical fixed grid numerical solvers hydrus1d and bigflow3d these classical richards pde solvers are considered as surrogates for exact solutions when used with extreme refinement in both space and time a fine regular mesh δz will be used here corresponding to about one thousand fixed grid points in both solvers and the time step δt will be kept extremely small as well e g one second or less for the fine sand tests the criteria to be used for comparisons and validation of the mmf method are the transient water content and or pressure head profiles θ z t h z t and also the temporal evolution of boundary fluxes top or bottom boundary flux depending on the proposed test 4 1 richards equation constitutive relations the richards pde richards 1931 is obtained by the combination of darcy s law with mass balance equation the 1d mixed form of richards pde describing vertical water flow in variably saturated unsaturated homogeneous soils is expressed as follows 10 θ h t z k h h z g k h where h m is pressure head θ h m 3 m 3 is the volumetric water content of the soil k h m s is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil t s is time z m is the vertical coordinate taken positive downwards in this work z depth g dimensionless is the normalized vertical gravity component 1 in this work in the case of unsaturated flow both the hydraulic conductivity k and water content θ are functions of pressure head h various models have been suggested to describe the constitutive relationships θ h k h in this article the unsaturated hydrodynamic properties of the soils are described with the soil water retention model θ h of vangenuchten van genuchten 1980 in combination with the functional model of hydraulic conductivity k θ proposed by mualem 1976 the water retention function is given by 11 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m where θ r is the residual water content θ s is the saturated water content α m 1 is a scaling factor that represents an inverse capillary length scale n is a dimensionless real number exponent or shape parameter related theoretically to pore size distribution usually n 1 and m is also an exponent related to n by the relation m 1 1 n inserting the van genuchten curve θ h in mualem s functional model k θ yields the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity pressure curve k h 12 k h k s 1 α h n m 2 1 1 1 1 α h n m 2 where k s m s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil for more details on unsaturated constitutive relations see ababou 2018 vol 1 sec 4 2 sec 4 3 sec 5 4 4 2 soil properties two different soils namely fine sand fs and guelph loam gl were used in this study to evaluate the performance of the mmf model the fine sand and the loam are presented in alastal et al 2010 the soil water retention curves are presented in fig 6 the curves indicated that the fine sand has a sharp transition from the saturated to the dry water content green ampt soil behavior in contrast with the guelph loam which have gradual transition behavior the soil hydrodynamic parameters are summarized in table 1 based on van genuchten model 4 3 benchmark tests results and discussion the following tests were used to validate the mmf model and to show its applicability for a broad range of cases flow regimes and soil types the selected tests are as follows infiltration in a dry soil i e towards a deep water table the purpose is to test and validate the mmf model for a prototype case for which the classical ga model was theoretically designed downwards infiltration in an initially dry semi infinite soil column infiltration to shallow water table the purpose is to test and validate the mmf model for non uniform initial water content along the column and such that the vertical profiles of water content and the hydraulic conductivity are non monotonic capillary rise problem to test and validate the mmf model for anti gravity flow problem gradual rise of water table to test and validate the mmf model for variable pressure head boundary condition in all the tests the performance of the mmf model was analyzed mainly in terms of the temporal evolutions of two variables the water content profiles θ z t and the boundary flux q t 4 3 1 infiltration to deep water table test1 the test considered here is analogous to semi infinite infiltration of the classical ga and it is characterized by monotonic water content profiles this test treated 1d water infiltration towards deep water table to ensure that the soil is initially dry under infiltration the top boundary condition is subjected to saturation and the wetting front started to move downwards into the previously dry soil where the simulation should be stop far before the front reaches the bottom water table here is a summary of the initial and boundary conditions initial condition t 0 h z 0 h 0 depending on the soil as explained below boundary conditions top bc z 0 h 0 t 0 which corresponds to saturation bottom bc z l h l t h 0 which is compatible with the initial condition this validation test was applied for the two soils guelph loam gl and fine sand fs with the properties presented earlier in table 1 the chosen value of initial pressure head is h 0 1 m for the gl soil corresponding to a moderately dry water content θ 0 414 and h 0 0 5 m for the fs soil corresponding to almost totally dry water content θ 0 033 see table 1 for comparison of these initial water contents with the saturated and residual water contents of each soil the column length is 1 m deep l 1 m the vertical domain of the numerical pde solver is discretized into fine discretization of 1001 nodes δz 0 001 m to ensure a better reference for comparison results while only 30 moving fronts are used in mmf model to prove the robustness of the mmf even with a moderate number of fronts the results show the downwards evolution of water content profiles as well as the infiltration rate vs time as shown in fig 7 for the guelph loam and fig 8 for the fine sand comparison between the meshless mmf model with m 30 fronts and the numerical solver with n 1001 fixed nodes shows an excellent agreement between the two models for the evolution of water content profiles and for the infiltration rate as well and this for each of the two soils tested here fine sand and guelph loam 4 3 2 infiltration to shallow water table test 2 this test deals with water infiltration to a shallow water table the flow regime in this case differs from the previous one by two distinct characteristics i the initial condition is non uniform along the column both for moisture θ z and pressure h z and ii the state variable profiles obtained for this flow test are non monotonic in space vertically consider a homogeneous soil column of length l 1 m of guelph loam gl with the hydraulic properties described earlier in table 1 the initial pressure head distribution h z 0 is hydrostatic implying that h z 0 is a linear function of z starting from h 0 at the water table to h l at ground surface the lower and upper boundary conditions are zero pressure head these initial and boundary conditions are summarized below initial condition t 0 h z 0 z l where z is depth measured from the ground surface boundary conditions top bc z 0 h 0 t 0 corresponding to a constant saturation of ground surface bottom bc z l h l t 0 corresponding to a fixed water table at depth z l note this bottom bc is compatible with the initial condition at z l in the numerical simulation performed with the hydrus1d code the soil column is discretized into 1001 nodes in order to obtain a finely discretized reference solution while we use only 30 moving fronts in the mmf model fig 9 shows a good fit between the results of the two methods with respect to the evolution of water content profiles as well as the infiltration rate vs time the agreement between the two models can be enhanced by increasing the number of fronts in the mmf model a quantitative analysis of global error in terms of the number of fronts m for this test is presented separately in section 5 it should be noted that in this test the soil column is partially saturated it contains a saturated zone that increases with time until the column reaches full saturation at steady state large times as a consequence some pressure fronts should disappear with time when the corresponding pressure iso values no longer exist to solve this problem an auxiliary numerical scheme was implemented in the ode solver of the mmf model to monitor this process and to manage the emergence and disappearance of pressure iso values fronts this auxiliary numerical scheme includes two steps 1 detection and removal of any successive fronts z i t z i 1 t whose positions may be approaching each other athreshold value δz was pre defined in the script and 2 redistribution of the remaining front positions through spatial interpolation techniques 4 3 3 capillary rise from a fixed water table test3 in this test we analyze unsaturated capillary rise in a soil or porous medium this test in contrast with the previous tests represents an anti gravity flow problem a soil column of length l 1 m made up of the guelph loam soil gl is assumed to be relatively dry initially see initial condition below a zero pressure head is suddenly imposed at the bottom boundary which corresponds to imposing a fixed water table at depth z l for all times t 0 the initial and boundary conditions of this validation test are as follows initial condition t 0 h z 0 1 m corresponding to initial water content θ 0 414 boundary conditions top bc z 0 h 0 t 1 m which is compatible with the initial condition bottom bc z l h l t 0 which corresponds to a fixed water table at z l note the initial pressure condition h z 0 1 m corresponds to a water content θ 0 414 and a degree of saturation s 64 9 this may seem fairly wet but in fact the corresponding initial conductivity of the soil is 1 81e 7 m s about 20 times smaller than the saturated conductivity ks 3 66e 6 m s therefore the soil is initially relatively dry in the sense that it is initially poorly conductive in order to verify the accuracy of our mmf model a numerical benchmark simulation was implemented using the finite element code hydrus1d with n 1001 nodes versus the present mmf model with m 30 moving fronts fig 10 shows an excellent agreement between the two models both in terms of moisture and pressure profiles top plots and in terms of flux evolution q t bottom plot note that q t represents the upward flux through the water table during the capillary rise process the agreement is remarkable given that only 30moving fronts were used in the mmf method 4 3 4 gradual rise of a water table test4 the objective of this test is to validate the mmf model against time varying pressure head boundary condition in addition unlike the previous tests the proposed test involves a partially saturated unsaturated soil column a semi infinite fine sand column fs with properties defined in table 1 is initially hydrostatic with a water table located at elevation 0 5 m measured from the bottom of the column in this test the vertical coordinate is elevation rather than depth the water table is forced upward by gradually rising the bottom pressure h 0 t from h 0 0 5 m to h 0 1 0 m for the purpose of this test we select this time varying entry pressure function h 0 t to increase monotonically like a quarter of a sinusoidal function of the form h 0 t 0 5 0 5 sin ω t for t 0 t 4 with ω 2 π t and t 600 s therefore the bottom boundary pressure gradually increases from h 0 0 5 m to h 0 1 0 m within 150 s in this benchmark test four output variables are selected to compare the two models the water content profiles θ z t pressure head profiles h z t the evolution of water table elevation z wt t and the flux q 0 t calculated at the bottom boundary fig 11 shows an excellent fit between the mmf model with m 30 moving fronts and the numerical solver of richards pde bigflow3d code with n 1001 nodes and a fine time step δt 0 2 s the agreement is excellent between the two methods with only 30 moving fronts in the mmf recall that the flow is forced by the positive bottom pressure h 0 t imposed at bottom the calculated water table elevation z wt t is different from the imposed pressure h 0 t as can be seen from the bottom left plot of fig 11 the bottom flux q 0 t was calculated in the mmf by using darcy s law between the first two bottom fronts 5 performance and accuracy in this section the numerical performance of the proposed mmf model is studied in two different ways 1 through global analyses of error norms moisture content and surface flux vs number of fronts m and 2 through direct analyses of surface flux f t m s for several values of the number of fronts m 1 2 4 8 where the case m 1 is taken to mean the classical green ampt model in the case of test1 infiltration in the case of deep water table 5 1 numerical analyses of error norms in this section the gridless mmf model is evaluated in terms of its accuracy an appropriate global error norm ε is defined calculated and then analyzed as a function of the number m of moving fronts since analytical solutions are not generally available for this type of nonlinear transient flow problem given the highly nonlinear soil properties involved we use here the classical numerical solvers with a large number of nodes e g n 1001 nodes as a surrogate for the exact solution with this in mind the error is calculated for two types of output variables the space time distribution of water content θ z t and the time dependent boundary flux e g infiltration rate f t we choose to implement error norm criteria for test2 of the previous section i e water infiltration to a shallow water table guelph loam soil section 4 3 2 test2 for the water content the global error is calculated by applying a discrete form of the space time euclidian l2 norm where integration is replaced by discrete summation over both space and time as follows 13 ε θ 1 i δ z i n δ t n n i θ num z i t n θ mmf z i t n 2 δ z i δ t n 1 2 where θ num is the volumetric water content resulted from the fine resolution numerical solver with large number of nodes n 1001 θ mmf is the volumetric water content resulted from the mmf model with a moderate number of moving fronts here m 1000 it is worth mentioning that in order to calculate the above error we interpolate linearly the moving front solution θ mmf between the fixed nodes of the classical numerical solver hydrus1d since the positions of the mmf moving fronts do not coincide with the spatial discretization fixed nodes of the classical numerical solver for the boundary flux f t which corresponds to the infiltration rate for test2 the global error is calculated by applying a discrete form of the euclidian l2 norm over time as follows 14 ε f 1 n δ t n n f num t n f mmf t n 2 δ t n 1 2 where f num is the boundary flux or infiltration rate resulting from the fine resolution numerical solver with a large number of fixed nodes n 1001 f mmf is the boundary flux or infiltration rate resulting from the mmf model with a moderate number of moving fronts here m 1000 for water contents θ z t the behavior of the normalized global error as a function of the numberm of moving fronts is plotted in fig 12 on a log log scale it is clear from the graph of fig 12 that the error decreases as a power function with the number of fronts m of the mmf model based on a log log regression of the numerical error norm vs m it is found that the error norm ε θ behaves as follows 15 ε θ 0 6387 m 1 92 m 3 m 3 the accuracy of the mmf model is characterized by the number of moving fronts m or by its inverse 1 m note that the 1 m parameter of the mmf model is similar to the mesh size parameter δz of classical models e g linear finite elements for hydrus1d structured finite volumes for bigflow3d the conclusion from fig 12 and eq 15 is that in terms of 1 m the order of accuracy of the mmf method is close to 2 we can conclude in particular that the method is consistent and provides a good approximation of water content profiles one should also investigate further whether the estimated error norm ε θ aglobal measure of error is small relative to the calculated water content profiles θ z t one way to answer this question is to compare the global error ε θ m 3 m 3 to the range of moisture contents of infiltration flow test2 fig 9 in this test infiltration to shallow water table the range of moisture contents is defined by the initial moisture at the top boundary θ 0 0 41 and by the saturated water content θ s 0 52 imposed as top boundary condition also as bottom watertable condition thus the moisture range in this test is θ s θ 0 0 11 m 3 m 3 with this in mind let us evaluate the relative error norm ε θ θ s θ 0 for m 30 fronts we obtain 9 3217e 04 0 11 which yields finally ε θ θ s θ 0 0 0085 the global relative error on moisture content θ is less than 1 for m 30fronts for the error on the infiltration rate or boundary flux f t a similar power law behavior is obtained the calculated global error ε f decreases as a power law with the number of moving fronts m of the mmf model as can be seen in fig 13 based again on a linear regression in log log scale the error ε f appears to follow the power law 16 ε f 8 696 10 6 m 0 99 m s the conclusion from fig 13 and eq 16 is that in terms of 1 m the order of accuracy of the mmf method is about 1 for the flux variable we can infer in particular that the method is consistent for flux calculations as well technically one should also investigate whether the flux error norm ε f aglobal measure of error is small relative to the calculated flux f t at various times the flux error norm obtained for m 30fronts is ε f 2 9769e 07 m s it is quite small compared to the maximum flux rate f 3 5e 5 m s observed at early times in fig 9 test2 and it remains reasonably small compared to the final steady flux which is close to the saturated conductivity of the guelphloam k s 3 66 10 6 m s 5 2 performance of mmf front in terms of infiltration rate f t vs number of fronts the temporal evolution of surface flux f t is a particularly important variable in many applications of soil hydrology for this reason we now focus on infiltration test1 deep water table in order to directly compare the surface flux f t m s obtained for several values of the number of fronts m 1 2 4 8 including the classical green ampt model represented by the case m 1 in that case m 1front the classical green ampt solution is implemented here with the widely used front suction model ψ f of bouwer bouwer 1964 bouwer 1966 given by eq 9 and selecting k s and θ s for the values of mid frontal conductivity and water content fig 14 shows that the infiltration rate agreement between the mmf model and a richards pde solver hydrus1d improves rapidly with m and becomes almost perfect for m 8 which is remarkable the figure also shows that the singlefront model classical green ampt does not perform very well as expected especially for this type of loamy soil as a reminder a comparison for m 30 fronts was also shown earlier in fig 7 in conclusion the present mmf model generalized green ampt performs quite well for just a relatively small number of fronts m 8 in terms of infiltration rate 6 conclusions and outlook the moving multi front mmf model presented in this paper is essentially a meshless method for calculating vertical water flows in unsaturated or partially saturated homogeneous soil columns under the combined influence of gravity and capillary gradients the mmf model requires the solution of a nonlinear ode system governing the positions z fi t of the moving iso values or fronts i 1 m each front position z fi t corresponds to a fixed frontal suction ψ i to which corresponds a pressure h i ψ i and a water content θ i θ h i from which pressure profiles h z fi t t and moisture profiles θ z fi t t are plotted at any desired time t to sum up the mmf model reduces the nonlinear richards pde partial differential equation governing unsaturated flow to a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ode s governing the positions of moving fronts the four benchmark test problems of section 4 served to validate the mmf model with a moderate number of fronts m 30 by comparing it to classical pde solvers implemented on extremely refined grids n 1001 nodes these test problems cover a broad range of flow regime including downwards infiltration upwards flow initially uniform or non uniform boundary conditions partially saturated flow and time varying boundary condition the benchmark results showed a very good fit with the mmf model in terms of transient pressure and moisture profiles and in terms of temporal evolutions boundary fluxes and free surface in addition two error norms were studied the error norm ε θ of the space time distribution of moisture θ z t and the error norm ε f of the time variable infiltration rate or flux f t it was found that these error norms behave like a power of the number of frontsm ε m ω with power ω 1 92 for ε θ and ω 0 99 for ε f it can be concluded first that the mmf method is numerically consistent in the sense that the error norm ε decreases as m increases secondly it is interesting to note that in terms of 1 m the order of accuracy of mmf is close to 2 for water content θ and 1 for flux the same order of accuracy is obtained for instance with classical centered finite difference schemes applied to the richards pde with regular mesh size δ z the order of accuracy is o δ z 2 for pressure or moisture and o δ z 1 for the calculated mid nodal flux see truncation error analyses in vauclin et al 1979 and ababou et al 1992 among others further analyses and rescaling of our calculated errors indicate that the relative errors on both moisture and flux are quite small typically 1 using only m 30 moving fronts in the mmf model in conclusion the behavior of the mmf method is quite satisfactory it appears from global errors that only a few tens of fronts are needed to obtain accurate solutions as can be seen from direct comparisons with the classical solvers in section 4 3 tests1 2 3 4 and from the error norm plots of section 5 1 in addition the infiltration rates f t of test1 were systematically compared with the reference solution for m 1 2 4 8 and these tests confirmed the previous results infiltration rate f t is in very good agreement for all times even for moderate number of fronts e g m 8 overall the results obtained with the meshless mmf model compared with finely discretized space time solutions of the nonlinear richards pde demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of the mmf the mmf model has distinct advantages including its ability to track directly a given pressure or water content in time and its robustness in terms of pressure and moisture profiles note cpu times benchmark tests were not implemented because the classical fe or fv solvers hydrus bigflow are coded in compiled languages fortran while our mmf method at this stage is programmed in an interpreted language matlab interpreted languages are notoriously slower than compiled languages in terms of execution time and the cpu times comparisons would be meaningless nevertheless the performance results of mmf already suggest that cpu times could be significantly reduced with mmf once re programmed in a compiled language such cpu time tests should be run for equal precision of results given these encouraging results the mmf model is currently undergoing several extensions current work is devoted to generalizing the mmf method to include flux and pressure gradient boundary conditions such as a prescribed darcy flux q z m s at ground surface e g to simulate internal drainage under zero flux and or a gravitational boundary condition h z 0 at some depth the generalization to time variable boundary conditions including the switching from pressure to flux condition and vice versa will open the way for multiple events such as storm inter storm scenarios on the other hand the case of multi layered soils involving one or more interfaces of material discontinuity between layers is also being considered currently the main issues with multi front modeling of flow in a multi layered soil have to do with acombination of several factors thus non monotonic pressure profiles require detection and updates of the mobile pressure fronts furthermore when pressure fronts move through a material interface the discontinuous pressure gradient must be dealt with as well as the discontinuous moisture content while pressure itself remains continuous some of these issues may be resolved by using more robust and adaptive ode solvers ongoing work declaration of competing interest the authors

like to extend his sincerest thanks and appreciation to welfare association palestine for their support to his research visit to the imft france appendix 1 this appendix briefly describes the semi analytical procedure for solving the governing equation of the classical green ampt ga infiltration model which corresponds also to the single front model with m 1 front in our generalized moving multi front method let us start with the ga governing equation developed in the text eq 5 renamed here eq a1 a1 d z f dt k s θ s θ d ψ f h p z f t 1 eq a1 is a nonlinear ordinary differential equation ode it can be solved for the unknown wetting front depth z f t using either semi analytical or fully numerical procedures ode solvers we focus here briefly on semi analytical procedures 1 eq a1 can be directly integrated quasi analytically in time to obtain a non differential equation f z f t t 0 where z f t appears implicitly as follows a2 z f t ψ f h p k s t θ s θ d ψ f h p l n 1 z f t ψ f h p 0 2 the short time and large time behavior of z f t can be analyzed directly from this eq a2 without recourse to numerical methods short and large times can distinguished based on the following characteristic time a3 t char 0 5 θ s θ d ψ f h p k s t char plays the same role for green ampt infiltration as the gravitational time t grav in philip s infiltration theory the short time solution t

all times from eq a2 an iterative technique such as picard or newton can be used the problem is to solve iteratively a non differential equation of the form f z 0 the root z f t of the implicit equation f z f t t 0 is obtained iteratively at each fixed timet by picard or newton iterations which yields a quasi analytical solution for z f t at any time t 
6096,a moving multi front mmf method is developed and tested for solving the richards equation governing unsaturated flow in vertical homogeneous porous columns the mmf model is a gridless method it can be viewed as a generalization of the green ampt piston flow approach which models flow as a single abrupt moving front separating saturated and dry regions during infiltration the mmf model further generalizes this concept using a parametrization of unsaturated water retention and conductivity pressure curves it reduces the richards pde to an ode system governing m moving front positions different tests are developed to validate this approach for 1d transient downwards upwards flows submitted to constant and time varying pressure boundary conditions they include i infiltration to deep water tables ii infiltration to shallow water tables iii capillary rise from fixed water tables iv gradual water table rise partially saturated column with evolving pressure condition at bottom the mmf results are compared favorably to finely discretized fixed grid solutions of richards pde analyses of error and accuracy show satisfactory results in terms of water content profiles and boundary fluxes e g infiltration rate keywords moving multi front model green ampt model richards equation unsaturated flow infiltration nonlinear ode system 1 introduction vertical water flows through porous media like soils are of great interest for hydrologists and geotechnical scientists and engineers in general these water flows take place in the presence of air and they are modeled based on a generalized darcy approach darcy buckingham where the water content as well as the pore pressure are taken into account in the unsaturated porous medium unsaturated flows include important phenomena such as downward infiltration and capillary rise due for instance to a rise of the water table infiltration is a downward water flow process through which water penetrates the soil surface and flows towards drier soil due to capillary gradients and gravitational force capillary rise involves a rise of moisture driven upwards by capillary gradients and partially counteracted by the downwards gravity force researchers have developed a number of analytical semi analytical and numerical models or solvers to simulate infiltration and more generally unsaturated flow processes the darcy based richards equation richards 1931 is still the most frequently used equation to describe unsaturated flow and it can be generalized to deal with partially saturated as well as unsaturated porous media and to include other effects like compressibility the richards equation is mathematically a quasi linear pde partial differential equation with nonlinear coefficients numerical solvers have been developed for solving the partially saturated unsaturated richards pde with implicit discretization in time finite volume bigflow3d ababou and bagtzoglou 1993 or galerkin finite element hydrus1d 2d 3d simunek et al 2013 discretization in space and iterative methods to linearize and solve the resulting nonlinear system of algebraic equations modified picard iterations in bigflow3d newton raphson iterations in hydrus1d 2d 3d these two codes will be used here for benchmarking the highly nonlinear nature of the richards pde has attracted the attention of many researchers with the aim of improving or adapting nonlinear iteration methods along with time stepping methods see for instance islam et al 2017 and references therein specifically in islam et al 2017 the authors propose a lookup table method to enhance the performance of picard and newton iterations for highly nonlinear constitutive relationships by sampling adaptively the pressure h at points where the capacity curve c h varies most rapidly in order to avoid divergence of the picard or newton solvers on the other hand due to the complexity and non linear nature of the richards pde analytical and semi analytical solutions to infiltration type problems were developed under special constraints and limitations usually for 1d vertical flow in spite of their limitations the analytical models are useful in several ways for approximate analyses of real infiltration processes but also for evaluating the accuracy of numerical solutions validation benchmarking the literature involves many analytical and quasi analytical models that have been developed over the past years to tackle infiltration problem green and ampt 1911 horton 1933 philip 1957 morel seytoux and khanji 1974 smith and parlange 1978 warrick et al 1991 ghotbi et al 2011 parlange et al 1999 srivastava and yeh 1991 su et al 2017 triadis and broadbridge 2010 wang et al 2009 wu and zhang 2009 among many others morbidelli et al 2018 present a review on infiltration modeling accommodating constant or variable rainfall rate ponding and post ponding infiltration for homogeneous or 2 layered soils they review several such models some of them related to or extensions of the classical green ampt approach see references therein the review paper by morbidelli et al 2018 also points out other infiltration models including the semi analytical model of corradini et al 2000 which models infiltration redistribution in a 2 layer soil their model can be considered as a simplified conceptual model of the richards equation it yields a system of ode s governing suctions vs time at interface and or boundary points when the two layers are identical their model reduces to the green ampt infiltration model under zero ponding depth the green ampt ga piston flow model green and ampt 1911 is one of the most simplified analytical and physically based models that was developed initially for water infiltration under ponded conditions into initially dry homogeneous soils far above the water table the piston flow assumption in the ga model approximates the soil moisture distribution with an abrupt moving front separating a wetted saturated region above the front and a dry region belowit this model implies a constant hydraulic conductivity k s and water content θ s within the wetted zone and it assumes that the abrupt wetting front can be characterized by a constant suction ψ f driving the flow bouwer 1964 bouwer 1966 bouwer 1969 the model assumes that the front suction ψ f is a parameter that characterizes the soil and does not depend on other factors such as initial water content and top boundary condition the ga model has been the focus of many interests because of its simplicity and adaptability for a variety of applications in soil and watershed hydrology other works in the literature extended or analyzed the ga approximation in various ways e g infiltration under time varying conditions chu 1978 warrick et al 2005 layered and heterogeneous soils liu et al 2008 selker et al 1999 yanwei et al 2015 and kacimov et al 2010 sloping soil surfaces chen and young 2006 and gavin and xue 2008 air flow and air compression effects on infiltration morel seytoux 1973 nonuniform initial moisture liu et al 2008 moisture redistribution after infiltration musy and soutter 1991 horizontal imbibition instead of vertical infiltration cao et al 2019 prevedello and armindo 2016 zhang et al 2019 the latter work by zhang et al 2019 also proposes a parametric extension of ga based on a piecewise linear approximation of moisture profiles with two linear zones for horizontal flow similarly meng and yang 2019 present an extended ga model for vertical flow comprising a partition between a saturated zone and an unsaturated zone with assumed linear pressure profile in the unsaturated zone the wet unsaturated partition function is fitted empirically using a neural network in addition the paper by ali et al 2016 presents an extensive review and performance analyses of various explicit approximations of the classical ga solution in comparison with the exact implicit ga equation at this point in comparison with the ga piston flow model it is useful to consider a technical mathematical issue concerning the space time discretization methods used for solving numerically the nonlinear unsaturated flow equations richards pde for example in the numerical based method like finite elements hydrus or finite volumes bigflow the nonlinear richards pde partial differential equation is discretized in both space and time in contrast the ga equation avoids discretizing space z by assuming that the vertical moisture pressure profile is a step function with only one sharp wetting front located at position z t at any given timet warrick et al 2005 used a slightly modified form of the ga infiltration equation under a boundary condition of time variable ponded depth at soil surface they proposed to discretize the ga model in time with relatively coarse time steps and to reformulate it as a classical ga model under piecewise constant boundary conditions over time lee et al 2004 applied the method of lines mol for unsaturated flow problems governed by richards pde this method is based on a fixed discretization of the spatial domain while keeping the time domain continuous this results in a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ode that can be easily solved by available numerical time integrator schemes matthews et al 2004 further considered the mol for multi layered soils and proposed methods to handle the discontinuity of water content and hydraulic conductivity at interfaces between soil layers talbot and ogden 2008 proposed a solution method for 1d vertical infiltration and redistribution based on the ga approximation where they discretize the water content domain θ into equal bins δθ instead of discretizing the vertical spatial dimension this is equivalent to discretizing the water content profiles θ z into vertical bins of width δθ the vertical water movement is decomposed at every time step into a two step process the so called infiltration step is followed by a redistribution step the latter being based on capillary forces ogden et al 2015 subsequently built on the finite water content discretization of talbot and ogden 2008 however this time they used the method of lines mol and they approximate the partial derivative q θ by neglecting a term that contributes to capillary suction gradient ogden et al 2015 their eq 10 they also criticized the previous paper by talbot and ogden 2008 stating that the redistribution sub step used in infiltration simulation was incorrect and they renamed and reformulated this sub step as capillary relaxation which moves water from low to high capillary bin s or region s it has come to our attention while revising this paper that two particle based schemes for solving the richards equation were tested in beaudoin et al 2011 both schemes are lagrangian the mmf method can also be qualified as lagrangian but each of them is different from mmf the first scheme is a particle strength exchange or weighted particle method where each particle has variable mass m t and the second scheme is based on the concept of diffusion velocity or rather pseudo velocity it is based on a transformation from nonlinear capillary diffusion to strongly nonlinear convection haq et al 2010 present a meshless method of lines for solving a 1d nonlinear fourth order pde known as the kuramoto sivashinsky equation their method could potentially be adapted to solve the nonlinear second order richards pde in spite of its name the method is based on a fixed grid of nodes x i and then on an approximate linear decomposition of the unknown u x t on a basis of functions ψ j x with time dependent coefficients λ j t j 1 n the unknowns u x i t are nodal although the unknown coefficients λ j t themselves are indeed meshless and these coefficients are finally used to solve a system of ode s for the nodal unknowns u i t u x i t by the mol approach evoked earlier the objective of this paper is to propose a new quasi analytical efficient alternative model named moving multi fronts mmf we will focus here on a one dimensional 1d vertical system taking into account both saturated and unsaturated flow dynamics in the porous domain we will propose to improve on the classical g a approach by discretizing the state variables themselves the pressure head and consequently the water contents and the hydraulic conductivity along the soil profile such that the nonlinear behavior can easily be accounted for the resulting nonlinear odes can then be solved either by numerical integration or say by explicit runge kutta finite differences in time 1 1 note in all such cases when the resulting equations boil down to single integrals or to integrable 1rst order ode s we refer to these as quasi analytical or semi analytical solutions the mmf tracks movable multi fronts instead of a single ga moving front in similar lagrangian manner in comparison with the meshless mol of haq et al 2010 the mmf method proposed here is completely meshless on the other hand in comparison to the method of discretized moisture content domain by talbot and ogden 2008 and ogden et al 2015 the mmf method to be presented here does not require the two steps process used in their model all processes in the present mmf model capillary gradients and gravity forces are treated at once in a fully coupled manner furthermore their model also neglects some contributions of the non gravitational part containing d θ θ z d is the soil water diffusivity whereas the mmf model does not finally the present mmf can handle as easily co gravity and anti gravity flows examples including downwards infiltration capillary rise sudden and gradual rise or drop of water table will be presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model uniform and a nonuniform initial soil water profiles constant or time dependent pressure head boundary conditions will also be considered 2 method the moving multi front model 2 1 the classical green ampt ga model single moving front the classical ga model is a simplified representation of vertical water infiltration in a dry soil away from the water table deep water table the ga model assumes a saturated piston type flow into the dry soil i e flow is modeled as the displacement of a single sharp wetting front into a uniformly dry homogeneous soil the front abruptly separates two distinct regions a fully saturated region upstream above and a very dry region downstream below the sharp wetting front is pulled downwards by gravity and capillary suction forces as shown in fig 1 this model is also called single front model because as in the classical ga approach it is based on the movement of a single front z f t accordingly based on the usual green ampt piston flow hypotheses we assume that there exists a well defined wetting front separating the fully saturated and the totally dry regions as shown in fig 1 where the dashed line represents the ga approximation the wetting front is assumed to be characterized by some effective constant suction head ψ f or pressure head h f ψ f considered to be a characteristic parameter of the soil the ga model approximation divides the soil column into two zones each zone having apriori its own hydraulic conductivity and water content k θ top zone this zone is totally saturated according ga approximation it extends from the ground surface z 0 to the moving wetting front z z f t in this zone we have k k s θ θ s bottom zone this zone is the totally dry region extending from the moving wetting front z z f t up to infinite depth it is a semi infinite zone the flux is null in this zone since the initial soil is totally dry k 0 θ θ d where θ d is also denoted θ r residual water content let us now develop the governing equations under these assumptions using darcy s flux gradient law and mass conservation principles global darcy equation and ga infiltration rate first one develops a global approximation of darcy s law q z t k h z g for the entire saturated region this is obtained by integrating q z t vertically at any fixed timet through the saturated region i e from the ponded surface at z 0 to the wetting front at depth z z f t this procedure necessarily assumes the existence of an effective front pressure h f or front suction ψ f parameter in terms of pressure head h and with z downwards the global version of the pressure gradient h z is δ h δ z h f h p z f t also since the transmission zone is saturated in the ga model we have k k s in that zone this yields finally the ga relation for the global integrated flux q t or infiltration rate f t in terms of pressure heads 1a f t q t k s h f h p z f t g or equivalently in terms of suction heads ψ h a n d ψ f h f 1b f t q t k s ψ f h p z f t g note that h p represents the positive pressure condition due to ponded water depth at soil surface h p 0 the other variables and parameters are defined as follows f t m s is the infiltration rate at a given time t k s m s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the saturated transition zone z f t m is the depth of the moving wetting front at time t it is also the vertical extent of the saturated zone ψ f m is the capillary suction head at the wetting front g dimensionless represents normalized gravity g g z g with g 1 if the oz axis is directed downwards as is the case here note that the global darcy flux density q t obtained by integration through the saturated region is assumed to represent also the infiltration rate at soil surface denoted f t m s the above relations for the single front ga infiltration rate can also be generalized in terms of the gravity vector g as follows simply by changing the oz axis direction let g 1 in the present case for water infiltration with z directed downwards let g 1 with z directed upwards e g to treat capillary rise or water table rise let g 0 e g for horizontal flow model and or in the absence of gravity global mass balance and closure of ga infiltration equations the previous relation of eq 1 is not closed because it contains two unknowns the infiltration rate f t and the wetting front depth z f t the closure of this problem is obtained by applying a global mass balance principle at the scale of the transmission zone thus neglecting the flux in the initially dry zone just below the wetting front q d k d 0 the depth of the wetting front z f t can be related to the cumulative infiltration f t by the following mass conservation principle 2 f t θ s θ d z f t taking the derivative of the cumulative infiltration f t with respect to time yields 3 f t df dt θ s θ d d z f dt where f t m is the cumulative infiltration at time t θ s is the saturated water content or porosity θ d is the dry initial water content if the soil is initially very dry then we have ideally θ d θ r the initially dry water content is the residual water content of the soil in that case the initial conductivity of the soil vanishes k θ d k d 0 and for this reason the flux q d below the wetting front is negligible or null at all times note also that eq 3 can also be obtained by applying mass conservation around the moving front z f t as follows 4a q top t q bot t θ top θ bot d z f dt where q top t f t q bot t 0 θ top θ s and θ bot θ d θ r the approximate equalities become exact if θ d θ r exactly implying q bot t 0 q top t f t whence 4b f t θ s θ d d z f dt now finally combining eq 1 and eq 3 leads to the governing equation of the ga model 5 d z f dt k s θ s θ d ψ f h p z f t 1 eq 5 is a nonlinear ordinary differential equation ode it can be solved for the unknown wetting front depth z f t using semi analytical procedures which are briefly described in appendix 1 for the sake of completeness alternatively eq 5 could also be solved directly numerically in discrete time t n using any available robust ode solver based for instance on explicit runge kutta methods or more general combinations of explicit implicit temporal discretization methods which are available for example in matlab once z f t is determined eq 1 or eq 4b can be used to obtain the infiltration rate f t finally this single front approach can be considered also for other unsaturated flow processes such as upwards flow and other flow conditions such as redistribution however the single front approximation is not accurate in general except if the soil is very coarse grained with a narrow range of pore sizes and initially very dry outside the wetted zone otherwise the single front approach is inaccurate 2 2 the moving multi fronts mmf model in this article the approximate green ampt ga model is generalized to the new moving multi front mmf model in order to deal efficiently and accurately with 1d vertical flows in partially saturated unsaturated porous media taking into account both gravity and capillary effects on the process as realistically as possible in the new mmf model the 1d flow process governed by richards pde is represented more accurately for example the water content and pressure profiles cannot be reduced to the movement of a single sharp front in cases such as water infiltration in a fine grained soil and or an initially wet soil and or in the presence of a shallow water table the main idea underlying the mmf approach is to extend the classical ga model by introducing more moving fronts in order to allow a better representation of the vertical spatial distribution of state variables vertical moisture and pressure profiles thus at any given time t water content θ z will varied with depth in a more realistic step by step or gradual fashion and similarly for pressure head h z and hydraulic conductivity k z k h z therefore in the mmf method the unsaturated profiles k z and θ z are approximated by m moving fronts this is shown schematically in fig 2 for the moisture profile θ z with this parametrization of the multi front model we expect that the accuracy of the results will be improved as the soil column is divided approximated by a larger number of moving fronts over depth accordingly a set of iso values or fronts of the state variables such as suction ψ f will be selected within a range that depends on initial boundary conditions and then tracked through time based on their positions z f ψ f t position of a given iso value or front ψ f given a time discretization this formulation implies that we are looking at each new time step for the new position z f t n δ t n of the state variable s iso value or front clearly no spatial discretization is required for simplicity and clarity we describe now the mmf model specifically for the case of downwards infiltration in a very dry soil other cases of 1d flow are treated with the same mmf model by changing initial and boundary conditions see test problems in section 4 assume we have defined m fronts each characterized by its own suction value subscript f refers to front ψ f ψ f 1 ψ f 2 ψ fm the main objective of the mmf model is to find the positions of the fronts z f i t at each time step z f t z f 1 t z f 2 t z f 3 t z fm t according to fig 2 the multi front approximation divides the 1d column into m 1 zones 2 2 zones are inter frontal regions conductivity k and flux q are zonal or mid frontal quantities accordingly the zonal quantities like the conductivity k of zone i will be later subscripted by i 1 2 zones 1 to m these zones are comprised between the ground surface z 0 and the last mth moving front z z f m t they are the m transition zones from the totally saturated zone to the totally dry one the parameters of each zone number i are k i k s θ i θ s zone m 1 this is the totally dry region it is a semi infinite dry zone below the mth moving front z z f m t the flux in this zone is null and the parameters are k m 1 0 θ m 1 θ d the flow in each zone i e between each pair of successive fronts is governed by darcy s equation while a mass conservation equation is satisfied around each moving front let us now develop the governing equations using darcy s flux gradient law and mass conservation principles we will use the suction head ψ z t as the main state variable recalling that pressure head h z t is just the opposite of suction head h ψ the advantage of using suction ψ is that it is positive in the unsaturated zone which is our main concern here recall also that z indicates depth downwards darcy s law applied between pairs of moving fronts applying darcy s equation for zone i where 1 i m 6 q i 1 2 t k i 1 2 h z g k i 1 2 ψ f i ψ f i 1 z f i t z f i 1 t 1 where quantities q i 1 2 t are mid frontal fluxes defined at intermediate positions between fronts z f i 1 t and z f i t equivalently each flux q i 1 2 t approximates the flux in the mobile zone z f i 1 t z f i t similarly quantities like k i 1 2 are mid frontal or zonal hydraulic conductivities note that k i 1 2 does not depend on time because it is a function solely of the two iso values ψ f i ψ f i 1 through the conductivity suction curve k ψ in the case of infiltration in a dry soil the mid front flux is assumed to be null through the bottom dry zone i e between the next to last front m and the last front m 1 this emulates the case of a semi infinite initially dry soil column q m 1 2 t 0 mass conservation around each moving front moreover applying mass conservation equation around each of the m moving fronts z f i t we obtain 7 q i 1 2 t q i 1 2 t θ i 1 2 θ i 1 2 d z i dt where again q i 1 2 t represents a mid frontal flux and θ i 1 2 is the mid frontal water content between fronts z i 1 t and z i t note that θ i 1 2 does not depend on time because it is a function solely of the two iso values ψ f i ψ f i 1 through the water retention curve θ ψ recall that the bottom mid front flux is null q m 1 2 t 0 in addition for the same reasons the bottom water content is equal to the initial dry water content that is θ m 1 2 θ d where we usually take θ d θ r residual moisture for infiltration in a very dry semi infinite soil column as explained earlier the mass conservation eq 7 combined with darcy s eq 6 applied to the moving fronts yields a system of 1rst order nonlinear ordinary differential equations ode s or more generally here a system of algebraic differential equations this system can be solved numerically for the unknown front positions z f i t subject to initial condition z f i 0 the numerical solution of such a system can be accomplished in discrete time t n using robust ode solvers based for instance on explicit runge kutta methods or more general combinations of explicit implicit temporal discretization methods a suite of robust and reliable ode solvers is available in matlab with possible choices including stiff systems and also systems that may require computationally more intensive implicit methods in this article an explicit stiff matlab ode solver function was used mainly ode15s in order to solve the system and obtain the evolving front positions z f i t once the evolution of front positions z f i t is determined the darcy eq 6 can be applied to calculate fluxes between the moving fronts including the top flux q 1 1 2 t which represents the infiltration rate f t the bottom flux is null for the infiltration problem in dry soil but it can be nonnull and may need to be calculated e g in the case of initially wet soils and or in the presence of a shallow water table indeed various types of unsaturated flow problems will be treated with the mmf model see next section 4 for instance in the case of infiltration to a shallow water table the position of front ψ 0 is fixed at bottom because the water table is fixed at some finite depth and because it corresponds physically to iso value ψ 0 in that case the bottom mid frontal flux q m 1 2 t is not null and it can be computed as a function of time using the mid frontal darcy eq 6 3 parametrization of the mmf model generalized green ampt as in the classical ga model the performance of the proposed mmf models depends on a suitable estimation of the model parameters these parameters are the constant suction head ψ fi at each front f i the mid front unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k i 1 2 and the mid front water content θ i 1 2 between successive fronts for clarity we start with the parametrization of the simpler single front model ga before developing the parametrization of the multi front model mmf 3 1 parametrization of the single front model classical ga model in the classical ga or single front model the main parameter is the front suction ψ f which needs to be related to soil hydraulic characteristics several expressions for ψ f have been suggested in the literature e g panikar and nanjappa 1977 musy and soutter 1991 here we select the following two expressions 1 the first expression for ψ f proposed here corresponds to the point of the inflection of the water retention curve θ h or θ ψ at which the specific moisture capacity c h θ h h is maximum as shown in fig 3 the suction head at this inflection point can be treated as a global capillary length scale of the porous medium for the van genuchten model ψ f it can be easily calculated analytically e g ababou 1991 and alastal et al 2010 8 ψ f 1 α 1 1 n 1 n where α and n are the van genuchten parameters of the water retention curve θ ψ 1 the second proposed estimate of wetting front suction ψ f is the following modified from neuman 1976 and originally proposed by bouwer bouwer 1964 bouwer 1966 under the name critical pressure 9 ψ f 0 k r ψ d ψ where k r ψ k ψ k s is the relative conductivity curve vs suction this estimation of ψ f is illustrated graphically in fig 4 in the case of the exponential gardner conductivity curve k r ψ e x p α g ψ the resulting front suction is simply ψ f 1 α g 3 2 parametrization of the multi front model the parameters k i 1 2 and θ i 1 2 of the multi front model can be determined by different methods we propose here two possible classes of parametrization methods the first method is the one used in section 4 on test problems 1 the first parametrization method is a simple approach based on discretizing the water content θ and the hydraulic conductivity k into m 1 frontal values θ i and k i defining m equally spaced segments alternatively a variant of this method consists in discretizing directly the suction head ψ ψ i and then obtain the corresponding θ i and k i after this discretization average mid frontal values of water content θ i 1 2 and hydraulic conductivity k i 1 2 are calculated for each inter frontal zone z i 1 t z i t based on the frontal values θ i 1 θ i and k i 1 k i which do not depend on time but only on the corresponding suction iso values ψ i in the four test problems of section 4 the selected averaging method is the arithmetic mean for θ and the harmonic mean for k accordingly the mid frontal values are calculated as follows θ i 1 2 θ i 1 θ i 2 k i 1 2 k i 1 1 k i 1 2 1 the second method uses an integral criterion to calculate the fronts suctions ψ i based on pre selected values of mid frontal conductivities k i 1 2 this approach generalizes the parametrization method described in eq 9 where the front suction ψ f of the single front ga model is obtained from an integral of the relative hydraulic conductivity curve k r ψ for multiple fronts a generalization of this method consists in maintaining equal areas under the curve k r ψ an illustration of this method for m 4 fronts is shown in fig 5 this parametrization method keeps the area under the curve k r ψ equal to the area under the discrete front model approximation defined by m discrete frontal suction values ψ i and the corresponding frontal conductivities k i for example to find or adjust the front suction ψ f 2 the area under the k r ψ curve between ψ inter 2 and ψ inter 3 is set equal to the area under the discrete approximation between ψ inter 2 and ψ inter 3 this step is repeated between each two pairs of intermediate suctions in order to obtain the corresponding suction pressure at each front ψ f i note the notation ψ inter i in fig 5 corresponds to inter frontal or mid front suction values also denoted ψ i 1 2 in the mmf equations at which inter frontal water contents θ i 1 2 and hydraulic conductivities k i 1 2 are also calculated 4 test problems validation and performance of mmf model to evaluate the proposed mmf model the solutions obtained from the gridless mmf system of ode s are compared to other solutions obtained by classical numerical solvers of the richards pde in order to provide benchmark tests for our gridless mmf model our choice here is to use extremely refined space time grids in the classical richards pde solvers in order to use their numerical solutions as surrogate true solutions typically the number m of fronts in our tests will be one order of magnitude less in the mmf model than the number of grid nodes used in the richards pde solvers specifically in this article we compare our model to both hydrus1d and bigflow3d codes hydrus1d is a well documented and tested numerical model for simulating the 1d movement of water heat and multiple solutes in variably saturated unsaturated porous media it numerically solves the richards pde for saturated unsaturated water flow coupled to fickian based advection dispersion equations for heat and solute transport hydrus1d is based on an implicit discretization in time and 1d galerkin finite elements discretization in space simunek et al 2013 the linearization of the space time discretized system is handled with newton raphson iterations in hydrus1d hydrus 1d also solves advective diffusive dispersive solute and several other transport processes coupled to unsaturated water flow bigflow3d is a 3d finite volume flow code that has been widely documented tested and benchmarked ababou and bagtzoglou 1993 ababou et al 1992 bigflow3d solves the 3d richards pde based on a generalized darcy type flux law with a mixed pressure moisture formulation of mass conservation it uses an implicit discretization in time and finite volume discretization in space the linearization of the discretized space time system is handled with a modified picard iteration loop in bigflow3d it is capable of simulating various types of partially saturated flows and solves other flow problems such as planar groundwater flow seawater intrusion and surface flow governed by the diffusive wave equation there are several reasons for using two different classical codes for comparisons with the new mmf approach first we do not wish to rely entirely on a single code secondly there is some value added to these comparisons given that the two selected codes are quite different finite elements vs finite volumes infact our auxiliary benchmark tests show that hydrus bigflow s responses are undistinguishable although presenting these auxiliary results is not the purpose of this paper thirdly there also minor technical reasons for using one code or the other depending on post processing needs to sumup the validation of the mmf model proposed in this study is based on comparisons with the classical fixed grid numerical solvers hydrus1d and bigflow3d these classical richards pde solvers are considered as surrogates for exact solutions when used with extreme refinement in both space and time a fine regular mesh δz will be used here corresponding to about one thousand fixed grid points in both solvers and the time step δt will be kept extremely small as well e g one second or less for the fine sand tests the criteria to be used for comparisons and validation of the mmf method are the transient water content and or pressure head profiles θ z t h z t and also the temporal evolution of boundary fluxes top or bottom boundary flux depending on the proposed test 4 1 richards equation constitutive relations the richards pde richards 1931 is obtained by the combination of darcy s law with mass balance equation the 1d mixed form of richards pde describing vertical water flow in variably saturated unsaturated homogeneous soils is expressed as follows 10 θ h t z k h h z g k h where h m is pressure head θ h m 3 m 3 is the volumetric water content of the soil k h m s is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil t s is time z m is the vertical coordinate taken positive downwards in this work z depth g dimensionless is the normalized vertical gravity component 1 in this work in the case of unsaturated flow both the hydraulic conductivity k and water content θ are functions of pressure head h various models have been suggested to describe the constitutive relationships θ h k h in this article the unsaturated hydrodynamic properties of the soils are described with the soil water retention model θ h of vangenuchten van genuchten 1980 in combination with the functional model of hydraulic conductivity k θ proposed by mualem 1976 the water retention function is given by 11 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m where θ r is the residual water content θ s is the saturated water content α m 1 is a scaling factor that represents an inverse capillary length scale n is a dimensionless real number exponent or shape parameter related theoretically to pore size distribution usually n 1 and m is also an exponent related to n by the relation m 1 1 n inserting the van genuchten curve θ h in mualem s functional model k θ yields the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity pressure curve k h 12 k h k s 1 α h n m 2 1 1 1 1 α h n m 2 where k s m s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil for more details on unsaturated constitutive relations see ababou 2018 vol 1 sec 4 2 sec 4 3 sec 5 4 4 2 soil properties two different soils namely fine sand fs and guelph loam gl were used in this study to evaluate the performance of the mmf model the fine sand and the loam are presented in alastal et al 2010 the soil water retention curves are presented in fig 6 the curves indicated that the fine sand has a sharp transition from the saturated to the dry water content green ampt soil behavior in contrast with the guelph loam which have gradual transition behavior the soil hydrodynamic parameters are summarized in table 1 based on van genuchten model 4 3 benchmark tests results and discussion the following tests were used to validate the mmf model and to show its applicability for a broad range of cases flow regimes and soil types the selected tests are as follows infiltration in a dry soil i e towards a deep water table the purpose is to test and validate the mmf model for a prototype case for which the classical ga model was theoretically designed downwards infiltration in an initially dry semi infinite soil column infiltration to shallow water table the purpose is to test and validate the mmf model for non uniform initial water content along the column and such that the vertical profiles of water content and the hydraulic conductivity are non monotonic capillary rise problem to test and validate the mmf model for anti gravity flow problem gradual rise of water table to test and validate the mmf model for variable pressure head boundary condition in all the tests the performance of the mmf model was analyzed mainly in terms of the temporal evolutions of two variables the water content profiles θ z t and the boundary flux q t 4 3 1 infiltration to deep water table test1 the test considered here is analogous to semi infinite infiltration of the classical ga and it is characterized by monotonic water content profiles this test treated 1d water infiltration towards deep water table to ensure that the soil is initially dry under infiltration the top boundary condition is subjected to saturation and the wetting front started to move downwards into the previously dry soil where the simulation should be stop far before the front reaches the bottom water table here is a summary of the initial and boundary conditions initial condition t 0 h z 0 h 0 depending on the soil as explained below boundary conditions top bc z 0 h 0 t 0 which corresponds to saturation bottom bc z l h l t h 0 which is compatible with the initial condition this validation test was applied for the two soils guelph loam gl and fine sand fs with the properties presented earlier in table 1 the chosen value of initial pressure head is h 0 1 m for the gl soil corresponding to a moderately dry water content θ 0 414 and h 0 0 5 m for the fs soil corresponding to almost totally dry water content θ 0 033 see table 1 for comparison of these initial water contents with the saturated and residual water contents of each soil the column length is 1 m deep l 1 m the vertical domain of the numerical pde solver is discretized into fine discretization of 1001 nodes δz 0 001 m to ensure a better reference for comparison results while only 30 moving fronts are used in mmf model to prove the robustness of the mmf even with a moderate number of fronts the results show the downwards evolution of water content profiles as well as the infiltration rate vs time as shown in fig 7 for the guelph loam and fig 8 for the fine sand comparison between the meshless mmf model with m 30 fronts and the numerical solver with n 1001 fixed nodes shows an excellent agreement between the two models for the evolution of water content profiles and for the infiltration rate as well and this for each of the two soils tested here fine sand and guelph loam 4 3 2 infiltration to shallow water table test 2 this test deals with water infiltration to a shallow water table the flow regime in this case differs from the previous one by two distinct characteristics i the initial condition is non uniform along the column both for moisture θ z and pressure h z and ii the state variable profiles obtained for this flow test are non monotonic in space vertically consider a homogeneous soil column of length l 1 m of guelph loam gl with the hydraulic properties described earlier in table 1 the initial pressure head distribution h z 0 is hydrostatic implying that h z 0 is a linear function of z starting from h 0 at the water table to h l at ground surface the lower and upper boundary conditions are zero pressure head these initial and boundary conditions are summarized below initial condition t 0 h z 0 z l where z is depth measured from the ground surface boundary conditions top bc z 0 h 0 t 0 corresponding to a constant saturation of ground surface bottom bc z l h l t 0 corresponding to a fixed water table at depth z l note this bottom bc is compatible with the initial condition at z l in the numerical simulation performed with the hydrus1d code the soil column is discretized into 1001 nodes in order to obtain a finely discretized reference solution while we use only 30 moving fronts in the mmf model fig 9 shows a good fit between the results of the two methods with respect to the evolution of water content profiles as well as the infiltration rate vs time the agreement between the two models can be enhanced by increasing the number of fronts in the mmf model a quantitative analysis of global error in terms of the number of fronts m for this test is presented separately in section 5 it should be noted that in this test the soil column is partially saturated it contains a saturated zone that increases with time until the column reaches full saturation at steady state large times as a consequence some pressure fronts should disappear with time when the corresponding pressure iso values no longer exist to solve this problem an auxiliary numerical scheme was implemented in the ode solver of the mmf model to monitor this process and to manage the emergence and disappearance of pressure iso values fronts this auxiliary numerical scheme includes two steps 1 detection and removal of any successive fronts z i t z i 1 t whose positions may be approaching each other athreshold value δz was pre defined in the script and 2 redistribution of the remaining front positions through spatial interpolation techniques 4 3 3 capillary rise from a fixed water table test3 in this test we analyze unsaturated capillary rise in a soil or porous medium this test in contrast with the previous tests represents an anti gravity flow problem a soil column of length l 1 m made up of the guelph loam soil gl is assumed to be relatively dry initially see initial condition below a zero pressure head is suddenly imposed at the bottom boundary which corresponds to imposing a fixed water table at depth z l for all times t 0 the initial and boundary conditions of this validation test are as follows initial condition t 0 h z 0 1 m corresponding to initial water content θ 0 414 boundary conditions top bc z 0 h 0 t 1 m which is compatible with the initial condition bottom bc z l h l t 0 which corresponds to a fixed water table at z l note the initial pressure condition h z 0 1 m corresponds to a water content θ 0 414 and a degree of saturation s 64 9 this may seem fairly wet but in fact the corresponding initial conductivity of the soil is 1 81e 7 m s about 20 times smaller than the saturated conductivity ks 3 66e 6 m s therefore the soil is initially relatively dry in the sense that it is initially poorly conductive in order to verify the accuracy of our mmf model a numerical benchmark simulation was implemented using the finite element code hydrus1d with n 1001 nodes versus the present mmf model with m 30 moving fronts fig 10 shows an excellent agreement between the two models both in terms of moisture and pressure profiles top plots and in terms of flux evolution q t bottom plot note that q t represents the upward flux through the water table during the capillary rise process the agreement is remarkable given that only 30moving fronts were used in the mmf method 4 3 4 gradual rise of a water table test4 the objective of this test is to validate the mmf model against time varying pressure head boundary condition in addition unlike the previous tests the proposed test involves a partially saturated unsaturated soil column a semi infinite fine sand column fs with properties defined in table 1 is initially hydrostatic with a water table located at elevation 0 5 m measured from the bottom of the column in this test the vertical coordinate is elevation rather than depth the water table is forced upward by gradually rising the bottom pressure h 0 t from h 0 0 5 m to h 0 1 0 m for the purpose of this test we select this time varying entry pressure function h 0 t to increase monotonically like a quarter of a sinusoidal function of the form h 0 t 0 5 0 5 sin ω t for t 0 t 4 with ω 2 π t and t 600 s therefore the bottom boundary pressure gradually increases from h 0 0 5 m to h 0 1 0 m within 150 s in this benchmark test four output variables are selected to compare the two models the water content profiles θ z t pressure head profiles h z t the evolution of water table elevation z wt t and the flux q 0 t calculated at the bottom boundary fig 11 shows an excellent fit between the mmf model with m 30 moving fronts and the numerical solver of richards pde bigflow3d code with n 1001 nodes and a fine time step δt 0 2 s the agreement is excellent between the two methods with only 30 moving fronts in the mmf recall that the flow is forced by the positive bottom pressure h 0 t imposed at bottom the calculated water table elevation z wt t is different from the imposed pressure h 0 t as can be seen from the bottom left plot of fig 11 the bottom flux q 0 t was calculated in the mmf by using darcy s law between the first two bottom fronts 5 performance and accuracy in this section the numerical performance of the proposed mmf model is studied in two different ways 1 through global analyses of error norms moisture content and surface flux vs number of fronts m and 2 through direct analyses of surface flux f t m s for several values of the number of fronts m 1 2 4 8 where the case m 1 is taken to mean the classical green ampt model in the case of test1 infiltration in the case of deep water table 5 1 numerical analyses of error norms in this section the gridless mmf model is evaluated in terms of its accuracy an appropriate global error norm ε is defined calculated and then analyzed as a function of the number m of moving fronts since analytical solutions are not generally available for this type of nonlinear transient flow problem given the highly nonlinear soil properties involved we use here the classical numerical solvers with a large number of nodes e g n 1001 nodes as a surrogate for the exact solution with this in mind the error is calculated for two types of output variables the space time distribution of water content θ z t and the time dependent boundary flux e g infiltration rate f t we choose to implement error norm criteria for test2 of the previous section i e water infiltration to a shallow water table guelph loam soil section 4 3 2 test2 for the water content the global error is calculated by applying a discrete form of the space time euclidian l2 norm where integration is replaced by discrete summation over both space and time as follows 13 ε θ 1 i δ z i n δ t n n i θ num z i t n θ mmf z i t n 2 δ z i δ t n 1 2 where θ num is the volumetric water content resulted from the fine resolution numerical solver with large number of nodes n 1001 θ mmf is the volumetric water content resulted from the mmf model with a moderate number of moving fronts here m 1000 it is worth mentioning that in order to calculate the above error we interpolate linearly the moving front solution θ mmf between the fixed nodes of the classical numerical solver hydrus1d since the positions of the mmf moving fronts do not coincide with the spatial discretization fixed nodes of the classical numerical solver for the boundary flux f t which corresponds to the infiltration rate for test2 the global error is calculated by applying a discrete form of the euclidian l2 norm over time as follows 14 ε f 1 n δ t n n f num t n f mmf t n 2 δ t n 1 2 where f num is the boundary flux or infiltration rate resulting from the fine resolution numerical solver with a large number of fixed nodes n 1001 f mmf is the boundary flux or infiltration rate resulting from the mmf model with a moderate number of moving fronts here m 1000 for water contents θ z t the behavior of the normalized global error as a function of the numberm of moving fronts is plotted in fig 12 on a log log scale it is clear from the graph of fig 12 that the error decreases as a power function with the number of fronts m of the mmf model based on a log log regression of the numerical error norm vs m it is found that the error norm ε θ behaves as follows 15 ε θ 0 6387 m 1 92 m 3 m 3 the accuracy of the mmf model is characterized by the number of moving fronts m or by its inverse 1 m note that the 1 m parameter of the mmf model is similar to the mesh size parameter δz of classical models e g linear finite elements for hydrus1d structured finite volumes for bigflow3d the conclusion from fig 12 and eq 15 is that in terms of 1 m the order of accuracy of the mmf method is close to 2 we can conclude in particular that the method is consistent and provides a good approximation of water content profiles one should also investigate further whether the estimated error norm ε θ aglobal measure of error is small relative to the calculated water content profiles θ z t one way to answer this question is to compare the global error ε θ m 3 m 3 to the range of moisture contents of infiltration flow test2 fig 9 in this test infiltration to shallow water table the range of moisture contents is defined by the initial moisture at the top boundary θ 0 0 41 and by the saturated water content θ s 0 52 imposed as top boundary condition also as bottom watertable condition thus the moisture range in this test is θ s θ 0 0 11 m 3 m 3 with this in mind let us evaluate the relative error norm ε θ θ s θ 0 for m 30 fronts we obtain 9 3217e 04 0 11 which yields finally ε θ θ s θ 0 0 0085 the global relative error on moisture content θ is less than 1 for m 30fronts for the error on the infiltration rate or boundary flux f t a similar power law behavior is obtained the calculated global error ε f decreases as a power law with the number of moving fronts m of the mmf model as can be seen in fig 13 based again on a linear regression in log log scale the error ε f appears to follow the power law 16 ε f 8 696 10 6 m 0 99 m s the conclusion from fig 13 and eq 16 is that in terms of 1 m the order of accuracy of the mmf method is about 1 for the flux variable we can infer in particular that the method is consistent for flux calculations as well technically one should also investigate whether the flux error norm ε f aglobal measure of error is small relative to the calculated flux f t at various times the flux error norm obtained for m 30fronts is ε f 2 9769e 07 m s it is quite small compared to the maximum flux rate f 3 5e 5 m s observed at early times in fig 9 test2 and it remains reasonably small compared to the final steady flux which is close to the saturated conductivity of the guelphloam k s 3 66 10 6 m s 5 2 performance of mmf front in terms of infiltration rate f t vs number of fronts the temporal evolution of surface flux f t is a particularly important variable in many applications of soil hydrology for this reason we now focus on infiltration test1 deep water table in order to directly compare the surface flux f t m s obtained for several values of the number of fronts m 1 2 4 8 including the classical green ampt model represented by the case m 1 in that case m 1front the classical green ampt solution is implemented here with the widely used front suction model ψ f of bouwer bouwer 1964 bouwer 1966 given by eq 9 and selecting k s and θ s for the values of mid frontal conductivity and water content fig 14 shows that the infiltration rate agreement between the mmf model and a richards pde solver hydrus1d improves rapidly with m and becomes almost perfect for m 8 which is remarkable the figure also shows that the singlefront model classical green ampt does not perform very well as expected especially for this type of loamy soil as a reminder a comparison for m 30 fronts was also shown earlier in fig 7 in conclusion the present mmf model generalized green ampt performs quite well for just a relatively small number of fronts m 8 in terms of infiltration rate 6 conclusions and outlook the moving multi front mmf model presented in this paper is essentially a meshless method for calculating vertical water flows in unsaturated or partially saturated homogeneous soil columns under the combined influence of gravity and capillary gradients the mmf model requires the solution of a nonlinear ode system governing the positions z fi t of the moving iso values or fronts i 1 m each front position z fi t corresponds to a fixed frontal suction ψ i to which corresponds a pressure h i ψ i and a water content θ i θ h i from which pressure profiles h z fi t t and moisture profiles θ z fi t t are plotted at any desired time t to sum up the mmf model reduces the nonlinear richards pde partial differential equation governing unsaturated flow to a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ode s governing the positions of moving fronts the four benchmark test problems of section 4 served to validate the mmf model with a moderate number of fronts m 30 by comparing it to classical pde solvers implemented on extremely refined grids n 1001 nodes these test problems cover a broad range of flow regime including downwards infiltration upwards flow initially uniform or non uniform boundary conditions partially saturated flow and time varying boundary condition the benchmark results showed a very good fit with the mmf model in terms of transient pressure and moisture profiles and in terms of temporal evolutions boundary fluxes and free surface in addition two error norms were studied the error norm ε θ of the space time distribution of moisture θ z t and the error norm ε f of the time variable infiltration rate or flux f t it was found that these error norms behave like a power of the number of frontsm ε m ω with power ω 1 92 for ε θ and ω 0 99 for ε f it can be concluded first that the mmf method is numerically consistent in the sense that the error norm ε decreases as m increases secondly it is interesting to note that in terms of 1 m the order of accuracy of mmf is close to 2 for water content θ and 1 for flux the same order of accuracy is obtained for instance with classical centered finite difference schemes applied to the richards pde with regular mesh size δ z the order of accuracy is o δ z 2 for pressure or moisture and o δ z 1 for the calculated mid nodal flux see truncation error analyses in vauclin et al 1979 and ababou et al 1992 among others further analyses and rescaling of our calculated errors indicate that the relative errors on both moisture and flux are quite small typically 1 using only m 30 moving fronts in the mmf model in conclusion the behavior of the mmf method is quite satisfactory it appears from global errors that only a few tens of fronts are needed to obtain accurate solutions as can be seen from direct comparisons with the classical solvers in section 4 3 tests1 2 3 4 and from the error norm plots of section 5 1 in addition the infiltration rates f t of test1 were systematically compared with the reference solution for m 1 2 4 8 and these tests confirmed the previous results infiltration rate f t is in very good agreement for all times even for moderate number of fronts e g m 8 overall the results obtained with the meshless mmf model compared with finely discretized space time solutions of the nonlinear richards pde demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of the mmf the mmf model has distinct advantages including its ability to track directly a given pressure or water content in time and its robustness in terms of pressure and moisture profiles note cpu times benchmark tests were not implemented because the classical fe or fv solvers hydrus bigflow are coded in compiled languages fortran while our mmf method at this stage is programmed in an interpreted language matlab interpreted languages are notoriously slower than compiled languages in terms of execution time and the cpu times comparisons would be meaningless nevertheless the performance results of mmf already suggest that cpu times could be significantly reduced with mmf once re programmed in a compiled language such cpu time tests should be run for equal precision of results given these encouraging results the mmf model is currently undergoing several extensions current work is devoted to generalizing the mmf method to include flux and pressure gradient boundary conditions such as a prescribed darcy flux q z m s at ground surface e g to simulate internal drainage under zero flux and or a gravitational boundary condition h z 0 at some depth the generalization to time variable boundary conditions including the switching from pressure to flux condition and vice versa will open the way for multiple events such as storm inter storm scenarios on the other hand the case of multi layered soils involving one or more interfaces of material discontinuity between layers is also being considered currently the main issues with multi front modeling of flow in a multi layered soil have to do with acombination of several factors thus non monotonic pressure profiles require detection and updates of the mobile pressure fronts furthermore when pressure fronts move through a material interface the discontinuous pressure gradient must be dealt with as well as the discontinuous moisture content while pressure itself remains continuous some of these issues may be resolved by using more robust and adaptive ode solvers ongoing work declaration of competing interest the authors

like to extend his sincerest thanks and appreciation to welfare association palestine for their support to his research visit to the imft france appendix 1 this appendix briefly describes the semi analytical procedure for solving the governing equation of the classical green ampt ga infiltration model which corresponds also to the single front model with m 1 front in our generalized moving multi front method let us start with the ga governing equation developed in the text eq 5 renamed here eq a1 a1 d z f dt k s θ s θ d ψ f h p z f t 1 eq a1 is a nonlinear ordinary differential equation ode it can be solved for the unknown wetting front depth z f t using either semi analytical or fully numerical procedures ode solvers we focus here briefly on semi analytical procedures 1 eq a1 can be directly integrated quasi analytically in time to obtain a non differential equation f z f t t 0 where z f t appears implicitly as follows a2 z f t ψ f h p k s t θ s θ d ψ f h p l n 1 z f t ψ f h p 0 2 the short time and large time behavior of z f t can be analyzed directly from this eq a2 without recourse to numerical methods short and large times can distinguished based on the following characteristic time a3 t char 0 5 θ s θ d ψ f h p k s t char plays the same role for green ampt infiltration as the gravitational time t grav in philip s infiltration theory the short time solution t t char is dominated by capillary suction a4 z f t ψ f h p t t char the large time solution t t char is dominated solely by gravity a5 z f t k s t θ s θ d 3 to obtain the more general solution z f t at all times from eq a2 an iterative technique such as picard or newton can be used the problem is to solve iteratively a non differential equation of the form f z 0 the root z f t of the implicit equation f z f t t 0 is obtained iteratively at each fixed timet by picard or newton iterations which yields a quasi analytical solution for z f t at any time t 
6097,the rainwater source control rsc is an important part of modern urban stormwater management to quantitatively evaluate the role of source control in the overall urban drainage system rainfall depths of different return periods and rainfall durations were calculated based on the rainfall intensity formulas of 342 cities in china and used to design size traditional urban drainage pipes furthermore design rainfalls for rsc facilities corresponding to four volume capture ratio of annual rainfall vcrar 60 70 80 and 90 were determined using the 30 yr historical rainfall data under the combination of rsc facilities with vcrar or sizes and the traditional drainage facilities trdfs the contribution of rsc facilities and trdfs to capture or convey rainwater was quantified for the rainfall with different durations 5 120 min and different durations 1 5 yr of studied cities in china finally equivalent or effective design return periods for combined rsc and trdfs were determined to evaluate the improvement effect of the rsc facilities on the design return period of urban drainage system with both facilities the rsc facilities play an obvious role in improving the return period even the rsc facilities designed using small vcrar can considerably improve the effective return period the improvement effect in south china is more significant than that in north china keywords source control return period design rainfall depth volume capture ratio of annual rainfall spatial distribution 1 introduction with the rapid development of the city urban built up areas often suffer from the problems caused by rainfall such as waterlogging and runoff pollution charlesworth et al 2003 however because there are a high degree of wealth accumulation and frequent human activities in urban built up areas it is very difficult to transform the traditional drainage facilities trdfs or gray facilities and completely realize the diversion of rainfall runoff and sewage the control of rainwater from the source villarreal et al 2004 w ando and p c freitas 2009 can achieve multiple objectives at the same time it can relieve the pressure of trdfs in terms of runoff volume and it can reduce the runoff pollution in terms of water quality both the development of sponge city construction spcc in china jia et al 2017 chan et al 2018 and a series of the international modern rainwater management practices which are represented by the low impact development lid in the united states jia et al 2015 campisano et al 2017 mao et al 2017 guo and guo 2018 ishaq et al 2019 matos et al 2019 emphasize the role of rainwater source control rsc or green facilities and try to restore the natural hydrological condition through the appropriate combinations of gray and green drainage facilities jia et al 2013 the resistance of cities to waterlogging risks can be reflected in its ability of urban drainage system to store and convey the runoff from rainfall events with certain return periods the complete urban drainage system shall provide more efficient combination of gray and green facilities to effectively control the rainwater from three perspectives of source midway and terminal that is to store capture and convey the runoff with longer return period therefore both the rsc facilities and trdfs such as underground pipeline networks are an integral part of the urban drainage system lots of studies have evaluated the control effect of the urban drainage system on the quantity of rainfall runoff bedan and clausen 2009 demuzere et al 2014 jia et al 2015 on the one hand the city s ability to resist flooding and waterlogging is related to the scale of urban drainage system on the other hand it also depends on the regional rainfall characteristics for the rainfall characteristics will significantly affect the drainage effect of rsc facilities and trdfs zhang et al azli and rao 2010 qin et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 it is necessary to adjust measures and polices to local conditions according to regional rainfall characteristics so as to reasonably determine the scale of the urban drainage system various methodologies have been developed to evaluate urban drainage system such as the design storm approach model simulations probabilistic approach and stochastic approach for example azli and rao 2010 analyzed the rainfall data from 13 stations in the malay peninsula and used the huff s curves to obtain the designed rainfall of different regions park et al 2013 studied the distribution characteristics of historical rainfall for eight representative cities in different climate regions of korea and selected the appropriate reservoir volume in terms of trdfs many cities prepare the rainfall intensity formula based on the local historical rainfall data which is used as an important basis to determine the design flow rate of drainage facilities in terms of source control previous studies have shown that different rainfall conditions can significantly change the effect of the rsc because the total volume and time distribution of rainstorms are directly related to the effect of the rsc therefore some researchers studied the regional rainfall characteristics to determine the reasonable scale of source control ghisi et al 2007 ghaffarianhoseini et al 2015 christian amos et al 2016 china has a vast territory and the rainfall characteristics vary greatly in different regions yin and sun 2018 gu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 therefore the study of the impact of rainfall characteristics on designing the urban drainage system with green and gray facilities is very important and beneficial to the society in china in order to quantitatively evaluate the role of rsc in the overall urban drainage system this paper analyzes the combined effect of rsc facilities and trdfs in china and calculates improvement effect of the rsc on the return period of urban drainage system under the combined green and gray facilities with different scales the ratio of their respective contributions to capture or drain the runoff under different rainfall conditions in terms of return period and duration provides a basis for the more effective layout of rsc facilities and trdfs for cities studied 2 data and methodology 2 1 data overview the rainfall data used in this study comes from the china ground international exchange station climate data http data cma cn data detail datacode surf cli chn mul day ces v3 0 html the 30 year 1983 2012 daily rainfall data from 186 weather stations fig 1 a in china were used furthermore this study utilizes the latest rainfall intensity formulas provided in the design manual of water supply and drainage third edition volume 5 which covers 240 cities in china for the number of rainfall intensity formulas in sichuan gansu inner mongolia tibet qinghai and xinjiang are less the new generation rainfall intensity formulas in the above areas developed by shao and shao 2013 were used as the supplement totally there are 342 cities with rainfall intensity formulas used for the study fig 1b 2 2 capture ratio of annual rainfall and design rainfall depth to design rsc facilities it needs to define or select a design rainfall depth the u s environmental protection agency usepa used the 95th percentile rainfall as design rainfall for developing redeveloping federal facilities which is determined from long term 30 or more years daily rainfall data the usepa method considers each rainfall event greater than0 1 in equally regardless of the rainfall depth in terms of rscs for the spcc in china the volume capture ratio of annual rainfall vcrar or α is used to define or determine the design rainfall h mm or inches and as the main indicator for evaluating the effect of source control li et al 2015 wang et al 2017 the calculation formula for α is as follows 1 α d f 100 where d is the annual average controlled or captured rainfall mm equation 2 and f is the regional or station annual average rainfall mm which is the sum of daily rainfall depths greater than2 mm divided by the total number of years n with daily rainfall data 2 d 1 n d s h d s h where d s h is the sum of the daily rainfall depths that are less than or equal to the design rainfall depth h and d s h is the sum of the rainfall captured by the source control facilities when the daily rainfall depths are greater than h d s h is equal to the number of those rainfall events j times h vcrar is a statistically derived long term rainfall parameter for the spcc development in china α f is often referred to the controlled or captured annual rainfall by rsc facilities fang at al 2017 compared the 95th percentile rainfall and the design rainfall determined from α 85 for 206 cities in the contiguous usa fang et al 2017 2 3 combined drainage capacity and return period in order to avoid the waterlogging problem in the city the drainage of the sponge city depends on not only the source control facilities but also the traditional facilities e g street gutters inlets underground pipelines and flood control channel network both together constitute the comprehensive drainage capacity of the city the source control facilities can control the rainwater before the rainfall runoff enters the traditional facilities at present the requirement of source control is that vcrar is generally 60 90 in the standards of various cities in china and the design return period of drainage is 3 5 years for the traditional pipeline network however the drainage capacity of some areas with older facilities is still under 1 year return period therefore the scale of the source control facilities is set as the volume capture ratio of annual rainfall of 60 70 80 and 90 and the return period of traditional drainage is set as 1 year 3 years and 5 years in this study for a rainfall event the actual drainage depth of the city can be estimated by the following formula 3 d combine min d rsc d trd d accmu c rsc c trd where dcombine is the actually controlled rainfall depth from both the rsc or green and traditional drainage subscript trd or gray facilities of the city drsc is the design rainfall depth of rsc facilities dtrd is the design rainfall depth of traditional drainage facilities and daccum is the accumulative rainfall depth for a rainfall event with certain return period and duration crsc and ctrd are the actually controlled rainfall depths of rainfall source control facilities and traditional drainage facilities respectively for the event with daccum and remaining rainfall that cannot be captured and conveyed will cause waterlogging or flooding and presents as dflood in table 1 when daccum is within three possible ranges in comparison to drsc and dtrd table 1 lists possible values for crsc ctrd dflood ctrd dflood and dcombine for example when daccum drsc the traditional drainage facilities will basically not play their role ctrd 0 and crsc daccum dcombine it will have not flooding dflood 0 for the small rainfall event when the accumulative rainfall depth is larger than the sum of the design rainfall depths for the green and gray facilities the actually controlled rainfall depth will be the sum of the design rainfall depths crsc drsc and ctrd dtrd and it will results in a flooding also dflood daccum drsc dtrd therefore for an urban drainage system with both source control facilities and traditional drainage facilities the equivalent or combined return period of integrated green and gray facilities can be determined by comparing drsc dtrd with the calculated rainfalls from the rainfall intensity formula in each city under different return periods for a fixed rainfall duration e g 120 min used in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of rainfall depths the rainfall depths of different durations can be obtained under different return periods using the rainfall intensity formulas for the rainwater drainage time of the source control facilities is normally long whether or not the source control facilities can properly play their role to capture store rainwater is closely related to the accumulative rainfall depth of the rainfall event but also could be affected by the rainfall intensity china has a wide territory and obvious climate difference and the results of rainfall intensity calculation formulas in different cities are quite different the spatial distributions contours of rainfall depths were developed using calculated rainfall depths from the rainfall intensity formulas in 342 cities fig 1 for three return periods 1 2 and 5 yr and five durations 5 15 30 60 and 120 min for this study example results for two return periods and two durations are shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the rainfall depths of two return periods and two rainfall durations have the increasing trend in the southeast and much less variations in the northwest of china except for hainan guangdong and guangxi 1 yr 60 min rainfall depths are basically below 40 mm while they are less than 10 mm in western region the area with the 5 yr 60 min rainfall depths less than 40 mm is less than 2 3 of china the overall distributions of 120 min rainfall depths are similar with those of 60 min rainfall depths the area with the 5 yr 120 min rainfall depths larger than 50 mm almost accounts for half of china 3 2 relationship between design rainfall depth and vcrar of rsc facilities the design rainfall depths in china corresponding to vcrar of 60 70 80 and 90 are given in fig 3 and obviously vary with the region they increase from northwest to southeast which is similar to the geographic distributions of rainfall depths in fig 2 contours in fig 3 were developed using design rainfalls determined from 186 cities fig 1 with daily rainfall data and then design rainfalls for all pixels about 19 19 km2 were obtained by interpolation based on geographic location when vcrar is 60 the design rainfall depths in china are less than 20 mm when vcrar is up to 90 the design rainfall of 20 mm can only occur in the western region of china to meet the standard the design rainfall depths in the southern region such as guangdong province and hainan province are significantly impacted by the change of vcrar and increase relatively steeply with the increase of vcrar when vcrar is small e g 60 the design rainfall depths do not vary greatly in each region because the small rainfall events account for a large proportion of the total annual rainfall in most cities with the increase of vcrar the design rainfall depths vary significantly among cities in china and are affected by the annual rainfalls from arid to humid region when one applies equation 1 to determine the design rainfall depth for a selected α one first computes a series of α values by selecting different observed rainfall depths from small to large as the design rainfall depths this is because f in equation 1 is not changed but d s h and d s h increase with the increase of selected h when long term rainfall data period is fixed typically there are numerous small rainfall events and relatively small number of heavy or severe rainfall events when vcrar becomes larger and larger design rainfall depth increases more rapidly since the larger rainfall depth is often less frequent therefore the special attention shall be paid to collecting the regional rainfall data in the area where the high vcrar is adopted for the source control facilities otherwise there will be a significant deviation of facility scale due to the inaccuracy of design rainfall depth in order to avoid and reduce the impact of a few extreme rainfall events on determining vcrar dominating to compute f in equation 1 guo and urbonas 1996 suggest removing a small percent 0 2 0 5 of the highest daily rainfall data before computing vcrar for example design rainfall depths for vcrar 85 in 206 cities in usa ranged from 9 6 to 128 0 mm when all 30 year rainfall data were used but they ranged from 8 9 to 66 mm when 99 5 of 30 year data were used fang et al 2017 3 3 comparison of contributions by green and gray facilities table 2 provides the statistical summary maximum and minimum values averages and standard deviations of design rainfalls for 15 combinations of 3 return periods and 5 durations from 186 cities and for all pixels in fig 3 minimum rainfalls of 1 5 yr return periods are less than 0 5 mm since many cities in western china desert are pretty dry the statistical summary from all pixels is given by the numbers in the brackets the controlled rainfall depths from the source control facilities and traditional drainage facilities in each city are compared with each other the calculated results are shown in fig 4 for the rainfall events of five durations 5 15 30 60 and 120 min and three return periods 1 2 and 5 yr and for source control facilities with four α values 60 90 time of concentration of the runoff from a contributing area is typically used as rainfall duration to design urban drainage facilities and varies from one to another facility gutter inlet and pipe that is why five rainfall durations were used in fig 4 the rainfall depth daccum is divided into two parts crsc y axis and ctrd dflood x axis but ctrd is not determined separately since design rainfall depths for the traditional drainage facilities are not specified for fig 4 as shown in table 1 when daccum drsc it will have crsc daccum and ctrd dflood 0 i e all data points on the y axis x 0 in fig 4 in some cases crsc could be overestimated since drsc is statistically determined from daily rainfall data when the duration is short 5 120 min one day rainfall intensity is high and larger than the infiltration rate of the source control facility it could have overflow when crsc is still less than daccum the rainfall control capture of each rainfall event is taken care by both the source control and the traditional drainage facilities in this study it is assumed that the rainfall is firstly controlled by the source control facilities and then the runoff flows into the traditional drainage facilities after the source control facilities are saturated when the design rainfall of traditional drainage facilities is not large enough insufficient it will cause the waterlogging and flooding in some lowland areas of the city but dflood is not determined separately for the spcc development in many cities in china using vcrar to design and construct the green facilities has been implemented in a small portion of the city area results in fig 4 assumes the design rainfall for each vcrar is implemented the citywide for all selected cities in china for urban cities not all stormwater runoff flows through a source control facility first and some runoff flows directly into traditional drainage facilities the source control facilities may have underdrain pipes that discharge to traditional drainage facilities but it is also assumed that design rainfall duration is smaller than the runoff holding time in the source control facilities each data point represents a city in fig 4 the closer to the origin the data point the less rainfall the city has four colors represent the design rainfalls corresponding to four selected volume capture ratios of annual rainfall for each city there are 342 points cities in china for each color each graph in fig 4 has a dotted line of y x when a data point city is located on the left top side of the dotted line it means that the rainfall in that city is mainly controlled by the source control facilities when the data point is located on the right bottom side of the dotted line it means that the rainfall is mainly drained by the traditional drainage facilities or may result in flooding it is generally considered that the source control facilities are mainly used to control or capture the small rainfall events and they only delay and reduce the peak discharges for the heavy or severe rainfall events design rainfall depths corresponding to four vcrars in 342 cities in china are statically summarized in table 2 and can be seen from the upper limit of y axis when crsc drsc on fig 4 for the same color points when vcrar is 90 80 70 and 60 the corresponding maximum design rainfall depth is 60 mm 40 mm 30 mm and 20 mm respectively with the increase of rainfall return period or duration the main rainfall control mode of each city will inevitably change from source control facilities to traditional drainage facilities fig 4 shows the source control facilities with vcrar of 90 can capture the 5 yr 30 min rainfall for the most cities in china without discharging to the traditional drainage facilities rsc facilities with this design rainfall can also capture the 2 yr 60 min or 1 yr 120 min rainfall even though they suffer from the heavy rainfall events they can also capture more than half of the 5 yr 120 min rainfalls the source control facilities with vcrar of 80 can basically capture the 1 yr 30 min rainfalls or more than half of the 2 yr 60 min rainfalls therefore when vcrar is 80 90 the source control facilities can greatly relieve the drainage pressure for the urban drainage system considering the cost some cities with limited financial resources will adopt the source control facilities designed with lower vcrar but they still have a certain rainfall control effect for example when vcrar is 70 the rsc facilities can play a leading role in the 2 yr 30 min or 1 yr 60 min rainfall events because they can absorb more than half of the rainfall when vcrar is only 60 the source control facilities can also capture more than half of the 1 yr 15 min rainfall it can be seen that the capability of source control facilities designed using varar of 60 70 to independently control the heavy rainfall is limited however they can still play a role in relieving the drainage pressure and delaying the runoff to traditional drainage facilities for there is obvious difference in the rainfall characteristics in various regions of china how to select an appropriate rainfall capture ratio to size the rsc facilities is an important and essential question for the sustainable spcc development in china the position of a city in fig 4 indicates how the rsc facilities and the traditional drainage facilities capture and convey the runoff when a city is on the y x dotted line it means for the rainfall with certain return period and duration half of the rainfall is captured by the rsc facilities and another half is conveyed by the traditional

is conveyed by the traditional drainage facilities i e the city on a line of y x 2 basically what is the optimal combination of the rsc and traditional drainage facilities is an important topic that should be further studies in the future furthermore because the capacity of source control facilities that is gradually recovered by the infiltration and evaporation is not taken into consideration for the calculation here the actual control effect of source control facilities may be slightly improved for the rainfall events with longer durations 3 4 estimation of return periods of combined drainage system as an example we used the 120 min duration to obtain the results in fig 5 using the controlled rainfall depth of both source control facilities and traditional drainage facilities i e drsc dtrd in equation 3 when the design return period of traditional drainage facilities is 1 year and the source control facilities are designed using vcrar of 60 the equivalent return period that combined source control facilities and traditional drainage facilities can convey can be increased to 2 years or more and it may be even up to 3 5 years for some southern cities if the design return period of traditional drainage facilities is 5 years and vcrar of 60 is used to design the source control facilities the equivalent return period of urban drainage system for the most regions can be increased to 10 20 years when the source control facilities is designed using vcrar of 90 the traditional drainage facilities with the 1 year return period can handle the 10 yr 120 min rainfall in most part of china and up to 50 year return period in some regions it can be seen that the source control facilities have a significant effect on the improvement of equivalent return period for the rainfall events of 120 min duration the source control facilities designed using a lower vcrar e g 60 cannot capture store the heavy rainfall independently fig 4 rainfall of 5 yr 30 min or duration greater than 60 min but they have a significant effect on the improvement of the return period of the combined system with the traditional pipeline network fig 5 for china has a wide territory there is significant difference in the spatial distribution of rainfall characteristics for the rainfall depth in south china is more than that in north china the design rainfall depth and corresponding size of source control facilities in south china are larger for the same volume capture ratio of annual rainfall the calculated results in fig 5 show that the source control facilities in the south cities play the more obvious role in improving the return period for the 120 min rainfall under the same vcrar and the area with a large improvement is distributed in the u shape 4 conclusions 1 the design rainfall depth of different return periods and different rainfall durations presents the trend of more in the southeast and less in the northwest except for hainan guangdong and guangxi the 1 yr 60 min rainfall is basically below 40 mm while less than 10 mm in the western region the area with the 5 yr 60 min rainfall less than 40 mm is less than 2 3 of china the geographic distribution pattern of 120 min rainfall depth is similar with that of the 60 min rainfall depth and the area with the 5 yr 120 min rainfall larger than 50 mm almost accounts for half of china 2 in terms of rainfall source control when vcrar is low corresponding design rainfall depth in each region does not change much with the increase of vcrar when vcrar is large e g 90 or more corresponding design rainfall increases greatly with vcrar because the number of severe rainfall events is small therefore the special attention shall be paid to the analysis of regional rainfall data in the area with high vcrar otherwise it is difficult for the source control facilities to achieve the expected results volume capture because of the error in determining the design rainfall 3 when vcrar of 80 90 is used the source control facilities can greatly relieve the pressure for the urban drainage system and they can even capture retain heavy rainfall independently the capability of source control facilities to independently control the heavy rainfall is limited when vcrar of 60 70 is used however they can still play a role in relieving the drainage pressure and delaying the runoff to traditional drainage facilities 4 when the rainfall duration is 120 min the source control facilities play an obvious role in improving the equivalent return periods of urban drainage systems with

6097,the rainwater source control rsc is an important part of modern urban stormwater management to quantitatively evaluate the role of source control in the overall urban drainage system rainfall depths of different return periods and rainfall durations were calculated based on the rainfall intensity formulas of 342 cities in china and used to design size traditional urban drainage pipes furthermore design rainfalls for rsc facilities corresponding to four volume capture ratio of annual rainfall vcrar 60 70 80 and 90 were determined using the 30 yr historical rainfall data under the combination of rsc facilities with vcrar or sizes and the traditional drainage facilities trdfs the contribution of rsc facilities and trdfs to capture or convey rainwater was quantified for the rainfall with different durations 5 120 min and different durations 1 5 yr of studied cities in china finally equivalent or effective design return periods for combined rsc and trdfs were determined to evaluate the improvement effect of the rsc facilities on the design return period of urban drainage system with both facilities the rsc facilities play an obvious role in improving the return period even the rsc facilities designed using small vcrar can considerably improve the effective return period the improvement effect in south china is more significant than that in north china keywords source control return period design rainfall depth volume capture ratio of annual rainfall spatial distribution 1 introduction with the rapid development of the city urban built up areas often suffer from the problems caused by rainfall such as waterlogging and runoff pollution charlesworth et al 2003 however because there are a high degree of wealth accumulation and frequent human activities in urban built up areas it is very difficult to transform the traditional drainage facilities trdfs or gray facilities and completely realize the diversion of rainfall runoff and sewage the control of rainwater from the source villarreal et al 2004 w ando and p c freitas 2009 can achieve multiple objectives at the same time it can relieve the pressure of trdfs in terms of runoff volume and it can reduce the runoff pollution in terms of water quality both the development of sponge city construction spcc in china jia et al 2017 chan et al 2018 and a series of the international modern rainwater management practices which are represented by the low impact development lid in the united states jia et al 2015 campisano et al 2017 mao et al 2017 guo and guo 2018 ishaq et al 2019 matos et al 2019 emphasize the role of rainwater source control rsc or green facilities and try to restore the natural hydrological condition through the appropriate combinations of gray and green drainage facilities jia et al 2013 the resistance of cities to waterlogging risks can be reflected in its ability of urban drainage system to store and convey the runoff from rainfall events with certain return periods the complete urban drainage system shall provide more efficient combination of gray and green facilities to effectively control the rainwater from three perspectives of source midway and terminal that is to store capture and convey the runoff with longer return period therefore both the rsc facilities and trdfs such as underground pipeline networks are an integral part of the urban drainage system lots of studies have evaluated the control effect of the urban drainage system on the quantity of rainfall runoff bedan and clausen 2009 demuzere et al 2014 jia et al 2015 on the one hand the city s ability to resist flooding and waterlogging is related to the scale of urban drainage system on the other hand it also depends on the regional rainfall characteristics for the rainfall characteristics will significantly affect the drainage effect of rsc facilities and trdfs zhang et al azli and rao 2010 qin et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 it is necessary to adjust measures and polices to local conditions according to regional rainfall characteristics so as to reasonably determine the scale of the urban drainage system various methodologies have been developed to evaluate urban drainage system such as the design storm approach model simulations probabilistic approach and stochastic approach for example azli and rao 2010 analyzed the rainfall data from 13 stations in the malay peninsula and used the huff s curves to obtain the designed rainfall of different regions park et al 2013 studied the distribution characteristics of historical rainfall for eight representative cities in different climate regions of korea and selected the appropriate reservoir volume in terms of trdfs many cities prepare the rainfall intensity formula based on the local historical rainfall data which is used as an important basis to determine the design flow rate of drainage facilities in terms of source control previous studies have shown that different rainfall conditions can significantly change the effect of the rsc because the total volume and time distribution of rainstorms are directly related to the effect of the rsc therefore some researchers studied the regional rainfall characteristics to determine the reasonable scale of source control ghisi et al 2007 ghaffarianhoseini et al 2015 christian amos et al 2016 china has a vast territory and the rainfall characteristics vary greatly in different regions yin and sun 2018 gu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 therefore the study of the impact of rainfall characteristics on designing the urban drainage system with green and gray facilities is very important and beneficial to the society in china in order to quantitatively evaluate the role of rsc in the overall urban drainage system this paper analyzes the combined effect of rsc facilities and trdfs in china and calculates improvement effect of the rsc on the return period of urban drainage system under the combined green and gray facilities with different scales the ratio of their respective contributions to capture or drain the runoff under different rainfall conditions in terms of return period and duration provides a basis for the more effective layout of rsc facilities and trdfs for cities studied 2 data and methodology 2 1 data overview the rainfall data used in this study comes from the china ground international exchange station climate data http data cma cn data detail datacode surf cli chn mul day ces v3 0 html the 30 year 1983 2012 daily rainfall data from 186 weather stations fig 1 a in china were used furthermore this study utilizes the latest rainfall intensity formulas provided in the design manual of water supply and drainage third edition volume 5 which covers 240 cities in china for the number of rainfall intensity formulas in sichuan gansu inner mongolia tibet qinghai and xinjiang are less the new generation rainfall intensity formulas in the above areas developed by shao and shao 2013 were used as the supplement totally there are 342 cities with rainfall intensity formulas used for the study fig 1b 2 2 capture ratio of annual rainfall and design rainfall depth to design rsc facilities it needs to define or select a design rainfall depth the u s environmental protection agency usepa used the 95th percentile rainfall as design rainfall for developing redeveloping federal facilities which is determined from long term 30 or more years daily rainfall data the usepa method considers each rainfall event greater than0 1 in equally regardless of the rainfall depth in terms of rscs for the spcc in china the volume capture ratio of annual rainfall vcrar or α is used to define or determine the design rainfall h mm or inches and as the main indicator for evaluating the effect of source control li et al 2015 wang et al 2017 the calculation formula for α is as follows 1 α d f 100 where d is the annual average controlled or captured rainfall mm equation 2 and f is the regional or station annual average rainfall mm which is the sum of daily rainfall depths greater than2 mm divided by the total number of years n with daily rainfall data 2 d 1 n d s h d s h where d s h is the sum of the daily rainfall depths that are less than or equal to the design rainfall depth h and d s h is the sum of the rainfall captured by the source control facilities when the daily rainfall depths are greater than h d s h is equal to the number of those rainfall events j times h vcrar is a statistically derived long term rainfall parameter for the spcc development in china α f is often referred to the controlled or captured annual rainfall by rsc facilities fang at al 2017 compared the 95th percentile rainfall and the design rainfall determined from α 85 for 206 cities in the contiguous usa fang et al 2017 2 3 combined drainage capacity and return period in order to avoid the waterlogging problem in the city the drainage of the sponge city depends on not only the source control facilities but also the traditional facilities e g street gutters inlets underground pipelines and flood control channel network both together constitute the comprehensive drainage capacity of the city the source control facilities can control the rainwater before the rainfall runoff enters the traditional facilities at present the requirement of source control is that vcrar is generally 60 90 in the standards of various cities in china and the design return period of drainage is 3 5 years for the traditional pipeline network however the drainage capacity of some areas with older facilities is still under 1 year return period therefore the scale of the source control facilities is set as the volume capture ratio of annual rainfall of 60 70 80 and 90 and the return period of traditional drainage is set as 1 year 3 years and 5 years in this study for a rainfall event the actual drainage depth of the city can be estimated by the following formula 3 d combine min d rsc d trd d accmu c rsc c trd where dcombine is the actually controlled rainfall depth from both the rsc or green and traditional drainage subscript trd or gray facilities of the city drsc is the design rainfall depth of rsc facilities dtrd is the design rainfall depth of traditional drainage facilities and daccum is the accumulative rainfall depth for a rainfall event with certain return period and duration crsc and ctrd are the actually controlled rainfall depths of rainfall source control facilities and traditional drainage facilities respectively for the event with daccum and remaining rainfall that cannot be captured and conveyed will cause waterlogging or flooding and presents as dflood in table 1 when daccum is within three possible ranges in comparison to drsc and dtrd table 1 lists possible values for crsc ctrd dflood ctrd dflood and dcombine for example when daccum drsc the traditional drainage facilities will basically not play their role ctrd 0 and crsc daccum dcombine it will have not flooding dflood 0 for the small rainfall event when the accumulative rainfall depth is larger than the sum of the design rainfall depths for the green and gray facilities the actually controlled rainfall depth will be the sum of the design rainfall depths crsc drsc and ctrd dtrd and it will results in a flooding also dflood daccum drsc dtrd therefore for an urban drainage system with both source control facilities and traditional drainage facilities the equivalent or combined return period of integrated green and gray facilities can be determined by comparing drsc dtrd with the calculated rainfalls from the rainfall intensity formula in each city under different return periods for a fixed rainfall duration e g 120 min used in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of rainfall depths the rainfall depths of different durations can be obtained under different return periods using the rainfall intensity formulas for the rainwater drainage time of the source control facilities is normally long whether or not the source control facilities can properly play their role to capture store rainwater is closely related to the accumulative rainfall depth of the rainfall event but also could be affected by the rainfall intensity china has a wide territory and obvious climate difference and the results of rainfall intensity calculation formulas in different cities are quite different the spatial distributions contours of rainfall depths were developed using calculated rainfall depths from the rainfall intensity formulas in 342 cities fig 1 for three return periods 1 2 and 5 yr and five durations 5 15 30 60 and 120 min for this study example results for two return periods and two durations are shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the rainfall depths of two return periods and two rainfall durations have the increasing trend in the southeast and much less variations in the northwest of china except for hainan guangdong and guangxi 1 yr 60 min rainfall depths are basically below 40 mm while they are less than 10 mm in western region the area with the 5 yr 60 min rainfall depths less than 40 mm is less than 2 3 of china the overall distributions of 120 min rainfall depths are similar with those of 60 min rainfall depths the area with the 5 yr 120 min rainfall depths larger than 50 mm almost accounts for half of china 3 2 relationship between design rainfall depth and vcrar of rsc facilities the design rainfall depths in china corresponding to vcrar of 60 70 80 and 90 are given in fig 3 and obviously vary with the region they increase from northwest to southeast which is similar to the geographic distributions of rainfall depths in fig 2 contours in fig 3 were developed using design rainfalls determined from 186 cities fig 1 with daily rainfall data and then design rainfalls for all pixels about 19 19 km2 were obtained by interpolation based on geographic location when vcrar is 60 the design rainfall depths in china are less than 20 mm when vcrar is up to 90 the design rainfall of 20 mm can only occur in the western region of china to meet the standard the design rainfall depths in the southern region such as guangdong province and hainan province are significantly impacted by the change of vcrar and increase relatively steeply with the increase of vcrar when vcrar is small e g 60 the design rainfall depths do not vary greatly in each region because the small rainfall events account for a large proportion of the total annual rainfall in most cities with the increase of vcrar the design rainfall depths vary significantly among cities in china and are affected by the annual rainfalls from arid to humid region when one applies equation 1 to determine the design rainfall depth for a selected α one first computes a series of α values by selecting different observed rainfall depths from small to large as the design rainfall depths this is because f in equation 1 is not changed but d s h and d s h increase with the increase of selected h when long term rainfall data period is fixed typically there are numerous small rainfall events and relatively small number of heavy or severe rainfall events when vcrar becomes larger and larger design rainfall depth increases more rapidly since the larger rainfall depth is often less frequent therefore the special attention shall be paid to collecting the regional rainfall data in the area where the high vcrar is adopted for the source control facilities otherwise there will be a significant deviation of facility scale due to the inaccuracy of design rainfall depth in order to avoid and reduce the impact of a few extreme rainfall events on determining vcrar dominating to compute f in equation 1 guo and urbonas 1996 suggest removing a small percent 0 2 0 5 of the highest daily rainfall data before computing vcrar for example design rainfall depths for vcrar 85 in 206 cities in usa ranged from 9 6 to 128 0 mm when all 30 year rainfall data were used but they ranged from 8 9 to 66 mm when 99 5 of 30 year data were used fang et al 2017 3 3 comparison of contributions by green and gray facilities table 2 provides the statistical summary maximum and minimum values averages and standard deviations of design rainfalls for 15 combinations of 3 return periods and 5 durations from 186 cities and for all pixels in fig 3 minimum rainfalls of 1 5 yr return periods are less than 0 5 mm since many cities in western china desert are pretty dry the statistical summary from all pixels is given by the numbers in the brackets the controlled rainfall depths from the source control facilities and traditional drainage facilities in each city are compared with each other the calculated results are shown in fig 4 for the rainfall events of five durations 5 15 30 60 and 120 min and three return periods 1 2 and 5 yr and for source control facilities with four α values 60 90 time of concentration of the runoff from a contributing area is typically used as rainfall duration to design urban drainage facilities and varies from one to another facility gutter inlet and pipe that is why five rainfall durations were used in fig 4 the rainfall depth daccum is divided into two parts crsc y axis and ctrd dflood x axis but ctrd is not determined separately since design rainfall depths for the traditional drainage facilities are not specified for fig 4 as shown in table 1 when daccum drsc it will have crsc daccum and ctrd dflood 0 i e all data points on the y axis x 0 in fig 4 in some cases crsc could be overestimated since drsc is statistically determined from daily rainfall data when the duration is short 5 120 min one day rainfall intensity is high and larger than the infiltration rate of the source control facility it could have overflow when crsc is still less than daccum the rainfall control capture of each rainfall event is taken care by both the source control and the traditional drainage facilities in this study it is assumed that the rainfall is firstly controlled by the source control facilities and then the runoff flows into the traditional drainage facilities after the source control facilities are saturated when the design rainfall of traditional drainage facilities is not large enough insufficient it will cause the waterlogging and flooding in some lowland areas of the city but dflood is not determined separately for the spcc development in many cities in china using vcrar to design and construct the green facilities has been implemented in a small portion of the city area results in fig 4 assumes the design rainfall for each vcrar is implemented the citywide for all selected cities in china for urban cities not all stormwater runoff flows through a source control facility first and some runoff flows directly into traditional drainage facilities the source control facilities may have underdrain pipes that discharge to traditional drainage facilities but it is also assumed that design rainfall duration is smaller than the runoff holding time in the source control facilities each data point represents a city in fig 4 the closer to the origin the data point the less rainfall the city has four colors represent the design rainfalls corresponding to four selected volume capture ratios of annual rainfall for each city there are 342 points cities in china for each color each graph in fig 4 has a dotted line of y x when a data point city is located on the left top side of the dotted line it means that the rainfall in that city is mainly controlled by the source control facilities when the data point is located on the right bottom side of the dotted line it means that the rainfall is mainly drained by the traditional drainage facilities or may result in flooding it is generally considered that the source control facilities are mainly used to control or capture the small rainfall events and they only delay and reduce the peak discharges for the heavy or severe rainfall events design rainfall depths corresponding to four vcrars in 342 cities in china are statically summarized in table 2 and can be seen from the upper limit of y axis when crsc drsc on fig 4 for the same color points when vcrar is 90 80 70 and 60 the corresponding maximum design rainfall depth is 60 mm 40 mm 30 mm and 20 mm respectively with the increase of rainfall return period or duration the main rainfall control mode of each city will inevitably change from source control facilities to traditional drainage facilities fig 4 shows the source control facilities with vcrar of 90 can capture the 5 yr 30 min rainfall for the most cities in china without discharging to the traditional drainage facilities rsc facilities with this design rainfall can also capture the 2 yr 60 min or 1 yr 120 min rainfall even though they suffer from the heavy rainfall events they can also capture more than half of the 5 yr 120 min rainfalls the source control facilities with vcrar of 80 can basically capture the 1 yr 30 min rainfalls or more than half of the 2 yr 60 min rainfalls therefore when vcrar is 80 90 the source control facilities can greatly relieve the drainage pressure for the urban drainage system considering the cost some cities with limited financial resources will adopt the source control facilities designed with lower vcrar but they still have a certain rainfall control effect for example when vcrar is 70 the rsc facilities can play a leading role in the 2 yr 30 min or 1 yr 60 min rainfall events because they can absorb more than half of the rainfall when vcrar is only 60 the source control facilities can also capture more than half of the 1 yr 15 min rainfall it can be seen that the capability of source control facilities designed using varar of 60 70 to independently control the heavy rainfall is limited however they can still play a role in relieving the drainage pressure and delaying the runoff to traditional drainage facilities for there is obvious difference in the rainfall characteristics in various regions of china how to select an appropriate rainfall capture ratio to size the rsc facilities is an important and essential question for the sustainable spcc development in china the position of a city in fig 4 indicates how the rsc facilities and the traditional drainage facilities capture and convey the runoff when a city is on the y x dotted line it means for the rainfall with certain return period and duration half of the rainfall is captured by the rsc facilities and another half is conveyed by the traditional drainage facilities considering the higher construction and maintenance cost of the rsc facilities maybe it is better that 1 3 of the rainfall is captured by the rsc facilities and 2 3 of the rainfall is conveyed by the traditional drainage facilities i e the city on a line of y x 2 basically what is the optimal combination of the rsc and traditional drainage facilities is an important topic that should be further studies in the future furthermore because the capacity of source control facilities that is gradually recovered by the infiltration and evaporation is not taken into consideration for the calculation here the actual control effect of source control facilities may be slightly improved for the rainfall events with longer durations 3 4 estimation of return periods of combined drainage system as an example we used the 120 min duration to obtain the results in fig 5 using the controlled rainfall depth of both source control facilities and traditional drainage facilities i e drsc dtrd in equation 3 when the design return period of traditional drainage facilities is 1 year and the source control facilities are designed using vcrar of 60 the equivalent return period that combined source control facilities and traditional drainage facilities can convey can be increased to 2 years or more and it may be even up to 3 5 years for some southern cities if the design return

6098,substantial concerns have been raised about the degradation of groundwater quality and their harmful effects due to salinization processes and endemic fluorosis issues in china yuncheng basin is an economically important area situated in semi arid northern china which has suffered from severe groundwater contamination and intensive anthropogenic activities agricultural industrial and domestic twenty water quality parameters were surveyed at 85 groundwater and salt lake water sites during august 2013 september 2015 the combining using of cl br mass ratio δ2h δ18o δ13c and δ7li isotopes was employed to investigate the potential impact of anthropogenic activities which are supposed to contribute to groundwater salinization and fluoride enrichment in the yuncheng basin to a large extent results show that shallow groundwater are more vulnerable to contamination from anthropogenic processes of irrigation leaching wastewater drainage fertilizer utilization and salt lake water intrusion

groundwater with low cl br ratios around 300 high δ7li value c a 27 and moderate high δ18o 8 2 8 7 and δ2h 62 2 66 1 values the influence of anthropogenic activities on deep groundwater is reflected in two possible scenarios increased extraction of groundwater leads to downward leakage of shallow high fluoride saline groundwater increasing the pollution risk of deep groundwater within the

introduction degradation of groundwater quality due to salinization processes and secondary health related issues e g endemic fluorosis is one of the key issues throughout the world since it restrains sustainable exploitation of groundwater resource for domestic water supply agricultural and environmental uses bovolo et al 2009 karen et al 2017 the problem is intensified in arid semi arid inland areas where natural processes accelerate water quality deterioration by the dissolution of evaporate and fluoride bearing rocks and palaeo saline waters in agricultural areas these natural processes are frequently accompanied by anthropogenic activities such as over exploitation of groundwater wastewater drainage and fertilizer pesticide application which gradually cause the occurrence arise of high fluoride saline groundwater the above situation occurs in the yuncheng basin situated in northern china where industrial agricultural and domestic water supply heavily depend on groundwater elevated contents of tds and fluoride in groundwater have been observed in the study area in the past decade currell et al 2010 gao et al 2007 li et al 2015 due to the rapid development of social economy groundwater in the yuncheng basin has been greatly impacted by large scale intensive anthropogenic activities posing great threats on groundwater quality since 1980 s the lack of basin wide management strategies and occurrence of pollution from various anthropogenic sources only add complexity of the groundwater contamination problem such a situation necessitates comprehensive studies that will characterize and demonstrate the anthropogenic activities involved in groundwater contamination of this inland environment however it would be a challenge to sufficiently demarcate them based on the hydrochemical and multiple isotope tracers in view of its advantages cl br ratio has been used successfully to distinguish between various sources of anthropogenic and naturally occurring pollutants in groundwater alcala and custodio 2008 chien and lautz 2018 katz et al 2011 mcarthur et al 2012 panno et al 2006 typically due to the ideal conservative behavior of cl and br ions during transport several end members that control groundwater contamination processes would result in distinct ranges of cl br ratios the ocean has a constant cl br ratio of 290 davis et al 2001 coastal rainfall receives cl and br along the wind path from the ocean producing a similar cl br ratio inland rainfall especially in semi arid arid areas may have relatively lower cl br ratios on account of the tendency for cl to be removed by deposition of marine aerosols in coastal areas davis et al 2001 edmunds 2001 while evaporite halite weathering would result in high cl br ratios up to 104 105 due to the exclusion of br ion from the mineral structure cartwright et al 2006 kloppmann et al 2001 interaction of shallow groundwater with cl bearing contaminants such as domestic wastewater and fertilizers may also give a high cl br signal while organic degradation may reduce cl br ratios however conclusions only based on cl br ratio would be inconclusive or ambiguous other indicators used to explore anthropogenic influences on groundwater contamination are traditional isotopes δ2h δ18o and δ13c kass et al 2005 leybourne and goodfellow 2007 zouari et al 2011 while traditional tracers can provide some indication of the solute sources non traditional tracers have been found to be valuable one example is the lithium isotope ratio δ7li lithium has two stable isotopes 6li and 7li with relative abundance of 7 52 and 92 48 the large mass difference between the two stable isotopes 17 can produce significant isotope fractionation during geochemical processes making 7li 6li useful for fingerprinting water rock interactions kloppmann et al 2008 millot et al 2007 temperature is a key controlling factor for lithium isotope fractionation the fractionation factor has a significant correlation with temperature which can be expressed by the formula of δ7lilisolution altered rock 7847 t k 8 093 r2 0 93 during water rock interaction process the differences in diffusion coefficients between 6li and 7li could result in different migration behaviors for the two isotopes due to the inverse correlation between diffusion coefficient and mass of the isotope the diffusion coefficient of 6li is higher than that of 7li the result of the diffusion leads to the lithium isotope fractionation between minerals teng et al 2006 additionally the fractionation of lithium isotope may be affected by the coordination number between different phases for lithium having different coordination number in different solid phase oi et al 1997 jahn and wunder 2009 used ab initio molecular dynamic simulations to study the speciation changes in lithium bearing aqueous fluids at high temperatures and high pressures finding that higher pressure higher coordination number and easier occupied by 6li although some studies have applied lithium isotope to natural geology and hydrogeochemical processes systematic research on its application in anthropogenic pollution is less li et al 2016a 2016b taking into consideration of the significant isotope fractionation δ7li is applied in this paper to the identification of various anthropogenic influences such as wastewater drainage geothermal water exploitation and agricultural activity it is expected that lithium isotope could be more applicable in the field of environmental hydrology in this study impacts of anthropogenic activities on the enrichment of fluoride and salinity in groundwater at yuncheng basin are investigated by integrating groundwater chemistry cl br mass ratio and isotopic tools δ2h δ18o δ13c and δ7li the major objectives are 1 to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic activities on groundwater salinization and secondary fluoride enrichment pollution 2 to shed further insights into f rich saline groundwater by combining cl br ratio with isotopes δ2h δ18o δ13c and δ7li 2 study area 2 1 location and geography the yuncheng basin is located in the southeast of shanxi province northern china and extends between latitudes 34 40 and 35 30 n and longitudes 110 15 and 111 25 e the study area comprises two major geographic zones the sushui river basin and the e mei plateau the sushui river basin occupies a subsiding graben that ranges in elevation of 350 500 m above sea level a s l with the zhongtiao fault to the south and linyi fault to the north e mei plateau is a horst block elevation 460 600 m a s l which is located to the north of the linyi fault the yuncheng basin is surrounded by mountains to the south east and north forming a ne sw semi closed rifted basin to the west of the yuncheng basin is the yellow river the so called yuncheng salt lake is situated in the southwest of yuncheng city and covers an area of 120 km2 fig 1 the study area falls under monsoonal climatic condition with the main wet season occurring during the months of july august and september while the driest season months are november december and january the annual average rainfall is of 550 mm year while the total annual evapotranspiration is in excess of 2000 mm far more than the average rainfall han et al 2006 2 2 geology the geology of the study area is summarized by li et al 2015 briefly the basin contains 300 500 m thick quaternary sediments q1 q4 mostly fine grained aeolian loess that is interlayered with fluvial and lacustrine deposits han et al 2006 bedrock outcrops are archean metamorphic rocks arsm to the south of the area adjacent to the zhongtiao mountain composed by hornblendite amphibolites and quartzite elsewhere the sedimentary rocks mainly neogene mudstone and cambro ordivician limestone lie under the quaternary sediments 2 3 hydrogeology the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer of yuncheng basin occurs in two groups shallow and deep the unconfined shallow unit q3 and locally q4 has a depth ranging from 10 to 70 m below the land surface while the q1 and locally q2 consist the confined deep unit at depths of 80 500 m thick fig 1 in the basin groundwater flow is from the margins towards its center groundwater is recharged by meteoric water and lateral penetration of fissure water along the basin margin supplemented by leakage of non perennial river water and irrigation return flow while the discharge occurs via evapotranspiration and artificial abstraction extensive deep groundwater exploitation began in the beginning of 1980 s for public water supply zhao 2002 and the hydraulic head in the deep aquifer has steadily declined this is particularly true within the cone of depression to west of yuncheng city where the rate of drawdown has been 3 m year since 1986 cao 2005 3 methods 3 1 sampling a total of 85 water samples including 34 from shallow aquifers 50 from deep wells and one from yuncheng salt lake were collected across the yuncheng basin during august 2013 september 2015 fig 1 all the samples were stored in new 500 ml polyethylene bottles that had been pre cleaned with distilled water in the laboratory and rinsed with extracted water at least three times during sampling several in situ physico chemical parameters including ph temperature t and electrical conductivity were monitored by hanna ec and ph meter which had been calibrated already alkalinity in the aqueous samples was determined using the gran titration method on the same day of sampling samples for analysis of cations and trace elements were preserved by

all the analyses were completed within 2 weeks after sampling and the analytical charge imbalances were less than 5 the δ18o and δ2h contents of groundwater samples were measured using a finnigan mat

groundwater contamination after alcala and custodio 2008 davis et al 2001 katz et al 2011 mcarthur et al 2012 and panno et al 2006 are summarized in fig 2 in this paper δ13cdic and δ7li isotopes are introduced into the cl cl br systematics to further restrain the assessment of possible anthropogenic activities responsible for the groundwater contamination several possible scenarios are developed to illustrate how the cl cl br coupled with δ13cdic and δ7li of dilute groundwater change under possible processes mixing with salt discharge of wastewater usage of fertilizer and salt lake intrusion fig 2 table 1 the dilute groundwater end member is characterized by the lower cl concentration of 9 mg l cl br ratio of 100 δ7li of 16 9 and δ13c of 10 4 derived from our most dilute samples fig 2 the salt end member has a cl of 10 000 mg l and cl br of 6770 based on data from granato 1996 the given value of δ7li and δ13c isotopes of the salt end member are in the range of 31 0 37 5 huh et al 2001 and 3 16 schmid 2017 respectively the end member for wastewater was confirmed by reported compositions of urine cl 1910 mg l cl br 1240 mcarthur et al 2012 septic leachate cl 91 mg l cl br 769 panno et al 2006 and sewage effluents cl 400 mg l cl br 700 vengosh and pankratov 1998 considering the fact that wastewater may be constituted by various sources nitrogenous fertilizer is widely used in the study area mainly ammonium carbonate nh4 2co3 and urea nh4no3 the cl br ratio of 332 for fertilizer end member is based on chloride and bromide concentrations of about 350 and 1 05 mg l respectively otero et al 2005 as the major anthropogenic sources wastewater δ7li of 13 4 kloppmann et al 2008 and fertilizer 13 8 negrel et al 2010 are characterized by lower δ7li compared to reported δ7li value of natural surface water and groundwater in china gou et al 2019 li et al 2016a 2016b wang et al 2015 and δ13c values 11 vitoria et al 2008 the salt lake water end member has a cl br ratio of 436 with chloride and bromide concentrations of 2687 and 6 16 mg l respectively highest δ7li value 29 2 is the significant characteristic of salt lake water end member it is most likely due to the influence of intensive weathering on the lithium isotope fractionation by deposition of fine clay minerals with preferential adsorption of the light 6li by clay minerals von strandmann et al 2013 consequently salt lake water is strongly enriched with 7li a new end member the geothermal water is introduced in this study as discussed above geothermal water samples have distinct chemical characteristics the geothermal water end member 630 mg l cl cl br 249 represents the mean of five deep geothermal water from the yuncheng basin due to the significant effect of temperature on lithium isotopic fractionation the lowest δ7li 12 4 is recorded in this end member the negative δ13c value 7 9 of the geothermal waters indicate the groundwater dic in origin alçiçek et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 distribution and hydrogeochemistry of f rich saline groundwater the chemical compositions of water samples from yuncheng basin are presented in table 2 groundwater ph varies from 7 1 to 8 8 with f concentration ranging from 0 6 to 9 2 mg l and tds contents being 210 9597 mg l according to the who drinking guideline 1 5 mg l for fluoride who 2011 and classification of freeze and cherry 1979 over 80 of the samples from shallow aquifers and 50 of deep groundwater samples belong to high fluoride brackish or saline groundwater the dominant cation is sodium 5 3024 mg l with major anion as cl 9 1866 mg l so4 2 40 3939 mg l and hco3 62 8 1953 mg l varying extensively vertically relatively lower f contents 2 mg l and tds values 1000 mg l are mostly found in deep aquifers and aqueous f tds concentration generally exhibit a log arithmical attenuation pattern with depth fig 1b and 1c it is also observed that some deep samples contain high f and tds values indicating the probable downward vertical leakage of shallow groundwater distinct hydrochemical characteristics are recorded in groundwater from yuncheng basin fig s1a and s1b chadha 1999 the majority of samples in shallow 74 and deep aquifers 58 fall under na cl so4 type this indicates severe groundwater salinization problems in the study area fluoride enriched groundwater mainly occurs in the saline water zones suggesting the concomitance of fluoride and salinity in the study area higher contents of f 2 1 8 2 mg l and tds 772 3036 mg l are also observed in geothermal waters 23 1 41 8 collected from the locations near linyi fault and mingtiaogang fault minor elements like br b and li reach up to 2 5 folds higher than those in other groundwater the salt lake water exhibits a slightly alkaline ph value 7 9 and high concentrations of f 7 1 mg l and tds 11050 mg l 4 2 potential anthropogenic activities identified by cl br ratios δ13cdic and δ7li isotopes as shown in table 2 cl br ratios 24 0 5307 δ7li 11 0 31 8 δ13c 6 6 13 7 cl 9 0 1866 mg l and f 0 1 9 2 mg l in groundwater in the yuncheng basin are most variable eight shallow wells in the regional groundwater flow through area between kaolao lowland and the center of the basin yield water samples with the highest values of cl br ratios up to 5307 δ7li 31 8 cl 1866 mg l and higher f 5 32 mg l fig 2a higher cl br ratios 2129 3754 and δ7li values 18 8 26 1 also occur in a lot of deep samples with cl concentrations of 173 mg l and low to high f contents 0 11 1 95 mg l fig 2b all these higher cl br ratio samples are mostly located in the kaolao lowland alluvial areas in the northwest of salt lake and the northern part of xiaxian county dissolution of salts evaporites is the most likely mechanism that contributes to the higher cl br ratios cl and f of shallow groundwater near the salt lake with medium high cl br ratio of 200 1000 some 15 samples plot within the area affected by wastewater characterized by an elevated cl concentration and highest f contents up to 771 mg l and 9 2 mg l respectively whilst most plot on or close to the fertilizer mixing line and salt lake mixing line these points correspond to highly variable cl contents 29 4 767 mg l in addition high variable δ7li and δ13c values are observed in these points of groundwater from the deep aquifers some 12 with elevated cl br ratios of 308 1008 and cl concentrations from 96 8 to 931 mg l in the northern shore of the salt lake plot in the area for wastewater and fertilizer influence considering the fact that deep wells are unlikely to be directly affected by wastewater and fertilizer due to retardation of aquicludes cl br ratios and cl contents in these deep wells which are similar to those in shallow groundwater strongly indicate the effects of vertical leakage of shallow groundwater another 12 appear to be impacted by deep geothermal water and are characterized by relatively higher f concentrations 2 33 2 83 mg l and lower δ7li values 17 5 19 4 above all anthropogenic activities contribute to high f contents and salinity in groundwater in the yuncheng basin to a large extent shallow groundwater are more vulnerable to pollution and four possible scenarios are considered 1 dissolution of soluble salts during irrigation activities in the runoff area between kaolao lowland and the center of the basin 2 mixing with wastewater near the salt lake 3 mixing with fertilizer near the salt lake and 4 salt lake water intrusion in the northern part of salt lake due to over exploitation of groundwater influences of anthropogenic activities on deep groundwater are reflected in two possible scenarios 1 mixing with geothermal water due to rapidly developed drilling activities of geothermal resources 2 mixing with shallow leakages due to over pumping of deep aquifers all these scenarios will be discussed below in detail 4 3 influences of anthropogenic activities on high fluoride saline groundwater 4 3 1 impact of irrigation activities in central basin vertical leaching by irrigation return flows in central basin leads to the downward movement of fluoride and salt through the root zone the accumulation of fluoride and salts in the unsaturated zone provides favorable conditions for the enrichment of groundwater fluoride and salinity as demonstrated above several shallow groundwater no 57 75 76 77 78 80 83 and 84 located in the runoff area between kaolao lowland and the center of the basin are clearly set apart from the other samples they have the highest cl br ratios cl and higher f contents fig 2b within the study area irrigated agriculture has been a common practice for at least the last 50 years in most irrigation situations leaching the net downward movement of soil water and salt through the root zone occurs simultaneously fipps 2003 gabriel et al 2012 in the runoff and central part of this arid semi arid basin the sediments and surface soils are consist of lacustrine silts silt clay and clays this waterlogging condition enhances evapotranspiration leading to the accumulation of salts in the unsaturated zone carol et al 2009 the enrichment of salinity of groundwater in these points are affected by dissolution of soluble salts all these groundwater samples are under saturated with respect to halite and gypsum indicating a favorable condition for salt dissolution additionally during the leaching process a small proportion of leachable f would be desorbed into the aqueous phase under neutral to acidic conditions li et al 2015 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 therefore the shallow unconfined groundwater chemistry in the runoff area between kaolao lowland and the center of the basin could have been significantly affected by the infiltrated irrigation return flows the chemistry of which yields high cl br ratio high cl and f contents relationships between stable isotopes δ18o δ2h and chemical signatures tds cl f cl br ratio are studied further to reveal the effect of vertical irrigation leaching on the enrichment of groundwater fluoride and salinity plotting the δ18o data versus cl br ratios reveals two distinct fields of shallow groundwater fig 3 a i sharp increase in δ18o values with minor change of cl br ratio and low to high f contents this could be attributed to evaporation process and or salt lake intrusion which can modify δ18o and δ2h values with no significant change of cl br ratio ii large variations in cl br ratio with little change of stable isotopic compositions which suggests the effect of vertical irrigation leaching or dissolution of evaporates in the saturated zones from fig 3b and 3c three trends can be detected for shallow groundwater i changes in δ18o and δ2h values with no accompanying variation of cl concentrations and low f contents ii simultaneous increase of δ18o and δ2h values with increasing cl concentrations and high f values iii large variations of cl concentration and higher f contents without significant changes of δ18o and δ2h values in zone i the large variation in stable isotopic compositions with little change in chloride concentration could be due to the mixing with lateral recharge water characterized by low cl f concentrations and varying δ18o and δ2h values the relationship between cl concentrations and δ18o and δ2h values in zone ii reflects the effect of evaporation and or leakage of saline water from nearby salt lake evaporation either from the unsaturated zone or in the case of shallow water tables and or intrusion of hyper saline salt lake water can modify the stable isotopic compositions of groundwater with moderate changes of cl concentrations and high f values in contrast the consistency of δ18o and δ2h values in groundwater with increasing cl contents and higher f concentrations in zone iii could be related to vertical leaching of irrigation returns or dissolution of evaporates in the saturated zones the similarity of the conclusions inferred from stable isotopic compositions δ18o vs cl br ratios and stable isotopic compositions δ18o and δ2h vs cl concentrations demonstrates that vertical leaching could have a strong impact on the shallow groundwater contamination in the runoff area between kaolao lowland and the center of the yuncheng basin these groundwater are sensitive to the dissolution of soluble salts in the unsaturated zone during extensive vertical irrigation recharge having the highest tds and f values of 8044 mg l and 5 32 mg l respectively 4 3 2 contamination of wastewater and fertilizer overuse of fertilizers and discharge of wastewater are another anthropogenic practices promoting the formation of high fluoride saline groundwater the groundwater in which fluoride and salinity might have originated from wastewater fig 4 b no 61 62 and 82 are distributed near the yuncheng salt lake on the other hand the groundwater contamination from fertilizer fig 4a no 52 53 63 66 67 68 69 70 and 81 are widely distributed in the northern part of the salt lake and the kaolao lowland these areas are known as high residential population density and agricultural zones in the yuncheng basin in general natural concentrations of nitrate in precipitation are extremely small little no3 can infiltrate into the saturated zone the increase of groundwater fluoride and salinity when accompanied by the presence of no3 10 mg l might lead to the belief that the groundwater are affected by an anthropogenic source of contamination like domestic wastewater and fertilizer from the no3 vs cl plot fig 4a the following two trends can be clearly observed for the shallow groundwater with nitrate contamination 1 significant changes in chloride concentration with no or little variation of nitrate contents such trend corroborates the impact of evaporites dissolution during extensive vertical irrigation recharge on shallow groundwater contamination which discussed above 2 moderate changes of chloride concentration with variations of nitrate contents this can be attributed to mixing with wastewater and or fertilizer the wells either mixing with wastewater or fertilizer yield saline water samples with elevated no3 and f concentrations in general groundwater contaminated by domestic wastewater contains higher sodium to potassium ratio na k than that contaminated by poultry wastes land spraying of hog wastes and fertilizers used on cropland spruill et al 2002 boron is also commonly found at elevated concentrations in wastewater as a result of the use of synthetic na borate additives derived from natural na borate minerals in bleaching agents nishikoori et al 2011 panno et al 2007 as shown in na k vs b plot fig 4b elevated contents of na k and b in group i are consistent with wastewater influences for these wells in addition the δ13cdic of groundwater from these wells show good anti correlation to both na k and cl no3 values fig 4c and 4d wachniew 2006 records that release of isotopically light biogenic carbon can be related to oxidation and decomposition of labile organic matter in wastewater vitoria et al 2008 documents similar conclusions and confirms that the decomposition of organic matter leads to a decrease of δ13cdic with increasing dic thus the relationship between δ13cdic and anthropogenic ions like na k no3 and cl in the shallow groundwater influenced by wastewater further suggest that anthropogenic activities c within organic matter in wastewater could have an impact on groundwater contamination lowering δ13cdic values whilst increasing fluoride and salinity of the studied groundwater two possible mechanisms for this may be considered one is that wastewater dissolves minerals during leaching down ogrinc et al 2019 the second possibility is the microbial processes loomer et al 2015 as stated above the shallow groundwater in the west and northern part of salt lake and the kaolao lowland bear the imprint of wastewater and fertilizer which is identifiable by the combined use of major and minor ions with traditional δ13cdic isotopes 4 3 3 over pumping of groundwater intensive groundwater abstraction for industrial agricultural and municipal water use for decades in the yuncheng basin has disturbed the dynamic balance between fresh water and saline water leading to the intrusion of saline water from the salt lake into aquifer systems to degrade groundwater quality li et al 2016a 2016b as shown in δ7li vs cl plot fig 5 a compared with other shallow groundwater the relatively higher δ7li of several shallow groundwater samples are worth noting basically in the mineral weathering process the differences in diffusion coefficients between 6li and 7li could result in different migration behaviors for the two isotopes thereby leading to lithium isotope fractionation between minerals evaporite dissolution can produce high δ7li values in addition high li content and high li isotopic composition are one of the important characteristics of salt lake water as shown in fig 5 as a consequence the enrichment of δ7li values of those shallow groundwater can be produced by evaporate dissolution or salt lake intrusion further taking into consideration of the high cl br ratios resulted from evaporate weathering high δ7li and low cl br characteristics of some shallow groundwater no 60 64 and 65 in the northern shore of salt lake plotted close to salt lake water in fig 5b make us believe that the salt lake saline water intrudes into these shallow groundwater it is noticeable that except for high tds values these three shallow groundwaters are characterized by relatively high f concentrations therefore it can be postulated that salt lake intrusion affects the groundwater quality of wells located in the northern shore of the lake and leads to the enrichment of fluoride and salinity in these groundwater in addition heavy pumping of deep aquifers coupled with irrigation return flow for shallow groundwater result in the growing difference in hydraulic head between the shallow and deep unit and consequently the formation of a large cone of depression cao 2005 shows the difference of hydraulic head exceeds 90 m within the cone of depression west of yuncheng city hence vertical leakage occurs leading to the potential for deep groundwater to be contaminated as inferred from the plot of stable isotopic compositions δ18o and δ2h vs no3 concentrations fig 6 a and 6b in general shallow groundwater is affected more by evaporation due to its shallow water levels nachabe et al 2005 thus shallow groundwater is enriched in heavier isotopes than deep groundwater moreover due to the low background nitrate concentrations in the deep aquifers the elevated δ18o and δ2h values coupled with high no3 concentrations in some deep groundwater samples no 4 28 29 30 and 40 fig 6a and 6b are a strong indication of the downward movement of the shallow groundwater this interpretation is also supported by the plot of δ7li vs no3 values fig 6c deep groundwater generally shows relatively lower δ7li and no3 values however there are some exceptions several groundwater samples located in the kaolao lowland area and wenxi county show high values of δ7li and low no3 concentrations probably reflecting the existence of palaeo saline waters additionally there are some deep groundwater samples that are characterized by relatively higher δ7li and no3 values these combined geochemical and isotopic signals are consistent with gradual vertical leakage of shallow high f saline groundwater near the depression cone as a consequence leakage recharge of shallow high f saline groundwater via recharge window between aquifers is another factor responding for the elevation of fluoride and salinity in deep groundwater 4 3 4 exploitations of deep geothermal water deep groundwater samples no 14 15 16 42 and 50 show cl br ratios similar to geothermal waters fig 2d conferring the sample numbers to their sampling sites all located near the faults the chemistry of these samples may be related to deep drilled geothermal water in the study area drilling of geothermal water is rapidly developed and some serious environmental problems such as groundwater contamination may occur dogdu and bayari 2002 demonstrate that thermal water contribution primarily affects the freshwater wells located around geothermal fields by a visual analysis of the areal distribution of groundwater chemical composition cakin 2003 documents similar results that shallow groundwater contaminated by hot geothermal fluids near izmir turkey by both natural and anthropogenic mechanisms as mentioned above the geothermal waters are characterized by elevated concentrations of most chemical constituents including f b and tds intense water rock interaction and dissolution of hydrothermal carbonate minerals as the major carbon source offer the geothermal waters with relatively higher δ13c values 7 9 in addition the high temperature and good capacity of dissolving rocks in geothermal waters lead to the characteristics of low li isotopic composition groundwater δ7li in the yuncheng basin ranges between 11 and 31 8 with a median value of 22 5 the highest δ7li value is from the shallow groundwater 19 6 31 8 median 24 8 followed by deep groundwater 14 7 21 9 median 21 9 whilst deep geothermal waters show the lowest δ7li values 11 14 3 median 11 8 table 1 therefore in this area δ7li combined with δ13c and b values can be used to trace groundwater contamination due to exploitation of geothermal water fig 7 a and 7b show that two deep groundwater samples no 14 and 15 near the linyi fault are positioned around the mixing straight line between deep fresh groundwater and the geothermal waters the good coincidence in these constituent values further confirms the impact of geothermal water in the yuncheng basin thus we can infer that hydraulic connection exists between deep groundwater and deep geothermal water moreover mixing with these geothermal waters results in the enrichment of fluoride and salinity in deep groundwater in addition shallow groundwater in the area may be contaminated by discharge of untreated hot wastewater according to our preliminary investigation li and gao 2018 one shallow groundwater located in the south side of the salt lake is characterized by a bit higher t and li not shown here considering the lack of salts in this zone the chemical signatures of this shallow groundwater could be due to the improper discharge of the geothermal waters in the area as a whole exploitation of geothermal waters leads to deep groundwater contamination the existence of faults provides favorable condition for the movement of geothermal waters moreover the hot wastewater drainage has been a new source of pollutants for the shallow groundwater 4 4 conceptual model the results of this study provide a basis for a unifying conceptual model that describes the influences of anthropogenic activities on groundwater contamination along a cross section from northwest to southeast along the groundwater flow fig 8 in the e mei highland area fresh groundwater e g no 8 with low f contents has isotopic composition similar to modern precipitation δ18o 10 9 li et al 2016a 2016b indicating that these groundwater are recharged during warm climatic periods such as present at the front edge of the highland area deep geothermal groundwater no 13 is characterized by the lowest δ7li value and high tds f concentrations along the faults these fault structures may offer favorable pathways for the diffusion of deep geothermal energy which result in elevation of salinity and f in deep groundwater near the faults no 14 as noted earlier overall relatively high no3 concentrations in the shallow aquifers suggest that shallow groundwater has clearly been contaminated by agricultural irrigation this vertical irrigation recharge is more pronounced in waters no 84 from the runoff area between kaolao lowland and the center of the yuncheng basin revealed by the increase in salinity cl br ratios and f contents without significant changes of δ18o and δ2h values on the other hand contamination of fertilizer is responsible for the slight increase in the enrichment of salinity and fluoride for those shallow groundwater no 52 in the crop land in the west part of the salt lake additionally densely populated area may bring about groundwater salinization and fluoride pollution due to the improper or poor wastewater treatment as in the northern part of yuncheng salt lake shallow samples e g no 82 with higher nitrate also show high na k b contents low δ7li 20 4 and medium δ13c values 11 pointing towards wastewater for the high f saline component some shallow groundwater near the salt lake are observed to have the highest δ7li values high cl and low cl br ratio similar to those in salt lake saline water this is compelling evidence that salt lake water intrudes into these shallow groundwater due to over pumping of groundwater leading to the enrichment of fluoride and salinity in these groundwaters most deep groundwater are impervious to contamination however elevated and increasing levels of salinity and f in deep groundwaters within the areas of intensive pumping support the hypothesis that downward leakage of shallow groundwater and deep water quality degradation have taken place within the cone of depression west of yuncheng city 5 conclusions arid semi arid inland environments are complex regarding geology hydrogeology land using and human activity practices and present a unique challenge for groundwater sustainable use due to some natural and anthropic processes yuncheng basin is a typical semi arid area in northern china where degradation of groundwater quality has been observed since 1970s in this region the problems associated with groundwater contamination are exacerbated due to large amounts of pollution load received from intensive anthropogenic activities therefore in the yuncheng basin sustainable management of groundwater resources requires a comprehensive understanding of anthropogenic activities that affect groundwater quality the co occurrence of cl br mass ratio and multi isotopes δ2h δ18o δ13c and δ7li have been applied in this study to characterize the impact of anthropogenic activities on groundwater salinization and secondary fluoride enrichment anthropogenic activities contribute significantly to groundwater contamination at yuncheng basin shallow groundwater are more vulnerable to contamination from anthropogenic processes of irrigation leaching wastewater drainage fertilizer application and salt lake intrusion whereas influences from anthropogenic activities on deep groundwater are reflected in two possible scenarios mixing with deep geothermal water and vertical leakage of shallow groundwater a conceptual model has been devised to depict these anthropogenic processes the highest salinity and cl br ratios coupled with higher f values are found in the shallow groundwater located in the runoff area between kaolao lowland and the central basin the consistency of δ18o and δ2h values with increasing cl tds and f concentrations in these groundwater indicate that evaporites and fluoride bearing minerals are flushed during infiltration of irrigation return flow on the other hand salinization and fluoride pollution in some shallow groundwater in the crop land to the west of the yuncheng salt lake can be attributed to the general over utilization of fertilizers in agricultural activities the observations that the shallow samples in the northern part of salt lake with high nitrate are characterized by high na k b contents low δ7li and medium δ13c values reflect the wastewater input into shallow groundwater identified by the combined use of cl chemicals cl concentrations and cl br ratios with δ7li values some shallow groundwater in the northern shore of salt lake bear the imprint of salt lake water pointing to salt lake intrusion having occurred and leading to the enrichment of fluoride and salinity in these groundwater additionally intensive groundwater abstraction brings about vertical leakage of shallow groundwater near the cone of depression increasing the risk of deep groundwater contamination finally deep groundwater quality is also deteriorating along the faults due to the exploitation of geothermal water resulting in elevation of salinity and f in these groundwaters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

6098,substantial concerns have been raised about the degradation of groundwater quality and their harmful effects due to salinization processes and endemic fluorosis issues in china yuncheng basin is an economically important area situated in semi arid northern china which has suffered from severe groundwater contamination and intensive anthropogenic activities agricultural industrial and domestic twenty water quality parameters were surveyed at 85 groundwater and salt lake water sites during august 2013 september 2015 the combining using of cl br mass ratio δ2h δ18o δ13c and δ7li isotopes was employed to investigate the potential impact of anthropogenic activities which are supposed to contribute to groundwater salinization and fluoride enrichment in the yuncheng basin to a large extent results show that shallow groundwater are more vulnerable to contamination from anthropogenic processes of irrigation leaching wastewater drainage fertilizer utilization and salt lake water intrusion vertical irrigation recharge has been an important source of salt and fluoride for the shallow groundwater in the runoff area between kaolao lowland and the central basin revealed by the high salinity 4000 mg l high cl br ratios 2000 moderate high δ7li 19 7 26 1 moderate δ13c 8 1 10 3 and constant δ18o and δ2h values the contribution of over utilization of fertilizers on high fluoride shallow saline groundwater is found in the crop land in the west part of the salt lake with a moderate high nitrate concentration 10 mg l moderate cl br ratios 332 1000 and low δ7li value 13 8 shallow groundwater in the northern part of the salt lake polluted by wastewater evidenced by boron concentration 2000 μg l na k molar ratio 0 6 δ13c 11 11 1 and δ7li 20 4 22 5 show highest fluoride concentrations due to over pumping of groundwater salt lake water intrusion mainly occurs in the northern shore of the lake and results in the enrichment of fluoride and salinity in some shallow groundwater with low cl br ratios around 300 high δ7li value c a 27 and moderate high δ18o 8 2 8 7 and δ2h 62 2 66 1 values the influence of anthropogenic activities on deep groundwater is reflected in two possible scenarios increased extraction of groundwater leads to downward leakage of shallow high fluoride saline groundwater increasing the pollution risk of deep groundwater within the

fresh groundwater by the underground leaking or discharge of geothermal water finally a conceptual model has been developed to demonstrate the influences of anthropogenic activities on groundwater contamination along a northwest to southeast cross section keywords high fluoride saline groundwater anthropogenic activity cl br ratios li isotopes environmental stable isotopes yuncheng basin 1 introduction degradation of groundwater quality due to salinization processes and secondary health related issues e g endemic fluorosis is one of the key issues throughout the world since it restrains sustainable exploitation of groundwater resource for domestic water supply agricultural and environmental uses bovolo et al 2009 karen et al 2017 the problem is intensified in arid semi arid inland areas where natural processes accelerate water quality deterioration by the dissolution of evaporate and fluoride bearing rocks and palaeo saline waters in agricultural areas these natural processes are frequently accompanied by anthropogenic activities such as over exploitation of groundwater wastewater drainage and fertilizer pesticide application which gradually cause the occurrence arise of high fluoride saline groundwater the above situation occurs in the yuncheng basin situated in northern china where industrial agricultural and domestic water supply heavily depend on groundwater elevated contents of tds and fluoride in groundwater have been observed in the study area in the past decade currell et al 2010 gao et al 2007 li et al 2015 due to the rapid development of social economy groundwater in the yuncheng basin has been greatly impacted by large scale intensive anthropogenic activities posing great threats on groundwater quality since 1980 s the lack of basin wide management strategies and occurrence of pollution from various anthropogenic sources only add complexity of the groundwater contamination problem such a situation necessitates comprehensive studies that will characterize and demonstrate the anthropogenic activities involved in groundwater contamination of this inland environment however it would be a challenge to sufficiently demarcate them based on the hydrochemical and multiple isotope tracers in view of its advantages cl br ratio has been used successfully to distinguish between various sources of anthropogenic and naturally occurring pollutants in groundwater alcala and custodio 2008 chien and lautz 2018 katz et al 2011 mcarthur et al 2012 panno et al 2006 typically due to the ideal conservative behavior of cl and br ions during transport several end members that control groundwater contamination processes would result in distinct ranges of cl br ratios the ocean has a constant cl br ratio of 290 davis et al 2001 coastal rainfall receives cl and br along the wind path from the ocean producing a similar cl br ratio inland rainfall especially in semi arid arid areas may have relatively lower cl br ratios on account of the tendency for cl to be removed by deposition of marine aerosols in coastal areas davis et al 2001 edmunds 2001 while evaporite halite weathering would result in high cl br ratios up to 104 105 due to the exclusion of br ion from the mineral structure cartwright et al 2006 kloppmann et al 2001 interaction of shallow groundwater with cl bearing contaminants such as domestic wastewater and fertilizers may also give a high cl br signal while organic degradation may reduce cl br ratios however conclusions only based on cl br ratio would be inconclusive or ambiguous other indicators used to explore anthropogenic influences on groundwater contamination are traditional isotopes δ2h δ18o and δ13c kass et al 2005 leybourne and goodfellow 2007 zouari et al 2011 while traditional tracers can provide some indication of the solute sources non traditional tracers have been found to be valuable one example is the lithium isotope ratio δ7li lithium has two stable isotopes 6li and 7li with relative abundance of 7 52 and 92 48 the large mass difference between the two stable isotopes 17 can produce significant isotope fractionation during geochemical processes making 7li 6li useful for fingerprinting water rock interactions kloppmann et al 2008 millot et al 2007 temperature is a key controlling factor for lithium isotope fractionation the fractionation factor has a significant correlation with temperature which can be expressed by the formula of δ7lilisolution altered rock 7847 t k 8 093 r2 0 93 during water rock interaction process the differences in diffusion coefficients between 6li and 7li could result in different migration behaviors for the two isotopes due to the inverse correlation between diffusion coefficient and mass of the isotope the diffusion coefficient of 6li is higher than that of 7li the result of the diffusion leads to the lithium isotope fractionation between minerals teng et al 2006 additionally the fractionation of lithium isotope may be affected by the coordination number between different phases for lithium having different coordination number in different solid phase oi et al 1997 jahn and wunder 2009 used ab initio molecular dynamic simulations to study the speciation changes in lithium bearing aqueous fluids at high temperatures and high pressures finding that higher pressure higher coordination number and easier occupied by 6li although some studies have applied lithium isotope to natural geology and hydrogeochemical processes systematic research on its application in anthropogenic pollution is less li et al 2016a 2016b taking into consideration of the significant isotope fractionation δ7li is applied in this paper to the identification of various anthropogenic influences such as wastewater drainage geothermal water exploitation and agricultural activity it is expected that lithium isotope could be more applicable in the field of environmental hydrology in this study impacts of anthropogenic activities on the enrichment of fluoride and salinity in groundwater at yuncheng basin are investigated by integrating groundwater chemistry cl br mass ratio and isotopic tools δ2h δ18o δ13c and δ7li the major objectives are 1 to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic activities on groundwater salinization and secondary fluoride enrichment pollution 2 to shed further insights into f rich saline groundwater by combining cl br ratio with isotopes δ2h δ18o δ13c and δ7li 2 study area 2 1 location and geography the yuncheng basin is located in the southeast of shanxi province northern china and extends between latitudes 34 40 and 35 30 n and longitudes 110 15 and 111 25 e the study area comprises two major geographic zones the sushui river basin and the e mei plateau the sushui river basin occupies a subsiding graben that ranges in elevation of 350 500 m above sea level a s l with the zhongtiao fault to the south and linyi fault to the north e mei plateau is a horst block elevation 460 600 m a s l which is located to the north of the linyi fault the yuncheng basin is surrounded by mountains to the south east and north forming a ne sw semi closed rifted basin to the west of the yuncheng basin is the yellow river the so called yuncheng salt lake is situated in the southwest of yuncheng city and covers an area of 120 km2 fig 1 the study area falls under monsoonal climatic condition with the main wet season occurring during the months of july august and september while the driest season months are november december and january the annual average rainfall is of 550 mm year while the total annual evapotranspiration is in excess of 2000 mm far more than the average rainfall han et al 2006 2 2 geology the geology of the study area is summarized by li et al 2015 briefly the basin contains 300 500 m thick quaternary sediments q1 q4 mostly fine grained aeolian loess that is interlayered with fluvial and lacustrine deposits han et al 2006 bedrock outcrops are archean metamorphic rocks arsm to the south of the area adjacent to the zhongtiao mountain composed by hornblendite amphibolites and quartzite elsewhere the sedimentary rocks mainly neogene mudstone and cambro ordivician limestone lie under the quaternary sediments 2 3 hydrogeology the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer of yuncheng basin occurs in two groups shallow and deep the unconfined shallow unit q3 and locally q4 has a depth ranging from 10 to 70 m below the land surface while the q1 and locally q2 consist the confined deep unit at depths of 80 500 m thick fig 1 in the basin groundwater flow is from the margins towards its center groundwater is recharged by meteoric water and lateral penetration of fissure water along the basin margin supplemented by leakage of non perennial river water and irrigation return flow while the discharge occurs via evapotranspiration and artificial abstraction extensive deep groundwater exploitation began in the beginning of 1980 s for public water supply zhao 2002 and the hydraulic head in the deep aquifer has steadily declined this is particularly true within the cone of depression to west of yuncheng city where the rate of drawdown has been 3 m year since 1986 cao 2005 3 methods 3 1 sampling a total of 85 water samples including 34 from shallow aquifers 50 from deep wells and one from yuncheng salt lake were collected across the yuncheng basin during august 2013 september 2015 fig 1 all the samples were stored in new 500 ml polyethylene bottles that had been pre cleaned with distilled water in the laboratory and rinsed with extracted water at least three times during sampling several in situ physico chemical parameters including ph temperature t and electrical conductivity were monitored by hanna ec and ph meter which had been calibrated already alkalinity in the aqueous samples was determined using the gran titration method on the same day of sampling samples for analysis of cations and trace elements were preserved by acidification with reagent quality hno3 to ph 2 while those for other analysis were untreated 3 2 analysis major and trace constituents of the water samples were analyzed at the state key laboratory

all the analyses were completed within 2 weeks after sampling and the analytical charge imbalances were less than 5 the δ18o and δ2h contents of groundwater samples were measured using a finnigan mat

groundwater contamination after alcala and custodio 2008 davis et al 2001 katz et al 2011 mcarthur et al 2012 and panno et al 2006 are summarized in fig 2 in this paper δ13cdic and δ7li isotopes are introduced into the cl cl br systematics to further restrain the assessment of possible anthropogenic activities responsible for the groundwater contamination several possible scenarios are developed to illustrate how the cl cl br coupled with δ13cdic and δ7li of dilute groundwater change under possible processes mixing with salt discharge of wastewater usage of fertilizer and salt lake intrusion fig 2 table 1 the dilute groundwater end member is characterized by the lower cl concentration of 9 mg l cl br ratio of 100 δ7li of 16 9 and δ13c of 10 4 derived from our most dilute samples fig 2 the salt end member has a cl of 10 000 mg l and cl br of 6770 based on data from granato 1996 the given value of δ7li and δ13c isotopes of the salt end member are in the range of 31 0 37 5 huh et al 2001 and 3 16 schmid 2017 respectively the end member for wastewater was confirmed by reported compositions of urine cl 1910 mg l cl br 1240 mcarthur et al 2012 septic leachate cl 91 mg l cl br 769 panno et al 2006 and sewage effluents cl 400 mg l cl br 700 vengosh and pankratov 1998 considering the fact that wastewater may be constituted by various sources nitrogenous fertilizer is widely used in the study area mainly ammonium carbonate nh4 2co3 and urea nh4no3 the cl br ratio of 332 for fertilizer end member is based on chloride and bromide concentrations of about 350 and 1 05 mg l respectively otero et al 2005 as the major anthropogenic sources wastewater δ7li of 13 4 kloppmann et al 2008 and fertilizer 13 8 negrel et al 2010 are characterized by lower δ7li compared to reported δ7li value of natural surface water and groundwater in china gou et al 2019 li et al 2016a 2016b wang et al 2015 and δ13c values 11 vitoria et al 2008 the salt lake water end member has a cl br ratio of 436 with chloride and bromide concentrations of 2687 and 6 16 mg l respectively highest δ7li value 29 2 is the significant characteristic of salt lake water end member it is most likely due to the influence of intensive weathering on the lithium isotope fractionation by deposition of fine clay minerals with preferential adsorption of the light 6li by clay minerals von strandmann et al 2013 consequently salt lake water is strongly enriched with 7li a new end member the geothermal water is introduced in this study as discussed above geothermal water samples have distinct chemical characteristics the geothermal water end member 630 mg l cl cl br 249 represents the mean of five deep geothermal water from the yuncheng basin due to the significant effect of temperature on lithium isotopic fractionation the lowest δ7li 12 4 is recorded in this end member the negative δ13c value 7 9 of the geothermal waters indicate the groundwater dic in origin alçiçek et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 distribution and hydrogeochemistry of f rich saline groundwater the chemical compositions of water samples from yuncheng basin are presented in table 2 groundwater ph varies from 7 1 to 8 8 with f concentration ranging from 0 6 to 9 2 mg l and tds contents being 210 9597 mg l according to the who drinking guideline 1 5 mg l for fluoride who 2011 and classification of freeze and cherry 1979 over 80 of the samples from shallow aquifers and 50 of deep groundwater samples belong to high fluoride brackish or saline groundwater the dominant cation is sodium 5 3024 mg l with major anion as cl 9 1866 mg l so4 2 40 3939 mg l and hco3 62 8 1953 mg l varying extensively vertically relatively lower f contents 2 mg l and tds values 1000 mg l are mostly found in deep aquifers and aqueous f tds concentration generally exhibit a log arithmical attenuation pattern with depth fig 1b and 1c it is also observed that some deep samples contain high f and tds values indicating the probable downward vertical leakage of shallow groundwater distinct hydrochemical characteristics are recorded in groundwater from yuncheng basin fig s1a and s1b chadha 1999 the majority of samples in shallow 74 and deep aquifers 58 fall under na cl so4 type this indicates severe groundwater salinization problems in the study area fluoride enriched groundwater mainly occurs in the saline water zones suggesting the concomitance of fluoride and salinity in the study area higher contents of f 2 1 8 2 mg l and tds 772 3036 mg l are also observed in geothermal waters 23 1 41 8 collected from the locations near linyi fault and mingtiaogang fault minor elements like br b and li reach up to 2 5 folds higher than those in other groundwater the salt lake water exhibits a slightly alkaline ph value 7 9 and high concentrations of f 7 1 mg l and tds 11050 mg l 4 2 potential anthropogenic activities identified by cl br ratios δ13cdic and δ7li isotopes as shown in table 2 cl br ratios 24 0 5307 δ7li 11 0 31 8 δ13c 6 6 13 7 cl 9 0 1866 mg l and f 0 1 9 2 mg l in groundwater in the yuncheng basin are most variable eight shallow wells in the regional groundwater flow through area between kaolao lowland and the center of the basin yield water samples with the highest values of cl br ratios up to 5307 δ7li 31 8 cl 1866 mg l and higher f 5 32 mg l fig 2a higher cl br ratios 2129 3754 and δ7li values 18 8 26 1 also occur in a lot of deep samples with cl concentrations of 173 mg l and low to high f contents 0 11 1 95 mg l fig 2b all these higher cl br ratio samples are mostly located in the kaolao lowland alluvial areas in the northwest of salt lake and the northern part of xiaxian county dissolution of salts evaporites is the most likely mechanism that contributes to the higher cl br ratios cl and f of shallow groundwater near the salt lake with medium high cl br ratio of 200 1000 some 15 samples plot within the area affected by wastewater characterized by an elevated cl concentration and highest f contents up to 771 mg l and 9 2 mg l respectively whilst most plot on or close to the fertilizer mixing line and salt lake mixing line these points correspond to highly variable cl contents 29 4 767 mg l in addition high variable δ7li and δ13c values are observed in these points of groundwater from the deep aquifers some 12 with elevated cl br ratios of 308 1008 and cl concentrations from 96 8 to 931 mg l in the northern shore of the salt lake plot in the area for wastewater and fertilizer influence considering the fact that deep wells are unlikely to be directly affected by wastewater and fertilizer due to retardation of aquicludes cl br ratios and cl contents in these deep wells which are similar to those in shallow groundwater strongly indicate the effects of vertical leakage of shallow groundwater another 12 appear to be impacted by deep geothermal water and are characterized by relatively higher f concentrations 2 33 2 83 mg l and lower δ7li values 17 5 19 4 above all anthropogenic activities contribute to high f contents and salinity in groundwater in the yuncheng basin to a large extent shallow groundwater are more vulnerable to pollution and four possible scenarios are considered 1 dissolution of soluble salts during irrigation activities in the runoff area between kaolao lowland and the center of the basin 2 mixing with wastewater near the salt lake 3 mixing with fertilizer near the salt lake and 4 salt lake water intrusion in the northern part of salt lake due to over exploitation of groundwater influences of anthropogenic activities on deep groundwater are reflected in two possible scenarios 1 mixing with geothermal water due to rapidly developed drilling activities of geothermal resources 2 mixing with shallow leakages due to over pumping of deep aquifers all these scenarios will be discussed below in detail 4 3 influences of anthropogenic activities on high fluoride saline groundwater 4 3 1 impact of irrigation activities in central basin vertical leaching by irrigation return flows in central basin leads to the downward movement of fluoride and salt through the root zone the accumulation of fluoride and salts in the unsaturated zone provides favorable conditions for the enrichment of groundwater fluoride and salinity as demonstrated above several shallow groundwater no 57 75 76 77 78 80 83 and 84 located in the runoff area between kaolao lowland and the center of the basin are clearly set apart from the other samples they have the highest cl br ratios cl and higher f contents fig 2b within the study area irrigated agriculture has been a common practice for at least the last 50 years in most irrigation situations leaching the net downward movement of soil water and salt through the root zone occurs simultaneously fipps 2003 gabriel et al 2012 in the runoff and central part of this arid semi arid basin the sediments and surface soils are consist of lacustrine silts silt clay and clays this waterlogging condition enhances evapotranspiration leading to the accumulation of salts in the unsaturated zone carol et al 2009 the enrichment of salinity of groundwater in these points are affected by dissolution of soluble salts all these groundwater samples are under saturated with respect to halite and gypsum indicating a favorable condition for salt dissolution additionally during the leaching process a small proportion of leachable f would be desorbed into the aqueous phase under neutral to acidic conditions li et al 2015 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 therefore the shallow unconfined groundwater chemistry in the runoff area between kaolao lowland and the center of the basin could have been significantly affected by the infiltrated irrigation return flows the chemistry of which yields high cl br ratio high cl and f contents relationships between stable isotopes δ18o δ2h and chemical signatures tds cl f cl br ratio are studied further to reveal the effect of vertical irrigation leaching on the enrichment of groundwater fluoride and salinity plotting the δ18o data versus cl br ratios reveals two distinct fields of shallow groundwater fig 3 a i sharp increase in δ18o values with minor change of cl br ratio and low to high f contents this could be attributed to evaporation process and or salt lake intrusion which can modify δ18o and δ2h values with no significant change of cl br ratio ii large variations in cl br ratio with little change of stable isotopic compositions which suggests the effect of vertical irrigation leaching or dissolution of evaporates in the saturated zones from fig 3b and 3c three trends can be detected for shallow groundwater i changes in δ18o and δ2h values with no accompanying variation of cl concentrations and low f contents ii simultaneous increase of δ18o and δ2h values with increasing cl concentrations and high f values iii large variations of cl concentration and higher f contents without significant changes of δ18o and δ2h values in zone i the large variation in stable isotopic compositions with little change in chloride concentration could be due to the mixing with lateral recharge water characterized by low cl f concentrations and varying δ18o and δ2h values the relationship between cl concentrations and δ18o and δ2h values in zone ii reflects the effect of evaporation and or leakage of saline water from nearby salt lake evaporation either from the unsaturated zone or in the case of shallow water tables and or intrusion of hyper saline salt lake water can modify the stable isotopic compositions of groundwater with moderate changes of cl concentrations and high f values in contrast the consistency of δ18o and δ2h values in groundwater with increasing cl contents and higher f concentrations in zone iii could be related to vertical leaching of irrigation returns or dissolution of evaporates in the saturated zones the similarity of the conclusions inferred from stable isotopic compositions δ18o vs cl br ratios and stable isotopic compositions δ18o and δ2h vs cl concentrations demonstrates that vertical leaching could have a strong impact on the shallow groundwater contamination in the runoff area between kaolao lowland and the center of the yuncheng basin these groundwater are sensitive to the dissolution of soluble salts in the unsaturated zone during extensive vertical irrigation recharge having the highest tds and f values of 8044 mg l and 5 32 mg l respectively 4 3 2 contamination of wastewater and fertilizer overuse of fertilizers and discharge of wastewater are another anthropogenic practices promoting the formation of high fluoride saline groundwater the groundwater in which fluoride and salinity might have originated from wastewater fig 4 b no 61 62 and 82 are distributed near the yuncheng salt lake on the other hand the groundwater contamination from fertilizer fig 4a no 52 53 63 66 67 68 69 70 and 81 are widely distributed in the northern part of the salt lake and the kaolao lowland these areas are known as high residential population density and agricultural zones in the yuncheng basin in general natural concentrations of nitrate in precipitation are extremely small little no3 can infiltrate into the saturated zone the increase of groundwater fluoride and salinity when accompanied by the presence of no3 10 mg l might lead to the belief that the groundwater are affected by an anthropogenic source of contamination like domestic wastewater and fertilizer from the no3 vs cl plot fig 4a the following two trends can be clearly observed for the shallow groundwater with nitrate contamination 1 significant changes in chloride concentration with no or little variation of nitrate contents such trend corroborates the impact of evaporites dissolution during extensive vertical irrigation recharge on shallow groundwater contamination which discussed above 2 moderate changes of chloride concentration with variations of nitrate contents this can be attributed to mixing with wastewater and or fertilizer the wells either mixing with wastewater or fertilizer yield saline water samples with elevated no3 and f concentrations in general groundwater contaminated by domestic wastewater contains higher sodium to potassium ratio na k than that contaminated by poultry wastes land spraying of hog wastes and fertilizers used on cropland spruill et al 2002 boron is also commonly found at elevated concentrations in wastewater as a result of the use of synthetic na borate additives derived from natural na borate minerals in bleaching agents nishikoori et al 2011 panno et al 2007 as shown in na k vs b plot fig 4b elevated contents of na k and b in group i are consistent with wastewater influences for these wells in addition the δ13cdic of groundwater from these wells show good anti correlation to both na k and cl no3 values fig 4c and 4d wachniew 2006 records that release of isotopically light biogenic carbon can be related to oxidation and decomposition of labile organic matter in wastewater vitoria et al 2008 documents similar conclusions and confirms that the decomposition of organic matter leads to a decrease of δ13cdic with increasing dic thus the relationship between δ13cdic and anthropogenic ions like na k no3 and cl in the shallow groundwater influenced by wastewater further suggest that anthropogenic activities c within organic matter in wastewater could have an impact on groundwater contamination lowering δ13cdic values whilst increasing fluoride and salinity of the studied groundwater two possible mechanisms for this may be considered one is that wastewater dissolves minerals during leaching down ogrinc et al 2019 the second possibility is the microbial processes loomer et al 2015 as stated above the shallow groundwater in the west and northern part of salt lake and the kaolao lowland bear the imprint of wastewater and fertilizer which is identifiable by the combined use of major and minor ions with traditional δ13cdic isotopes 4 3 3 over pumping of groundwater intensive groundwater abstraction for industrial agricultural and municipal water use for decades in the yuncheng basin has disturbed the dynamic balance between fresh water and saline water leading to the intrusion of saline water from the salt lake into aquifer systems to degrade groundwater quality li et al 2016a 2016b as shown in δ7li vs cl plot fig 5 a compared with other shallow groundwater the relatively higher δ7li of several shallow groundwater samples are worth noting basically in the mineral weathering process the differences in diffusion coefficients between 6li and 7li could result in different migration behaviors for the two isotopes thereby leading to lithium isotope fractionation between minerals evaporite dissolution can produce high δ7li values in addition high li content and high li isotopic composition are one of the important characteristics of salt lake water as shown in fig 5 as a consequence the enrichment of δ7li values of those shallow groundwater can be produced by evaporate dissolution or salt lake intrusion further taking into consideration of the high cl br ratios resulted from evaporate weathering high δ7li and low cl br characteristics of some shallow groundwater no 60 64 and 65 in the northern shore of salt lake plotted close to salt lake water in fig 5b make us believe that the salt lake saline water intrudes into these shallow groundwater it is noticeable that except for high tds values these three shallow groundwaters are characterized by relatively high f concentrations therefore it can be postulated that salt lake intrusion affects the groundwater quality of wells located in the northern shore of the lake and leads to the enrichment of fluoride and salinity in these groundwater in addition heavy pumping of deep aquifers coupled with irrigation return flow for shallow groundwater result in the growing difference in hydraulic head between the shallow and deep unit and consequently the formation of a large cone of depression cao 2005 shows the difference of hydraulic head exceeds 90 m within the cone of depression west of yuncheng city hence vertical leakage occurs leading to the potential for deep groundwater to be contaminated as inferred from the plot of stable isotopic compositions δ18o and δ2h vs no3 concentrations fig 6 a and 6b in general shallow groundwater is affected more by evaporation due to its shallow water levels nachabe et al 2005 thus shallow groundwater is enriched in heavier isotopes than deep groundwater moreover due to the low background nitrate concentrations in the deep aquifers the elevated δ18o and δ2h values coupled with high no3 concentrations in some deep groundwater samples no 4 28 29 30 and 40 fig 6a and 6b are a strong indication of the downward movement of the shallow groundwater this interpretation is also supported by the plot of δ7li vs no3 values fig 6c deep groundwater generally shows relatively lower δ7li and no3 values however there are some exceptions several groundwater samples located in the kaolao lowland area and wenxi county show high values of δ7li and low no3 concentrations probably reflecting the existence of palaeo saline waters additionally there are some deep groundwater samples that are characterized by relatively higher δ7li and no3 values these combined geochemical and isotopic signals are consistent with gradual vertical leakage of shallow high f saline groundwater near the depression cone as a consequence leakage recharge of shallow high f saline groundwater via recharge window between aquifers is another factor responding for the elevation of fluoride and salinity in deep groundwater 4 3 4 exploitations of deep geothermal water deep groundwater samples no 14 15 16 42 and 50 show cl br ratios similar to geothermal waters fig 2d conferring the sample numbers to their sampling sites all located near the faults the chemistry of these samples may be related to deep drilled geothermal water in the study area drilling of geothermal water is rapidly developed and some serious environmental problems such as groundwater contamination may occur dogdu and bayari 2002 demonstrate that thermal water contribution primarily affects the freshwater wells located around geothermal fields by a visual analysis of the areal distribution of groundwater chemical composition cakin 2003 documents similar results that shallow groundwater contaminated by hot geothermal fluids near izmir turkey by both natural and anthropogenic mechanisms as mentioned above the geothermal waters are characterized by elevated concentrations of most chemical constituents including f b and tds intense water rock interaction and dissolution of hydrothermal carbonate minerals as the major carbon source offer the geothermal waters with relatively higher δ13c values 7 9 in addition the high temperature and good capacity of dissolving rocks in geothermal waters lead to the characteristics of low li isotopic composition groundwater δ7li in the yuncheng basin ranges between 11 and 31 8 with a median value of 22 5 the highest δ7li value is from the shallow groundwater 19 6 31 8 median 24 8 followed by deep groundwater 14 7 21 9 median 21 9 whilst deep geothermal waters show the lowest δ7li values 11 14 3 median 11 8 table 1 therefore in this area δ7li combined with δ13c and b values can be used to trace groundwater contamination due to exploitation of geothermal water fig 7 a and 7b show that two deep groundwater samples no 14 and 15 near the linyi fault are positioned around the mixing straight line between deep fresh groundwater and the geothermal waters the good coincidence in these constituent values further confirms the impact of geothermal water in the yuncheng basin thus we can infer that hydraulic connection exists between deep groundwater and deep geothermal water moreover mixing with these geothermal waters results in the enrichment of fluoride and salinity in deep groundwater in addition shallow groundwater in the area may be contaminated by discharge of untreated hot wastewater according to our preliminary investigation li and gao 2018 one shallow groundwater located in the south side of the salt lake is characterized by a bit higher t and li not shown here considering the lack of salts in this zone the chemical signatures of this shallow groundwater could be due to the improper discharge of the geothermal waters in the area as a whole exploitation of geothermal waters leads to deep groundwater contamination the existence of faults provides favorable condition for the movement of geothermal waters moreover the hot wastewater drainage has been a new source of pollutants for the shallow groundwater 4 4 conceptual model the results of this study provide a basis for a unifying conceptual model that describes the influences of anthropogenic activities on groundwater contamination along a cross section from northwest to southeast along the groundwater flow fig 8 in the e mei highland area fresh groundwater e g no 8 with low f contents has isotopic composition similar to modern precipitation δ18o 10 9 li et al 2016a 2016b indicating that these groundwater are recharged during warm climatic periods such as present at the front edge of the highland area deep geothermal groundwater no 13 is characterized by the lowest δ7li value and high tds f concentrations along the faults these fault structures may offer favorable pathways for the diffusion of deep geothermal energy which result in elevation of salinity and f in deep groundwater near the faults no 14 as noted earlier overall relatively high no3 concentrations in the shallow aquifers suggest that shallow groundwater has clearly been contaminated by agricultural irrigation this vertical irrigation recharge is more pronounced in waters no 84 from the runoff area between kaolao lowland and the center of the yuncheng basin revealed by the increase in salinity cl br ratios and f contents without significant changes of δ18o and δ2h values on the other hand contamination of fertilizer is responsible for the slight increase in the enrichment of salinity and fluoride for those shallow groundwater no 52 in the crop land in the west part of the salt lake additionally densely populated area may bring about groundwater salinization and fluoride pollution due to the improper or poor wastewater treatment as in the northern part of yuncheng salt lake shallow samples e g no 82 with higher nitrate also show high na k b contents low δ7li 20 4 and medium δ13c values 11 pointing towards wastewater for the high f saline component some shallow groundwater near the salt lake are observed to have the highest δ7li values high cl and low cl br ratio similar to those in salt lake saline water this is compelling evidence that salt lake water intrudes into these shallow groundwater due to over pumping of groundwater leading to the enrichment of fluoride and salinity in these groundwaters most deep groundwater are impervious to contamination however elevated and increasing levels of salinity and f in deep groundwaters within the areas of intensive pumping support the hypothesis that downward leakage of shallow groundwater and deep water quality degradation have taken place within the cone of depression west of yuncheng city 5 conclusions arid semi arid inland environments are complex regarding geology hydrogeology land using and human activity practices and present a unique challenge for groundwater sustainable use due to some natural and anthropic processes yuncheng basin is a typical semi arid area in northern china where degradation of groundwater quality has been observed since 1970s in this region the problems associated with groundwater contamination are exacerbated due to large amounts of pollution load received from intensive anthropogenic activities therefore in the yuncheng basin sustainable management of groundwater resources requires a comprehensive understanding of anthropogenic activities that affect groundwater quality the co occurrence of cl br mass ratio and multi isotopes δ2h δ18o δ13c and δ7li have been applied in this study to characterize the impact of anthropogenic activities on groundwater salinization and secondary fluoride enrichment anthropogenic activities contribute significantly to groundwater contamination at yuncheng basin shallow groundwater are more vulnerable to contamination from anthropogenic processes of irrigation leaching wastewater drainage fertilizer application and salt lake intrusion whereas influences from anthropogenic activities on deep groundwater are reflected in two possible scenarios mixing with deep geothermal water and vertical leakage of shallow groundwater a conceptual model has been devised to depict these anthropogenic processes the highest salinity and cl br ratios coupled with higher f values are found in the shallow groundwater located in the runoff area between kaolao lowland and the central basin the consistency of δ18o and δ2h values with increasing cl tds and f concentrations in these groundwater indicate that evaporites and fluoride bearing minerals are flushed during infiltration of irrigation return flow on the other hand salinization and fluoride pollution in some shallow groundwater in the crop land to the west of the yuncheng salt lake can be attributed to the general over utilization of fertilizers in agricultural activities the observations that the shallow samples in the northern part of salt lake with high nitrate are characterized by high na k b contents low δ7li and medium δ13c values reflect the wastewater input into shallow groundwater identified by the combined use of cl chemicals cl concentrations and cl br ratios with δ7li values some shallow groundwater in the northern shore of salt lake bear the imprint of salt lake water pointing to salt lake intrusion having occurred and leading to the enrichment of fluoride and salinity in these groundwater additionally intensive groundwater abstraction brings about vertical leakage of shallow groundwater near the cone of depression increasing the risk of deep groundwater contamination finally deep groundwater quality is also deteriorating along the faults due to the exploitation of geothermal water resulting in elevation of salinity and f in these groundwaters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

6099,we use sub daily gage records from montane headwater channels in the luquillo experimental forest of puerto rico tropical rainforest and the hj andrews experimental forest of oregon temperate rainforest to characterize differences in discharge pulses rapid high magnitude discharge fluctuations and determine whether the characteristics of discharge pulses differ with respect to drainage area between these two regions the study sites have different precipitation regimes and runoff generation mechanisms and we quantify differences in discharge pulses between sites the assessment of discharge pulses which are defined as flows that are higher than one standard deviation above the historical mean flow at each site represents a novel approach to characterizing flashy discharge events in headwater streams using high temporal resolution datasets our analyses indicate a clear difference between regions with discharge in the luquillo streams pulsing more frequently for shorter periods of time and at higher magnitudes than discharge in the andrews streams we also quantify how discharge pulses change with increasing drainage area at each of the sites differences in discharge pulse metrics with respect to drainage area include an increase in the number of pulses an increase in the normalized magnitude of pulses an increase in the standard deviation in normalized magnitude and a decrease in kurtosis with increasing drainage area at the luquillo site these results indicate that there is no attenuation of discharge pulses with increasing drainage area at luquillo in contrast there is a decrease in the normalized magnitude with increasing drainage area at the andrews site indicating some attenuation of discharge pulses with increasing drainage area the characteristics of these pulsed events have implications for ecological processes by transporting sediment biota and organic matter likely altering stream substrates biotic communities and organic matter retention times keywords discharge pulses headwater streams hydrology temperate rainforest tropical rainforest flow pulses 1 introduction rapid high magnitude discharge fluctuations in forested headwater streams influence the transport of sediment and instream wood as well as long term riverine ecosystem processes e g bilby and likens 1979 bonniwell et al 1999 cadol and wohl 2010 merriam et al 2002 wohl and cenderelli 2000 wohl and jaeger 2009 however the hydrological characteristics of such short term fluctuations in small headwater streams across different climates have received little attention the use of metrics to analyze differences in fluctuations with sub daily measurements has mostly only been assessed in systems with hydropeaking due to dams or in urban catchments e g alonso et al 2017 ten veldhuis and schleiss 2017 and not in headwater streams with short discharge pulses here we quantify the differences in discharge fluctuations along montane headwaters between two regions temperate rainforest in oregon and tropical rainforest in puerto rico we also determine whether the relationship between drainage area and discharge pulse characteristics is different between these regions we draw on the hydrologic analyses to discuss the ecological implications of the characteristics of discharge pulses at these sites with respect to retention of stream organic matter as well as the export of nutrients and sediment using previously published literature in many headwater streams limited subsurface storage rapid surface and subsurface transmission of snowmelt and rainfall from adjacent uplands and limited attenuation within the short channel network and confined valley bottoms all produce fast changes in discharge in response to changes in precipitation compared to lowland higher order streams and rivers niedzialek and ogden 2005 schellekens et al 2004 wohl 2010 zhang et al 2018 fast changes in discharge promotes the rapid transfer of materials and organisms swanson et al 1998 headwater portions of stream networks defined here as including streams that drain less than 100 km2 and are 3rd order or lower are emphasized as being disproportionally important for the transfer of material and organisms from uplands to lowlands adams and spotila 2005 benda et al 2003 clarke et al 2008 haigh et al 1998 meyer et al 1997 swanson et al 1998 wipfli et al 2007 wohl 2017 rapidly fluctuating discharges help to promote transport of bedload green et al 2015 suspended sediment bonniwell et al 1999 wohl and cenderelli 2000 large wood lw cadol and wohl 2010 wohl et al 2019b and smaller particulate organic matter pom such as leaf detritus bilby and likens 1979 merriam et al 2002 because the increased transport capacity during discharge fluctuations can exert an important limit on stream retention of sediment and nutrients we quantify and compare hydrologic characteristics of discharge pulses rapid high magnitude discharge fluctuations in headwater streams of tropic and temperate rainforests where pulses are numerous and driven by intense rainfall our use of the term pulse reflects the commonly accepted definition of a transient variation or disturbance from background conditions junk et al 1989 and benke et al 2000 used the term flood pulse to describe overbank long duration floods in large tropical and subtropical systems while puckridge et al 1998 and tockner et al 2000 used the term flow pulse to acknowledge the ecological importance of fluctuations in discharge relative to some level regardless of whether the flow exceeds or is below bankfull specifically puckridge et al 1998 define a flow pulse not in terms of a threshold but as a rise and fall in discharge or stage at scales of space and time appropriate to the observer s frame of reference pg 55 in headwater streams which may have limited floodplain development due to confined valley bottoms the term flood pulse is a less useful concept since it implies only overbank flows and has been developed and emphasized in larger tropical and subtropical river systems junk et al 1989 puckridge et al 1998 tockner et al 2000 because the original definition in the literature of flow pulse is not attached to a threshold we use the term discharge pulse to distinguish a type of flow pulse which we define here as a flow reaching one standard deviation above the historical mean in a headwater stream thus our term discharge pulse can be seen as fitting within the concept of flow pulses but attached to a specific threshold that is found through investigating the variability in flows in a given headwater stream although studies of headwater streams in a variety of environments indicate the rapid discharge response of these systems to changes in precipitation schellekens et al 2004 wohl 2010 less is known regarding the range of variability of short duration high flows within headwater basins and between climatic zones one of the reasons for few studies of short duration variability within smaller drainages is the rarity of stream gaging networks with sufficient spatial density to capture differences across networks that cover less than a hundred square kilometers suitable gages also need to record flow characteristics over short time intervals in headwater networks where a geomorphically and ecologically significant fluctuation in discharge can last less than an hour analyses of sub daily flow measurements can provide insights into flow patterns that would be missed if only daily or seasonal data are available alonso et al 2017 bevelhimer et al 2015 spurgeon et al 2016 this potential loss of information due to coarse temporal frequency is particularly true for headwater streams in which discharge pulses are of very short duration in addition metrics that characterize one portion of continuous discharge records e g averages variability metrics may not fully describe the continuous nature of discharge pulses analyzing hydrographs as curves i e functional data in addition to using metrics allows for incorporating more information on discharge pulses and flood flows chebana et al 2013 stewart koster et al 2014 as drainage area increases the processes that delay and dampen stream flow responses to precipitation e g increased hillslope and valley bottom storage of surface and subsurface water become more effective resulting in greater attenuation of fluctuating flows dunne and leopold 1978 woltemade and potter 1994 however the changes in the characteristics of short duration high flows with increasing drainage area has not been compared between climates in small headwater streams and differences in precipitation regime and runoff characteristics among sites could potentially result in different changes in discharge pulses with increasing drainage area we use gauging records for the h j andrews experimental forest aef in oregon united states and luquillo experimental forest lef in puerto rico to examine differences in hydrograph characteristics of discharge pulses in a mountainous temperate rainforest compared to a mountainous tropical rainforest we use statistical analyses to assess differences in characteristics for discharge pulses between these two regions metrics used for comparison include frequency of pulses relative magnitude expressed as a percentage above the historical average discharge duration and metrics indicating shape of individual discharge pulses e g skew and kurtosis we also determine differences in discharge pulse characteristics between the regions in relation to increasing drainage area asking whether the relationship between pulse metrics and drainage area differs between regions we use functional data analysis which analyzes the entire pulse as a curve as opposed to calculating a metric from discharge pulses chebana et al 2013 to determine representative curves for each climate zone to gain additional information on discharge pulse shape we then discuss the ecological implications of differences in discharge pulses at the two sites knowledge of these two sites based on previous studies are summarized in table 1 the precipitation regimes differ between aef and lef with more frequent rainstorms distributed throughout the year at lef in addition at aef infiltration rates generally exceed precipitation rates resulting in very little overland flow jones 2000 there is substantial macropore flow and saturation overland flow at lef resulting in rapid delivery of frequent precipitation to the stream channels schellekens et al 2004 because of the differences in precipitation regime precipitation intensity and runoff processes table 1 we expect that discharge pulses will be more frequent of shorter duration and of higher relative magnitude in non seasonal wet tropical rain forest streams lef compared to temperate rain forest streams aef we also expect that pulses in lef will have a steeper falling limb due to the runoff processes at lef which include extensive macropore flow and saturation overland flow schellekens et al 2004 related to drainage area and pulse characteristics we expect that different relationships between pulse characteristics and increasing drainage exist when assessing lef compared to aef as a result of differences in precipitation regimes relative to runoff processes we anticipate that rapid transfer of precipitation to streams due to overland and macropore flow in the lef schellekens et al 2004 likely results in increasing relative magnitude of pulses with increasing drainage area compared to the aef which experiences greater infiltration rates relative to precipitation rates and more subsurface contribution to stream flow in addition we expect that the duration of pulses increases with increasing drainage area in the aef due to the greater infiltration rates relative to precipitation rates delaying the delivery of precipitation to streams and the attenuation of pulses with increasing drainage area thus the influence of drainage area increases on delaying and dampening delivery of precipitation to streams may be stronger in the aef compared to the lef our detailed analyses are able to test and quantify the magnitude of these expected differences that exist between regions with long term data and multiple metrics rather than assuming their general validity assessing pulses as functional data which looks at the curves of all individual pulses to determine differences in pulses among regions has also not been investigated these quantitative comparisons provide a numerical basis for understanding differences in headwater streams 2 study areas the h j andrews aef and luquillo lef sites occur within temperate and tropical rainforests respectively the aef sites represent drainage areas of 0 1 to 62 4 km2 and the lef sites represent drainage areas between 0 3 and 38 8 km2 we chose to use streams within the aef and lef for a detailed analysis of discharge pulses because they met our criteria of i several gages on adjacent streams that drain less than 100 km2 7 seven at aef and nine at lef ii 15 minute recording intervals for stream flow over several years for all but one gaging station at aef and iii extensive published research that characterizes stream ecosystems and biotic response streams at the two sites share a wet climate relative to other environments on earth but represent diverse conditions in terms of seasonality and intensity of precipitation post and jones 2001 as well as inputs processing and retention of coarse particulate organic matter in the lef tropical streams the presence of short duration frequent rainstorms throughout the year and the rapid delivery of water through macropores creates a flashy hydrograph characterized by rapid rise and recession and large differences between base flow and flood peaks schellekens et al 2004 fig 1 a table 1 although streams at aef have a flashier hydrograph compared to streams solely dominated by snowmelt runoff high infiltration rates that exceed precipitation rates jones 2000 and the presence of broad low pressure fronts during winter that produce more prolonged precipitation can create more sustained flows with less difference between base flow and flood peaks than at lef fig 1b table 1 2 1 andrews experimental forest streams the aef is located in the cascade mountains of western oregon fig 2 a the aef covers a total of 64 km2 from 1630 m elevation down to 412 m elevation the hydrothermally altered volcaniclastic rocks of the little butte formation swanson and james 1975 are deeply dissected by glacial fluvial and hillslope processes and covered by conifer forests dominated by douglas fir psuedotsuga menziesii and western hemlock tsuga heterophylla post and jones 2001 the region has a maritime climate with wet winters and dry summers annual precipitation normally exceeds 2540 mm and deep snowpacks are common above 1000 m a continuous flow of upper level moisture originating from the tropics can produce particularly strong winter storms convective storms during summer can also produce more localized intense rainfall post and jones 2001 overland flow occurs rarely because soil infiltration rates exceed 20 cm h which in turn exceeds most precipitation rates jones 2000 macropores are present at shallow depths and soils are fine textured highly porous and well aggregated resulting in the high infiltration rates that can accommodate precipitation inputs harr 1977 post and jones 2001 streams carry flood flows during autumn and winter harr 1981 and floods result from rainfall and rain on snow jones 2000 with the highest stream flow normally resulting from warm rain on snow events during november to february when broad low pressure systems move inland from the pacific ocean baseflow averages about 40 of mean annual streamflow post and jones 2001 the seven stream sites analyzed here are all within the lookout creek watershed which drains to the mckenzie river fig 2a streams are steep and lined with boulders and have either step pool or pool riffle morphology montgomery and buffington 1997 first and second order streams receive abundant wood and litter from adjacent slopes and riparian corridors via debris flows windthrow and tree fall nakamura and swanson 1993 fig 2b mack creek a third order stream in the drainage stores an average of 812 m3 of wood per ha of channel gurnell et al 2002 and this large wood creates steps that account for nearly 30 of the total channel fall faustini and jones 2003 less than 1 of the logs in mack creek move in most years and most movements probably occur during floods with a return interval greater than 25 years gurnell et al 2002 larger streams with wider channels have increasing instream photosynthesis but microbially processed litter transported from upstream remains an important part of the energy base vannote et al 1980 loading and retention of wood in streams decreases progressively downstream minshall et al 1983 naiman and sedell 1979 but channels throughout the network have very high bed roughness grant et al 1990 and enhanced hyporheic exchange along channel segments with closely spaced breaks in bed slope and concave water surfaces anderson et al 2005 2 2 luquillo experimental forest streams the lef in northeastern puerto rico covers 113 km2 of high relief terrain formed over mixed lithologies characteristic of island arc systems fig 3 a larsen and torres sánchez 1998 scatena and lugo 1995 total monthly rainfall is distributed relatively evenly throughout the year as a result of puerto rico s location with respect to the maritime trade winds scatena 1995 precipitation typically results from short duration frequent rainstorms or from longer duration frontal systems or tropical hurricanes comarazamy and gonzález 2011 murphy et al 2017 post and jones 2001 the short duration storms can account for up to 80 of the total annual rainfall scatena 1995 but the longer duration and frequent storms are more likely to produce landslides larsen and simon 1993 scatena and larsen 1991 that introduce substantial sediment and organic matter to streams mean annual rainfall varies from approximately 4400 mm at the highest elevations above 1000 m down to 2300 2600 mm at elevations of 100 m or lower garcia martino et al 1996 ramseyer and mote 2018 vegetation within the lef is classified by elevation into elfin forest on the uppermost peaks colorado forest dominated by cyrilla racemiflora at 900 600 m elevations palm forest dominated by sierra palm prestoea montana and tabonuco forest dominated by dacryodes excelsa at 600 100 m elevations scatena et al 2002 the lef drainage network is composed of numerous small tributaries that merge to form nine major rivers mcdowell et al 2012 the nine gaged stream sites within the lef used in this analysis lie within five watersheds that drain to the coast in northeastern puerto rico fig 3a headwater streams are steep and lined with large boulders with occasional small pools of varying depth fig 3b pike et al 2010 peak flows occur during may through december with discharge closely related to rainfall garcia martino et al 1996 rapid decreases in soil hydraulic conductivity with depth promote saturation overland flow and return flow that together with abundant macropores in the top 20 cm of the soil profile can reduce stream flow response to precipitation to less than 10 min in catchments of less than a few square kilometers schellekens et al 2004 frequent floods ranging from a few hours to a few days alter stream habitat availability scatena and johnson 2001 and nutrient fluxes heartsill scalley et al 2012 2007 droughts and hurricanes occur infrequently covich et al 2003 scatena 1989 but when they occur they affect the stream biota covich et al 2006 baseflow averages between 40 and 45 of mean annual streamflow post and jones 2001 river corridors have similar vegetation communities comprising secondary broad leaf evergreen tropical forest and have similar geological and land use histories secondary forests with closed riparian canopies provide a continuous input of leaf litter for detritivores although leaf fall peaks in april june and reaches a minimum in december march weigert 1970 zalamea and gonzález 2008 primary production is low in small streams because of light limitation and rapid decomposition results in a low standing crop of coarse organic matter webster et al 2003 undisturbed headwater streams in the lef contain much less wood than undisturbed forested headwater streams in temperate regions pike et al 2010 3 methods 3 1 datasets used data available from the early 1950 s to 2013 were used for aef stations in the analyses and data available from the late 1980 s to 2005 were used for each lef station table 2 data were organized by water year which begins on october 1 and ends on september 30 and is named for the year in which the water year ends water years where missing data were sufficient to impact calculations were left out of the analysis water years that were left out include lef basins espiritu santu from 1993 to 1994 and sonadora 1998 and aef basin w7 from 1988 to 1993 at the guaba station a landslide that delivered large amounts of sand to the stream potentially impacting the reliability of measurements in water years 2004 and 2005 however the 2004 and 2005 water year metrics were not outside of the range of variability in the data prior to 2004 and thus we chose to leave those water years in the analysis measurement increments for all stations are 15 min except for the lookout station at aef which has longer measurement intervals earlier in the record 60 minute increments from 1950 to 1986 30 minute increments from 1986 to 2009 we maintained the high temporal resolution of the data 15 minute for all stations except for lookout station because it provides unique information at all stations and only one station deviated from the 15 minute interval table 2 summarizes the drainage areas water years analyzed and the mean flow over the record for each basin although the lengths of record differ for the lef and aef with longer records from aef station we do not believe the difference in record length impacted the analyses because the number of discharge pulses identified was large overall n 12 779 total aef pulses 4 148 lef pulses 8 631 we investigated the data for trends in the records and no substantial trend was found in aef data thus inclusion of the entire dataset was deemed appropriate discharge pulses were extracted by defining a discharge pulse to be when flow rate is faster than one standard deviation above that station s historical mean historical mean was calculated using the entire discharge record under analyses we used one standard deviation as a threshold because after visual inspection it consistently and adequately separated the rising and falling limbs of discharge pulses from baseflow fluctuations see fig 1 flow magnitude had to drop below the threshold for the next high flow to be counted as a separate pulse we considered using two standard deviations for the threshold to limit the number of double peaks counted as a single pulse but the number of peaks extracted were not appreciably different from using one standard deviation in addition using two standard deviations would have overly shortened pulse duration because a large portion of the rising and falling limbs were below the two standard deviation threshold a variety of metrics have been used to characterize stream flow at different time scales particularly for observations made at daily intervals e g olden and poff 2003 in order to characterize the frequency magnitude and shape of short duration potentially sub daily discharge pulses for the lef and aef sites for each station we computed nine summary statistics of discharge pulses by water year day 1 oct 1 the average and standard deviation of peak magnitude of pulses as percent above historical mean qmax and sd qmax the number of pulses n the average and standard deviation of pulse duration in hours d and sd d the average and standard deviation of skew s and sd s and the average and standard deviation of the kurtosis k and sd k percent above historical flow mean rather than absolute peak magnitudes were used to facilitate comparison across stations and to normalize the peak magnitude to mean discharge at each station duration was measured as the length of time flow was above the historical mean threshold for each individual pulse skew and kurtosis were measured to provide information about the shape of pulses namely how asymmetric and how heavy tailed a pulse is respectively we then analyzed these summary characteristics graphically and statistically to portray differences between pulses in the aef and lef and the influence of increasing drainage area between each location 3 2 discharge pulses in relation to previous characterizations of flashiness a discharge pulse is a flashy sequence of flow within a stream the flashiness of a given stream system is usually described as the rate of change in flow poff et al 1997 it has been characterized in different ways including through the use of the ratio between a high percentile flow to a low percentile flow taken from a flow duration curve the standard deviation standardized by the mean flow or the spread between the 75th and 25th percentile flow standardized by the median flow other variations on the coefficient of variation typically the standard deviation divided by the mean flow and through creating a normalized index using the sum of the change in day to day flows baker et al 2004 richards 1990 our discharge pulse definition and extraction relates to flashiness but in the sense that the discharge pulses are the flashy portions of the hydrograph the usefulness of extracting discharge pulses based on a threshold defined by one standard deviation above the mean lies in the ability to analyze solely the pulse characteristics and patterns across headwater streams using high temporal resolution data 3 3 statistical analyses using discharge pulses metrics in order to make cross comparisons between basins in the two regions we scaled each metric to be centered at 0 with standard deviation of 1 by subtracting the mean of each variable from all rivers and years for the entire dataset including both regions and then dividing this difference by the standard deviation of that variable from all rivers and all years we used logistic regression and linear discriminant analyses in r version 3 1 1 r core team 2018 to investigate the hydrologic features of pulses that most distinguish aef pulses from lef pulses logistic regression was conducted using the scaled nine covariates to predict the categorical response temperate aef or tropical lef linear discriminant analysis lda was used on the scaled nine covariates to quantify how each contributes towards the prediction of temperate or tropical to do this analysis a coefficient was generated for each covariate the magnitude of the coefficient reflects how much an increase in a covariate is associated with the chances the river is temperate or tropical if all other covariates are held constant an lda score was calculated for each station for each year by multiplying scaled covariates xi xn by their respective lda coefficient ci xi and then summing them i 1 n 9 c i x i the results of lda can be viewed graphically by constructing a density plot of lda scores which indicates how likely a combination of covariates will be exhibited by a aef or lef stream multiple regression was used to investigate if drainage area has a different association with the characteristics of the discharge pulses for aef or lef regions separate regression models were completed using each of the nine covariates as response variables against the predictor variables of drainage area region aef or lef and an interaction term between the two the form of each model was μ β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 1 x 2 where μ the mean of the response hydrograph characteristic as a function of the covariates x 1 drainage area x 2 categorical variable aef x 2 0 or lef x 2 1 the null hypothesis of interest is whether or not β 3 the coefficient for the interaction term is zero β 3 adjusts the slope of the regression corresponding to the tropical rivers and thus a non zero β 3 means that the association between drainage area and the response hydrograph metric e g the number of pulses is different for aef rivers versus lef alternatively a zero coefficient for an interaction term would mean that the association between drainage area and the response hydrograph characteristic is the same regardless of region if coefficients are small it implies that drainage area has little effect on the response hydrograph characteristic in order to satisfy the usual regression assumptions for normality a box cox power transformation was applied to the response in most of the models to achieve a family wise error rate of α 0 05 a bonferroni correction was made and each interaction term was tested at level α 9 0 0055556 we also used functional data analysis fda techniques to further characterize the shape of discharge pulses between the aef and lef using the r fda statistical package ramsay et al 2018 the entire rise and fall of each discharge pulse is a functional observation this method has been used in applications such as investigating flood frequency chebana et al 2012 and flow ecology relationships stewart koster et al 2014 we extracted each discharge pulse that had at least 3 measurements over their duration which resulted in 10 592 out of 12 779 pulses because the fda technique was used to primarily look at the shape of the pulses between aef and lef and a similar duration is needed to compare across pulses and across regions each pulse was scaled to 40 h by dividing the time of each of the measurements by the pulse s total duration and then multiplying each by 40 h forty hours is about 10 h less than the average pulse duration across all sites the functional observations in this case each individual discharge pulse is fit with a model which allows for determining average curves for each region and to investigate the potential differences between average curves we completed b spline transformations of each discharge pulse which converts the observed discharge values in the pulse into a function that can then be averaged with other functions for each discharge pulse we smoothly transformed the discretely observed data into functional objects via a decomposition into a quadratic b spline basis with 50 basis elements because we are not concerned with predicting discharge pulses and are only concerned with determining average shapes of the pulses we were not concerned with overfitting each pulse functional data objects are then created and can be used to compute mean and standard deviation curves a full detailed description of the fda methods used for this analysis including the equations used to develop functional objects is included in appendix 1 4 results 4 1 discharge pulses between temperate and tropical using pulse metrics fig 4 plots each of the nine covariates of hydrograph characteristics extracted from the yearly pulse data as boxplots demonstrating some of the differences between the aef and lef tables a2 1 and a2 2 in appendix 2 include the extracted hydrograph metrics for each basin for each water year and over the period of record used respectively lef tends to have higher magnitude of pulses as a percent above historical mean and more discharge pulses whereas aef has greater average duration of pulses and greater variability in pulse duration fig 4 the lef streams average approximately 7 times as many discharge pulses each year as the aef streams but discharge pulses at aef have an average event duration about sixteen times as long as those at lef the boxplots also indicate that lef has higher variability in discharge magnitude and potentially higher skew compared to aef fig 4 in logistic regression only four of the nine covariates were needed to achieve perfect distinction between aef and lef number of pulses n standard deviation of magnitude as a percent above historical mean sd qmax average duration d and standard deviation of the duration sd d this means it is possible to determine whether a river is located in aef or lef using just number of pulses variation in the normalized magnitude duration and the variation in duration specifically in our study the aef streams have fewer pulses less variability in the normalized magnitude longer average duration and greater variability in duration than lef streams fig 4 table 3 shows the resulting lda coefficients for each covariate larger values for covariates with positive coefficients increase the likelihood that the river will be lef and conversely larger values for covariates with negative coefficients increase the likelihood that a river will be categorized as aef this relationship for individual covariates is true only when all other covariates are held constant the resulting lda scores for our analysis were between 6 and 10 with non overlapping density curves for aef and lef stations fig 5 a clear divide between the two regions is located at around 0 the height of the density plot indicates how likely a station is to have a combination of hydrograph characteristics produce a particular score lef stations are centered near 2 5 and aef stations near 2 5 lef rivers show much more variability in scores with longer tails in the distribution than the aef rivers this greater variability implies that lef rivers may be more variable in the combination of pulse hydrograph characteristics than aef rivers 4 2 variations in discharge pulses with increasing drainage area between regions in order to determine the associations between drainage area and the pulse metrics we completed multiple linear regression as described in the methods section the estimated models for the multiple regression analyses are included in table 4 along with the coefficients slope terms describing the relationship between the metric and drainage area for each region when analyzing the coefficients for each region individually positive significant coefficients indicate that as the drainage area increases the pulse metric increases i e the coefficient is significantly different than zero negative significant coefficients indicate that as drainage area increases the pulse metric decreases significant interaction term coefficients indicate whether there is a different relationship between the metric and drainage area when compared between regions because of the form of the model the exact p value for lef coefficients cannot be computed but the significance of the relationship between the metric and drainage area for lef can be inferred when looking at the relationship between aef metrics and drainage area and the interaction term significance for example for the number of pulses metric there is no significant relationship between number of pulses and drainage area for aef but there is a significant interaction term indicating that the lef coefficient for the relationship between number of pulses and drainage area is a significant relationship the significant relationships between drainage area and the pulse metrics correspond to the models with number of pulses magnitude as a percent above the historical mean standard deviation of magnitude as a percent above the historical mean and average pulse kurtosis table 4 therefore the association between drainage area and these four pulse characteristics is different for each region for aef there is no relationship between number of pulses and drainage area but for lef there is a slight decrease in number of pulses with increasing drainage area fig 6 a when considering magnitude as a percent above the historical mean there is a slight decrease in magnitude with increasing drainage area in aef and an increase in magnitude with increasing drainage area in lef fig 6b the positive coefficient for the normalized magnitude for lef indicates a stronger increase in normalized magnitude with increasing drainage area compared to the small decrease in normalized magnitude in the aef thus the normalized pulse magnitude metric indicates a slight dampening of the peak pulse discharge relative to the average value in the aef but an increase in lef fig 6b the standard deviation of normalized pulse magnitude increases slightly in lef with increasing drainage area with no significant relationship in aef fig 6c indicating that as drainage area increases the variation in pulse magnitude increases at lef finally the average kurtosis of the discharge pulses decreases slightly in lef with increasing drainage area with no significant relationship in aef fig 6d 4 3 differences in shape of discharge pulses between regions we used fda to further investigate the average pulse shapes for each region fig 7 shows the average curve and the standard deviation for each region using the discharge pulses scaled to the same duration of 40 h clear differences in the mean curves indicate that lef pulses peak at a much higher magnitude in addition the lef pulses have a steeper receding limb of the pulses while the receding limb of the aef pulses is more gradual the higher standard deviation of the lef pulses indicate that there is greater variability in pulses in the lef compared to aef the greatest variability in the pulses occur at the peak for both aef and lef 5 discussion 5 1 hydrologic variations between regions and with increasing drainage area our results support the expectations that discharge pulses are more frequent more events per year of shorter duration and of higher magnitudes relative to the historical mean in lef compared to aef fig 4 these patterns are predictable from what is known of regional hydrographs flow in the tropical streams generally pulse more frequently for shorter periods of time and at higher magnitudes than flow in the temperate streams reflecting greater frequency of rainstorms greater amounts of average annual precipitation and more efficient transmission of water from hillslopes to streams brown et al 1983 post and jones 2001 schellekens et al 2004 the lda analyses indicate that some metrics of discharge pulses can provide a complete distinction between aef and lef number of pulses standard deviation of magnitude as a percent above historical mean average duration and standard deviation of the duration fig 5 lef pulses also have greater variability in magnitude relative to the historical mean and higher skew of discharge pulses plotting lda scores is a useful tool to examine variability between basins and could be used as a more standard tool in hydrology to discriminate between basins potential applications of lda analysis could include using it to identify outlier basins that have different hydrologic responses than nearby basins help construct design pulses from reservoir releases to more closely match the characteristics of undammed basins nearby compare different land management scenarios or to compare discharge pulse characteristics pre and post disturbances e g fire our expectation that pulses in lef will have a steeper falling limb relative to aef is supported by the mean curves of discharge pulses from fda analyses fig 7 normalizing the pulses to 40 h allows us to compare other aspects of the pulse such as shape without being overwhelmed by the already clear difference in duration high infiltration rates in the aef relative to precipitation rates jones 2000 likely promotes a slower decline of discharge on the falling limb of the discharge pulse in contrast there is substantial macropore and overland flow in the lef schellekens et al 2004 which is common in the humid tropics chappell 2010 and may contribute to the relatively steep receding limb in pulses due to preferential transport in hillslopes variations in normalized magnitude with increasing drainage area also aligned with our expectations we found a slight decrease in normalized magnitude in the aef but an increase in normalized magnitude in the lef table 4 and fig 6b which may be due to the rapid transfer of precipitation to streams in the lef caused by overland and macropore flow while the aef has higher infiltration rates relative to precipitation harr 1977 jones 2000 schellekens et al 2004 thus pulse attenuation with increasing drainage area is greater in the aef compared to the lef the number of pulses increases with increasing drainage area at lef and does not change significantly with increasing drainage area in the aef the increase in the number of pulses with increasing drainage area could be a result of the larger drainage area sites receiving multiple pulses from incoming tributaries in a precipitation regime that experiences frequent short duration precipitation compared to aef scatena 1995 aef precipitation events many times result from broad low pressure systems that move inland from the pacific ocean post and jones 2001 potentially resulting in a spatially extensive pulse throughout the aef in addition there are a much larger number of pulses in lef compared to aef overall fig 4 and the high infiltration rates at aef may dampen and reduce the number of pulses within streams from storm events the standard deviation of the normalized magnitude also demonstrates a significant relationship with increasing drainage area increasing slightly at lef but lacking a significant relationship in the aef similar to the number of pulses the standard deviation of normalized magnitude in the lef could increase with increasing drainage area due to short duration rainstorms occurring in different portions of the headwater basins resulting in more variable pulse magnitudes at larger drainage areas finally average kurtosis slightly decreases in lef with increasing drainage area but has no significant relationship with drainage area in the aef although somewhat difficult to interpret kurtosis indicates how heavy tailed a pulse is and a slight decrease in kurtosis with drainage area indicates thinner tails for the pulse as drainage area increases there is no thickening of the pulse tails with increasing drainage area due to attenuation at lef but the pulses become more peaked with thinner tails as drainage area increases this could potentially be a consequence of increasing pulse magnitude as drainage area increases however the coefficient for kurtosis is quite small table 4 and thus the effect of increasing drainage area on kurtosis is likely weak the lack of significant relationships between the additional 5 pulse metrics average and standard deviation of pulse duration and skew and standard deviation of kurtosis and drainage area may be due to the relatively small drainage areas across the entire study in particular we expected that the average duration of pulses would increase with increasing drainage area in the aef due to attenuation of low flow with increasing drainage area but no significant relationship exists table 4 headwater streams many times do not display expected downstream trends in channel morphology due to the influence of local knickpoints coarse sediment and debris inputs direct connections to hillslopes and limited floodplain development adams and spotila 2005 because the stations in both aef and lef occur over limited drainage areas the attenuation of pulse metrics through slowing of pulses and increasing duration likely does not occur 5 2 ecological implications of discharge pulses disturbances such as discharge pulses can physically move organisms along a stream both through downstream transport and through increased hydrologic connection between different habitats transient states of discharge and stream substrate are particularly important to the survival rates of stream organisms which must withstand the stresses imposed by conditions such as exceptionally high velocity and turbulence or rapid sedimentation on the streambed e g erman et al 1988 fausch and bramblett 1991 johnson et al 1998 swanson et al 1998 zimmermann et al 2014 discharge pulses also temporarily reduce physical storage associated with obstacles to flow and zones of flow separation and increase flow velocity thus increasing the rate of loss of organic materials in stream ecosystems minshall et al 1983 the differences in discharge pulse characteristics between the aef and lef along with differences in channel morphology likely influence stream ecosystems the high magnitude discharge pulses at lef produce large values of shear stress and transport capacity that in combination with rapid decay limit retention of wood and other coarse particulate organic matter entering the streams thus we expect that streams at lef have relatively short residence times for organic matter the lower magnitude longer duration flow pulses present at aef combined with the greater capacity for storage of organic matter indicate that streams at aef likely have longer turnover times and distances for organic matter than streams at lef and generally greater stream retention relative to the aef minimal instream wood is present in the lef pyron et al 1999 and retention of organic matter occurs mainly in the interstices between coarse sediment or along channel margins in zones of reduced flow velocity the exception to these relatively low wood inputs and limited retention occurs when large tropical storms and hurricanes create transient organic debris dams throughout the lef wohl et al 2019a measurements in quebrada bisley a headwater tributary of the rio mameyes however provide a cautionary note merriam et al 2002 found that only 37 of instream fine benthic organic matter was removed during a discharge pulse in which discharge increased more than twenty fold the frequency of such discharge pulses as seen by the high number of pulses at lef compared to aef however suggests that organic matter is removed fairly effectively during most years especially given the long travel distances noted by merriam et al 2002 for organic matter dislodged in quebrada bisley although the discharge pulses analyzed here are not explicitly linked to ecological traits and species response there is a need to move away from using only hydrologic metrics from daily discharge measurements towards a more complex understanding of hydrologic dynamics and associated effects arthington et al 2018 using discharge measurements at high temporal resolution particularly in headwater streams along with functional data to assess the entire shape of a discharge pulse is an advancement towards measuring and assessing complex hydrologic processes and determining the potential impact on ecological processes in headwater stream 6 conclusion we find that discharge pulses taken from sub daily discharge measurements in headwater streams are distinctly different when comparing the aef and lef regions the differences in discharge pulses are likely the result of differences in precipitation regimes runoff processes and the relationship between precipitation rate and infiltration rates treating the discharge pulses as functional data and averaging across all pulses allows for comparison of rising and falling limbs of pulses as well as the variability in pulses between tropical and temperate sites the drainage area and discharge pulse relationship differed between study regions for some of the pulse characteristics shedding further light on runoff processes and attenuation in headwater streams across regions further work is needed across diverse temperate and tropical headwater streams to determine whether the differences between aef and lef apply elsewhere characterizing regional differences in discharge pulses provides a useful starting point for understanding how physical differences in stream ecosystems can influence organic matter retention and ecosystem processes our results indicate that sub daily high temporal resolution discharge data can provide important insights into the hydrological patterns of stream discharge in small headwater streams fully quantifying differences between regions is also important in the context of management regimes and climate change which may modify discharge pulses in the future declaration of competing interest the

6099,we use sub daily gage records from montane headwater channels in the luquillo experimental forest of puerto rico tropical rainforest and the hj andrews experimental forest of oregon temperate rainforest to characterize differences in discharge pulses rapid high magnitude discharge fluctuations and determine whether the characteristics of discharge pulses differ with respect to drainage area between these two regions the study sites have different precipitation regimes and runoff generation mechanisms and we quantify differences in discharge pulses between sites the assessment of discharge pulses which are defined as flows that are higher than one standard deviation above the historical mean flow at each site represents a novel approach to characterizing flashy discharge events in headwater streams using high temporal resolution datasets our analyses indicate a clear difference between regions with discharge in the luquillo streams pulsing more frequently for shorter periods of time and at higher magnitudes than discharge in the andrews streams we also quantify how discharge pulses change with increasing drainage area at each of the sites differences in discharge pulse metrics with respect to drainage area include an increase in the number of pulses an increase in the normalized magnitude of pulses an increase in the standard deviation in normalized magnitude and a decrease in kurtosis with increasing drainage area at the luquillo site these results indicate that there is no attenuation of discharge pulses with increasing drainage area at luquillo in contrast there is a decrease in the normalized magnitude with increasing drainage area at the andrews site indicating some attenuation of discharge pulses with increasing drainage area the characteristics of these pulsed events have implications for ecological processes by transporting sediment biota and organic matter likely altering stream substrates biotic communities and organic matter retention times keywords discharge pulses headwater streams hydrology temperate rainforest tropical rainforest flow pulses 1 introduction rapid high magnitude discharge fluctuations in forested headwater streams influence the transport of sediment and instream wood as well as long term riverine ecosystem processes e g bilby and likens 1979 bonniwell et al 1999 cadol and wohl 2010 merriam et al 2002 wohl and cenderelli 2000 wohl and jaeger 2009 however the hydrological characteristics of such short term fluctuations in small headwater streams across different climates have received little attention the use of metrics to analyze differences in fluctuations with sub daily measurements has mostly only been assessed in systems with hydropeaking due to dams or in urban catchments e g alonso et al 2017 ten veldhuis and schleiss 2017 and not in headwater streams with short discharge pulses here we quantify the differences in discharge fluctuations along montane headwaters between two regions temperate rainforest in oregon and tropical rainforest in puerto rico we also determine whether the relationship between drainage area and discharge pulse characteristics is different between these regions we draw on the hydrologic analyses to discuss the ecological implications of the characteristics of discharge pulses at these sites with respect to retention of stream organic matter as well as the export of nutrients and sediment using previously published literature in many headwater streams limited subsurface storage rapid surface and subsurface transmission of snowmelt and rainfall from adjacent uplands and limited attenuation within the short channel network and confined valley bottoms all produce fast changes in discharge in response to changes in precipitation compared to lowland higher order streams and rivers niedzialek and ogden 2005 schellekens et al 2004 wohl 2010 zhang et al 2018 fast changes in discharge promotes the rapid transfer of materials and organisms swanson et al 1998 headwater portions of stream networks defined here as including streams that drain less than 100 km2 and are 3rd order or lower are emphasized as being disproportionally important for the transfer of material and organisms from uplands to lowlands adams and spotila 2005 benda et al 2003 clarke et al 2008 haigh et al 1998 meyer et al 1997 swanson et al 1998 wipfli et

2010 wohl et al 2019b and smaller particulate organic matter pom such as leaf detritus bilby and likens 1979 merriam et al 2002 because the increased transport capacity during discharge fluctuations can exert an important limit on stream retention of sediment and nutrients we quantify and compare hydrologic characteristics of discharge pulses rapid high magnitude discharge fluctuations in headwater streams of tropic and temperate rainforests where pulses are numerous and driven by intense rainfall our use of the term pulse reflects the commonly accepted definition of a transient variation or disturbance from background conditions junk et al 1989 and benke et al 2000 used the term flood pulse to describe overbank long duration floods in large tropical and subtropical systems while puckridge et al 1998 and tockner et al 2000 used the term flow pulse to acknowledge the ecological importance of fluctuations in discharge relative to some level regardless of whether the flow exceeds or is below bankfull specifically puckridge et al 1998 define a flow pulse not in terms of a threshold but as a rise and fall in discharge or stage at scales of space and time appropriate to the observer s frame of reference pg 55 in headwater streams which may have limited floodplain development due to confined valley bottoms the term flood pulse is a less useful concept since it implies only overbank flows and has been developed and emphasized in larger tropical and subtropical river systems junk et al 1989 puckridge et al 1998 tockner et al 2000 because the original definition in the literature of flow pulse is not attached to a threshold we use the term discharge pulse to distinguish a type of flow pulse which we define here as a flow reaching one standard deviation above the historical mean in a headwater stream thus our term discharge pulse can be seen as fitting within the concept of flow pulses but attached to a specific threshold that is found through investigating the variability in flows in a given headwater stream although studies of headwater streams in a variety of environments indicate the rapid discharge response of these systems to changes in precipitation schellekens et al 2004 wohl 2010 less is known regarding the range of variability of short duration high flows within headwater basins and between climatic zones one of the reasons for few studies of short duration variability within smaller drainages is the rarity of stream gaging networks with sufficient spatial density to capture differences across networks that cover less than a hundred square kilometers suitable gages also need to record flow characteristics over short time intervals in headwater networks where a geomorphically and ecologically significant fluctuation in discharge can last less than an hour analyses of sub daily flow measurements can provide insights into flow patterns that would be missed if only daily or seasonal data are available alonso et al 2017 bevelhimer et al 2015 spurgeon et al 2016 this potential loss of information due to coarse temporal frequency is particularly true for headwater streams in which discharge pulses are of very short duration in addition metrics that characterize one portion of continuous discharge records e g averages variability metrics may not fully describe the continuous nature of discharge pulses analyzing hydrographs as curves i e functional data in addition to using metrics allows for incorporating more information on discharge pulses and flood flows chebana et al 2013 stewart koster et al 2014 as drainage area increases the processes that delay and dampen stream flow responses to precipitation e g increased hillslope and valley bottom storage of surface and subsurface water become more effective resulting in greater attenuation of fluctuating flows dunne and leopold 1978 woltemade and potter 1994 however the changes in the characteristics of short duration high flows with increasing drainage area has not been compared between climates in small headwater streams and differences in precipitation regime and runoff characteristics among sites could potentially result in different changes in discharge pulses with increasing drainage area we use gauging records for the h j andrews experimental forest aef in oregon united states and luquillo experimental forest lef in puerto rico to examine differences in hydrograph characteristics of discharge pulses in a mountainous temperate rainforest compared to a mountainous tropical rainforest we use statistical analyses to assess differences in characteristics for discharge pulses between these two regions metrics used for comparison include frequency of pulses relative magnitude expressed as a percentage above the historical average discharge duration and metrics indicating shape of individual discharge pulses e g skew and kurtosis we also determine differences in discharge pulse characteristics between the regions in relation to increasing drainage area asking whether the relationship between pulse metrics and drainage area differs between regions we use functional data analysis which analyzes the entire pulse as a curve as opposed to calculating a metric from discharge pulses chebana et al 2013 to determine representative curves for each climate zone to gain additional information on discharge pulse shape we then discuss the ecological implications of differences in discharge pulses at the two sites knowledge of these two sites based on previous studies are summarized in table 1 the precipitation regimes differ between aef and lef with more frequent rainstorms distributed throughout the year at lef in addition at aef infiltration rates generally exceed precipitation rates resulting in very little overland flow jones 2000 there is substantial macropore flow and saturation overland flow at lef resulting in rapid delivery of frequent precipitation to the stream channels schellekens et al 2004 because of the differences in precipitation regime precipitation intensity and runoff processes table 1 we expect that discharge pulses will be more frequent of shorter duration and of higher relative magnitude in non seasonal wet tropical rain forest streams lef compared to temperate rain forest streams aef we also expect that pulses in lef will have a steeper falling limb due to the runoff processes at lef which include extensive macropore flow and saturation overland flow schellekens et al 2004 related to drainage area and pulse characteristics we expect that different relationships between pulse characteristics and increasing drainage exist when assessing lef compared to aef as a result of differences in precipitation regimes relative to runoff processes we anticipate that rapid transfer of precipitation to streams due to overland and macropore flow in the lef schellekens et al 2004 likely results in increasing relative magnitude of pulses with increasing drainage area compared to the aef which experiences greater infiltration rates relative to precipitation rates and more subsurface contribution to stream flow in addition we expect that the duration of pulses increases with increasing drainage area in the aef due to the greater infiltration rates relative to precipitation rates delaying the delivery of precipitation to streams and the attenuation of pulses with increasing drainage area thus the influence of drainage area increases on delaying and dampening delivery of precipitation to streams may be stronger in the aef compared to the lef our detailed analyses are able to test and quantify the magnitude of these expected differences that exist between regions with long term data and multiple metrics rather than assuming their general validity assessing pulses as functional data which looks at the curves of all individual pulses to determine differences in pulses among regions has also not been investigated these quantitative comparisons provide a numerical basis for understanding differences in headwater streams 2 study areas the h j andrews aef and luquillo lef sites occur within temperate and tropical rainforests respectively the aef sites represent drainage areas of 0 1 to 62 4 km2 and the lef sites represent drainage areas between 0 3 and 38 8 km2 we chose to use streams within the aef and lef for a detailed analysis of discharge pulses because they met our criteria of i several gages on adjacent streams that drain less than 100 km2 7 seven at aef and nine at lef ii 15 minute recording intervals for stream flow over several years for all but one gaging station at aef and iii extensive published research that characterizes stream ecosystems and biotic response streams at the two sites share a wet climate relative to other environments on earth but represent diverse conditions in terms of seasonality and intensity of precipitation post and jones 2001 as well as inputs processing and retention of coarse particulate organic matter in the lef tropical streams the presence of short duration frequent rainstorms throughout the year and the rapid delivery of water through macropores creates a flashy hydrograph characterized by rapid rise and recession and large differences between base flow and flood peaks schellekens et al 2004 fig 1 a table 1 although streams at aef have a flashier hydrograph compared to streams solely dominated by snowmelt runoff high infiltration rates that exceed precipitation rates jones 2000 and the presence of broad low pressure fronts during winter that produce more prolonged precipitation can create more sustained flows with less difference between base flow and flood peaks than at lef fig 1b table 1 2 1 andrews experimental forest streams the aef is located in the cascade mountains of western oregon fig 2 a the aef covers a total of 64 km2 from 1630 m elevation down to 412 m elevation the hydrothermally altered volcaniclastic rocks of the little butte formation swanson and james 1975 are deeply dissected by glacial fluvial and hillslope processes and covered by conifer forests dominated by douglas fir psuedotsuga menziesii and western hemlock tsuga heterophylla post and jones 2001 the region has a maritime climate with wet winters and dry summers annual precipitation normally exceeds 2540 mm and deep snowpacks are common above 1000 m a continuous flow of upper level moisture originating from the tropics can produce particularly strong winter storms convective storms during summer can also produce more localized intense rainfall post and jones 2001 overland flow occurs rarely because soil infiltration rates exceed 20 cm h which in turn exceeds most precipitation rates jones 2000 macropores are present at shallow depths and soils are fine textured highly porous and well aggregated resulting in the high infiltration rates that can accommodate precipitation inputs harr 1977 post and jones 2001 streams carry flood flows during autumn and winter harr 1981 and floods result from rainfall and rain on snow jones 2000 with the highest stream flow normally resulting from warm rain on snow events during november to february when broad low pressure systems move inland from the pacific ocean baseflow averages about 40 of mean annual streamflow post and jones 2001 the seven stream sites analyzed here are all within the lookout

wood in streams decreases progressively downstream minshall et al 1983 naiman and sedell 1979 but channels throughout the network have very high bed roughness grant et al 1990 and enhanced hyporheic

of the total annual rainfall scatena 1995 but the longer duration and frequent storms are more likely to produce landslides larsen and simon 1993 scatena and larsen 1991 that introduce substantial

december with discharge closely related to rainfall garcia martino et al 1996 rapid decreases in soil hydraulic conductivity with depth promote saturation overland flow and return flow that together with abundant macropores in the top 20 cm of the soil profile can reduce stream flow response to precipitation to less than 10 min in catchments of less than a few square kilometers schellekens et al

reliability of measurements in water years 2004 and 2005 however the 2004 and 2005 water year metrics were not outside of the range of variability in the data prior to 2004 and thus we chose to leave those water years in the analysis measurement increments for all stations are 15 min except for the lookout station at aef which has longer measurement intervals earlier in the record 60 minute increments from 1950 to 1986 30 minute increments from 1986 to 2009 we maintained the high temporal resolution of the data 15 minute for all stations except for lookout station because it provides unique information at all stations and only one station deviated from the 15 minute interval table 2 summarizes the drainage areas water years analyzed and the mean flow over the record for each basin although the lengths of record differ for the lef and aef with longer records from aef station we do not believe the difference in record length impacted the analyses because the number of discharge pulses identified was large overall n 12 779 total aef pulses 4 148 lef pulses 8 631 we investigated the data for trends in the records and no substantial trend was found in aef data thus inclusion of the entire dataset was deemed appropriate discharge pulses were extracted by defining a discharge pulse to be when flow rate is faster than one standard deviation above that station s historical mean historical mean was calculated using the entire discharge record under analyses we used one standard deviation as a threshold because after visual inspection it consistently and adequately separated the rising and falling limbs of discharge pulses from baseflow fluctuations see fig 1 flow magnitude had to drop below the threshold for the next high flow to be counted as a separate pulse we considered using two standard deviations for the threshold to limit the number of double peaks counted as a single pulse but the number of peaks extracted were not appreciably different from using one standard deviation in addition using two standard deviations would have overly shortened pulse duration because a large portion of the rising and falling limbs were below the two standard deviation threshold a variety of metrics have been used to characterize stream flow at different time scales particularly for observations made at daily intervals e g olden and poff 2003 in order to characterize the frequency magnitude and shape of short duration potentially sub daily discharge pulses for the lef and aef sites for each station we computed nine summary statistics of discharge pulses by water year day 1 oct 1 the average and standard deviation of peak magnitude of pulses as percent above historical mean qmax and sd qmax the number of pulses n the average and standard deviation of pulse duration in hours d and sd d the average and standard deviation of skew s and sd s and the average and standard deviation of the kurtosis k and sd k percent above historical flow mean rather than absolute peak magnitudes were used to facilitate comparison across stations and to normalize the peak magnitude to mean discharge at each station duration was measured as the length of time flow was above the historical mean threshold for each individual pulse skew and kurtosis were measured to provide information about the shape of pulses namely how asymmetric and how heavy tailed a pulse is respectively we then analyzed these summary characteristics graphically and statistically to portray differences between pulses in the aef and lef and the influence of increasing drainage area between each location 3 2 discharge pulses in relation to previous characterizations of flashiness a discharge pulse is a flashy sequence of flow within a stream the flashiness of a given stream system is usually described as the rate of change in flow poff et al 1997 it has been characterized in different ways including through the use of the ratio between a high percentile flow to a low percentile flow taken from a flow duration curve the standard deviation standardized by the mean flow or the spread between the 75th and 25th percentile flow standardized by the median flow other variations on the coefficient of variation typically the standard deviation divided by the mean flow and through creating a normalized index using the sum of the change in day to day flows baker et al 2004 richards 1990 our discharge pulse definition and extraction relates to flashiness but in the sense that the discharge pulses are the flashy portions of the hydrograph the usefulness of extracting discharge pulses based on a threshold defined by one standard deviation above the mean lies in the ability to analyze solely the pulse characteristics and patterns across headwater streams using high temporal resolution data 3 3 statistical analyses using discharge pulses metrics in order to make cross comparisons between basins in the two regions we scaled each metric to be centered at 0 with standard deviation of 1 by subtracting the mean of each variable from all rivers and years for the entire dataset including both regions and then dividing this difference by the standard deviation of that variable from all rivers and all years we used logistic regression and linear discriminant analyses in r version 3 1 1 r core team 2018 to investigate the hydrologic features of pulses that most distinguish aef pulses from lef pulses logistic regression was conducted using the scaled nine covariates to predict the categorical response temperate aef or tropical lef linear discriminant analysis lda was used on the scaled nine covariates to quantify how each contributes towards the prediction of temperate or tropical to do this analysis a coefficient was generated for each covariate the magnitude of the coefficient reflects how much an increase in a covariate is associated with the chances the river is temperate or tropical if all other covariates are held constant an lda score was calculated for each station for each year by multiplying scaled covariates xi xn by their respective lda coefficient ci xi and then summing them i 1 n 9 c i x i the results of lda can be viewed graphically by constructing a density plot of lda scores which indicates how likely a combination of covariates will be exhibited by a aef or lef stream multiple regression was used to investigate if drainage area has a different association with the characteristics of the discharge pulses for aef or lef regions separate regression models were completed using each of the nine covariates as response variables against the predictor variables of drainage area region aef or lef and an interaction term between the two the form of each model was μ β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 1 x 2 where μ the mean of the response hydrograph characteristic as a function of the covariates x 1 drainage area x 2 categorical variable aef x 2 0 or lef x 2 1 the null hypothesis of interest is whether or not β 3 the coefficient for the interaction term is zero β 3 adjusts the slope of the regression corresponding to the tropical rivers and thus a non zero β 3 means that the association between drainage area and the response hydrograph metric e g the number of pulses is different for aef rivers versus lef alternatively a zero coefficient for an interaction term would mean that the association between drainage area and the response hydrograph characteristic is the same regardless of region if coefficients are small it implies that drainage area has little effect on the response hydrograph characteristic in order to satisfy the usual regression assumptions for normality a box cox power transformation was applied to the response in most of the models to achieve a family wise error rate of α 0 05 a bonferroni correction was made and each interaction term was tested at level α 9 0 0055556 we also used functional data analysis fda techniques to further characterize the shape of discharge pulses between the aef and lef using the r fda statistical package ramsay et al 2018 the entire rise and fall of each discharge pulse is a functional observation this method has been used in applications such as investigating flood frequency chebana et al 2012 and flow ecology relationships stewart koster et al 2014 we extracted each discharge pulse that had at least 3 measurements over their duration which resulted in 10 592 out of 12 779 pulses because the fda technique was used to primarily look at the shape of the pulses between aef and lef and a similar duration is needed to compare across pulses and across regions each pulse was scaled to 40 h by dividing the time of each of the measurements by the pulse s total duration and then multiplying each by 40 h forty hours is about 10 h less than the average pulse duration across all sites the functional observations in this case each individual discharge pulse is fit with a model which allows for determining average curves for each region and to investigate the potential differences between average curves we completed b spline transformations of each discharge pulse which converts the observed discharge values in the pulse into a function that can then be averaged with other functions for each discharge pulse we smoothly transformed the discretely observed data into functional objects via a decomposition into a quadratic b spline basis with 50 basis elements because we are not concerned with predicting discharge pulses and are only concerned with determining average shapes of the pulses we were not concerned with overfitting each pulse functional data objects are then created and can be used to compute mean and standard deviation curves a full detailed description of the fda methods used for this analysis including the equations used to develop functional objects is included in appendix 1 4 results 4 1 discharge pulses between temperate and tropical using pulse metrics fig 4 plots each of the nine covariates of hydrograph characteristics extracted from the yearly pulse data as boxplots demonstrating some of the differences between the aef and lef tables a2 1 and a2 2 in appendix 2 include the extracted hydrograph metrics for each basin for each water year and over the period of record used respectively lef tends to have higher magnitude of pulses as a percent above historical mean and more discharge pulses whereas aef has greater average duration of pulses and greater variability in pulse duration fig 4 the lef streams average approximately 7 times as many discharge pulses each year as the aef streams but discharge pulses at aef have an average event duration about sixteen times as long as those at lef the boxplots also indicate that lef has higher variability in discharge magnitude and potentially higher skew compared to aef fig 4 in logistic regression only four of the nine covariates were needed to achieve perfect distinction between aef and lef number of pulses n standard deviation of magnitude as a percent above historical mean sd qmax average duration d and standard deviation of the duration sd d this means it is possible to determine whether a river is located in aef or lef using just number of pulses variation in the normalized magnitude duration and the variation in duration specifically in our study the aef streams have fewer pulses less variability in the normalized magnitude longer average duration and greater variability in duration than lef streams fig 4 table 3 shows the resulting lda coefficients for each covariate larger values for covariates with positive coefficients increase the likelihood that the river will be lef and conversely larger values for covariates with negative coefficients increase the likelihood that a river will be categorized as aef this relationship for individual covariates is true only when all other covariates are held constant the resulting lda scores for our analysis were between 6 and 10 with non overlapping density curves for aef and lef stations fig 5 a clear divide between the two regions is located at around 0 the height of the density plot indicates how likely a station is to have a combination of hydrograph characteristics produce a particular score lef stations are centered near 2 5 and aef stations near 2 5 lef rivers show much more variability in scores with longer tails in the distribution than the aef rivers this greater variability implies that lef rivers may be more variable in the combination of pulse hydrograph characteristics than aef rivers 4 2 variations in discharge pulses with increasing drainage area between regions in order to determine the associations between drainage area and the pulse metrics we completed multiple linear regression as described in the methods section the estimated models for the multiple regression analyses are included in table 4 along with the coefficients slope terms describing the relationship between the metric and drainage area for each region when analyzing the coefficients for each region individually positive significant coefficients indicate that as the drainage area increases the pulse metric increases i e the coefficient is significantly different than zero negative significant coefficients indicate that as drainage area increases the pulse metric decreases significant interaction term coefficients indicate whether there is a different relationship between the metric and drainage area when compared between regions because of the form of the model the exact p value for lef coefficients cannot be computed but the significance of the relationship between the metric and drainage area for lef can be inferred when looking at the relationship between aef metrics and drainage area and the interaction term significance for example for the number of pulses metric there is no significant relationship between number of pulses and drainage area for aef but there is a significant interaction term indicating that the lef coefficient for the relationship between number of pulses and drainage area is a significant relationship the significant relationships between drainage area and the pulse metrics correspond to the models with number of pulses magnitude as a percent above the historical mean standard deviation of magnitude as a percent above the historical mean and average pulse kurtosis table 4 therefore the association between drainage area and these four pulse characteristics is different for each region for aef there is no relationship between number of pulses and drainage area but for lef there is a slight decrease in number of pulses with increasing drainage area fig 6 a when considering magnitude as a percent above the historical mean there is a slight decrease in magnitude with increasing drainage area in aef and an increase in magnitude with increasing drainage area in lef fig 6b the positive coefficient for the normalized magnitude for lef indicates a stronger increase in normalized magnitude with increasing drainage area compared to the small decrease in normalized magnitude in the aef thus the normalized pulse magnitude metric indicates a slight dampening of the peak pulse discharge relative to the average value in the aef but an increase in lef fig 6b the standard deviation of normalized pulse magnitude increases slightly in lef with increasing drainage area with no significant relationship in aef fig 6c indicating that as drainage area increases the variation in pulse magnitude increases at lef finally the average kurtosis of the discharge pulses decreases slightly in lef with increasing drainage area with no significant relationship in aef fig 6d 4 3 differences in shape of discharge pulses between regions we used fda to further investigate the average pulse shapes for each region fig 7 shows the average curve and the standard deviation for each region using the discharge pulses scaled to the same duration of 40 h clear differences in the mean curves indicate that lef pulses peak at a much higher magnitude in addition the lef pulses have a steeper receding limb of the pulses while the receding limb of the aef pulses is more gradual the higher standard deviation of the lef pulses indicate that there is greater variability in pulses in the lef compared to aef the greatest variability in the pulses occur at the peak for both aef and lef 5 discussion 5 1 hydrologic variations between regions and with increasing drainage area our results support the expectations that discharge pulses are more frequent more events per year of shorter duration and of higher magnitudes relative to the historical mean in lef compared to aef fig 4 these patterns are predictable from what is known of regional hydrographs flow in the tropical streams generally pulse more frequently for shorter periods of time and at higher magnitudes than flow in the temperate streams reflecting greater frequency of rainstorms greater amounts of average annual precipitation and more efficient transmission of water from hillslopes to streams brown et al 1983 post and jones 2001 schellekens et al 2004 the lda analyses indicate that some metrics of discharge pulses can provide a complete distinction between aef and lef number of pulses standard deviation of magnitude as a percent above historical mean average duration and standard deviation of the duration fig 5 lef pulses also have greater variability in magnitude relative to the historical mean and higher skew of discharge pulses plotting lda scores is a useful tool to examine variability between basins and could be used as a more standard tool in hydrology to discriminate between basins potential applications of lda analysis could include using it to identify outlier basins that have different hydrologic responses than nearby basins help construct design pulses from reservoir releases to more closely match the characteristics of undammed basins nearby compare different land management scenarios or to compare discharge pulse characteristics pre and post disturbances e g fire our expectation that pulses in lef will have a steeper falling limb relative to aef is supported by the mean curves of discharge pulses from fda analyses fig 7 normalizing the pulses to 40 h allows us to compare other aspects of the pulse such as shape without being overwhelmed by the already clear difference in duration high infiltration rates in the aef relative to precipitation rates jones 2000 likely promotes a slower decline of discharge on the falling limb of the discharge pulse in contrast there is substantial macropore and overland flow in the lef schellekens et al 2004 which is common in the humid tropics chappell 2010 and may contribute to the relatively steep receding limb in pulses due to preferential transport in hillslopes variations in normalized magnitude with increasing drainage area also aligned with our expectations we found a slight decrease in normalized magnitude in the aef but an increase in normalized magnitude in the lef table 4 and fig 6b which may be due to the rapid transfer of precipitation to streams in the lef caused by overland and macropore flow while the aef has higher infiltration rates relative to precipitation harr 1977 jones 2000 schellekens et al 2004 thus pulse attenuation with increasing drainage area is greater in the aef compared to the lef the number of pulses increases with increasing drainage area at lef and does not change significantly with increasing drainage area in the aef the increase in the number of pulses with increasing drainage area could be a result of the larger drainage area sites receiving multiple pulses from incoming tributaries in a precipitation regime that experiences frequent short duration precipitation compared to aef scatena 1995 aef precipitation events many times result from broad low pressure systems that move inland from the pacific ocean post and jones 2001 potentially resulting in a spatially extensive pulse throughout the aef in addition there are a much larger number of pulses in lef compared to aef overall fig 4 and the high infiltration rates at aef may dampen and reduce the number of pulses within streams from storm events the standard deviation of the normalized magnitude also demonstrates a significant relationship with increasing drainage area increasing slightly at lef but lacking a significant relationship in the aef similar to the number of pulses the standard deviation of normalized magnitude in the lef could increase with increasing drainage area due to short duration rainstorms occurring in different portions of the headwater basins resulting in more variable pulse magnitudes at larger drainage areas finally average kurtosis slightly decreases in lef with increasing drainage area but has no significant relationship with drainage area in the aef although somewhat difficult to interpret kurtosis indicates how heavy tailed a pulse is and a slight decrease in kurtosis with drainage area indicates thinner tails for the pulse as drainage area increases there is no thickening of the pulse tails with increasing drainage area due to attenuation at lef but the pulses become more peaked with thinner tails as drainage area increases this could potentially be a consequence of increasing pulse magnitude as drainage area increases however the coefficient for kurtosis is quite small table 4 and thus the effect of increasing drainage area on kurtosis is likely weak the lack of significant relationships between the additional 5 pulse metrics average and standard deviation of pulse duration and skew and standard deviation of kurtosis and drainage area may be due to the relatively small drainage areas across the entire study in particular we expected that the average duration of pulses would increase with increasing drainage area in the aef due to attenuation of low flow with increasing drainage area but no significant relationship exists table 4 headwater streams many times do not display expected downstream trends in channel morphology due to the influence of local knickpoints coarse sediment and debris inputs direct connections to hillslopes and limited floodplain development adams and spotila 2005 because the stations in both aef and lef occur over limited drainage areas the attenuation of pulse metrics through slowing of pulses and increasing duration likely does not occur 5 2 ecological implications of discharge pulses disturbances such as discharge pulses can physically move organisms along a stream both through downstream transport and through increased hydrologic connection between different habitats transient states of discharge and stream substrate are particularly important to the survival rates of stream organisms which must withstand the stresses imposed by conditions such as exceptionally high velocity and turbulence or rapid sedimentation on the streambed e g erman et al 1988 fausch and bramblett 1991 johnson et al 1998 swanson et al 1998 zimmermann et al 2014 discharge pulses also temporarily reduce physical storage associated with obstacles to flow and zones of flow separation and increase flow velocity thus increasing the rate of loss of organic materials in stream ecosystems minshall et al 1983 the differences in discharge pulse characteristics between the aef and lef along with differences in channel morphology likely influence stream ecosystems the high magnitude discharge pulses at lef produce large values of shear stress and transport capacity that in combination with rapid decay limit retention of wood and other coarse particulate organic matter entering the streams thus we expect that streams at lef have relatively short residence times for organic matter the lower magnitude longer duration flow pulses present at aef combined with the greater capacity for storage of organic matter indicate that streams at aef likely have longer turnover times and distances for organic matter than streams at lef and generally greater stream retention relative to the aef minimal instream wood is present in the lef pyron et al 1999 and retention of organic matter occurs mainly in the interstices between coarse sediment or along channel margins in zones of reduced flow velocity the exception to these relatively low wood inputs and limited retention occurs when large tropical storms and hurricanes create transient organic debris dams throughout the lef wohl et al 2019a measurements in quebrada bisley a headwater tributary of the rio mameyes however provide a cautionary note merriam et al 2002 found that only 37 of instream fine benthic organic matter was removed during a discharge pulse in which discharge increased more than twenty fold the frequency of such discharge pulses as seen by the high number of pulses at lef compared to aef however suggests that organic matter is removed fairly effectively during most years especially given the long travel distances noted by merriam et al 2002 for organic matter dislodged in quebrada bisley although the discharge pulses analyzed here are not explicitly linked to ecological traits and species response there is a need to move away from using only hydrologic metrics from daily discharge measurements towards a more complex understanding of hydrologic dynamics and associated effects arthington et al 2018 using discharge measurements at high temporal resolution particularly in headwater streams along with functional data to assess the entire shape of a discharge pulse is an advancement towards measuring and assessing complex hydrologic processes and determining the potential impact on ecological processes in headwater stream 6 conclusion we find that discharge pulses taken from sub daily discharge measurements in headwater streams are distinctly different when comparing the aef and lef regions the differences in discharge pulses are likely the result of differences in precipitation regimes runoff processes and the relationship between precipitation rate and infiltration rates treating the discharge pulses as functional data and averaging across all pulses allows for comparison of rising and falling limbs of pulses as well as the variability in pulses between tropical and temperate sites the drainage area and discharge pulse relationship differed between study regions for some of the pulse characteristics shedding further light on runoff processes and attenuation in headwater streams across regions further work is needed across diverse temperate and tropical headwater streams to determine whether the differences between aef and lef apply elsewhere characterizing regional differences in discharge pulses provides a useful starting point for understanding how physical differences in stream ecosystems can influence organic matter retention and ecosystem processes our results indicate that sub daily high temporal resolution discharge data can provide important insights into the hydrological patterns of stream discharge in small headwater streams fully quantifying differences between regions is also important in the context of management regimes and climate change which may modify discharge pulses in the future declaration of competing interest the
