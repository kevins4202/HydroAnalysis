8560,the objective of this study was to characterise the primary forcing variables and system feedback responsible for daily waterflow dynamics within a large international river system canada and usa during 17 melt seasons from 2001 to 2018 an analysis based on extreme gradient boosting showed that daily waterflow in four subcatchments of the upper saint john river sjr wolastoq basin during the 17 melt seasons was to a large measure controlled by the area s seasonal warming associated with the springtime increase in regional incident global radiation and northeasterly advection of sensible and latent heat from southerly locations historically seasonal surges in air temperature and cumulative snow degree days were shown to contribute to roughly 60 of the control on subcatchment discharge by influencing the production and timing of snowmelt peak accumulation of snow on the ground provided the second most important control of discharge accounting for about 15 6 of the overall control at a daily timescale cumulative short and long term forest cover losses in the four subcatchments provided some control but at varying levels i e 4 8 14 2 dependent on the extent of total forest cover loss and other subcatchment traits convergent cross mapping confirmed the unidirectional causal relationship between annual forest cover loss and daily discharge rates at the outlet of three of the four subcatchments the strength of the annual forest cover removal to daily discharge signal within the four subcatchments varied with the subcatchment with the least annual forest cover loss 1 over the 17 years predictably displaying the weakest signal p 0 282 forest cover removal was shown to increase springtime discharge for all subcatchments albeit at different rates this work provides a more comprehensive mechanistic interpretation of daily snowmelt control of stream river flow dynamics in northeastern north america keywords abiotic and biotic controls causal inference landcover loss machine learning snowmelt dominated dynamics structural equation modelling 1 introduction trend analysis of historical timeseries of waterflow dynamics has revealed a detectible increase in flood occurrence and intensity in eastern canada e g zadeh et al 2020 during the past eight decades 1931 2010 as snow dominated catchments transition to rain dominated systems with continued atmospheric warming buttle et al 2016 burn and whitfield 2016 burn and whitfield 2017 many more of these large devastating spring floods are expected to occur in the region over the immediate to near term with future climate warming e g el jabi et al 2016 bonsal et al 2019 one significant insight of recent assessments of flooding in the region is that we may be entering an era where historical analogs and associated assumptions of stationarity will be of little value for municipal and infrastructure planning in the future as such it is likely that we will become more reliant on simulated futures as a foundation for future planning and decision making to get there however a first step is to identify the forcing variables and system feedbacks responsible for contemporary daily waterflow dynamics in medium to high ordered streams and rivers of eastern canada in establishing a frame of reference a coherent progression in the development of regional capacity in flood risk forecasting and year round simulation of waterflow dynamics over the immediate to near term would involve the examination of flooding vulnerabilities and exposures along the international tri jurisdictional saint john river sjr wolastoq system in northeastern north america such a study would help fill basic knowledge gaps regarding the key biophysical drivers of springtime flooding in a large river basin in eastern canada at a daily timescale commercial and non commercial harvesting of forests throughout the sjr basin is widespread and its quantification particularly in the upper basin where topography is most varied is important in characterising localised present and future trends regarding i daily weather patterns via surface albedo effects and energy exchange patterns ii accumulation and distribution of snow iii snowmelt processes and iv subsequent springtime catchment responses paired catchment experiments in small catchments characteristically smaller than 100 km2 giles hansen et al 2019 goeking and tarboton 2020 have generally produced contradictory results as to the degree forest cover removal controls post disturbance stream and river flow characteristics e g brooks et al 2013 schelker et al 2013 mcdonnell et al 2018 goeking and tarboton 2020 some studies have shown that forest cover losses due to large scale forest modifications by insects and pathogens bladon et al 2019 clearcutting and land conversion can cause seasonal streamflow to increase because of post disturbance reductions in interception and evaporative losses while others have shown it to decrease due to increases in evaporative losses from the residual understorey or remain mostly unaffected zhang et al 2017 mcdonnell et al 2018 goeking and tarboton 2020 processes influencing the role of forest cover losses on waterflow responses in small to large catchments are complex and subsequently not entirely understood mcdonnell et al 2018 post disturbance changes in stream discharge in a small experimental subcatchment affiliated with the nashwaak experimental watershed project newp in central new brunswick nb canada dickison et al 1981 jewett et al 1995 was shown to become negligibly small after about 10 12 years after a one time tree felling experiment in the subcatchment jewett et al 1995 other studies have shown even longer post disturbance recovery times to baseline conditions e g 15 years to several decades in a douglas fir forest in the pacific northwest usa perry and jones 2017 and 20 30 years in an oak hickory yellow poplar and red maple dominated catchment in north carolina usa returning to pre harvest levels at a pace commensurate with forest re growth patterns webster et al 1992 large discrepancies in recovery times can be expected given the vast differences in pre harvest forest composition i e deciduous vs coniferous cover and structure soil conditions catchment physiography climate and other important mitigating factors at each study site goeking and tarboton 2020 recent scientific articles relating to the study of flooding along the sjr system gleaned from a bibliometric search yousfi et al 2019 maclellan et al 2019 were mostly statistical in nature i e regression studies e g el jabi and caissie 2019 or based on black box approaches such as artificial neural networks a great number of these studies addressed the dynamic attributions of high waterflow events such as return periods peak non stationarity flooding frequencies and other descriptive qualities many of these studies however did not explicitly address drivers of waterflow dynamics attributed to landcover and landcover changes in the upper sjr basin the few scientific articles that addressed the impact of forest cover loss on streamflow behaviour in nb largely reported on findings drawn from studies based on experimental catchments smaller than 60 km2 e g 3 7 km2 for the newp dickison et al 1981 jewett et al 1995 and 52 km2 for the catamaran brook research project in east central nb caissie et al 2002 generalising results from the treatment of small catchments to larger catchments is often challenging due to the presence of variable flow pathways complex interactions among controlling variables non uniform weather conditions and scaling problems caissie et al 2002 lisi et al 2015 mcdonnell et al 2018 the objective of this study was to define the primary forcing variables and system feedbacks responsible for spring inundations across a significant part of the upper sjr basin over a 17 year period 2001 2018 the study uses i structural equation modelling ii machine learning and iii convergent cross mapping in inferring causality among system variables this initial effort was to provide an evidence based explanation of linear and nonlinear trends in daily snowmelt and waterflow dynamics in the upper sjr knowledge acquired from this initial effort will help generalise our understanding of the eco hydrometeorological processes and trends relevant to the production of high waterflow events in the upper sjr with a full expectation that this will lead to refinement of existing eco hydrometeorological models that can help support flood risk management interests in northeastern north america particularly as the area continues to transition to a warmer and wetter climate bourque et al 2020 2 methods and material 2 1 study area the upper saint john river sjr wolastoq basin upstream from the capital city of fredericton 45 9636 n 66 6431 w nb covers a large land area of approximately 41 179 km2 and spans the jurisdictions of nb quebec qc and maine me usa fig 1 the upper sjr basin falls within the atlantic maritime ecozone of canada and the new england acadian forests zone of usa the study area is characterised by a fragmented landscape with elevations ranging from 0 to 856 m above mean sea level amsl fig 1 the basin s climate is generally characterised as continental there are however some maritime influences during the year due to the region s proximity to the bay of fundy and north atlantic ocean to its south orographic lifting of advected air is a familiar meteorological occurrence in the high elevation parts of the basin on average winters are frigid snowy and cloudy over the span of a year the near surface air temperature ranges between 18 5 and 24 7 c with an annual mean air temperature of 3 6 c based on 1981 2010 climate data from environment and climate change canada environment and climate change canada 2021 historically air temperature seldom drops below 29 or exceeds 29 c total annual precipitation is on average 1 011 mm of which about 26 falls as snow eccc 2021 2 2 landcover landcover in the upper sjr basin varies from forests particularly in the headwaters of the river system to agricultural fields to residential and other non vegetated impervious surfaces adjacent to the middle branch of the upper sjr fig 2 temporal courses of forest cover loss within four large subcatchments of the upper sjr basin i e subcatchments 01ad004 01af002 01ag003 and 01ah002 fig 1 are based on satellite derived annual estimates of forest cover loss of subcatchment area acquired from the global forest watch programme fig 3 global forest watch 2021 linke et al 2017 analysis of an earlier version of the global forest watch dataset has established the data s feasibility in reproducing historical harvesting trends in transitional mix forests of nb achieving user and producer s accuracies based on area of 81 and 82 respectively linke et al 2017 boxplots per subcatchment in fig 3 give the within subcatchment variation in annual forest cover loss of the four subcatchments subcatchment 01ag003 had the least forest cover removed during the 2001 2018 study period i e 0 05 per year whereas subcatchment 01ah002 had the most at slightly 0 8 2 5 per year fig 3 owing to the legacy carry over effects of past forest cover removal on stream river discharge rates over spans of years we treat recurring bouts of annual forest cover removal over the 17 year period as cumulative functions of past landcover changes fig 3 including quasi permanent forest cover losses stemming from land conversion fig 2 2 3 flow regime the upper sjr is dammed at several places e g at edmundston tobique narrows grand falls beechwood and mactaquac affecting the normal flow regime of the river kidd et al 2011 the dams along the river however have limited capacity to retain floodwater from running downstream as their upstream reservoirs are simply too small to handle the enormous volumes of water that usually flows with the spring flooding of the upper sjr the occasional ice jams on the sjr may lead to localised flooding e g beltaos and burrell 2015 altogether the impact of these ice jams which occur at random rokaya et al 2018 can introduce a level of unexplained variation in springtime waterflow conditions along the upper sjr in our analysis we treat the presence of ice jams and their impending impact on the river as a source of error 2 4 subcatchments and associated eco hydrometeorological data the analysis relied heavily on hydrometeorological data acquired from the daymet v 4 0 database thornton et al 1997 thornton and running 1999 thornton et al 2020a thornton et al 2020b point extractions of cross validated daily minimum and maximum air temperature tmin and tmax respectively and precipitation and subsequent ancillary daily data of incident solar radiation ambient water vapour pressure and snowpack water equivalent were collected at 200 or 300 virtual weather stations the latter number for the largest subcatchment randomly placed throughout the subcatchments e g fig 1 and a single virtual weather station strategically placed in the headwaters of each subcatchment for a full accounting of downstream waterflow dynamics these data were either used directly as acquired e g air temperature precipitation ambient water vapour or were subsequently used to derive new variables such as peak on the ground snow accumulation snow degree days start of the melt season and other pertinent variables figs 4 and a 1 based on daymet v 3 0 data from tile 12 297 approximate location of the upper srj basin regionalised mean absolute error and prediction bias of daily tmin tmax and precipitation for the 1980 2019 period corresponded to 1 6 c with a prediction bias of 0 0623 c 1 3 0 079 c and 2 05 0 185 mm day 1 respectively a recent uncertainty analysis of the newest daymet data i e v 4 0 showed continued improvement from earlier generation data thornton et al 2020b despite minor differences between daymet v 2 0 and other gridded climate products derived from many of the same weather station data hydrological modelling based on the different datasets following model calibration did not produce vastly different statistical results during model testing essou et al 2016 cumulative snow degree days as proxies of meltwater production were calculated by adding daily mean air temperatures i e tmn 0 5 tmax tmin 0 c whenever snowpack water equivalents were 0 0 kg m 2 total precipitation was partitioned into snow and rain volumes mm day 1 according to the temperature index method in bourque and matin 2012 but implemented at a daily timescale daily wind speeds m s 1 in the headwaters of each subcatchment were calculated based on a simple temporal averaging of hourly wind speeds recorded at the caribou me usa weather station in the upper sjr basin i e 46 87 n and 68 01 w daily waterflow dynamics at the outlet of each subcatchment apart from outlet 01ad004 were recorded directly as discharge rates i e in m3 s 1 for conformity all stage measurements m at the outlet of subcatchment 01ad004 were converted to discharge rates based on a rating curve determined by fitting a 2nd order polynomial regression to limited simultaneous measurements of discharge rates and stage height obtained further downstream i e discharge rate 73 39 stage2 15 878 stage 65 318 yielding an r2 0 96 2 5 data analysis ordinary statistical analyses are based on pre established models assumptions that data occur without error and are generally not adjustable however structural equation modelling sem cangur and ercan 2015 epskamp 2015 fan et al 2016 shi et al 2021 necessitates specification of a model based on a posteriori knowledge and openly stipulates measurement error structural equation modelling is an extension of multivariate regression that can be used to examine structural relations in multivariate data covariance is used to determine the strength of association between paired combinations of predictor variables to help provide insight concerning the controls of waterflow dynamics in the upper sjr when used sem offers a system of linear equations for latent unobserved and manifest observed variables crucial to explaining the hydro climatic system of study this information can be used to develop a path diagram epskamp 2015 e g fig 5 that emphasises the non trivial associations among the different system variables the sem method merges factor analysis with multiple linear regression and provides estimates of associated empirical dependencies in a single evaluation the method helps to explain linear correlation among variables and indicate the strength of anticipated causal interaction structural equation models require scrutiny to determine their global fit to observational data a common measurement of the goodness of fit of sem to observational data is the χ2 distribution barrett 2007 cangur and ercan 2015 the χ2 test is a model level statistical measure indicating whether the residuals i e modelled minus sample covariances are ostensibly equal to zero specifying the null hypothesis i e ho if the goodness of fit statistic i e χ2 is less than the expected critical p value of 0 05 then the null hypothesis of model covariances equal to sample covariances a case of no difference cannot be excluded as a viable explanation of the system s covariance matrix barrett 2007 here we use sem to test our prior understanding of waterflow dynamics in the upper sjr structural equation modelling facilitates our understanding by either confirming or invalidating our hypotheses about system mechanisms and processes in the path diagram latent variable i air symbolising the airmass exchange and inherent hydrometeorological properties in the upper sjr basin that forces day to day regional weather regarding near surface air temperature and cumulative snow degree days rainfall and ambient water vapour content ii mlw production of meltwater as a function of variations in atmospheric and on the ground conditions e g air temperature cumulative snow degree days and available snow water equivalent and iii ovl the contribution of meltwater to lagged overland flow possibly incorporating return flow that eventually reaches the subcatchment outlet in addition to sem we also use extreme gradient boosting xgb chen and guestrin 2016 ni et al 2020 a machine learning procedure akin to random forests esfandiari et al 2020 to uncover the importance of the various eco hydrometeorological variables in governing daily waterflow dynamics at individual outlets i e hydrometric station figs 1 and 2 extreme gradient boosting is the most skilled machine learning method for analysing complex nonlinear datasets the method can scale billions of samples using fewer computational resources than most other machine learning methods chen and guestrin 2016 eco hydrometeorological variables in the headwaters of each subcatchment i e suite of daymet variables average wind speed and forest cover loss were selected for xgb model development based on the variables known contribution to the control of snowmelt production processes and downstream waterflow dynamics at individual subcatchment scales an analysis of feature importance among the environmental variables via the xgb calculated gain helped identify the main drivers of springtime waterflow dynamics in each subcatchment the same modelling procedure was later used to create a multi catchment model to assess the consequence of repeated forest cover removal on outlet discharge rates an assessment of feature importance for each subcatchment and development of the multi catchment model was accomplished by i training five xgb based models on 70 of subcatchment sourced data for assessing feature importance and combined data from all four subcatchments for multi catchment model development and ii validating each model against the remaining 30 of their respective datasets correlative studies such as those provided with sem are unsuitable for assessing cause and effect relationships in dynamic nonlinear systems chang et al 2017 contemporary advances in the analysis of dynamic systems have led to the deployment of new statistical techniques in detecting causality in timeseries data sugihara et al 2012 one such technique convergent cross mapping ccm is a non parametric statistical approach that helps to isolate cause and effect interactions between system variables in contrast to linear tests based on cross correlation and sem ccm provides an improved level of explanation sugihara et al 2012 chang et al 2017 including detection of casual linkages direction of causation and feedback between variables two timeseries variables are causally linked if both originate from the same dynamic system convergent cross mapping checks for causality by measuring the extent historical records in one timeseries can reliably detect the conditions in another timeseries originating from the same system the ccm method can provide reliable accounts of causality even when confronted with confoundedness sugihara et al 2012 convergence in the predictive skill curve is an important characteristic of ccm that distinguishes causation from standard linear correlation clark et al 2015 2 6 analytical tools structural equation modelling sem xgb and ccm were based on open source r scripts called by the r programme v 4 0 5 r core team 2021 these scripts included i lavaan v 0 6 9 for sem rosseel 2012 epskamp 2015 ii xgbtree option in the caret package v 6 0 88 for xgb kuhn 2008 chen and guestrin 2016 and iii multispatialccm v 1 0 sugihara et al 2012 clark et al 2015 chang et al 2017 and pdc v 1 0 3 brandmaier 2015 for ccm 1 the lavaan script was configured to use maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors and a test statistic equivalent to the yuan bentler statistic rosseel 2012 given the non normality of the input data non normality of the data was confirmed with a series of shapiro wilk tests system optimisation was achieved by fitting the system of equations to the data with the nlminb optimiser 2 the extreme gradient boosting script i e xgboost belongs to a line of boosting procedures that upgrades weak learners into strong learners a weak learner is a tree that performs a little better than pure random guessing boosting is a sequential process such that decision trees are grown serially using information from previously grown trees during learner improvement 3 convergent cross mapping determines the direction and strength of causality among paired variables complementing the linear dependencies established with sem r script pdc via subroutine

stands for the i th daily discharge rate over the 17 year period and ξ j the area of the j th subcatchment giving units of m3 s 1 km 2 table 1 provides the statistics of pairwise comparisons between the subcatchment wide evaluations of environmental data averaged for the 200 or 300 virtual weather stations figs 4 and a 1 many pairwise comparisons are not statistically significant at a critical p value of 0 05 subcatchment 01ad004 identified in figs 1 and 2 has the lowest mean daily discharge rate per unit area of 0 026 m3 s 1 km 2 in contrast to 0 036 0 042 m3 s 1 km 2 for the other subcatchments fig 4d 3 1 variable dependency fig 5 illustrates the path diagram of a conceptualisation of internal system organisation tested against the eco hydrometeorological data from the headwaters of the four subcatchments and associated outlets the linear network offers a fairly robust explanation of daily waterflow dynamics in the upper sjr basin after cangur and ercan 2015 in view of the strong test statistics produced fan et al 2016 shi et al 2021 namely i the model level goodness of fit statistic χ2 7 601 bootstrapped derived mean χ2 4 256 with n 6 000 bootstrapped iterations

negative path coefficients with standardised coefficients ranging from 1 746 in red representing a direct negative relationship between two variables to 1 418 in blue a direct positive relationship fig 5 and table a 1 correlations between two of the latent variables in the model i e airmass exchange and overland flow air and ovl in fig 5 and water vapor pressure i e vp in the regression equation for mlw are not statistically significant at a critical p value of 0 05 table a 1 note that the path diagram in fig 5 does not consider the effects of quasi permanent and repeated annual forest cover losses as well as locally available incident solar radiation and daily wind speed at coarse spatial resolutions in its explanation of outlet daily discharge rates incorporating these variables in modifications of the path diagram caused the sem procedure to perform poorly statistically when compared to the explanation offered in fig 5 3 2 feature importance per subcatchment feature importance

solar radiation sol v average wind speed ws vi ambient water vapour content vp and vii total daily rainfall pre predictors in the calculation of water discharge rate response variable at the outlet of each subcatchment across the four subcatchments the individual impact of the various predictors on the calculation of water discharge rates were largely the same with minor differences appearing in variables sdd and cumloss fig 6 cumulative day to day variations in ambient air temperature 0 c during the snowmelt season via sdd contributed the most to the production of snowmelt and downstream changes in water discharge for all subcatchments considered accounting for about 60 of the total control fig 6 peak snowpack water equivalent swe fig 4a and 6 was the second most important weather related variable in the prediction of water discharge rates 15 6 average contribution fig 6 for each subcatchment daily total rainfall pre was seen to be the least important with 1 6 of the control in affecting waterflow characteristics in the four subcatchments during the 17 years a close inspection of timeseries data for subcatchment 01ad004 however revealed that intermittent heavy rainfall during or soon after the spring snowmelt period had led to significant seasonal flooding of the upper sjr for example the combined contributions of daily snowmelt and rainfall 37 mm over a single day in subcatchment 01ad004 during the end of the 2008 snowmelt season contributed to the delayed cresting and extended duration of flooding of the upper sjr that year 3 3 causal inference appearing in table 2 are the results of ccm with timeseries pairs relating seven of the abiotic variables a to the daily variation in waterflow dynamics b at the outlet of subcatchment 01ad004 for 17 snowmelt seasons the pairwise comparisons point to differences as to the extent inter variable coupling occurs between paired variables i e a and b table 2 convergent cross mapping revealed that locally available incident solar radiation sol average wind speed ws and total rainfall at coarse spatial resolutions pre were not causally linked to daily discharge rates at the outlet of subcatchment 01ad004 case i table 2 this was consistent with the sem results where both sol and ws went unused in explaining waterflow characteristics at the subcatchment outlets fig 5 omission of these variables in the sem based explanation of discharge was consistent with their low feature importance identified with xgb fig 6 with sol being assigned a slightly greater mean importance than the two other variables combined i e 4 3 0 44 standard deviation vs 2 0 0 37 and 1 6 0 54 for ws and pre respectively although total rainfall pre appears in the sem path diagram fig 5 i e in the regression equations for latent variables air and ovl all related associations returned low standardised path coefficients namely 0 177 and 0 299 for the direct negative effect on air and indirect positive effect affiliated with its reciprocal interaction with air and 0 095 for a direct positive effect on ovl the former relationships between pre and air went unobserved by ccm as these relationships were not directly connected to the melting process confronted with ccm the latter relationship i e between pre and ovl was associated with the probable mixture of rain with meltwater in forming overland flow during the melt season the contribution of rainwater during the snowmelt period was generally very low across all snowmelt seasons as inferred by the variable s low standardised path coefficient

sdd and swe were both bidirectionally affected by the generation of meltwater and subsequent changes in waterflow characteristics at the outlet of the subcatchment fig 7b case iii table 2 as inferred previously by sem shaded components in fig 5 outlet discharge forcing via snowmelt generation on sdd i e b a provided by far a stronger signal with ρb a 0 737 table 2 and fig 7b with ln 460 record

revealed convergence in the predictive skill curve for a b but not b a which is suggestive of unidirectional causality i e a forcing b being the only viable interaction a case ii relationship with

statistically significant increasing trends p 0 05 for three of the four subcatchments i e 01ad004 01af002 and 01ah002 table 4 with the greatest melt period increase of 0 150 m3 s 1 day 1 having occurred in subcatchment 01af002 the largest of the four subcatchments fig 1 seasonal projections of outlet discharge rates as a function of forest cover removal in fig 8 were based on an implementation of a multi catchment model unlike the earlier xgb models developed in the assessment of feature importance for individual subcatchments i e fig 6 the multi catchment model adopted the contributing area of individual subcatchments as an essential differentiator of discharge volume for the four subcatchments the multi catchment model was suitably skilled at replicating individual subcatchment responses during testing yielding an r2 of 0 93 and a systematic bias from the 1 1 correspondence line of 0 19 with the y intercept forced to zero cumulative discharge rates for subcatchment 01ad004 without and with actual forest cover removal deviated the most accounting for a 31 8 increase between forest cover removal schemes by the end of the 17 years figs 3 8 and table 4 all 17 year cumulative discharge rates for the other subcatchments at their respective outlets equally underwent increases but at significantly reduced levels i e 12 7 11 4 12 9 respectively depending on pre and post 2001 total forest cover loss fig 3 its subcatchment specific feature importance value fig 6 and table 4 and subcatchment area figs 1 and 2 the feature importance of forest cover

the two forest disturbance regimes daily discharge rate differences per snowmelt season for the four subcatchments i e actual rate with disturbance minus simulated rate with no disturbance increased over the 17 years fig 8 all producing statistically significant results table 4 fig 9 gives the historical 41 year median trend fig 9a and significance level fig 9b in peak swe 1980 2020 throughout the upper sjr basin over this 41 year period peak swe increased on the western side of the basin whereas it decreased on the opposite side 4 discussion 4 1 variable dependency elements of the analysis suggest that meltwater generation and springtime discharge rates across the four subcatchments were for the most part controlled by the area s seasonal warming associated with the springtime increase in regional incident global radiation and northeasterly advection of sensible and latent heat from southerly locations welty and zeng 2021 and subsequent turbulent transfer of the heat from the air to the snowpack prowse and owens 1982 moore and owens 1984 neale and fitzharris 1997 wei et al 2001 and tjernström et al 2015 in the dissipation of arctic sea ice this characterisation is strongly supported by the feature importance of cumulative snow degree days sdd in the prediction of meltwater production via the indirect positive relationship between mlw and sdd in fig 5 and table a 1 and stream river flow dynamics in the region fig 6 in addition to sdd s strong association with the latent unobserved variable air with a standardised path coefficient of 1 245 fig 5 and table a 1 when warm humid air travels over snow sensible heat via sdd or dt and ambient water vapour vp transported with the air are transferred to the snow surface causing the near surface air temperature and water vapour content of the air to decrease locally wexler et al 1954 treidl 1970 atmospheric cooling that results with the phase change of frozen water snow and ice to liquid water and the requirement of energy for this process to take place is explained in sem as an amalgamation of several internal system associations namely i direct positive effects on dt by both latent variables air and mlw ii a direct negative effect on air by dt iii a direct positive effect on air by sdd with sdd representing the seasonal accumulation of dt and an indirect positive association with mlw iv a direct negative effect on swe by sdd and v a direct negative effect on mlw by swe fig 5 on the ground swe is shown to be related to mlw in a negative fashion i e the higher on the ground swe is the lower we can expect mlw to be and vice versa the rate of meltwater production via mlw is greatest when sdd and dt are greatest both yielding positive relationships rainfall patterns associated with advected air via variable pre can undergo local to regional modifications as the airmass encounters orographic lifting and subsidence in irregular terrain as well as other complex precipitation forming processes mott et al 2014 these modifications on liquid water content of the air are displayed in fig 5 as a causal loop consisting of an indirect positive relationship dashed blue line between air and pre and a reciprocal direct negative relationship red solid line going in the opposite direction between the two variables the red line going in the opposite direction can be viewed as the airmass gradually loses its liquid water content through precipitation fall the air stabilising effects associated with melting snow or ice tjernström et al 2015 is generally maintained under low vertical wind shear treidl 1970 introduction of strong wind shear prevents development of a stable atmospheric boundary layer i e an inversion which can extend upward to 100 m or more from the snow surface takeuchi et al 2002 giving opportunity for continued turbulent heat transfer to the snow cover and snow cover ablation treidl 1970 normally the more snow ice available for melting both in terms of its depth and coverage takeuchi et al 2002 the more the atmospheric boundary layer can cool and become stable in conditions of weak vertical wind shear bidirectional causal relationships feedback loops identified with ccm for i sdd fig 7b and table 2 and ii swe a paired individually with discharge rate via the variable s association with snowmelt generation b table 2 were particularly interesting given our prior understanding of their mutual coupling in sem shaded circle and rectangles in fig 5 treidl 1970 and others the coupled interaction among the three variables depicts a negative feedback loop i e as springtime sdd increases with the seasonal advection of warm humid air swe decreases locally increasing discharge flow by way of mlw and then ovl causing the air next to the snowpack to momentarily cool due to the requirement of energy to melt snow and subsequently cause sdd and hence dt and reductions in swe to decrease in fig 5 a statistically significant negative association solid red line fig 5 exists between mlw and ovl suggesting a delayed transmission of meltwater from the mlw latent variable to overland flow ovl given the complexity of overland flow of meltwater via different pathways to the outlets the relationship between ovl and wfl waterflow discharge at the outlet is depicted as an indirect positive relationship between the two variables the direct negative association between vp a and mlw b is not statistically significant p 0 215 when considered from a sem perspective see fig 5 and table a 1 convergent cross mapping however suggests that this relationship is in fact a viable and statistically significant result with its unidirectional interaction namely vp forcing discharge via the production of meltwater with predictive skill curve convergence ρ 0 397 and a p value 0 002 table 2 the cooling process by turbulent transfer of sensible heat is often coupled with a supplementary snowmelt process resulting from the release of latent heat with the condensation of ambient water vapour figs 5 and 6 wei et al 2001 tjernström et al 2015 harpold and brooks 2018 in the region vp s role in melting snow is modest compared to the role of advected sensible heat with an overall contribution of about 8 to sdd s 60 over the 17 years fig 6 one way interactions between vp and swe and vp and wfl identified with ccm suggests that local and regional sublimation of on the ground snow and the direct evaporation of previously melted snow via mlw in fig 5 plays a minor role in the re introduction of water vapour to the air during the spring melt period i e b forcing a is not supported with ccm p 0 05 if the local to regional scale effects of sublimation and evaporation were to be substantial for the current conditions in the upper sjr basin we would expect two way interactions between the paired variables instead of the one way interactions recognised here i e a b the diminished role of sublimation in our study is analogous to that observed by cline 1997 for a continental midlatitude alpine site in colorado usa locally available global incident solar radiation sol in open areas or above forests compared to the effect of sdd and the advection of warm humid air has a reduced role in melting snow in the area 4 3 control fig 6 the effects of locally available solar radiation become weak at large spatial scales as features like slope orientation become decoupled and discrepancies start to average out this scale dependency supports our use of the snow degree day approach e g rango and martinec 1995 clark et al 2009 bourque and matin 2012 in quantifying snowmelt for large catchments substantially bigger than the slope orientation scale comola et al 2015 repeated annual forest cover losses and quasi permanent openings in forests serve as proxies of available melt energy to large forest clearings in the order of several hundreds to thousands of hectares as the openings facilitate transfer of locally available solar energy above the forest cover to the on the ground snow cover and to a greater extent transfer of energy advected with the long range transport of warm humid air to the region from more southerly positions welty and zeng 2021 4 2 forest cover disturbance and its relationship to subcatchment meltwater discharge the strength of the annual forest removal to daily discharge signal within the four subcatchments varied with the subcatchment with the least annual forest cover loss i e subcatchment 01ag003 with 1 over the 17 years unsurprisingly exhibiting the weakest signal p 0 282 table 3 forest cover removal was revealed to increase springtime discharge rates for all subcatchments over the 17 years of repeated forest cover removal although at various volume changes and statistical significance fig 8 and table 4 several observational studies have revealed that snowmelt rates in forest openings can be as high as 70 more than in areas with forest cover varhola et al 2010 fig 7a and tables 2 and 3 consistently point to a one way interaction between cumulative annual forest cover loss with the quasi permanent land conversion component kept constant as expressed in fig 2 and outlet discharge rates i e a b with ccm the strength of the annual forest cover removal to discharge signal detected with ccm and xgb although not with sem because of the signal s strong nonlinear properties was largely dependent on the total forest cover removed over the 17 years naturally large repeated forest cover disturbances fig 3 fostered strong statistically significant signals p 0 05 table 3 in contrast weaker signals due to their high noise standard deviation to mean ratios i e coefficient of variation of 62 for subcatchment 01ag003 vs 30 for the others tended to produce statistically non significant results both in terms of ccm pairwise comparisons and minor increases in outlet discharge rates as displayed for subcatchment 01ag003 table 3 and 4 annual forest cover removal to discharge signals at the start of the 17 year period for subcatchments 01ad004 01af002 and 01ah002 were also too weak to generate any discernible differences between instantaneous and cumulative discharge rates for the two forest disturbance regimes fig 8 the effects of forest cover removal on stream river discharge rates in the four subcatchments were sensed about four to eight years after repeated annual forest cover removal fig 8 i e at the point cumulative discharge rates associated with and without forest cover removal started to show divergence after that initial four to eight year period signals for the subcatchments generally grew stronger leading to statistically significant results for subcatchments 01ad004 01af002 and 01ah002 whenever cumulative forest cover loss exceeded 3 5 not including the forest removed for land conversion of the total subcatchment area table 3 springtime high and low waterflow results for both forest removal systems were mostly synchronised with the main differences appearing in individual peak discharges fig 8 during the 2008 flood in subcatchment 01ad004 with a maximum stage of 8 6 m annual forest cover loss in preceding years most likely contributed to a flood stage at the subcatchment outlet of approximately 0 6 m higher than it would have been if the subcatchment had not been subject to repeated disturbance fig 8 the amount of snow on the ground that year was by far the greatest during the 17 year period with a maximum accumulation of 1 6 m in the headwaters of the subcatchment saint camille eccc weather station qc during the past 41 years i e 1980 2020 peak on the ground snow water equivalent in the headwaters of subcatchment 01ad004 and associated discharge rates had for the most part increased fig 9 and table 4 continued increases in both peak on the ground snow accumulation and annual forest cover removal may appear as increases in springtime flooding of the upper sjr in the immediate to near term much like the flooding events that followed in 2018 and 2019 esfandiari et al 2020 in contrast the increase in stream discharge rates at the outlet of subcatchment 01af002 table 4 if sustained for a longer period will be most likely mitigated by the statistically significant drop in peak snow accumulation on the eastern side of the basin potentially offsetting the increase on the opposite side fig 9 5 conclusions this study summaries the variables that contribute the most to altering springtime discharge rates at the outlets of four large subcatchments 2 230 21 900 km2 located in the upper sjr basin over a study period spanning 17 snowmelt seasons from 2001 to 2018 the objective of the study was to examine the causal relationships in eco hydrometeorological data acquired from three independent data sources i e daymet v 4 0 eccc and global forest watch programme the study identified cumulative snow degree days peak snow water equivalent and cumulative annual forest cover losses as three important variables in the prediction of outlet discharge rates during the melt seasons keeping the 17 snowmelt season input to the hydrometeorological variables in a multi catchment version of the xgb model unchanged while varying the forest disturbance input from 0 to 2 500 km2 over 17 years presented us an opportunity to estimate the overall control forest cover removal had on springtime discharge rates at the four subcatchment outlets taken as a whole repeated forest cover removal had a measurable impact on the hydrometric response of individual subcatchments by increasing outlet discharge rates relative to the level of forest cover disturbance over the 17 years and subcatchment specific feature importance value the subcatchment with the least forest cover removed during the 17 years produced small albeit not statistically significant increases in outlet discharge rates likewise trend analysis on modelled discharge rate differences resulting from model applications of two forest disturbance schemes i e without and with repeated annual forest cover losses indicated statistically significant increases for all subcatchments application of these methods to additional catchments in northeastern north america could help corroborate the trends uncovered for the four subcatchments of this study the methods collectively provide a very powerful analytical

8560,the objective of this study was to characterise the primary forcing variables and system feedback responsible for daily waterflow dynamics within a large international river system canada and usa during 17 melt seasons from 2001 to 2018 an analysis based on extreme gradient boosting showed that daily waterflow in four subcatchments of the upper saint john river sjr wolastoq basin during the 17 melt seasons was to a large measure controlled by the area s seasonal warming associated with the springtime increase in regional incident global radiation and northeasterly advection of sensible and latent heat from southerly locations historically seasonal surges in air temperature and cumulative snow degree days were shown to contribute to roughly 60 of the control on subcatchment discharge by influencing the production and timing of snowmelt peak accumulation of snow on the ground provided the second most important control of discharge accounting for about 15 6 of the overall control at a daily timescale cumulative short and long term forest cover losses in the four subcatchments provided some control but at varying levels i e 4 8 14 2 dependent on the extent of total forest cover loss and other subcatchment traits convergent cross mapping confirmed the unidirectional causal relationship between annual forest cover loss and daily discharge rates at the outlet of three of the four subcatchments the strength of the annual forest cover removal to daily discharge signal within the four subcatchments varied with the subcatchment with the least annual forest cover loss 1 over the 17 years predictably displaying the weakest signal p 0 282 forest cover removal was shown to increase springtime discharge for all subcatchments albeit at different rates this work provides a more comprehensive mechanistic interpretation of daily snowmelt control of stream river flow dynamics in northeastern north america keywords abiotic and biotic controls causal inference landcover loss machine learning snowmelt dominated dynamics structural equation modelling 1 introduction trend analysis of historical timeseries of waterflow dynamics has revealed a detectible increase in flood occurrence and intensity in eastern canada e g zadeh et al 2020 during the past eight decades 1931 2010 as snow dominated catchments transition to rain dominated systems with continued atmospheric warming buttle et al 2016 burn and whitfield 2016 burn and whitfield 2017 many more of these large devastating spring floods are expected to occur in the region over the immediate to near term with future climate warming e g el jabi et al 2016 bonsal et al 2019 one significant insight of recent assessments of flooding in the region is that we may be entering an era where historical analogs and associated assumptions of stationarity will be of little value for municipal and infrastructure planning in the future as such it is likely that we will become more reliant on simulated futures as a foundation for future planning and decision making to get there however a first step is to identify the forcing variables and system feedbacks responsible for contemporary daily waterflow dynamics in medium to high ordered streams and rivers of eastern canada in establishing a frame of reference a coherent progression in the development of regional capacity in flood risk forecasting and year round simulation of waterflow dynamics over the immediate to near term would involve the examination of flooding vulnerabilities and exposures along the international tri jurisdictional saint john river sjr wolastoq system in northeastern north america such a study would help fill basic knowledge gaps regarding the key biophysical drivers of springtime flooding in a large river basin in eastern canada at a daily timescale commercial and non commercial harvesting of forests throughout the sjr basin is widespread and its quantification particularly in the upper basin where topography is most varied is important in characterising localised present and future trends regarding i daily weather patterns via surface albedo effects and energy exchange patterns ii accumulation and distribution of snow iii snowmelt processes and iv subsequent springtime catchment responses paired catchment experiments in small catchments characteristically smaller than 100 km2 giles hansen et al 2019 goeking and

2013 mcdonnell et al 2018 goeking and tarboton 2020 some studies have shown that forest cover losses due to large scale forest modifications by insects and pathogens bladon et al 2019 clearcutting and land conversion can cause seasonal streamflow to increase because of post disturbance reductions in interception and evaporative losses while others have shown it to decrease due to increases in evaporative losses from the residual understorey or remain mostly unaffected zhang et al 2017 mcdonnell et al 2018 goeking and tarboton 2020 processes influencing the role of forest cover losses on

trends in daily snowmelt and waterflow dynamics in the upper sjr knowledge acquired from this initial effort will help generalise our understanding of the eco hydrometeorological processes and trends relevant to the production of high waterflow events in the upper sjr with a full expectation that this will lead to refinement of existing eco hydrometeorological models that can help support flood

upper saint john river sjr wolastoq basin upstream from the capital city of fredericton 45 9636 n 66 6431 w nb covers a large land area of approximately 41 179 km2 and spans the jurisdictions of nb quebec qc and maine me usa fig 1 the upper sjr basin falls within the atlantic maritime ecozone of canada and the new england acadian forests zone of usa the study area is characterised by a fragmented landscape with elevations ranging from 0 to 856 m above mean sea level amsl fig 1 the basin s climate is generally characterised as continental there are however some maritime influences during the year due to the region s proximity to the bay of fundy and north atlantic ocean to its south orographic lifting of advected air is a familiar meteorological occurrence in the high elevation parts of the basin on average winters are frigid snowy and cloudy over the span of a year the near surface air temperature ranges between 18 5 and 24 7 c with an annual mean air temperature of 3 6 c based on 1981 2010 climate data from environment and climate change canada environment and climate change canada 2021 historically air temperature seldom drops below 29 or exceeds 29 c total annual precipitation is on average 1 011 mm of which about 26 falls as snow eccc 2021 2 2 landcover landcover in the upper sjr basin varies from forests particularly in the headwaters of the river system to agricultural fields to residential and other non vegetated impervious surfaces adjacent to the middle branch of the upper sjr fig 2 temporal courses of forest cover loss within four large subcatchments of the upper sjr basin i e subcatchments 01ad004 01af002 01ag003 and 01ah002 fig 1 are based on satellite derived annual estimates of forest cover loss of subcatchment area acquired from the global forest watch programme fig 3 global forest watch 2021 linke et al 2017 analysis of an earlier version of the global forest watch dataset has established the data s feasibility in reproducing historical harvesting trends in transitional mix forests of nb achieving user and producer s accuracies based on area of 81 and 82 respectively linke et al 2017 boxplots per subcatchment in fig 3 give the within subcatchment variation in annual forest cover loss of the four subcatchments subcatchment 01ag003 had the least forest cover removed during the 2001 2018 study period i e 0 05 per year whereas subcatchment 01ah002 had the most at slightly 0 8 2 5 per year fig 3 owing to the legacy carry over effects of past forest cover removal on stream river discharge rates over spans of years we treat recurring bouts of annual forest cover removal over the 17 year period as cumulative functions of past landcover changes fig 3 including quasi permanent forest cover losses stemming from land conversion fig 2 2 3 flow regime the upper sjr is dammed at several places e g at edmundston tobique narrows grand falls beechwood and mactaquac affecting the normal flow regime of the river kidd et al 2011 the dams along the river however have limited capacity to retain floodwater from running downstream as their upstream reservoirs are simply too small to handle the enormous volumes of water that usually flows with the spring flooding of the upper sjr the occasional ice jams on the sjr may lead to localised flooding e g beltaos and burrell 2015 altogether the impact of these ice jams which occur at random rokaya et al 2018 can introduce a level of unexplained variation in springtime waterflow conditions along the upper sjr in our analysis we treat the presence of ice jams and their impending impact on the river as a source of error 2 4 subcatchments and associated eco hydrometeorological data the analysis relied heavily on hydrometeorological data acquired from the daymet v 4 0 database thornton et al 1997 thornton and running 1999 thornton et al 2020a thornton et al 2020b point extractions of cross validated daily minimum and maximum air temperature tmin and tmax respectively and precipitation and subsequent ancillary daily data of incident solar radiation ambient water vapour pressure and snowpack water equivalent were collected at 200 or 300 virtual weather stations the latter number for the largest subcatchment randomly placed throughout the subcatchments e g fig 1 and a single virtual weather station strategically placed in the headwaters of each subcatchment for a full accounting of downstream waterflow dynamics these data were either used directly as acquired e g air temperature precipitation ambient water vapour or were subsequently used to derive new variables such as peak on the ground snow accumulation snow degree days start of the melt season and other pertinent variables figs 4 and a 1 based on daymet v 3 0 data from tile 12 297 approximate location of the upper srj basin regionalised mean absolute error and prediction bias of daily tmin tmax and precipitation for the 1980 2019 period corresponded to 1 6 c with a prediction bias of 0 0623 c 1 3 0 079 c and 2 05 0 185 mm day 1 respectively a recent uncertainty analysis of the newest daymet data i e v 4 0 showed continued improvement from earlier generation data thornton et al 2020b despite minor differences between daymet v 2 0 and other gridded climate products derived from many of the same weather station data hydrological modelling based on the different datasets following model calibration did not produce vastly different statistical results during model testing essou et al 2016 cumulative snow degree days as proxies of meltwater production were calculated by adding daily mean air temperatures i e tmn 0 5 tmax tmin 0 c whenever snowpack water equivalents were 0 0 kg m 2 total precipitation was partitioned into snow and rain volumes mm day 1 according to the temperature index method in bourque and matin 2012 but implemented at a daily timescale daily wind speeds m s 1 in the headwaters of each subcatchment were calculated based on a simple temporal averaging of hourly wind speeds recorded at the caribou me usa weather station in the upper sjr basin i e 46 87 n and 68 01 w daily waterflow dynamics at the outlet of each subcatchment apart from outlet 01ad004 were recorded directly as discharge rates i e in m3 s 1 for conformity all stage measurements m at the outlet of subcatchment 01ad004 were converted to discharge rates based on a rating

878 stage 65 318 yielding an r2 0 96 2 5 data analysis ordinary statistical analyses are based on pre established models assumptions that data occur without error and are generally not adjustable however structural equation modelling sem cangur and ercan 2015 epskamp 2015 fan et al 2016 shi et al 2021 necessitates specification of a model based on a posteriori knowledge and openly stipulates measurement error structural equation modelling is an extension of multivariate regression that can be used to examine structural relations in multivariate data covariance is used to determine the strength of association between paired combinations of predictor variables to help provide insight concerning the controls of waterflow dynamics in the upper sjr when used sem offers a system of linear equations for latent unobserved and manifest observed variables crucial to explaining the hydro climatic system of study this information can be used to develop a path diagram epskamp 2015 e g fig 5 that emphasises the non trivial associations among the different system variables the sem method merges factor analysis with multiple linear regression and provides estimates of associated empirical dependencies in a single evaluation the method helps to explain linear correlation among variables and indicate the strength of anticipated causal interaction structural equation models require scrutiny to determine their global fit to observational data a common measurement of the goodness of fit of sem to observational data is the χ2 distribution barrett 2007 cangur and ercan 2015 the χ2 test is a model level statistical measure indicating whether the residuals i e modelled minus sample covariances are ostensibly equal to zero specifying the null hypothesis i e ho if the goodness of fit statistic i e χ2 is less than the expected critical p value of 0 05 then the null hypothesis of model covariances equal to sample covariances a case of no difference cannot be excluded as a viable explanation of the system s covariance matrix barrett 2007 here we use sem to test our prior understanding of waterflow dynamics in the upper sjr structural equation modelling facilitates our understanding by either confirming or invalidating our hypotheses about system mechanisms and processes in the path diagram latent variable i air symbolising the airmass exchange and inherent

iii ovl the contribution of meltwater to lagged overland flow possibly incorporating return flow that eventually reaches the subcatchment outlet in addition to sem we also use extreme gradient boosting xgb chen and guestrin 2016 ni et al 2020 a machine learning procedure akin to random forests esfandiari et al 2020 to uncover the importance of the various eco hydrometeorological variables in governing daily waterflow dynamics at individual outlets i e hydrometric station figs 1 and 2 extreme gradient boosting is the most skilled machine learning method for analysing complex nonlinear datasets the method can scale billions of samples using fewer computational resources than most other machine learning methods chen and guestrin 2016 eco hydrometeorological variables in the headwaters of each subcatchment i e suite of daymet variables average wind speed and forest cover loss were selected for xgb model development based on the variables known contribution to the control of snowmelt production processes and downstream waterflow dynamics at individual subcatchment scales an analysis of feature importance among the environmental variables via the xgb calculated gain helped identify the main drivers of springtime waterflow dynamics in each subcatchment the same modelling procedure was later used to create a multi catchment model to assess the consequence of repeated forest cover removal on outlet discharge rates an assessment of feature importance for each subcatchment and development of the multi catchment model was accomplished by i training five xgb based models on 70 of subcatchment sourced data for assessing feature importance and combined data from all four subcatchments for multi catchment model development and ii validating each model against the remaining 30 of their respective datasets correlative studies such as those provided with sem are unsuitable for assessing cause and effect relationships in dynamic nonlinear systems chang et al 2017 contemporary advances in the analysis of dynamic systems have led to the deployment of new statistical techniques in detecting causality in timeseries data sugihara et al 2012 one such technique convergent cross mapping ccm is a non parametric statistical approach that helps to isolate cause and effect interactions between system variables in contrast to linear tests based on cross correlation and sem ccm provides an improved level of explanation sugihara et al 2012 chang et al 2017 including detection of casual linkages direction of causation and feedback between variables two timeseries variables are causally linked if both originate from the same dynamic system convergent cross mapping checks for causality by measuring the extent historical records in one timeseries can reliably detect the conditions in another timeseries originating from the same system the ccm method can provide reliable accounts of causality even when confronted with confoundedness sugihara et al 2012 convergence in the predictive skill curve is an important characteristic of ccm that distinguishes causation from standard linear correlation clark et al 2015 2 6 analytical tools structural equation modelling sem xgb and ccm were based on open source r scripts called by the r programme v 4 0 5 r core team 2021 these scripts included i lavaan v 0 6 9 for sem rosseel 2012 epskamp 2015 ii xgbtree option in the caret package v 6 0 88 for xgb kuhn 2008 chen and guestrin 2016 and iii multispatialccm v 1 0 sugihara et al 2012 clark et al 2015 chang et al 2017 and pdc v 1 0 3 brandmaier 2015 for ccm 1 the lavaan script was configured to use maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors and a test statistic equivalent to the yuan bentler statistic rosseel 2012 given the non normality of the input data non normality of the data was confirmed with a series of shapiro wilk tests system optimisation was achieved by fitting the system of equations to the data with the nlminb optimiser 2 the extreme gradient boosting script i e xgboost belongs to a line of boosting procedures that upgrades weak learners into strong learners a weak learner is a tree that performs a little better than pure random guessing boosting is a sequential process such that decision trees are grown serially using information from previously grown trees during learner improvement 3 convergent cross mapping determines the direction and strength of causality among paired variables complementing the linear dependencies established with sem r script pdc via subroutine

subcatchments fig 4d 3 1 variable dependency fig 5 illustrates the path diagram of a conceptualisation of internal system organisation tested against the eco hydrometeorological data from the headwaters of the four subcatchments and associated outlets the linear network offers a fairly robust explanation of daily waterflow dynamics in the upper sjr basin after cangur and ercan 2015 in view of the strong test statistics produced fan et al 2016 shi et al 2021 namely i the model level goodness of fit statistic χ2 7 601 bootstrapped derived mean χ2 4 256 with n 6 000 bootstrapped iterations

each subcatchment across the four subcatchments the individual impact of the various predictors on the calculation of water discharge rates were largely the same with minor differences appearing in variables sdd and cumloss fig 6 cumulative day to day variations in ambient air temperature 0 c during the snowmelt season via sdd contributed the most to the production of snowmelt and downstream changes in water discharge for all subcatchments considered accounting for about 60 of the total control fig 6 peak snowpack water equivalent swe fig 4a and 6 was the second most important weather related variable in the prediction of water discharge rates 15 6 average contribution fig 6 for each subcatchment daily total rainfall pre was seen to be the least important with 1 6 of the control in affecting waterflow characteristics in the four subcatchments during the 17 years a close inspection of timeseries data for subcatchment 01ad004 however revealed that intermittent heavy rainfall during or soon after the spring snowmelt period had led to significant seasonal flooding of the upper sjr for example the combined contributions of daily snowmelt and rainfall 37 mm over a single day in subcatchment 01ad004 during the end of the 2008 snowmelt season contributed to the delayed cresting and extended duration of flooding of the upper sjr that year 3 3 causal inference appearing in table 2 are the results of ccm with timeseries pairs relating seven of the abiotic variables a to the daily variation in waterflow dynamics b at the outlet of subcatchment 01ad004 for 17 snowmelt seasons the pairwise comparisons point to differences as to the extent inter variable coupling occurs between paired variables i e a and b table 2 convergent cross mapping revealed that locally available incident solar radiation sol average wind speed ws and total rainfall at coarse spatial resolutions pre were not causally linked to daily discharge rates at the outlet of subcatchment 01ad004 case i table 2 this was consistent with the sem results where both sol and ws went unused in explaining waterflow characteristics at the subcatchment outlets fig 5 omission of these variables in the sem based explanation of discharge was consistent with their low feature importance identified with xgb fig 6 with sol being assigned a slightly greater mean importance than the two other variables combined i e 4 3 0 44 standard deviation vs 2 0 0 37 and 1 6 0 54 for ws and pre respectively although total rainfall pre appears in the sem path diagram fig 5 i e in the regression equations for latent variables air and ovl all related associations returned low standardised path coefficients namely 0 177 and 0 299 for the direct negative effect on air and indirect positive effect affiliated with its reciprocal interaction with air and 0 095 for a direct positive effect on ovl the former relationships between pre and air went unobserved by ccm as these relationships were not directly connected to the melting process confronted with ccm the latter relationship i e between pre and ovl was associated with the probable mixture of rain with meltwater in forming overland flow during the melt season the contribution of rainwater during the snowmelt period was generally very low across all snowmelt seasons as inferred by the variable s low standardised path coefficient fig 5 and table a 1 weak feature importance fig 6 and lack of causal linkage with discharge table 2 both cumulative annual forest cover loss fig 7 a table 2 and 3 and ambient vp a table 2 had a unidirectional causal linkage case ii with waterflow changes b downstream ρa b asymptote 0 193 and 0 397 respectively table 2 during the 17 snowmelt seasons with a b where a b stands for a forcing b

sdd and swe were both bidirectionally affected by the generation of meltwater and subsequent changes in waterflow characteristics at the outlet of the subcatchment fig 7b case iii table 2 as inferred previously by sem shaded components in fig 5 outlet discharge forcing via snowmelt generation on sdd i e b a provided by far a stronger signal with ρb a 0 737 table 2 and fig 7b with ln 460 record

statistically significant increasing trends p 0 05 for three of the four subcatchments i e 01ad004 01af002 and 01ah002 table 4 with the greatest melt period increase of 0 150 m3 s 1 day 1 having occurred in subcatchment 01af002 the largest of the four subcatchments fig 1 seasonal projections of outlet discharge rates as a function of forest cover removal in fig 8 were based on an implementation of a multi catchment model unlike the earlier xgb models developed in the assessment of feature importance for individual subcatchments i e fig 6 the multi catchment model adopted the contributing area of individual subcatchments as an essential differentiator of discharge volume for the four subcatchments the multi catchment model was suitably skilled at replicating individual subcatchment responses during testing yielding an r2 of 0 93 and a systematic bias from the 1 1 correspondence line of 0 19 with the y intercept forced to zero cumulative discharge rates for subcatchment 01ad004 without and with actual forest cover removal deviated the most accounting for a 31 8 increase between forest cover removal schemes by the end of the 17 years figs 3 8 and table 4 all 17 year cumulative discharge rates for the other subcatchments at their respective outlets equally underwent increases but at significantly reduced levels i e 12 7 11 4 12 9 respectively depending on pre and post 2001 total forest cover loss fig 3 its subcatchment specific feature importance value fig 6 and table 4 and subcatchment area figs 1 and 2 the feature importance of forest cover removal may be viewed here as a composite index of meltwater production and mean flow efficiencies stemming from differences in catchment physiography landcover e g presence of forests wetlands lakes urban cover etc and other landscape level hydro climatic traits fig 4 inherently mirrored in individual outlet discharge rates subcatchment 01ag003 despite indicating a slight discharge increase by the end of the 17 years i e 0 023 m3 s 1 day 1 per melt season this increase was not statistically significant p 0 05 table 4 column six of table 4 gives the difference between discharge rates under the two forest disturbance regimes daily discharge rate differences per snowmelt season for the four subcatchments i e actual rate with disturbance minus simulated rate with no disturbance increased over the 17 years fig 8 all producing statistically significant results table 4 fig 9 gives the historical 41 year median trend fig 9a and significance level fig 9b in peak swe 1980 2020 throughout the upper sjr basin over this 41 year period peak swe increased on the western side of the basin whereas it decreased on the opposite side 4 discussion 4 1 variable dependency elements of the analysis suggest that meltwater generation and springtime discharge rates across the four subcatchments were for the most part controlled by the area s seasonal warming associated with the springtime increase in regional incident global radiation and northeasterly advection of sensible and latent heat from southerly locations welty and zeng 2021 and subsequent turbulent transfer of the heat from the air to the snowpack prowse and owens 1982 moore and owens 1984 neale and fitzharris 1997 wei et al 2001 and tjernström et al 2015 in the dissipation of arctic sea ice this characterisation is strongly supported by the feature importance of cumulative snow degree days sdd in the prediction of meltwater production via the indirect positive relationship between mlw and sdd in fig 5 and table a 1 and stream river flow dynamics in the region fig 6 in addition to sdd s strong association with the latent unobserved variable air with a standardised path coefficient of 1 245 fig 5 and table a 1 when warm humid air travels over snow sensible heat via sdd or dt and ambient water vapour vp transported with the air are transferred to the snow surface causing the near surface air temperature and water vapour content of the air to decrease locally wexler et al 1954 treidl 1970 atmospheric cooling that results with the phase change of frozen water snow and ice to liquid water and the requirement of energy for this process to take place is explained in sem as an amalgamation of several internal system associations namely i direct positive effects on dt by both latent variables air and mlw ii a direct negative effect on air by dt iii a direct positive effect on air by sdd with sdd representing the seasonal accumulation of dt and an indirect positive association with mlw iv a direct negative effect on swe by sdd and v a direct negative effect on mlw by swe fig 5 on the ground swe is shown to be related to mlw in a negative fashion i e the higher on the ground swe is the lower we can expect mlw to be and vice versa the rate of meltwater production via mlw is greatest when sdd and dt are greatest both yielding positive relationships rainfall patterns associated with advected air via variable pre can undergo local to regional modifications as the airmass encounters orographic lifting and subsidence in irregular terrain as well as other complex precipitation forming processes mott et al 2014 these modifications on liquid water content of the air are displayed in fig 5 as a causal loop consisting of an indirect positive relationship dashed blue line between air and pre and a reciprocal direct negative relationship red solid line going in the opposite direction between the two variables the red line going in the opposite direction can be viewed as the airmass gradually loses its liquid water content through precipitation fall the air stabilising effects associated with melting snow or ice tjernström et al 2015 is generally maintained under low vertical wind shear treidl 1970 introduction of strong wind shear prevents development of a stable atmospheric boundary layer i e an inversion which can extend upward to 100 m or more from the snow surface takeuchi et al 2002 giving opportunity for continued turbulent heat transfer to the snow cover and snow cover ablation treidl 1970 normally the more snow ice available for melting both in terms of its depth and coverage takeuchi et al 2002 the more the atmospheric boundary layer can cool and become stable in conditions of weak vertical wind shear bidirectional causal relationships feedback loops identified with ccm for i sdd fig 7b and table 2 and ii swe a paired individually with discharge rate via the variable s association with snowmelt generation b table 2 were particularly interesting given our prior understanding of their mutual coupling in sem shaded circle and rectangles in fig 5 treidl 1970 and others the coupled interaction among the three variables depicts a negative feedback loop i e as springtime sdd increases with the seasonal advection of warm humid air swe decreases locally increasing discharge flow by way of mlw and then ovl causing the air next to the snowpack to momentarily cool due to the requirement of energy to melt snow and subsequently cause sdd and hence dt and reductions in swe to decrease in fig 5 a statistically significant negative association solid red line fig 5 exists between mlw and ovl suggesting a delayed transmission of meltwater from the mlw latent variable to overland flow ovl given the complexity of overland flow of meltwater via different pathways to the outlets the relationship between ovl and wfl waterflow discharge at the outlet is depicted as an indirect positive relationship between the two variables the direct negative association between vp a and mlw b is not statistically significant p 0 215 when considered from a sem perspective see fig 5 and table a 1 convergent cross mapping however suggests that this relationship is in fact a viable and statistically significant result with its unidirectional interaction namely vp forcing discharge via the production of meltwater with predictive skill curve convergence ρ 0 397 and a p value 0 002 table 2 the cooling process by turbulent transfer of sensible heat is often coupled with a supplementary snowmelt process resulting from the release of latent heat with the condensation of ambient water vapour figs 5 and 6 wei et al 2001 tjernström et al 2015 harpold and brooks 2018 in the region vp s role in melting snow is modest compared to the role of advected sensible heat with an overall contribution of about 8 to sdd s 60 over the 17 years fig 6 one way interactions between vp and swe and vp and wfl identified with ccm suggests that local and regional sublimation of on the ground snow and the direct evaporation of previously melted snow via mlw in fig 5 plays a minor role in the re introduction of water vapour to the air during the spring melt period i e b forcing a is not supported with ccm p 0 05 if the local to regional scale effects of sublimation and evaporation were to be substantial for the current conditions in the upper sjr basin we would expect two way interactions between the paired variables instead of the one way interactions recognised here i e a b the diminished role of sublimation in our study is analogous to that observed by cline 1997 for a continental midlatitude alpine site in colorado usa locally available global incident solar radiation sol in open areas or above forests compared to the effect of sdd and the advection of warm humid air has a reduced role in melting snow in the area 4 3 control fig 6 the effects of locally available solar radiation become weak at large spatial scales as features like slope orientation become decoupled and discrepancies start to average out this scale dependency supports our use of the snow degree day approach e g rango and martinec 1995 clark et al 2009 bourque and matin 2012 in quantifying snowmelt for large catchments substantially bigger than the slope orientation scale comola et al 2015 repeated annual forest cover losses and quasi permanent openings in forests serve as proxies of available melt energy to large forest clearings in the order of several hundreds to thousands of hectares as the openings facilitate transfer of locally available solar energy above the forest cover to the on the ground snow cover and to a greater extent transfer of energy advected with the long range transport of warm humid air to the region from more southerly positions welty and zeng 2021 4 2 forest cover disturbance and its relationship to subcatchment meltwater discharge the strength of the annual forest removal to daily discharge signal within the four subcatchments varied with the subcatchment with the least annual forest cover loss i e subcatchment 01ag003 with 1 over the 17 years unsurprisingly exhibiting the weakest signal p 0 282 table 3 forest cover removal was revealed to increase springtime discharge rates for all subcatchments over the 17 years of repeated forest cover removal although at various volume changes and statistical significance fig 8 and table 4 several observational studies have revealed that snowmelt rates in forest openings can be as high as 70 more than in areas with forest cover varhola et al 2010 fig 7a and tables 2 and 3 consistently point to a one way interaction between cumulative annual forest cover loss with the quasi permanent land conversion component kept constant as expressed in fig 2 and outlet discharge rates i e a b with ccm the strength of the annual forest cover removal to discharge signal detected with ccm and xgb although not with sem because of the signal s strong nonlinear properties was largely dependent on the total forest cover removed over the 17 years naturally large repeated forest cover disturbances fig 3 fostered strong statistically significant signals p 0 05 table 3 in contrast weaker signals due to their high noise standard deviation to mean ratios i e coefficient of variation of 62 for subcatchment 01ag003 vs 30 for the others tended to produce statistically non significant results both in terms of ccm pairwise comparisons and minor increases in outlet discharge rates as displayed for subcatchment 01ag003 table 3 and 4 annual forest cover removal to discharge signals at the start of the 17 year period for subcatchments 01ad004 01af002 and 01ah002 were also too weak to generate any discernible differences between instantaneous and cumulative discharge rates for the two forest disturbance regimes fig 8 the effects of forest cover removal on stream river discharge rates in the four subcatchments were sensed about four to eight years after repeated annual forest cover removal fig 8 i e at the point cumulative discharge rates associated with and without forest cover removal started to show divergence after that initial four to eight year period signals for the subcatchments generally grew stronger leading to statistically significant results for subcatchments 01ad004 01af002 and 01ah002 whenever cumulative forest cover loss exceeded 3 5 not including the forest removed for land conversion of the total subcatchment area table 3 springtime high and low waterflow results for both forest removal systems were mostly synchronised with the main differences appearing in individual peak discharges fig 8 during the 2008 flood in subcatchment 01ad004 with a maximum stage of 8 6 m annual forest cover loss in preceding years most likely contributed to a flood stage at the subcatchment outlet of approximately 0 6 m higher than it would have been if the subcatchment had not been subject to repeated disturbance fig 8 the amount of snow on the ground that year was by far the greatest during the 17 year period with a maximum accumulation of 1 6 m in the headwaters of the subcatchment saint camille eccc weather station qc during the past 41 years i e 1980 2020 peak on the ground snow water equivalent in the headwaters of subcatchment 01ad004 and associated discharge rates had for the most part increased fig 9 and table 4 continued increases in both peak on the ground snow accumulation and annual forest cover removal may appear as increases in springtime flooding of the upper sjr in the immediate to near term much like the flooding events that followed in 2018 and 2019 esfandiari et al 2020 in contrast the increase in stream discharge rates at the outlet of subcatchment 01af002 table 4 if sustained for a longer period will be most likely mitigated by the statistically significant drop in peak snow accumulation on the eastern side of the basin potentially offsetting the increase on the opposite side fig 9 5 conclusions this study summaries the variables that contribute the most to altering springtime discharge rates at the outlets of four large subcatchments 2 230 21 900 km2 located in the upper sjr basin over a study period spanning 17 snowmelt seasons from 2001 to 2018 the objective of the study was to examine the causal relationships in eco hydrometeorological data acquired from three independent data sources i e daymet v 4 0 eccc and global forest watch programme the study identified cumulative snow degree days peak snow water equivalent and cumulative annual forest cover losses as three important variables in the prediction of outlet discharge rates during the melt seasons keeping the 17 snowmelt season input to the hydrometeorological variables in a multi catchment version of the xgb model unchanged while varying the forest disturbance input from 0 to 2 500 km2 over 17 years presented us an opportunity to estimate the overall control forest cover removal had on springtime discharge rates at the four subcatchment outlets taken as a whole repeated forest cover removal had a measurable impact on the hydrometric response of individual subcatchments by increasing outlet discharge rates relative to the level of forest cover disturbance over the 17 years and subcatchment specific feature importance value the subcatchment with the least forest cover removed during the 17 years produced small albeit not statistically significant increases in outlet discharge rates likewise trend analysis on modelled discharge rate differences resulting from model applications of two forest disturbance schemes i e without and with repeated annual forest cover losses indicated statistically significant increases for all subcatchments application of these methods to additional catchments in northeastern north america could help corroborate the trends uncovered for the four subcatchments of this study the methods collectively provide a very powerful analytical

8561,despite the growing knowledge on the significance of submarine groundwater discharge sgd mapping its occurrence is a continuing challenge this study explores the capability and applicability of low cost off the shelf recreational grade echosounders rgess to image different types and locate point sources of bubbly coastal sgd standard and systematic methodologies for efficient imaging and processing were established the use of rges was validated using a research grade side scan sonar rgsss continuous resistivity profiling conductivity temperature depth casting and mantacam and scuba diving surveys lower frequencies 77 83 khz of rgess showed more distinct acoustic signatures of bubbly sgd as these were nearly the same as the effective resonance frequency of the bubbles the clusters of bubbly discharges have higher backscatter strength than the water column noise resulting in the definitive and convenient manual detection of sgd features hence showing more accurate point sources of sgd three types of known sgd occurrence were identified and characterized based on acoustic behavior and spatial distribution 1 sparse discrete and sporadic discharge over wide area 2 curtain high and continuous bubble concentrations from widespread discharge and 3 spring direct bubble discharge from intense seafloor degassing at a single point source these results showed that rges provides a good alternative for more efficient and cost effective preliminary coastal sgd works additional research on areas with water dominated discharge but no bubbling is recommended keywords submarine groundwater discharge low cost single beam echosounder sidescan sonar mapping of sgd 1 introduction the need to address the difficulty in locating and assessing submarine groundwater discharge sgd by improving the mapping and measurement techniques has been continuously brought up in various work particularly in coastal studies burnett et al 2001 burnett et al 2006 kang et al 2019 moore 2010 moosdorf et al 2015 prakash et al 2018 taniguchi et al 2019 in this study sgd represents all direct discharge of subsurface fluids e g submarine fresh groundwater recirculated saline water and co2 and ch4 gases across the seafloor fig 1 from the intertidal zone to deep sea burnett et al 2001 burnett et al 2003 taniguchi et al 2002 generally the most prevalent freshwater sgd is found closest to the shore whereas gas bubbles are common indicators of sgd seeping from the seafloor in hydrothermal and hydrocarbon areas burnett et al 2006 nakamura et al 2015 cardenas et al 2020 the release of the bubbles in hydrothermal areas are driven by the volcanic degassing of co2 cardenas et al 2020 while in hydrocarbon areas it can be a result of the decompression of ch4 which can be produced by the intensive freshwater driven methanogenesis idczak et al 2020 in any coastal region sgd is ubiquitous and may take different physical forms burnett et al 2001 moore 2010 mulligan et al 2019 low and small upward leakages over wide areas are prevalent in permeable sediments whereas intensely channelized and focused small springs are seen in impermeable regions cut by conduits i e cavities in karsts bedding planes and faults in solid bedrocks where they enter the sea as submerged springs burnett et al 2001 unesco 2004 contrary to earlier knowledge that this phenomenon was insignificant and can be unremarkable as it flows much slower than surface runoff mulligan et al 2019 studies have shown that it can be widespread and in some areas have greater ecological significance johannes 1980 senal et al 2011 however sgd remains difficult to detect and quantify resulting to ambiguities in understanding subsurface processes taniguchi et al 2006 among the commonly used methods for identifying and mapping sgd include tracer techniques using radon 222 and radium 223 224 and electrical resistivity profiling taniguchi et al 2019 these techniques continue to evolve through time due to the recognition of limitation from generalized assumptions and natural variability szymczycha and pempkowiak 2016 in more recent years geophysical methods using hydroacoustic tools such as echosounders are explored for mapping and imaging sea features and phenomenon which can be related to or can indicate occurrence of sgd e g submarine volcanoes gas hydrates or bubbles however reports are concentrated in deep open ocean investigations usually linked to surveys for hydrocarbon and petroleum deposits and submarine volcanoes baraza and ercilla 1996 mccartney and bary 1965 mitchell et al 2017 tsai et al 2017 echosounders collect two types of data seafloor depth bathymetry and backscatter bathymetry is measured using the time it takes for the sound to be transmitted back

controlled by the size of the bubble frequency and water depth nakamura et al 2015 echosounders are single beam systems i e fish finders side scan sonars and multibeam echosounders medwin and clay 1998 in this study the recreational grade echosounder rges is a single beam system now commonly used in recreational activities such as sports fishing rges was the tool of choice for seafloor mapping before the multibeam systems became more accessible in the 1980 s blondel 2009 in a survey intended to map active offshore faults in an area known to have bubbly sgd an rges with side scan imaging capability captured the bubble discharges in the water column of the coastal areas of mabini and tingloy batangas following this discovery this study explored the capability and applicability of rges in locating bubbly sgds and identifying point sources to depths of about 50 m in areas with previously documented occurrences use of rges may provide a faster and cost efficient preliminary identification and mapping of sites with bubbly sgds narrowing down areas for further investigation availability of sgd maps may help in enhanced understanding of the phenomenon and its influence on the ecosystem 2 materials and methodology standard and systematic methodology for efficient imaging and processing using rges was established in this study the datasets were acquired from 2017 to 2020 the workability of the rges with fixed frequencies as a low cost alternative method in imaging and characterizing sgd occurrence and locating point source was assessed the utility of the rges was validated using a research grade side scan sonar rgsss and through continuous resistivity profiling crp the rgsss is more commonly used in scientific studies due to its large area coverage and high resolution seafloor images that are comparable to the quality and extent of satellite images blondel 2009 to help in the validation of occurrence of bubbly sgds underwater photographs were also collected using mantacam a towed video imaging system and during scuba diving for ground truthing 2 1 research area the study sites are in mabini and tingloy batangas southern luzon philippines where different types of sgds related to hydrothermal activities are known to occur fig 2 sgd sites are known dive sites frequented by tourists sgds in these areas were previously determined via small diver

and springer 2005 2 2 recreational grade echosounder rges 2 2 1 equipment and equipment set up two rges were used 1 humminbird 698ci hd si combo or humminbird a compact unit with a side scan capability that belongs to a wide array of portable systems by humminbird and 2 garmin echomap 50s or garmin a unit that belongs to the garmin series of chart plotter and fish finder combination the rgess collect the same type of data as typical echosounder systems but are more streamlined and designed for ease of use kingon 2013 both units are composed of a small transducer that can be deployed on the side of a vessel with a pole 12 volt power cable a 12 volt power bank and a compact main control head unit fig 3 since the rgess are primarily manufactured as location tracker and depth meter gps coordinates and tracks and water depths were also recorded the side beams of the humminbird operate at a frequency of 455 khz with a dualbeam plus sonar coverage at 200 83 khz humminbird 2013 dual beam transducers use multiple elements aimed at different directions and angles to maximize the coverage capacity for areas at the bottom of the boat the down scan beam is transmitted humminbird 2013 the side scan sonar s maximum slant range is about 120 m for each side with a bottom coverage diameter of about twice the depth and maximum depth capacity of about 50 m whereas the 83 and 200 khz down frequencies are transmitted as 60 and 20 conical beams respectively humminbird 2013 for garmin the transducer uses a conical beam with a coverage of 45 15 for the 77 200 khz dual beam frequency with a maximum depth capability of about 210 m garmin 2016 the bottom coverage area of the conical down beams for both units mainly depends on the cone angle sonar frequency water depth contour and presence of scatterers homestead 2017 in general since lower frequency sound waves have wider cone angles they also have wider cone bases capturing more features at a time the diameter d of these footprints can be theoretically determined by the following formula where d is the water depth and θ is the beam width humminbird 2013 d 2 d t a n θ 2 hence 77 khz has a cone base diameter equal to about three fourths of the depth 83 khz covers a base area with a diameter that is approximately equal to the depth whereas 200 khz cone has a diameter that is about one third of the depth humminbird 2013 the sensitivity of humminbird to backscatter acquisition was set to a conservative level 12 from the scale of 0 20 to avoid noises e g sounds from micro macroorganisms wave bubbles nepheloid and suspended sediments materials whereas for garmin sonar gain and color intensity were set to low medium sensitivity sonar returns to disregard these noises 2 2 2 survey design and operation an outrigger boat at least 5 m long and 1 m wide a design that minimizes roll was used for the surveys the transducers were side mounted within the fulcrum area of the boat to minimize errors due to pitch the transducers were placed at a depth just below the keel i e 0 3 m to avoid signal interference from the boat fig 3 as much as possible the boat ran along a straight line with minimal turns to prevent distortion and smearing of the image or parallel to the coast at 1 kt to 2 kts depending on the wave and wind conditions perpendicular survey tracks were also added to acquire more information on target shape 2 2 3 data processing and analysis for humminbird the recorded data included the sonar images acquired using side scan and down scan 455 khz and dual beam 83 200 khz with the gps tracks and corresponding water depths the extracted sonar recording files include different file extension formats in this study only the sonar son and data dat files were used the dat files were viewed and analyzed using the main processing software used in this study humviewer a freeware used to view and analyze sonar recordings acquired by humminbird sonar imaging units installation of this software only requires at the minimum java version 1 6 32 bit windows and screen resolution down to 1024 768 sonar recording files with identified bubbly sgd signatures were selected and analyzed using this software for presentation purposes the selected images were further refined and annotated using free image post processing software gnu image manipulation program gimp 2 10 20 humviewer can be connected to google earth where the gps tracks were plotted and saved as kml the saved track file was then opened in qgis to plot the locations of sgd occurrences in sonar images on a separate base map for the bathymetry data the saved track data were downloaded using humminbirdpc the points were converted to csv using ms excel and further converted to charts grd using surfer 11 the grd file was viewed and transformed into a bathymetric chart using qgis whereas for garmin the extracted sonar recording files were saved in binary file format rsd and gps positions were recorded as garmin userdata amd garmin datasets were viewed and analyzed using garmin homeport a map viewing and gis software primarily used for all data acquired using any garmin gps navigation devices in some of the 200 khz sonar images of garmin the rise velocities of the bubbles were estimated to approximate the size of the rising bubbles using the well defined bubble lines of the identified sgd features these bubble lines are formed as the vessel drifted across the survey area leaving linear acoustic anomalies of rising bubbles within the bubble cluster greinert 2008 the varying slopes of the bubble lines indicate different rise velocities hernández et al 2017 rise velocities were then estimated from the time difference between two distinct depths along the same bubble line artemov 2006 using the measure tool in homeport extracted depth data i e xyz files were converted to grd using surfer 11 the grd files were then viewed using qgis as hillshade bathymetry 2 3 confirmatory surveys 2 3 1 research grade side scan sonar rgsss the applicability of a research grade side scan sonar rgsss in coastal sgd imaging was also established from previous field activities while imaging coral reefs in anilao batangas sonar images from the rgsss were used to validate the resulting images of the rges the rgsss used is the c max cm2 system this unit is composed of digital chirp towfish sonar transceiver str topside unit maxview acquisition software with a dongle installed in a ruggedized laptop coaxial hand hauled tow cable and 12 volt deep cycle battery connected to a power inverter with 220 volt output the towfish has two different frequencies 325 khz and 780 khz with maximum ranges of 200 m side and 50 m side respectively it weighs 18 kg in air and 11 kg in water whereas the transceiver is a compact rugged splashproof topside unit with a plug and play usb connection to the maxview acquisition software the towfish was towed at the side of an outrigger boat near the center of gravity while the control head unit was placed as near as possible to the towfish the boat ran at 2 kts to 4 kts for this survey only the 325 khz was used as it was the effective frequency for this type of work based on the previous surveys conducted overlap and orthogonal survey tracks were traversed for best target detection probability the sonar recordings acquired was in cm2 side scan record format the files were converted to xtf using maxview the same software used during the survey the converted image files were uploaded to hypack 2015 for processing mosaicking and analyzing generated images were exported as tiff images these images were readily overlain to the base map uploaded in the same software post processing of the image i e annotations was done using surfer 11 2 3 2 continuous resistivity profiling crp the agi supersting r8 resistivity meter was used for crp the electrode array was towed at the water surface behind the boat at a speed of about 2 kts the crp unit simultaneously collected gps position and depth from a separate sonar transducer i e water depth only 24 electrodes were used because of the shallow depth and limited turning capability due to busy sea traffic a floater was tied to the end of the cable to exert a drag and straighten the cable line a sinker was placed two dead electrodes closer to the boat to prevent the lead electrodes from emerging above the water during the survey the surveys were conducted in the early morning i e 6 00 am 9 00 am to be consistent with most of the sonar surveys and to avoid the time when divers are in the water for this survey a bigger outrigger boat was needed i e 10 m long and at least 1 m wide since the equipment components are bulky and heavy the acquired stg data were viewed and processed using agi earthimager a licensed software which subscription came along with the system package to successfully process the data the gps and depth data from the external echo sounder must match all measurements otherwise processing error will occur the interpretation of the electrical resistivity er data followed the assumptions presented by cantarero et al 2019 1 negligible lithologic influence 2 absence of conductive materials along the survey lines and 3 porewater conductivity controls the bulk resistivity this study also used the same limits from cantarero et al 2019 for the classification of the resistivity units fresh groundwater er 3 ω m mixed waters 1 ω m er 3 ω m and seawater saline groundwater er 1 ω m 2 3 3 conductivity temperature depth ctd casting a seabird 19plus v2 ctd submersible pump flow through system was used to directly profile salinity and temperature in the sites ctd casting was conducted for characterization of the water column and correlation with the acoustic images three ctd data were considered relevant to this study salinity temperature and conductivity seawater is saturated with salts from 28 psu to 41 psu tmcs 2019 temperature commonly ranges from 2 c to 28 c but are hotter in hydrothermal vents or closer to land tmcs 2019 seawater conductivity is naturally at 5 5 s m whereas freshwater stream conductivity ranges from 0 05 s m to 2 s m fei 2014 water flow has a significant effect on these values freshwater input naturally decreases salinity and conductivity values unless the inflow is a highly mineralized groundwater inflow which results to elevated values due to the presence of more ions fei 2014 ctd casting was done manually in two different ways 1 purposive ctd casting the unit was lowered inside and outside the identified bubble fields with gps position of each cast recorded using a handheld gps device 2 yoyo method the unit was continuously lowered and raised as the boat ran at a speed of about 2 kts along a track with a handheld gps recording the points where the unit was lowered ctd data were saved as hex files generated through seaterm and processed using sbe data processing software developed by seabird the dataset were converted to ascii format in this software ascii files were then converted to csv for further analysis using ms excel 2 3 4 mantacam imaging and scuba diving mantacam is a rapid reef mosaicking tool that can make fast and frequent surveys of submarine environments the concept design of the unit is similar to the teardrop tow judilla et al 2012 the unit is composed of a v shaped flat stainless steel that holds a waterproof digital camera e g gopro in video mode while being towed by a boat over the survey area mantacam is limited to imaging of seafloor at shallow depths due to light limitations with survey time between 8 00 am and 4 00 pm when sunlight is enough for video capture for this study the device was tied to the side of the boat towed at a speed of about 2 kts the acquired videos were viewed using vlc player screenshots of relevant frames were taken and further annotated using surfer 11 scuba diving was conducted in selected sites for up close observation of the visible expression of sgd e g bubbling for areas with obvious and significant bubbling observations e g size density dispersal of the bubbles from the origin at the seafloor were noted additional photographs of the relevant features were taken using underwater cameras photographs from both methods were used for the primary ground truthing to show the actual occurrence of bubbly sgd in the sites 3 results and discussion the workability of an rges in imaging bubbly sgd occurrence and locating point source was assessed using the acquired sonar images results were confirmed with the sonar images acquired using rgsss resistivity profiles from crp parameter measurements from ctd casting and photographs from mantacam and scuba diving activities the rgess used are mainly built for leisure but from the results the units can effectively generate good quality sonar images that can be used to locate map and characterize previously known bubbly sgd occurrences in the study sites three types of sgd occurrence were identified based on their acoustic behavior and spatial distribution 1 sparse type i e balayan bay 2 spring type i e eastern coast of tingloy and 3 curtain type i e batangas bay sparse type referred to discrete sgd occurrence sporadically distributed over a limited area spring type was discrete and direct discharge caused by intense degassing from a single point source at the seafloor curtain type described high concentrations of bubbles from widespread and extensive seafloor degassing 3 1 sparse type in balayan bay sgd occurs as a discrete field of continuously rising warm bubbly discharges with varying bubble sizes i e 5 mm at point sources to 30 mm at surface these features were observed during the dive less than a meter away from the coast at depths 1 m to about 12 m rising from the seafloor covered with boulders live corals and coral rubble depths shallower than 5 m had more frequent gas discharges fig 4 a beyond 5 m bubbles were sporadic 4b for a copy of the scuba dive video follow this link https tinyurl com balayansgd upon confirmation from the dive these features were then imaged using the rgsss with 325 khz frequency signatures of known sgd were indistinct acoustic anomalies in the water column at depths of about 1 m to 15 m 4c and 4d gas bubbles were imaged as sporadic near seafloor or mid water features along the 50 m transect 4d of the 120 m traverse 4c other features imaged were corals and coral rubble covering the seafloor and the track of the boat nadir zone the rges units also imaged these features in all images 4e 4j the brighter signatures in the water column indicate high scattering high concentrations whereas darker colors reflect low concentrations low scattering fig 4e and 4f show the sparse type sgd at depths of about 8 m to 12 m imaged using garmin the sonar images show 15 m thick and discrete vertically rising bubbles in 77 khz the identified sgd signature 4e was more extensive with stronger signal than in 200 khz 4f fig 4g to 4i show the processed sonar images acquired with humminbird at 1 to 5 m depth sgd was indicated by 54 m isolated near seafloor to mid water rising bubbles with no significant change in the stream width across the water column images from down scan frequencies 83 khz 4h and 200 khz 4j show more distinct occurrence with more discernable signal from the background noise compared with the down scan sonar image of 455 khz 4i aside from sgd other features were also imaged although considered noise in this study in all frequencies signals which may indicate the wake of a passing boat suspended sediments or bubbles due to air sea interactions were seen in the water column features which look like part of the benthos yellow arrows in 4h 4i and 4j were also imaged in the down scan image of 455 khz 4i these features are not as persistent as seen in the two lower frequencies both side scan and down scan of 455 khz also imaged the rough coralline seafloor morphology of the area crp result indicated that in near surface sub bottom depths down to 24 m high resistivity corresponds to the location of these bubbles the resistivity values indicate the presence of brackish waters in the subsurface further suggesting recirculation of seawater from ctd casting locations of the identified sparse type sgd features correspond to areas with low salinity 4k low temperature 4l and low conductivity 4m values compared to ambient nearshore conditions further confirming that the bubbles imaged using rges indicate sgd occurrence however both temperature and conductivity were decreasing with depth whereas salinity was increasing with depth a nearby river drains near the bubble field which may have contributed to the relatively low temperature and salinity values at the surface 3 2 spring type in the eastern coast of tingloy spring type sgd features were seen during scuba diving in september 2018 for the mantacam video follow this link https tinyurl com tingloysgd fig 5 a shows a photograph of the spring type bubbly sgd plume emanating from a single point source at the rubbly and sandy seafloor about 9 m deep this intense degassing lies within a sparse type sgd field sgd signature in the rgsss images was seen in this location as less distinct discrete acoustic anomalies in the water column at depths of about 10 m 5b spring type was seen as stronger signal in contrast with the sparse type sgd features in the area collectively gas bubbles were imaged as a 50 m discrete near seafloor feature 5c linear features on the seafloor where the sgd is emanating were identified as lineaments this suggests that the intense discharge flow amid the rubble in this site can be fault related the image also shows rubble on the landward side with sandier seaward side following these results sonar image acquired with the 77 khz frequency of garmin also shows good contrast between the spring and sparse type sgd features 5d the spring type has stronger signal with more intense yellow to red scattering against the less distinct blue signal of sparse type in fig 5e the rise velocity of both sgds is estimated to be ranging from 25 cm s at depth of about 9 m to 45 cm s at 4 m from the generated model for rising bubbles by mcginnis et al 2006 ascending bubbles with 5 mm to 20 mm diameter must be rising at 20 cm s to 30 cm s respectively in this study the bubble size bubble composition i e contaminants pressure and depth were the main factors affecting the rise velocities mcginnis et al 2006 tassin and nikitopoulos 1995 considering that the bubbly sgds in the area are co2 rich and are emanating from sandy seafloors with high amount of possible solid and dissolved constituents cardenas et al 2020 high level of interactions was possible slowing down the small rising bubbles at the bottom tassin and nikitopoulos 1995 in humminbird sgd features were more distinct in the down scan images of 83 khz 5 g and 200 khz 5i in all frequencies suspended sediments reduced the signal contrast in the water column unlike the sonar images from other units the sparse type sgd is masking the spring type in all humminbird sonar images while the linear features inferred as lineaments using rgsss are also present in the rges side scan sonar image 5f the identified spring type bubbly sgd was further characterized by high temperature low salinity and low conductivity values salinity was decreasing with depth within the spring but slightly increasing outside 5j temperature within the spring was increasing near the point source with decreasing trend outside bubble field 5k and conductivity was significantly lower at the point source on the seafloor slightly increasing towards the surface 5l the results of ctd casting were interpreted as characteristics of a classic intense degassing in a geothermally active region the fresher sgd output contributed to the significant variations of the measured parameters 3 3 curtain type towards the tip of calumpan peninsula in batangas bay fig 2 sgd occurrence was more prevalent and extensive forming a series of curtains of bubbles bubble point soda springs and mainit point fig 2 composed this well documented curtain type sgd in batangas bay cardenas et al 2020 fig 6 a shows a mantacam snapshot of dense and extensive bubbles emerging from depths of 2 m to 3 m fig 6b shows the less frequent gas discharges at depth of about 5 m enclosed by the red box for more mantacam videos follow this link https tinyurl com batangassgd the less frequent discharges at 5 m to 6 m were seen as series of more prominent dispersed curtains of bubbles over a wide area using garmin in 77 khz the identified sgd features 6c appear to have stronger signatures both frequencies imaged sgd signatures disappearing in mid water with 80 of the bubble percentage not being imaged in 200 khz 6d sgd features were seen rising to the sea surface at 10 to 20 inclination in the 200 khz sonar image bubble lines of the identified sgd features are well defined in this location the rise velocities slightly vary from 30 cm s at depth of about 6 m to 35 cm s at depth of about 3 m these estimated velocities indicate that the rising bubbles in this area can expand bigger than 20 mm since the values are slightly higher than the theoretical range mcginnis et al 2006 fig 6e shows the er distribution to sub bottom depths of about 3 m to 24 m with relatively high resistivity records yellow to red color which match parts of these curtains of bubbles from the inversion a slightly stronger mixed water signal yellow green to green compared to the balayan bay er data was derived this is interpreted as a result of seawater recirculation thus the discharge is mixed freshwater sgd and recirculated sgd locations of the identified curtain type sgd matched the areas with slightly low salinity 6h elevated temperature 6i and slightly higher conductivity 6j with respect to ambient nearshore seawaters the bottom salinity and conductivity within the bubble field are slightly lower than the ambient seawater the bottom temperature is slightly elevated inside the bubble field however no significant variations were observed from the values 6h 6m indicating the probable mixing of waters further indicating the presence of recirculated sgd in the area to further assess the capability of an rges fig 6f and 6g show deeper water sgd identified as part of the soda springs cardenas et al 2020 however the 455 khz frequency failed to image the sgd features sonar images of the down scan show a 182 m curtain of bubbles the signals disappeared at a depth of about 15 m indicating bubble dissolving and incorporating with seawater sgd features were seen emanating from the seafloor at 10 to 15 angle with more tilting towards the sea surface for more supporting information cardenas et al 2020 has a compilation of video footages of their deep dive in batangas bay confirming that the bubbles imaged in this location are indeed sgds that are parts of soda springs 3 4 key findings rges fig 7 shows the locations of all nearshore sgd occurrence imaged using the rges units the blue lines correspond to the locations of sgd identified using the humminbird with 83 200 455 khz pink lines are sgd fields identified using the garmin unit with 77 200 khz the plots of transects with identified sgd signature were connected to generate the specific areas for ground truthing sgd sites covering an area of 170 800 m2 in batangas bay 676 m2 in the balayan bay and 830 m2 in the eastern coast of tingloy were generated the results of this study show that gas bubbles indicating sgd occurrences exhibit acoustic anomalies in the water column that can be detected using the identified frequencies of rges this is due to the characteristics of small bubbles and freshwater discharges as effective scatterers and absorbers of sound waves aided by the significantly high density variation between seawater and gas discharge and the acoustic resonance effect controlled by bubble size sonar frequency and water depth medwin and clay 1998 nakamura et al 2015 similar sgd signatures were detected in approximately the same positions further confirming that all frequencies used can effectively detect bubbly sgd however although all sonar frequencies of both units imaged sgd signatures the 77 khz down scan frequency of garmin and 83 khz down scan frequency of humminbird were the most effective in imaging bubbly discharges bubbles serve as good amplifiers of sonar signals as the higher limit resonance frequency i e 50 khz nearly matched the lowest frequencies 77 and 83 khz a small bubble resonates to sound whose wavelength is several hundred times its diameter that even a few and spatially distributed bubbles which can be almost invisible may show considerable acoustic anomalies spitzer 1943 given the high concentration of bubbles in sgd sites the water column was seen as nearly acoustically opaque furthermore lower frequencies have larger bottom coverage imaging bigger areas and more features at a time while the density of the rising bubbly discharge is controlled by its physico chemical characteristics considering the co2 rich composition and bubbly structure of sgd in the study sites cardenas et al 2020 the curtains and plumes have higher acoustic contrast against the ambient water column however co2 rich bubbly sgd is thermodynamically unstable in seawater until it reaches certain depth where its density is equivalent to that of the ambient seawater nakamura et al 2015 at this depth the bubbly discharge expands horizontally and dissolves into surrounding seawater nakamura et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 this is probably the reason why in soda springs the bubbles were not observed at sea surface and acoustic signatures immediately disappeared at 15 m depth fig 6 from the sonar images rges with fixed frequencies showed sharp acoustic signatures of sparse curtain and spring type sgd in shallow nearshore waters 2 m to 75 m in the hydrothermal areas of mabini and tingloy batangas specifically sonar images in all sites showed that the acoustic signatures of bubbly sgd can be indicated by near seafloor to mid water cloud and curtain like features the discrete sparse type sgd in balayan bay was observed as isolated vertically rising feature over a limited area this feature does not seem to vary in width and general appearance across the water column acoustic signal of this type of bubbly sgd is weaker and more distributed than the spring type the dispersed curtain like features in batangas bay showed more variation depending on the depth shallow discharges were seen as continuous near seafloor or mid water curtain like features with identifiable plumes at some parts sgds in deeper waters i e soda springs were seen as cloud like features with funnel morphology that dissipate in mid water curtain type may be composed of series of spring and sparse type sgds forming a chain of sgd signal over a wide area discrete spring type sgd formed strong signatures of cloud like features also with an overall funnel shaped morphology this morphology is probably due to greater horizontal dispersion and expansion of bubbles as they migrate upwards spring type sgd emanates from a single point source at the seafloor table 1 summarizes the comparison of these types based on their acoustic behavior and spatial distribution sonar images also showed that rges units have a good range of frequencies to detect other features that are not visible to other frequencies or in some cases are visible to frequencies used in rgsss units such as benthos on the seafloor and suspended sediments and wake of the boat in the water column 4 conclusions local studies focusing only on mapping and characterizing sgd occurrence is scarce this is mainly because currently utilized methods are tedious costly and mostly require site specific assessments over a wide range of spatial scales and or delicate geochemical procedures to date the most used on ground methods in mapping sgd occurrences in the philippines include crp continuous radon in water and scuba diving use of sonar systems in detecting features similar to sgd occurrences was explored in recent years nakamura et al 2015 greinert 2008 hernández et al 2017 mcginnis et al 2006 zhao et al 2017 but there were no published materials looking at the utility of rges in mapping and imaging sgd occurrences in this study the utility of rges was evaluated and is assessed as a good tool for mapping bubbly coastal sgds using the developed approach the rges successfully imaged identified and characterized nearshore and shallow water bubbly sgds and their corresponding point sources in the three survey areas the results further show that although all frequencies of the rges used can image sgd occurrence 77 and 83 khz down scan frequencies are the most effective sonar images acquired with these frequencies showed clearer acoustic signatures and more accurate point source locations of the different types of bubbly coastal sgd finally cluster of bubbles or gas discharges have higher backscatter strength than the noise in the water column hence can be found by manual detection from sonar images although manual detection can be variable due to subjective differences in experience and amount of sonar images to be interpreted it is also definitive and convenient 5 recommendations further research can be conducted in areas with known sgd discharges without bubbles to test the capability of rges in imaging water dominated discharges with varying temperature and salinity conditions this recommendation follows that of artemov 2006 who mentioned that the flares observed in sonar images may also indicate less dense water bodies the imaging capability of other frequencies if available in other rges models can be evaluated at present the most common combination of frequencies of available rges is 50 85 200 khz lastly rges is highly recommended as a mapping tool in preliminary surveys for nearshore bubbly sgd related research such as in areas with shallow hydrothermal vents and methane emanations credit authorship contribution statement mary rose p gabuyo conceptualization methodology software validation investigation formal

8561,despite the growing knowledge on the significance of submarine groundwater discharge sgd mapping its occurrence is a continuing challenge this study explores the capability and applicability of low cost off the shelf recreational grade echosounders rgess to image different types and locate point sources of bubbly coastal sgd standard and systematic methodologies for efficient imaging and processing were established the use of rges was validated using a research grade side scan sonar rgsss continuous resistivity profiling conductivity temperature depth casting and mantacam and scuba diving surveys lower frequencies 77 83 khz of rgess showed more distinct acoustic signatures of bubbly sgd as these were nearly the same as the effective resonance frequency of the bubbles the clusters of bubbly discharges have higher backscatter strength than the water column noise resulting in the definitive and convenient manual detection of sgd features hence showing more accurate point sources of sgd three types of known sgd occurrence were identified and characterized based on acoustic behavior and spatial distribution 1 sparse discrete and sporadic discharge over wide area 2 curtain high and continuous bubble concentrations from widespread discharge and 3 spring direct bubble discharge from intense seafloor degassing at a single point source these results showed that rges provides a good alternative for more efficient and cost effective preliminary coastal sgd works additional research on areas with water dominated discharge but no bubbling is recommended keywords submarine groundwater discharge low cost single beam echosounder sidescan sonar mapping of sgd 1 introduction the need to address the difficulty in locating and assessing submarine groundwater discharge sgd by improving the mapping and measurement techniques has been continuously brought up in various work particularly in coastal studies burnett et al 2001 burnett et al 2006 kang et al 2019 moore 2010 moosdorf et al 2015 prakash et al 2018 taniguchi et al 2019 in this study sgd represents all direct discharge of subsurface fluids e g submarine fresh groundwater recirculated saline water and co2 and ch4 gases across the seafloor fig 1 from the intertidal zone to deep sea burnett et al 2001 burnett et al 2003 taniguchi et al 2002 generally the most prevalent freshwater sgd is found closest to the shore whereas gas bubbles are common indicators of sgd seeping from the seafloor in hydrothermal and hydrocarbon areas burnett et al 2006 nakamura et al 2015 cardenas et al 2020 the release of the bubbles in hydrothermal areas are driven by the volcanic degassing of co2 cardenas et al 2020 while in hydrocarbon areas it can be a result of the decompression of ch4 which can be produced by the intensive freshwater driven methanogenesis idczak et al 2020 in any coastal region sgd is ubiquitous and may take different physical forms burnett et al 2001 moore 2010 mulligan et al 2019 low and small upward leakages over wide areas are prevalent in permeable sediments whereas intensely channelized and focused small springs are seen in impermeable regions cut by conduits i e cavities in karsts bedding planes and faults in solid bedrocks where they enter the sea as submerged springs burnett et al 2001 unesco 2004 contrary to earlier knowledge that this phenomenon was insignificant and can be unremarkable as it flows much slower than surface runoff mulligan et al 2019 studies have shown that it can be widespread and in some areas have greater ecological significance johannes 1980 senal et al 2011 however sgd remains difficult to detect and quantify resulting to ambiguities in understanding subsurface processes taniguchi et al 2006 among the commonly used methods for identifying and mapping sgd include tracer techniques using radon 222 and radium 223 224 and electrical resistivity profiling taniguchi et al 2019 these techniques continue to evolve through time due to the recognition of limitation from generalized assumptions and natural variability szymczycha and pempkowiak 2016 in more recent years geophysical methods using hydroacoustic tools such as echosounders are explored for mapping and imaging sea features and phenomenon which can be related to or can indicate occurrence of sgd e g submarine volcanoes gas hydrates or bubbles however reports are concentrated in deep open ocean investigations usually linked to surveys for hydrocarbon and petroleum deposits and submarine volcanoes baraza and ercilla 1996 mccartney and bary 1965 mitchell et al 2017 tsai et al 2017 echosounders collect two types of data seafloor depth bathymetry and backscatter bathymetry is measured using the time it takes for the sound to be transmitted back to the receiver whereas backscatter is the amount of sound reflected to the receiver medwin and clay 1998 noaa 2019 gas bubbles and freshwater dischargein seawater can act as strong acoustic scatterers due todifferences in density speed of sound between the different media layers in the water column and theresonance effect medwin and clay 1998 nakamura et al 2015 the resonance effect is controlled by the size of the bubble frequency and water depth nakamura et al 2015 echosounders are single beam systems i e fish finders side scan sonars and multibeam echosounders medwin and clay 1998 in this study the recreational grade echosounder rges is a single beam system now commonly used in recreational activities such as sports fishing rges was the tool of choice for seafloor mapping before the multibeam systems became more accessible in the 1980 s blondel 2009 in a survey intended to map active offshore faults in an area known to have bubbly sgd an rges with side scan imaging capability captured the bubble discharges in the water column of the coastal areas of mabini and tingloy batangas following this discovery this study explored the capability and applicability of rges in locating bubbly sgds and identifying point sources to depths of about 50 m in areas with previously documented occurrences use of rges may provide a faster and cost efficient preliminary identification and mapping of sites with bubbly sgds narrowing down areas for further investigation availability of sgd maps may help in enhanced understanding of the phenomenon and its influence on the ecosystem 2 materials and methodology standard and systematic methodology for efficient imaging and processing using rges was established in this study the datasets were acquired from 2017 to 2020 the workability of the rges with fixed frequencies as a low cost alternative method in imaging and characterizing sgd occurrence and locating point source was assessed the utility of the rges was validated using a research grade side scan sonar rgsss and through continuous resistivity profiling crp the rgsss is more commonly used in scientific studies due to its large area coverage and high resolution seafloor images that are comparable to the quality and extent of satellite images blondel 2009 to help in the validation of occurrence of bubbly sgds underwater photographs were also collected using mantacam a towed video imaging system and during scuba diving for ground truthing 2 1 research area the study sites are in mabini and tingloy batangas southern luzon philippines where different types of sgds related to hydrothermal activities are known to occur fig 2 sgd sites are known dive sites frequented by tourists sgds in these areas were previously determined via small diver based surveys and radon measurements in zones with evident bubbling and varying temperature cardenas et al 2020 cardenas et al 2020 looked at pco2 to identify areas of high degassing whereas rodolfo 2019 measured the distribution of radon 222 to identify areas of high sgd the study areas lie within the verde island passage marine corridor vipmc a volcanic region with an active hydrothermal system it is characterized by tectonic structures such as ne sw trending gravity faults and sw trending volcanic ridges which resulted from the active subduction along the southern segment of the manila trench del rosario and oanes 2010 the nearest highly active volcano in the area is mt taal fig 2 a 311 m high complex volcano cardenas et al 2020 which had its most recent phreatomagmatic explosion in january 2020 the region is also recognized as a significant conservation area due to several endangered to critically endangered species of mammals and turtles in addition to the significantly high coral and reef fish diversity horigue and licuanan 2013 with a high concentration of species per unit area vipmc is identified as the center of the center of marine shore fish biodiversity carpenter and springer 2005 2 2 recreational grade echosounder rges 2 2 1 equipment and equipment set up two rges were used 1 humminbird 698ci hd si combo or humminbird a compact unit with a side scan capability that belongs to a wide array of portable systems by humminbird and 2 garmin echomap 50s or garmin a unit that belongs to the garmin series of chart plotter and fish finder combination the rgess collect the same type of data as typical echosounder systems but are more streamlined and designed for ease of use kingon 2013 both units are composed of a small transducer that can be deployed on the side of a vessel with a pole 12 volt power cable a 12 volt power bank and a compact main control head unit fig 3 since the rgess are primarily manufactured as location tracker and depth meter gps coordinates and tracks and water depths were also recorded the side beams of the humminbird operate at a frequency of 455 khz with a dualbeam plus sonar coverage at 200 83 khz humminbird 2013 dual beam transducers use multiple elements aimed at different directions and angles to maximize the coverage capacity for areas at the bottom of the boat the down scan beam is transmitted humminbird 2013 the side scan sonar s maximum slant range is about 120 m for each side with a bottom coverage diameter of about twice the depth and maximum depth capacity of about 50 m whereas the 83 and 200 khz down frequencies are transmitted as 60 and 20 conical beams respectively humminbird 2013 for garmin the transducer uses a conical beam with a coverage of 45 15 for the 77 200 khz dual beam frequency with a maximum depth capability of about 210 m garmin 2016 the bottom coverage area of the conical down beams for both units mainly depends on the cone angle sonar frequency water depth contour and presence of scatterers homestead 2017 in general since lower frequency sound waves have wider cone angles they also have wider cone bases capturing more features at a time the diameter d of these footprints can be theoretically determined by the following formula where d is the water depth and θ is the beam width humminbird 2013 d 2 d t a n θ 2 hence 77 khz has a cone base diameter equal to about three fourths of the depth 83 khz covers a base area with a diameter that is approximately equal to the depth whereas 200 khz cone has a diameter that is about one third of the depth humminbird 2013 the sensitivity of humminbird to backscatter acquisition was set to a conservative level 12 from the scale of 0 20 to avoid noises e g sounds from micro macroorganisms wave bubbles nepheloid and suspended sediments materials whereas for garmin sonar gain and color intensity were set to low medium sensitivity sonar returns to disregard these noises 2 2 2 survey design and operation an outrigger boat at least 5 m long and 1 m wide a design that minimizes roll was used for the surveys the transducers were side mounted within the fulcrum area of the boat to minimize errors due to pitch the transducers were placed at a depth just below the keel i e 0 3 m to avoid signal interference from the boat fig 3 as much as possible the boat ran along a straight line with minimal turns to prevent distortion and smearing of the image or parallel to the coast at 1 kt to 2 kts depending on the wave and wind conditions perpendicular survey tracks were also added to acquire more information on target shape 2 2 3 data processing and analysis for humminbird the recorded data included the sonar images acquired using side scan and down scan 455 khz and dual beam 83 200 khz with the gps tracks and corresponding water depths the extracted sonar recording files include different file extension formats in this study only the sonar son and data dat files were used the dat files were viewed and analyzed using the main processing software used in this study humviewer a freeware used to view and analyze sonar recordings acquired by humminbird sonar imaging units installation of this software only requires at the minimum java version 1 6 32 bit windows and screen resolution down to 1024 768 sonar recording files with identified bubbly sgd signatures were selected and analyzed using this software for presentation purposes the selected images were further refined and annotated using free image post processing software gnu image manipulation program gimp 2 10 20 humviewer can be connected to google earth where the gps tracks were plotted and saved as kml the saved track file was then opened in qgis to plot the locations of sgd occurrences in sonar images on a separate base map for the bathymetry data the saved track data were downloaded using humminbirdpc the points were converted to csv using ms excel and further converted to charts grd using surfer 11 the grd file was viewed and transformed into a bathymetric chart using qgis whereas for garmin the extracted sonar recording files were saved in binary file format rsd and gps positions were recorded as garmin userdata amd garmin datasets were viewed and analyzed using garmin homeport a map viewing and gis software primarily used for all data acquired using any garmin gps navigation devices in some of the 200 khz sonar images of garmin the rise velocities of the bubbles were estimated to approximate the size of the rising bubbles using the well defined bubble lines of the identified sgd features these bubble lines are formed as the vessel drifted across the survey area leaving linear acoustic anomalies of rising bubbles within the bubble cluster greinert 2008 the varying slopes of the bubble lines indicate different rise velocities hernández et al 2017 rise velocities were then estimated from the time difference between two distinct depths along the same bubble line artemov 2006 using the measure tool in homeport extracted depth data i e xyz files were converted to grd using surfer 11 the grd files were then viewed using qgis as hillshade bathymetry 2 3 confirmatory surveys 2 3 1 research grade side scan sonar rgsss the applicability of a research grade side scan sonar rgsss in coastal sgd imaging was also established from previous field activities while imaging coral reefs in anilao batangas sonar images from the rgsss were used to validate the resulting images of the rges the rgsss used is the c max cm2 system this unit is composed of digital chirp towfish sonar transceiver str topside unit maxview acquisition software with a dongle installed in a ruggedized laptop coaxial hand hauled tow cable and 12 volt deep cycle battery connected to a power inverter with 220 volt output the towfish has two different frequencies 325 khz and 780 khz with maximum ranges of 200 m side and 50 m side respectively it weighs 18 kg in air and 11 kg in water whereas the transceiver is a compact rugged splashproof topside unit with a plug and play usb connection to the maxview acquisition software the towfish was towed at the side of an outrigger boat near the center of gravity while the control head unit was placed as near as possible to the towfish the boat ran at 2 kts to 4 kts for this survey only the 325 khz was used as it was the effective frequency for this type of work based on the previous surveys conducted overlap and orthogonal survey tracks were traversed for best target detection probability the sonar recordings acquired was in cm2 side scan record format the files were converted to xtf using maxview the same software used during the survey the converted image files were uploaded to hypack 2015 for processing mosaicking and analyzing generated images were exported as tiff images these images were readily overlain to the base map uploaded in the same software post processing of the image i e annotations was done using surfer 11 2 3 2 continuous resistivity profiling crp the agi supersting r8 resistivity meter was used for crp the electrode array was towed at the water surface behind the boat at a speed of about 2 kts the crp unit simultaneously collected gps position and depth from a separate sonar transducer i e water depth only 24 electrodes were used because of the shallow depth and limited turning capability due to busy sea traffic a floater was tied to the end of the cable to exert a drag and straighten the cable line a sinker was placed two dead electrodes closer to the boat to prevent the lead electrodes from emerging above the water during the survey the surveys were conducted in the early morning i e 6 00 am 9 00 am to be consistent with most of the sonar surveys and to avoid the time when divers are in the water for this survey a bigger outrigger boat was needed i e 10 m long and at least 1 m wide since the equipment components are bulky and heavy the acquired stg data were viewed and processed using agi earthimager a licensed software which subscription came along with the system package to successfully process the data the gps and depth data from the external echo sounder must match all measurements otherwise processing error will occur the interpretation of the electrical resistivity er data followed the assumptions presented by cantarero et al 2019 1 negligible lithologic influence 2 absence of conductive materials along the survey lines and 3 porewater conductivity controls the bulk resistivity this study also used the same limits from cantarero et al 2019 for the classification of the resistivity units fresh groundwater er 3 ω m mixed waters 1 ω m er 3 ω m and seawater saline groundwater er 1 ω m 2 3 3 conductivity temperature depth ctd casting a seabird 19plus v2 ctd submersible pump flow through system was used to directly profile salinity and temperature in the sites ctd casting was conducted for characterization of the water column and correlation with the acoustic images three ctd data were considered relevant to this study salinity temperature and conductivity seawater is saturated with salts from 28 psu to 41 psu tmcs 2019 temperature commonly ranges from 2 c to 28 c but are hotter in hydrothermal vents or closer to land tmcs 2019 seawater conductivity is naturally at 5 5 s m whereas freshwater stream conductivity ranges from 0 05 s m to 2 s m fei 2014 water flow has a significant effect on these values freshwater input naturally decreases salinity and conductivity values unless the inflow is a highly mineralized groundwater inflow which results to elevated values due to the presence of more ions fei 2014 ctd casting was done manually in two different ways 1 purposive ctd casting the unit was lowered inside and outside the identified bubble fields with gps position of each cast recorded using a handheld gps device 2 yoyo method the unit was continuously lowered and raised as the boat ran at a speed of about 2 kts along a track with a handheld gps recording the points where the unit was lowered ctd data were saved as hex files generated through seaterm and processed using sbe data processing software developed by seabird the dataset were converted to ascii format in this software ascii files were then converted to csv for further analysis using ms excel 2 3 4 mantacam imaging and scuba diving mantacam is a rapid reef mosaicking tool that can make fast and frequent surveys of submarine environments the concept design of the unit is similar to the teardrop tow judilla et al 2012 the unit is composed of a v shaped flat stainless steel that holds a waterproof digital camera e g gopro in video mode while being towed by a boat over the survey area mantacam is limited to imaging of seafloor at shallow depths due to light limitations with survey time between 8 00 am and 4 00 pm when sunlight is enough for video capture for this study the device was tied to the side of the boat towed at a speed of about 2 kts the acquired videos were viewed using vlc player screenshots of relevant frames were taken and further annotated using surfer 11 scuba diving was conducted in selected sites for up close observation of the visible expression of sgd e g bubbling for areas with obvious and significant bubbling observations e g size density dispersal of the bubbles from the origin at the seafloor were noted additional photographs of the relevant features were taken using underwater cameras photographs from both methods were used for the primary ground truthing to show the actual occurrence of bubbly sgd in the sites 3 results and discussion the workability of an rges in imaging bubbly sgd occurrence and locating point source was assessed using the acquired sonar images results were confirmed with the sonar images acquired using rgsss resistivity profiles from crp parameter measurements from ctd casting and photographs from mantacam and scuba diving activities the rgess used are mainly built for leisure but from the results the units can effectively generate good quality sonar images that can be used to locate map and characterize previously known bubbly sgd occurrences in the study sites three types of sgd occurrence were identified based on their acoustic behavior and spatial distribution 1 sparse type i e balayan bay 2 spring type i e eastern coast of tingloy and 3 curtain type i e batangas bay sparse type referred to discrete sgd occurrence sporadically distributed over a limited area spring type was discrete and direct discharge caused by intense degassing from a single point source at the seafloor curtain type described high concentrations of bubbles from widespread and extensive seafloor degassing 3 1 sparse type in balayan bay sgd occurs as a discrete field of continuously rising warm bubbly discharges with varying bubble sizes i e 5 mm at point sources to 30 mm at surface these features were observed during the dive less than a meter away from the coast at depths 1 m to about 12 m rising from the seafloor covered with boulders live corals and coral rubble depths shallower than 5 m had more frequent gas discharges fig 4 a beyond 5 m bubbles were sporadic 4b for a copy of the scuba dive video follow this link https tinyurl com balayansgd upon confirmation from the dive these features were then imaged using the rgsss with 325 khz frequency signatures of known sgd were indistinct acoustic anomalies in the water column at depths of about 1 m to 15 m 4c and 4d gas bubbles were imaged as sporadic near seafloor or mid water features along the 50 m transect 4d of the 120 m traverse 4c other features imaged were corals and coral rubble covering the seafloor and the track of the boat nadir zone the rges units also imaged these features in all images 4e 4j the brighter signatures in the water column indicate high scattering high concentrations whereas darker colors reflect low concentrations low scattering fig 4e and 4f show the sparse type sgd at depths of about 8 m to 12 m imaged using garmin the sonar images show 15 m thick and discrete vertically rising bubbles in 77 khz the identified sgd signature 4e was more extensive with stronger signal than in 200 khz 4f fig 4g to 4i show the processed sonar images acquired with humminbird at 1 to 5 m depth sgd was indicated by 54 m isolated near seafloor to mid water rising bubbles with no significant change in the stream width across the water column images from down scan frequencies 83 khz 4h and 200 khz 4j show more distinct occurrence with more discernable signal from the background noise compared with the down scan sonar image of 455 khz 4i aside from sgd other features were also imaged although considered noise in this study in all frequencies signals which may indicate the wake of a passing boat suspended sediments or bubbles due to air sea interactions were seen in the water column features which look like part of the benthos yellow arrows in 4h 4i and 4j were also imaged in the down scan image of 455 khz 4i these features are not as persistent as seen in the two lower frequencies both side scan and down scan of 455 khz also imaged the rough coralline seafloor morphology of the area crp result indicated that in near surface sub bottom depths down to 24 m high resistivity corresponds to the location of these bubbles the resistivity values indicate the presence of brackish waters in the subsurface further suggesting recirculation of seawater from ctd casting locations of the identified sparse type sgd features correspond to areas with low salinity 4k low temperature 4l and low conductivity 4m values compared to ambient nearshore conditions further confirming that the bubbles imaged using rges indicate sgd occurrence however both temperature and conductivity were decreasing with depth whereas salinity was increasing with depth a nearby river drains near the bubble field which may have contributed to the relatively low temperature and salinity values at the surface 3 2 spring type in the eastern coast of tingloy spring type sgd features were seen during scuba diving in september 2018 for the mantacam video follow this link https tinyurl com tingloysgd fig 5 a shows a photograph of the spring type bubbly sgd plume emanating from a single point source at the rubbly and sandy seafloor about 9 m deep this intense degassing lies within a sparse type sgd field sgd signature in the rgsss images was seen in this location as less distinct discrete acoustic anomalies in the water column at depths of about 10 m 5b spring type was seen as stronger signal in contrast with the sparse type sgd features in the area collectively gas bubbles were imaged as a 50 m discrete near seafloor feature 5c linear features on the seafloor where the sgd is emanating were identified as lineaments this suggests that the intense discharge flow amid the rubble in this site can be fault related the image also shows rubble on the landward side with sandier seaward side following these results sonar image acquired with the 77 khz frequency of garmin also shows good contrast between the spring and sparse type sgd features 5d the spring type has stronger signal with more intense yellow to red scattering against the less distinct blue signal of sparse type in fig 5e the rise velocity of both sgds is estimated to be ranging from 25 cm s at depth of about 9 m to 45 cm s at 4 m from the generated model for rising bubbles by mcginnis et al 2006 ascending bubbles with 5 mm to 20 mm diameter must be rising at 20 cm s to 30 cm s respectively in this study the bubble size bubble composition i e contaminants pressure and depth were the main factors affecting the rise velocities mcginnis et al 2006 tassin and nikitopoulos 1995 considering that the bubbly sgds in the area are co2 rich and are emanating from sandy seafloors with high amount of possible solid and dissolved constituents cardenas et al 2020 high level of interactions was possible slowing down the small rising bubbles at the bottom tassin and nikitopoulos 1995 in humminbird sgd features were more distinct in the down scan images of 83 khz 5 g and 200 khz 5i in all frequencies suspended sediments reduced the signal contrast in the water column unlike the sonar images from other units the sparse type sgd is masking the spring type in all humminbird sonar images while the linear features inferred as lineaments using rgsss are also present in the rges side scan sonar image 5f the identified spring type bubbly sgd was further characterized by high temperature low salinity and low conductivity values salinity was decreasing with depth within the spring but slightly increasing outside 5j temperature within the spring was increasing near the point source with decreasing trend outside bubble field 5k and conductivity was significantly lower at the point source on the seafloor slightly increasing towards the surface 5l the results of ctd casting were interpreted as characteristics of a classic intense degassing in a geothermally active region the fresher sgd output contributed to the significant variations of the measured parameters 3 3 curtain type towards the tip of calumpan peninsula in batangas bay fig 2 sgd occurrence was more prevalent and extensive forming a series of curtains of bubbles bubble point soda springs and mainit point fig 2 composed this well documented curtain type sgd in batangas bay cardenas et al 2020 fig 6 a shows a mantacam snapshot of dense and extensive bubbles emerging from depths of 2 m to 3 m fig 6b shows the less frequent gas discharges at depth of about 5 m enclosed by the red box for more mantacam videos follow this link https tinyurl com batangassgd the less frequent discharges at 5 m to 6 m were seen as series of more prominent dispersed curtains of bubbles over a wide area using garmin in 77 khz the identified sgd features 6c appear to have stronger signatures both frequencies imaged sgd signatures disappearing in mid water with 80 of the bubble percentage not being imaged in 200 khz 6d sgd features were seen rising to the sea surface at 10 to 20 inclination in the 200 khz sonar image bubble lines of the identified sgd features are well defined in this location the rise velocities slightly vary from 30 cm s at depth of about 6 m to 35 cm s at depth of about 3 m these estimated velocities indicate that the rising bubbles in this area can expand bigger than 20 mm since the values are slightly higher than the theoretical range mcginnis et al 2006 fig 6e shows the er distribution to sub bottom depths of about 3 m to 24 m with relatively high resistivity records yellow to red color which match parts of these curtains of bubbles from the inversion a slightly stronger mixed water signal yellow green to green compared to the balayan bay er data was derived this is interpreted as a result of seawater recirculation thus the discharge is mixed freshwater sgd and recirculated sgd locations of the identified curtain type sgd matched the areas with slightly low salinity 6h elevated temperature 6i and slightly higher conductivity 6j with respect to ambient nearshore seawaters the bottom salinity and conductivity within the bubble field are slightly lower than the ambient seawater the bottom temperature is slightly elevated inside the bubble field however no significant variations were observed from the values 6h 6m indicating the probable mixing of waters further indicating the presence of recirculated sgd in the area to further assess the capability of an rges fig 6f and 6g show deeper water sgd identified as part of the soda springs cardenas et al 2020 however the 455 khz frequency failed to image the sgd features sonar images of the down scan show a 182 m curtain of bubbles the signals disappeared at a depth of about 15 m indicating bubble dissolving and incorporating with seawater sgd features were seen emanating from the seafloor at 10 to 15 angle with more tilting towards the sea surface for more supporting information cardenas et al 2020 has a compilation of video footages of their deep dive in batangas bay confirming that the bubbles imaged in this location are indeed sgds that are parts of soda springs 3 4 key findings rges fig 7 shows the locations of all nearshore sgd occurrence imaged using the rges units the blue lines correspond to the locations of sgd identified using the humminbird with 83 200 455 khz pink lines are sgd fields identified using the garmin unit with 77 200 khz the plots of transects with identified sgd signature were connected to generate the specific areas for ground truthing sgd sites covering an area of 170 800 m2 in batangas bay 676 m2 in the balayan bay and 830 m2 in the eastern coast of tingloy were generated the results of this study show that gas bubbles indicating sgd occurrences exhibit acoustic anomalies in the water column that can be detected using the identified frequencies of rges this is due to the characteristics of small bubbles and freshwater discharges as effective scatterers and absorbers of sound waves aided by the significantly high density variation between seawater and gas discharge and the acoustic resonance effect controlled by bubble size sonar frequency and water depth medwin and clay 1998 nakamura et al 2015 similar sgd signatures were detected in approximately the same positions further confirming that all frequencies used can effectively detect bubbly sgd however although all sonar frequencies of both units imaged sgd signatures the 77 khz down scan frequency of garmin and 83 khz down scan frequency of humminbird were the most effective in imaging bubbly discharges bubbles serve as good amplifiers of sonar signals as the higher limit resonance frequency i e 50 khz nearly matched the lowest frequencies 77 and 83 khz a small bubble resonates to sound whose wavelength is several hundred times its diameter that even a few and spatially distributed bubbles which can be almost invisible may show considerable acoustic anomalies spitzer 1943 given the high concentration of bubbles in sgd sites the water column was seen as nearly acoustically opaque furthermore lower frequencies have larger bottom coverage imaging bigger areas and more features at a time while the density of the rising bubbly discharge is controlled by its physico chemical characteristics considering the co2 rich composition and bubbly structure of sgd in the study sites cardenas et al 2020 the curtains and plumes have higher acoustic contrast against the ambient water column however co2 rich bubbly sgd is thermodynamically unstable in seawater until it reaches certain depth where its density is equivalent to that of the ambient seawater nakamura et al 2015 at this depth the bubbly discharge expands horizontally and dissolves into surrounding seawater nakamura et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 this is probably the reason why in soda springs the bubbles were not observed at sea surface and acoustic signatures immediately disappeared at 15 m depth fig 6 from the sonar images rges with fixed frequencies showed sharp acoustic signatures of sparse curtain and spring type sgd in shallow nearshore waters 2 m to 75 m in the hydrothermal areas of mabini and tingloy batangas specifically sonar images in all sites showed that the acoustic signatures of bubbly sgd can be indicated by near seafloor to mid water cloud and curtain like features the discrete sparse type sgd in balayan bay was observed as isolated vertically rising feature over a limited area this feature does not seem to vary in width and general appearance across the water column acoustic signal of this type of bubbly sgd is weaker and more distributed than the spring type the dispersed curtain like features in batangas bay showed more variation depending on the depth shallow discharges were seen as continuous near seafloor or mid water curtain like features with identifiable plumes at some parts sgds in deeper waters i e soda springs were seen as cloud like features with funnel morphology that dissipate in mid water curtain type may be composed of series of spring and sparse type sgds forming a chain of sgd signal over a wide area discrete spring type sgd formed strong signatures of cloud like features also with an overall funnel shaped morphology this morphology is probably due to greater horizontal dispersion and expansion of bubbles as they migrate upwards spring type sgd emanates from a single point source at the seafloor table 1 summarizes the comparison of these types based on their acoustic behavior and spatial distribution sonar images also showed that rges units have a good range of frequencies to detect other features that are not visible to other frequencies or in some cases are visible to frequencies used in rgsss units such as benthos on the seafloor and suspended sediments and wake of the boat in the water column 4 conclusions local studies focusing only on mapping and characterizing sgd occurrence is scarce this is mainly because currently utilized methods are tedious costly and mostly require site specific assessments over a wide range of spatial scales and or delicate geochemical procedures to date the most used on ground methods in mapping sgd occurrences in the philippines include crp continuous radon in water and scuba diving use of sonar systems in detecting features similar to sgd occurrences was explored in recent years nakamura et al 2015 greinert 2008 hernández et al 2017 mcginnis et al 2006 zhao et al 2017 but there were no published materials looking at the utility of rges in mapping and imaging sgd occurrences in this study the utility of rges was evaluated and is assessed as a good tool for mapping bubbly coastal sgds using the developed approach the rges successfully imaged identified and characterized nearshore and shallow water bubbly sgds and their corresponding point sources in the three survey areas the results further show that although all frequencies of the rges used can image sgd occurrence 77 and 83 khz down scan frequencies are the most effective sonar images acquired with these frequencies showed clearer acoustic signatures and more accurate point source locations of the different types of bubbly coastal sgd finally cluster of bubbles or gas discharges have higher backscatter strength than the noise in the water column hence can be found by manual detection from sonar images although manual detection can be variable due to subjective differences in experience and amount of sonar images to be interpreted it is also definitive and convenient 5 recommendations further research can be conducted in areas with known sgd discharges without bubbles to test the capability of rges in imaging water dominated discharges with varying temperature and salinity conditions this recommendation follows that of artemov 2006 who mentioned that the flares observed in sonar images may also indicate less dense water bodies the imaging capability of other frequencies if available in other rges models can be evaluated at present the most common combination of frequencies of available rges is 50 85 200 khz lastly rges is highly recommended as a mapping tool in preliminary surveys for nearshore bubbly sgd related research such as in areas with shallow hydrothermal vents and methane emanations credit authorship contribution statement mary rose p gabuyo conceptualization methodology software validation investigation formal

8562,the recent increase in the frequency of urban flooding in bangkok has led to speculation that global warming may be to blame assessing this however is challenging as bangkok represents an ever changing environment with changing storm drainage infrastructure limited flood and precipitation data and a tropical setting that complicates the relationship precipitation extremes exhibit with temperature this study attempts to create a framework to investigate the merits of the above speculation using ground observations of precipitation maxima flood inundation and dew point temperature along with simulations from general circulation models gcms to present multiple lines of evidence to compensate for the weaknesses any individual evidence may have the complexity of flooding in an urban stormwater drainage network is accounted by focussing instead on flood inundation information conditional to the incident dew point temperature which is increasing as a result of warming the assessment identifies a markedly different pattern of change in the east versus the west of the city attributing this to population change in the two parts further complicating the link to global warming application of the developed methodology using the most recent gcm simulations available suggests the increase in flooding is a pattern that can be expected to continue keywords global warming urban flooding maximum rainfalls statistical linkage 1 introduction bangkok has been called the venice of the east due to its complex intervening canal networks that have been developed for over a hundred years making them a part of the city s history and legacy and a key factor responsible for saving resident lives and assets from flood disasters jiarakul 2016 the characteristics of flooding in bangkok however have changed over time from a combination of upstream floods and local storm rainfalls to mostly local floods in the past two decades such change has resulted in the drainage infrastructures being frequently tested to their limits the instability of the drainage systems is getting worse due to urbanization as well as many argue global warming this has motivated the key question in our study which is whether the present inadequacy of the drainage system will continue and worsen given expected increases in air temperatures for the remainder of the century and the corresponding intensification this has been known to bring to extreme storm events arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 hettiarachchi et al 2018 wasko et al 2016 any knowledge of such intensification see for example hettiarachchi et al 2019 can be used to design the infrastructure to better succeed in flood mitigation as well as better plan green spaces within the urban landscape to reduce flood impact in bangkok while our study focuses on bangkok the learnings from this exercise are of relevance to many other established cities with ageing stormwater infrastructure and a changing climate global warming and the associated increase in temperature have been linked to more intense precipitation extremes around the world ipcc 2007 ipcc 2014 this follows from the physical mechanism of an increase in the atmospheric moisture holding capacity for each degree rise in temperature 6 7 per c temperature rise as per the clausius clapeyron cc relationship bao et al 2017 bui et al 2019 hardwick jones et al 2010 lenderink et al 2011 roderick et al 2020 trenberth et al 2003 utsumi et al 2011 with minor changes in average relative humidity held and soden 2006 the increased moisture holding capacity leads to similar increase in the intensity of extreme precipitation trenberth et al 2003 whether this increase in precipitation intensity translates into an increase in flooding remains interestingly an issue of debate given the increased dryness of the upper soil layer the precipitation falls on as well as the impact this has on flood producing mechanisms in large catchments ashish 2013 sharma et al 2018 thanvisitthpon et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2017 wongsa et al 2019 given the limited impact of catchment storage in urban centers such as bangkok one however expects the increase in precipitation to result in an increase in flooding in most urban environments hettiarachchi et al 2018 urban flooding assessment is also complicated by the makeup of the urban drainage system protecting each city there is a tendency for urban reaches to continuously evolve adding segments to the drainage network and converting green spaces to impermeable surfaces over time such has indeed been the case with bangkok that is rapid economic growth of the city has resulted in growths in condominiums commercial areas and population dhakal and shrestha 2016 although bangkok metropolitan administration bma has actively improved the flood drainage network as the city expanded its developed capacity and configuration have not keep pace with the increase in population or the urban character of the city bma 2020 in practice two approaches are available for assessing and modelling change in flooding of an urban catchment the first approach applies observed sensitivity or scaling rate of maximum rainfall with respect to an atmospheric moisture or temperature surrogate to project the flooding into the future alexander et al 2019 hettiarachchi et al 2018 yin et al 2018 the second alternative considers climate model scenarios to predict future flooding using hydrologic models andimuthu et al 2019 le et al 2021 tabari et al 2021 zahmatkesh et al 2015 often with a suitable alternative for correcting systematic biases in simulated precipitation and evapotranspiration li et al 2018 nguyen et al 2020 sharma et al 2021 have reviewed these alternatives as well as the limitations of both approaches and concluded that they are linked as both rely on climate model projections although the former does not use precipitation projections instead relying on the more stable temperature simulations for the future kim et al 2020 we adopt here the first approach given the added complexity of simulating the stormwater runoff based on precipitation projections the difficulty in modelling the changing nature of the stormwater network for the city and also because the analyzed cc rate is rooted in physics and its analysis is robust in this study we examine whether the increase in flooding in bangkok can be attributed to intensification in storm characteristics resulting from increases as characterized by the cc relationship testing this hypothesis is complicated due to the short precipitation record available the high variability precipitation extremes represent wasko and sharma 2014 as well as the changing nature of the urban catchment that makes direct use of changed streamflow extremes problematic to analyses to account for this uncertainty a multiple lines of evidence approach is implemented use being made of the precipitation data available and its variation with temperature as well as flood level information in an urban catchment that is changing over time given the tropical climate bangkok falls in the analysis accounts for the need of an alternate descriptor of atmospheric moisture holding capacity as per roderick et al 2019 and visser et al 2020 surface dew point temperature considered more suitable than traditional surface temperature especially in tropical climates was used ali et al 2018 to address the limitations posed by the changing urban environment and the short data length the hypothesis that precipitation and dew point temperature associated with days on which flooding was recorded is significantly greater is tested an assessment of the data indicates a markedly different pattern of change in both precipitation and dew point temperature in the western versus the eastern part of the city this is then attributed to the different patterns of development and population growth the two areas have seen affirming the complexity associated with changes in flooding in a developed urban environment lastly the study assesses changes in flooding into the future using general circulation model gcm projections with the aim of verifying whether these model simulations are consistent with the data based outcomes reported here as gcm precipitation projections are notoriously unreliable eghdamirad et al 2017 kim et al 2020 only dew point temperature projections are used in this study all these analyses point to a worsening in the flood profile for bangkok a cause of worry to the city and to other similar older urban centers that have developed extensively over time 2 history of flooding in bangkok bangkok the capital of thailand is located at the mouth of the chao phraya river and represents a major tropical urban center in south east asia one that is prone to flooding see the location and extent of flooding in fig 1 the city receives moisture from the south west monsoon and from tropical storms originating in the south china sea and the andaman sea during the rainy season may to october the size of its watershed area is approximately one third of the country 160 000 km2 the chao phraya river starts at the confluence of the ping and nan tributaries at nakhon sawan province then flows south for 372 km through the central plain to bangkok and discharges to the upper gulf of thailand the worst recorded floods e g the great flood of 2011 usually start in october when upstream floods generated by heavy urban storms and spring tidal influxes synchronize such an event generally results in extreme loss of properties and lives with recent overall damages estimated in excess of 50 billion usd world bank 2012 most recorded flood occurrences before 1996 were a result of upstream flooding keetacha 2011 that exceeded the 3500 m3 s carrying capacity of the chao phraya river jica 2018 such upstream fluvial floods took approximately 5 days communication with royal irrigation department to arrive into the city allowing people and the bangkok metropolitan administration bma to be better prepared the typical frequency of such previous floods was once every 3 years on average however the durations of these floods could extend to 1 2 months with maximum depths approximately 1 5 to 2 0 m above the low alluvial plain given the length of these floods and the impact they had on the large population downstream the bma implemented the construction of five polder systems on the west and twelve polder systems on the east of the river as shown in fig 1 see grey and thick solid lines which were completed in 1983 green news 2017 the city used existing infrastructure e g roadway and railway and constructed additional levees as necessary to enclose the polder and equipped it with appurtenant drainage structures pipes water gates and natural and man made cannel networks and pumping stations simultaneously a royal decree by king rama ix initiated construction of levees on the east polders see red solid lines on the east in fig 1 to contain the upstream design flood of 3 500 m3 s i e elevation of levee crest including freeboard 2 5 m msl in 1997 the west polders were noted to be capable of preventing an equivalent flood via levees shown in fig 1 this polder system and the associated levees have been largely successful in securing the city from the arriving upstream floods ever since with local extreme rainfalls being the sole source of flooding post 1997 in the city flooding characteristics have changed from previously high depth events with a long duration to more frequent flash floods with shallower depths less than 0 5 m and durations shorter than 1 day kiguchi et al 2021 saito 2014 to alleviate the negative effect of the flash floods the bma has improved the capacity of existing drainage systems by constructing seven detention tunnels see green arrows in fig 1 table 1 presents location size and timeline of the tunnels available for the drainage systems these have enhanced the system to allow a local flood with maximum intensity of 60 mm hr of 5 min 4hr durations since 2011 bma 2020 however local flooding is noted to be getting worse following an increase in the frequency of flooding leading many to speculate on why this is occurring while many factors may lead to changes in precipitation the consensus is that rising global temperatures will lead to a larger capacity for storing atmospheric moisture resulting in larger more intense downpours when they occur lee et al 2020 investigating whether this is the reason for the apparent increase in flooding in bangkok forms the main motivation for this study 3 methodology the methodology presented in this section has been designed given the challenge of attributing temperature rise as the factor responsible for increase in flooding in bangkok due to the changing nature of the city and the relatively short and spatially variable climate record available the methodology consists of two parts first an approach to assess the change in precipitation extremes with rise in temperature is presented referred to as a scaling or sensitivity estimation next to provide an alternate line of evidence to assess our hypothesis change in the frequency of flooding resulting from temperature rise is assessed use is then made of bayes theorem to formally test the hypothesis that temperature rise is responsible for the increase in flooding in bangkok 3 1 precipitation temperature scaling rooted in thermodynamics the cc relationship explains how the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere increases with increase in surface temperature a greater atmospheric moisture volume in turn is assumed to equate to an increased extreme precipitation volume and intensity the rate of change in atmospheric moisture for each degree centigrade rise in temperature is termed the cc scaling coefficient assuming values between 6 and 7 per degree centigrade temperature rise given extreme precipitation events occur when humidity is high and relatively constant over time the cc scaling coefficient is often ascertained using available precipitation temperature records ali et al 2018 ali and mishra 2017 bao et al 2017 bui et al 2019 golroudbary et al 2019 hettiarachchi et al 2018 lenderink et al 2011 roderick et al 2020 shaw et al 2011 utsumi et al 2011 wasko and sharma 2014 wasko and sharma 2017 wasko et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 while there exist questions on what surrogate of temperature be used or how long the precipitation must last or how long before the precipitation this temperature observation be selected roderick et al 2019 roderick et al 2020 visser et al 2020 a scaling estimate that is reliable can be used to ascertain the change in intensity into the future alexander et al 2019 hettiarachchi et al 2018 the presented method therefore applies the cc relationship to determine the gradient of the extreme precipitation per unit temperature readers are referred to a recent review of scaling methodologies as the basis for assessing change in extreme rainfall characteristics fowler et al 2021 the cc scaling coefficient and its relation to extreme precipitation can be expressed as roderick et al 2019 wasko and sharma 2014 r 2 r 1 1 α δ t d where r 1 and r 2 are the daily maximum precipitation separated by dew point temperature difference δ t d and α is the scaling rate for the maximum precipitation in c it should be noted that use has been made of dew point temperature instead of surface air temperature in the description above given extreme precipitation in tropical cities such as bangkok has a known unstable relationship with surface air temperature as discussed by roderick et al 2019 this follows from a distortion in the temperature atmospheric moisture relationship at high temperatures 29 c and above where more energy is used as sensible heat instead of evaporative heat flux as a result a higher temperature equates to reduced atmospheric moisture creating a negative cc scaling effect contradicting the time trend of increasing rainfall rates that are usually associated use of dew point temperature instead reduces this discrepancy to a large extent and is a recommended option to adopt especially in tropical settings ali and mishra 2017 trenberth and shea 2005 utsumi et al 2011 the scaling coefficient can be estimated using either binning regression as in lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 or quantile regression wasko and sharma 2014 for a given quantile g the relationship can be written as follows log r i β 0 g β 1 g t d i ε i g where β 0 g and β 1 g are the estimates of the intercept log r 1 and the slope log 1 α and ε i g is an associated error with zero mean the parameters β 0 g and β 1 g are estimated by minimizing the error ε i g with the weight of g for underprediction and that 1 g for overprediction roderick et al 2019 that is d β 0 g β 1 g g y i β 0 g β 1 g x i log r i β 0 g β 1 g t d i 1 g y i β 0 g β 1 g x i log r i β 0 g β 1 g t d i in which d β 0 g β 1 g is the cost function to be minimized the estimated slope β 1 g is then inverted to 100 e β 1 g 1 for estimating the scaling rate estimate α a positive rate α implies the percentage of increase in the maximum precipitation r per c rise in the temperature t d 3 2 linking flooding to temperature in a changing urban environment while an increase in precipitation intensity with temperature can be expressed by a positive scaling rate whether this translates to an increase in flooding remains a question even though the likelihood of modulating this increase in precipitation through catchment storage is low as bangkok represents a dense urban catchment and not one where soil storage is significant assessing changes in flood peaks on the other hand is complicated due to continuous development of drainage facilities to keep up with urbanization resulting in a nonstationary precipitation flood relationship a situation that is common to most cities given this nonstationary the direct use of the scaling rationale for floods adopted before in the context of precipitation is not possible to test our hypothesis of flood increase with rising temperatures under these constraints a different approach is adopted instead of focusing on the quantitative increase in flooding the probability of flooding as a result of increase in temperature is ascertained this is done using bayes theorem as follows p f t d p t d f p f p t d where p f t d is the posterior probability of flooding given a particular dew point temperature p t d f is conditional probability of the temperature t d given a flood occurrence p f is prior occurrence probability of the flood across all wet days in the record and p t d is marginal probability of the temperature t d flood f here implies flood inundation instead of its difficulty to specify flow rate equivalent or alternatively the inability of the stormwater network to contain the local flood event the posterior probability p f t d is estimated empirically from the observed data as this probability is conditional on the dew point temperature any increase in this probability with higher temperatures is used as an indication of the hypothesis being supportable 4 observed local data twenty three point location time series of observed climate data precipitation depth surface air temperature and relative humidity and ten at site time sequences of historical flood depth records owned and operated by the department of drainage and sewerage dds bma were considered in this study dew point temperatures were derived using surface air temperature and relative humidity as per lawrence 2005 fig 2 shows a network of chosen climate stations see filled triangles that uniformly distribute over every polder in the city and a group of flood gauging stations representing flooding hotspots in the east of bangkok see blue circles notice that the west is less vulnerable to flooding than the east hence the above data configuration captures flood events adequately the relevant data are available at a 5 min time step and the total lengths of the climate and flood data are 7 years 2011 2017 and 6 years 2012 2017 respectively in the present study the scaling analysis is performed for daily maximum 60 minute precipitation hence we extracted the largest sum of 12 consecutive 5 min rainfalls 1 mm day on a wet day for each station the daily mean of wet day dew point temperature was selected for this application as a good surrogate for atmospheric moisture holding capacity especially for tropical environments ali et al 2018 bui et al 2019 hardwick jones et al 2010 lenderink et al 2011 park and min 2017 the frequency of a flood associated with the maximum precipitation for every location would be ascertained from the number of flooding days if observed depth above roadway in such a flood exceeded 1 cm 5 results 5 1 sensitivity of extreme rainfall to changes in dew point temperature the 90th percentile precipitation scaling rate estimates for daily maximum 60 minute rainfalls across bangkok are presented in fig 3 the red and white circles in the figure stand for positive and negative scaling rates respectively and the size of circle identifies the absolute rate of scaling in percent per c the overall result across the study area shows that the dew point temperature is a stable covariate for the scaling analysis of the maximum rainfalls because the scaling rates of most stations 19 out of 23 stations are positive and consistent with other studies for tropical locations ali et al 2018 ali and mishra 2017 bui et al 2019 roderick et al 2020 in addition the referred figure also demonstrates the scaling rates on the western part of the city are sub cc while the others are mostly super cc an issue that is investigated in greater detail below to examine why the scaling rates at nearby stations across the river are different fig 4 presents results for four representative stations west tlc and rbn east dmg and bkm along with a box plot representing the full distribution of scaling across the two zones there appears to be a consistent and significant difference in the scaling rates in the eastern stations as compared to those in the west a super cc 2 to 60 c scaling rate distribution is noticed in the east whereas the west exhibits sub cc rates 5 2 to 6 0 c given the geographical proximity of these two sets of locations this raises the question whether such differences are a result of site specific variations relating to the relatively short precipitation record available or due to more systemic changes in the precipitation temperature relationship to reduce the scatter in the above results a regionally pooled estimate is next ascertained wasko and sharma 2014 zhang et al 2017 fig 5 shows analysis result for the 90th percentile rate for the area using all observations for both the western and the eastern parts of the city the eastern side gradient is identified to be super cc with a magnitude of 12 0 c with the difference between the two sets deemed statistically significant at the 90 confidence level as per a bootstrap based test it is also notable that the scaling differences are consistent with the areas of flood increase noted in recent decades with inundation in the east being more severe and frequent than for the western part of the city fig 1 why thus should there be a difference between the east and the west given the close proximity of the regions and the lack of any argument supporting a difference in climate a further investigation of the scaling differences in the east and west of bangkok is presented in fig 6 and fig 7 some factors that could contribute to these differences are a variability in the short record used b a distinct difference in either the temperature or the humidity between the two regions and c a distinct pattern of change with time in the precipitation extremes or the covariate used dew point temperature while the first factor variability is important the use of pooled regional data and the fact that the data record spans the same period in both the east and the west gives us confidence that the differences above are more systemic than random it is interesting to note the differences between the humidity and temperature relationship shown in fig 6 temperature tends to be higher in the east compared to the west while the humidity varies similarly we suspect this is a result of the increasing rate of urbanization in the eastern part of bangkok with the urban heat island effect being more enhanced while a higher temperature by itself does not impact the estimated scaling rates a different trend in temperature can this is investigated in fig 7a with the rate of increase in the 90 percentile dew point temperature being greater for the east compared to the west also apparent is an overall increase in temperature greater than the increase expected due to warming again possibly a result of urbanization the reason for this increase appears to be the different population trends the two regions exhibit fig 7b the difference in the population trends arises from the boom of condominiums in the east which has increased migration from the west communication with the bma staff the change in flooding over time is illustrated in fig 8 shown is a series of observed flood days black circle in bangkok and the sequence of historical mean of dew point temperature records red triangle for each year from 2012 to 2017 the increase in flooding although based on a short sample is significant and clear the increase in dew point temperature is also significant and possibly a result of the global warming trend evident in temperature records elsewhere coupled to the added increase in temperatures because of urbanization in the eastern part of the city huong and pathirana 2013 thanvisitthpon et al 2018 it is important to note that the point scaling results here exhibit considerable uncertainty due to the short data record available for this study it is for this reason that we have adopted a less extreme percentile 90th which is more stable that the more extreme percentiles 99th used in related studies for other urban environments alexander et al 2019 hettiarachchi et al 2018 additionally we also substitute space for time in that we assess the consistency of the scaling results over space and identify reasons which may contribute to spatial differences hence while uncertainty is undeniable the assessment presented is robust and represents the best practice one can have in a typical urban environment subject to data limitations and on ground changes 5 2 assessment of change in stormwater flooding given the uncertainties in the precipitation scaling results presented earlier one needs an addition line of evidence to assess whether flooding is being caused due to rising temperatures in the region this is attempted here using flood inundation data via bayes theorem as described in section 3 2 fig 9 shows the probability of flooding given incident dew point temperature for the available data record it is clear that there is an increase in the frequency of flooding with rise in dew point temperature affirming the increase in precipitation that has been noted in earlier results the rate of increase in the frequency of flooding is ascertained using linear regression to give an increasing slope s equal to 1 6 c while this is not directly comparable to the positive scaling rates tabled before it is indicative of an increasing trend if dew point temperature continues to rise 6 can the increasing pattern of flooding be expected to continue a final part of our investigation focusses on whether the changes we have noted in earlier sections would continue into the future to address this question one needs information about change in temperature and population over bangkok this assessment is based on climate model simulations for the shared socio economic pathway ssp 3 and 5 scenarios for five global circulation models gcms from the ipcc cmip6 archive the models considered are ipsl cm6a lr ssp3 ssp5 access cm2 ssp3 ssp5 canesm5 ssp3 ssp5 cnrm cm6 1 ssp3 ssp5 and hadgem3 gc31 ll ssp3 the precipitation flux near surface temperature and relative humidity were assessed via https www wcrp climate org wgcm cmip wgcm cmip6 to create the results shown below the future climate simulation datasets used ranges from 2015 to 2100 it should be noted that while the models do consider changes in population with time added considerations necessary for an urban center such as bangkok may be absent consequently changes in temperature will align more with the overall change due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations globally what additional increase due to the urban heat island effect being absent dew point temperatures for each wet day were ascertained based on the surface temperature and the relative humidity lawrence 2005 the total series of these computed temperatures were then separated into 3 sub sequences i e near future 2020 to 2040 2030 s mid future 2050 to 2070 2060 s and far future 2080 to 2100 2090 s and their medians estimated respectively the median temperature scenarios were later compared with the appropriate temperature for the current period these comparisons indicated that the future temperatures tend to increase as a function of time see table 2 in addition the growth in the flood probability under the impact of the climate change was simply assessed as δ p f t d δ t d s where δ p f t d and δ t d were the changes in the probability of flooding and the dew point temperature between the future and current periods while s is the rate of change in this probability with rise in dew point temperature estimated from fig 9 fig 10 displays relative increases in ssp3 and ssp5 flood probabilities for the east of bangkok during the near mid and far future periods the increases shown in the figure are relative to the current period while the increases are not significantly different between the two scenarios considered what is concerning is the overall pattern of increase for a city that is already experiencing significant damage from flooding 7 conclusions this study focused on the increase in flooding in bangkok in recent times and whether this increase could partially be a result of global warming establishing the link between increasing temperatures and the rise in flooding in a complex changing city environment required a two step assessment first high resolution climate precipitation data from multiple locations in bangkok was used to assess intensification of maximum precipitation as a result of rise in temperature given a limitation of using air temperature for such analysis in tropical regions the assessment was based on using dew point temperature the second part of the method attempted to demonstrate that this increased precipitation intensity was resulting in an increase in flooding here bayes theorem was used to ascertain the conditional probability of flooding given dew point temperature this allowed us to then develop estimates of the change in probability using climate model simulations for the future given bangkok represents a highly urbanized area one would expect increase in precipitation intensity to correspond to a similar increase in flooding as the impact of drying soils due to higher temperatures is small assessing this impact was challenging as the urban system is under constant evolution with changing impervious fractions and hence a nonstationary relationship between precipitation and flow to complicate matters further it was noted that the city is experiencing a growth in population in its eastern zone and a decrease in population in the west leading to markedly different patterns of temperature change and hence estimates of the precipitation scaling rate to circumvent the changes in the urban drainage system data on flood levels that begin to exceed inlet capacity were consequently used to define overall possible flood events the definition further allowed us regionally robust backward linking the flood process with the corresponding dew point temperature phenomenon due to their comparable inlet capacities assessment into the future required the use of climate model simulations along with the relationship between the conditional probability of flooding as a function of dew point temperature established using observed data using current generation gcm simulations cmip6 we can conclude that increase in flooding in bangkok can be expected into the future furthermore we note that the extent of increase reported here may be an underestimate given the expected rise in population in the region and the associated temperature increase this will bring lastly while our assessment focusses on bangkok the analysis technique is of relevance to most urbanizing cities especially those with a rich history of stormwater drainage system development that is being stretched in its ability to contain urban flooding because of the pressures posed by humanity and the climate 8 data availability statement the available data present here

8562,the recent increase in the frequency of urban flooding in bangkok has led to speculation that global warming may be to blame assessing this however is challenging as bangkok represents an ever changing environment with changing storm drainage infrastructure limited flood and precipitation data and a tropical setting that complicates the relationship precipitation extremes exhibit with temperature this study attempts to create a framework to investigate the merits of the above speculation using ground observations of precipitation maxima flood inundation and dew point temperature along with simulations from general circulation models gcms to present multiple lines of evidence to compensate for the weaknesses any individual evidence may have the complexity of flooding in an urban stormwater drainage network is accounted by focussing instead on flood inundation information conditional to the incident dew point temperature which is increasing as a result of warming the assessment identifies a markedly different pattern of change in the east versus the west of the city attributing this to population change in the two parts further complicating the link to global warming application of the developed methodology using the most recent gcm simulations available suggests the increase in flooding is a pattern that can be expected to continue keywords global warming urban flooding maximum rainfalls statistical linkage 1 introduction bangkok has been called the venice of the east due to its complex intervening canal networks that have been developed for over a hundred years making them a part of the city s history and legacy and a key factor responsible for saving resident lives and assets from flood disasters jiarakul 2016 the characteristics of flooding in bangkok however have changed over time from a combination of upstream floods and local storm rainfalls to mostly local floods in the past two decades such change has resulted in the drainage infrastructures being frequently tested to their limits the instability of the drainage systems is getting worse due to urbanization as well as many argue global warming this has motivated the key question in our study which is whether the present inadequacy of the drainage system will continue and worsen given expected increases in air temperatures for the remainder of the century and the corresponding intensification this has been known to bring to extreme storm events arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 hettiarachchi et al 2018 wasko et al 2016 any knowledge of such intensification see for example hettiarachchi et al 2019 can be used to design the infrastructure to better succeed in flood mitigation as well as better plan green spaces within the urban landscape to reduce flood impact in bangkok while our study focuses on bangkok the learnings from this exercise are of relevance to many other established cities with ageing stormwater infrastructure and a changing climate global warming and the associated increase in temperature have been linked to more intense precipitation extremes around the world ipcc 2007 ipcc 2014 this follows from the physical mechanism of an increase in the atmospheric moisture holding capacity for each degree rise in temperature 6 7 per c temperature rise as per the clausius clapeyron cc relationship bao et al 2017 bui et al 2019 hardwick jones et al 2010 lenderink et al 2011 roderick et al 2020 trenberth et al 2003 utsumi et al 2011 with minor changes in average relative humidity held and soden 2006 the increased moisture holding capacity leads to similar increase in the intensity of extreme precipitation trenberth et al 2003 whether this increase in precipitation intensity translates into an increase in flooding remains interestingly an issue of debate given the increased dryness of the upper soil layer the precipitation falls on as well as the impact this has on flood producing mechanisms in large catchments ashish 2013 sharma et al 2018 thanvisitthpon et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2017 wongsa et al 2019 given the limited impact of catchment storage in urban centers such as bangkok one however expects the increase in precipitation to result in an increase in flooding in most urban environments hettiarachchi et al 2018 urban flooding assessment is also complicated by the makeup of the urban drainage system protecting each city there is a tendency for urban reaches to continuously evolve adding segments to the drainage network and converting green spaces to impermeable surfaces over time such has indeed been the case with bangkok that is rapid economic growth of the city has resulted in growths in condominiums commercial areas and population dhakal and shrestha 2016 although bangkok metropolitan administration bma has actively improved the flood drainage network as the city expanded its developed capacity and configuration have not keep pace with the increase in population or the urban character of the city bma 2020 in practice two approaches are available for assessing and modelling change in flooding of an urban catchment the first approach applies observed sensitivity or scaling rate of maximum rainfall with respect to an atmospheric moisture or temperature surrogate to project the flooding into the future alexander et al 2019 hettiarachchi et al 2018 yin et al 2018 the second alternative considers climate model scenarios to predict future flooding using hydrologic models andimuthu et al 2019 le et al 2021 tabari et al 2021 zahmatkesh et al 2015 often with a suitable alternative for correcting systematic biases in simulated precipitation and evapotranspiration li et al 2018 nguyen et al 2020 sharma et al 2021 have reviewed these alternatives as well as the limitations of both approaches and concluded that they are linked as both rely on climate model projections although the former does not use precipitation projections instead relying on the more stable temperature simulations for the future kim et al 2020 we adopt here the first approach given the added complexity of simulating the stormwater runoff based on precipitation projections the difficulty in modelling the changing nature of the stormwater network for the city and also because the analyzed cc rate is rooted in physics and its analysis is robust in this study we examine whether the increase in flooding in bangkok can be attributed to intensification in storm characteristics resulting from increases as characterized by the cc relationship testing this hypothesis is complicated due to the short precipitation record available the high variability precipitation extremes represent wasko and sharma 2014 as well as the changing nature of the urban catchment that makes direct use of changed streamflow extremes problematic to analyses to account for this uncertainty a multiple lines of evidence approach is implemented use being made of the precipitation data available and its variation with temperature as well as flood level information in an urban catchment that is changing over time given the tropical climate bangkok falls in the analysis accounts for the need of an alternate descriptor of atmospheric moisture holding capacity as per roderick et al 2019 and visser et al 2020 surface dew point temperature considered more suitable than traditional surface temperature especially in tropical climates was used ali et al 2018 to address the limitations posed by the changing urban environment and the short data length the hypothesis that precipitation and dew point temperature associated with days on which flooding was recorded is significantly greater is tested an assessment of the data indicates a markedly different pattern of change in both precipitation and dew point temperature in the western versus the eastern part of the city this is then attributed to the different patterns of development and population growth the two areas have seen affirming the complexity associated with changes in flooding in a developed urban environment lastly the study assesses changes in flooding into the future using general circulation model gcm projections with the aim of verifying whether these model simulations are consistent with the data based outcomes reported here as gcm precipitation projections are notoriously unreliable eghdamirad et al 2017 kim et al 2020 only dew point temperature projections are used in this study all these analyses point to a worsening in the flood profile for bangkok a cause of worry to the city and to other similar older urban centers that have developed extensively over time 2 history of flooding in bangkok bangkok the capital of thailand is located at the mouth of the chao phraya river and represents a major tropical urban center in south east asia one that is prone to flooding see the location and extent of flooding in fig 1 the city receives moisture from the south west monsoon and from tropical storms originating in the south china sea and the andaman sea during the rainy season may to october the size of its watershed area is approximately one third of the country 160 000 km2 the chao phraya river starts at the confluence of the ping and nan tributaries at nakhon sawan province then flows south for 372 km through the central plain to bangkok and discharges to the upper gulf of thailand the worst recorded floods e g the great flood of 2011 usually start in october when upstream floods generated by heavy urban storms and spring tidal influxes synchronize such an event generally results in extreme loss of properties and lives with recent overall damages estimated in excess of 50 billion usd world bank 2012 most recorded flood occurrences before 1996 were a result of upstream flooding keetacha 2011 that exceeded the 3500 m3 s carrying capacity of the chao phraya river jica 2018 such upstream fluvial floods took approximately 5 days communication with royal irrigation department to arrive into the city allowing people and the bangkok metropolitan administration bma to be better prepared the typical frequency of such previous floods was once every 3 years on average however the durations of these floods could extend to 1 2 months with maximum depths approximately 1 5 to 2 0 m above the low alluvial plain given the length of these floods and the impact they had on the large population downstream the bma implemented the construction of five polder systems on the west and twelve polder systems on the east of the river as shown in fig 1 see grey and thick solid lines which were completed in 1983 green news 2017 the city used existing infrastructure e g roadway and railway and constructed additional levees as necessary to enclose the polder and equipped it with appurtenant drainage structures pipes water gates and natural and man made cannel networks and pumping stations simultaneously a royal decree by king rama ix initiated construction of levees on the east polders see red solid lines on the east in fig 1 to contain the upstream design flood of 3 500 m3 s i e elevation of levee crest including freeboard 2 5 m msl in 1997 the west polders were noted to be capable of preventing an equivalent flood via levees shown in fig 1 this polder system and the associated levees have been largely successful in securing the city from the arriving upstream floods ever since with local extreme rainfalls being the sole source of flooding post 1997 in the city flooding characteristics have changed from previously high depth events with a long duration to more frequent flash floods with shallower depths less than 0 5 m and durations shorter than 1 day kiguchi et al 2021 saito 2014 to alleviate the negative effect of the flash floods the bma has improved the capacity of existing drainage systems by constructing seven detention tunnels see green arrows in fig 1 table 1 presents location size and timeline of the tunnels available for the drainage systems these have enhanced the system to allow a local flood with maximum intensity of 60 mm hr of 5 min 4hr durations since 2011 bma 2020 however local flooding is noted to be getting worse following an increase in the frequency of flooding leading many to speculate on why this is occurring while many factors may lead to changes in precipitation the consensus is that rising global temperatures will lead to a larger capacity for storing atmospheric moisture resulting in larger more intense downpours when they occur lee et al 2020 investigating whether this is the reason for the apparent increase in flooding in bangkok forms the main motivation for this study 3 methodology the methodology presented in this section has been designed given the challenge of attributing temperature rise as the factor responsible for increase in flooding in bangkok due to the changing nature of the city and the relatively short and spatially variable climate record available the methodology consists of two parts first an approach to assess the change in precipitation extremes with rise in temperature is presented referred to as a scaling or sensitivity estimation next to provide an alternate line of evidence to assess our hypothesis change in the frequency of flooding resulting from temperature rise is assessed use is then made of bayes theorem to formally test the hypothesis that temperature rise is responsible for the increase in flooding in bangkok 3 1 precipitation temperature scaling rooted in thermodynamics the cc relationship explains how the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere increases with increase in surface temperature a greater atmospheric moisture volume in turn is assumed to equate to an increased extreme precipitation volume and intensity the rate of change in atmospheric moisture for each degree centigrade rise in temperature is termed the cc scaling coefficient assuming values between 6 and 7 per degree centigrade temperature rise given extreme precipitation events occur when humidity is high and relatively constant over time the cc scaling coefficient is often ascertained using available precipitation temperature records ali et al 2018 ali and mishra 2017 bao et al 2017 bui et al 2019 golroudbary et al 2019 hettiarachchi et al 2018 lenderink et al 2011 roderick et al 2020 shaw et al 2011 utsumi et al 2011 wasko and sharma 2014 wasko and sharma 2017 wasko et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 while there exist questions on what surrogate of temperature be used or how long the precipitation must last or how long before the precipitation this temperature observation be selected roderick et al 2019 roderick et al 2020 visser et al 2020 a scaling estimate that is reliable can be used to ascertain the change in intensity into the future alexander et al 2019 hettiarachchi et al 2018 the presented method therefore applies the cc relationship to determine the gradient of the extreme precipitation per unit temperature readers are referred to a recent review of scaling methodologies as the basis for assessing change in extreme rainfall characteristics fowler et al 2021 the cc scaling coefficient and its relation to extreme precipitation can be expressed as roderick et al 2019 wasko and sharma 2014 r 2 r 1 1 α δ t d where r 1 and r 2 are the daily maximum precipitation separated by dew point temperature difference δ t d and α is the scaling rate for the maximum precipitation in c it should be noted that use has been made of dew point temperature instead of surface air temperature in the description above given extreme precipitation in tropical cities such as bangkok has a known unstable relationship with surface air temperature as discussed by roderick et al 2019 this follows from a distortion in the temperature atmospheric moisture relationship at high temperatures 29 c and above where more energy is used as sensible heat instead of evaporative heat flux as a result a higher temperature equates to reduced atmospheric moisture creating a negative cc scaling effect contradicting the time trend of increasing rainfall rates that are usually associated use of dew point temperature instead reduces this discrepancy to a large extent and is a recommended option to adopt especially in tropical settings ali and mishra 2017 trenberth and shea 2005 utsumi et al 2011 the scaling coefficient can be estimated using either binning regression as in lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 or quantile regression wasko and sharma 2014 for a given quantile g the relationship can be written as follows log r i β 0 g β 1 g t d i ε i g where β 0 g and β 1 g are the estimates of the intercept log r 1 and the slope log 1 α and ε i g is an associated error with zero mean the parameters β 0 g and β 1 g are estimated by minimizing the error ε i g with the weight of g for underprediction and that 1 g for overprediction roderick et al 2019 that is d β 0 g β 1 g g y i β 0 g β 1 g x i log r i β 0 g β 1 g t d i 1 g y i β 0 g β 1 g x i log r i β 0 g β 1 g t d i in which d β 0 g β 1 g is the cost function to be minimized the estimated slope β 1 g is then inverted to 100 e β 1 g 1 for estimating the scaling rate estimate α a positive rate α implies the percentage of increase in the maximum precipitation r per c rise in the temperature t d 3 2 linking flooding to temperature in a changing urban environment while an increase in precipitation intensity with temperature can be expressed by a positive scaling rate whether this translates to an increase in flooding remains a question even though the likelihood of modulating this increase in precipitation through catchment storage is low as bangkok represents a dense urban catchment and not one where soil storage is significant assessing changes in flood peaks on the other hand is complicated due to continuous development of drainage facilities to keep up with urbanization resulting in a nonstationary precipitation flood relationship a situation that is common to most cities given this nonstationary the direct use of the scaling rationale for floods adopted before in the context of precipitation is not possible to test our hypothesis of flood increase with rising temperatures under these constraints a different approach is adopted instead of focusing on the quantitative increase in flooding the probability of flooding as a result of increase in temperature is ascertained this is done using bayes theorem as follows p f t d p t d f p f p t d where p f t d is the posterior probability of flooding given a particular dew point temperature p t d f is conditional probability of the temperature t d given a flood occurrence p f is prior occurrence probability of the flood across all wet days in the record and p t d is marginal probability of the temperature t d flood f here implies flood inundation instead of its difficulty to specify flow rate equivalent or alternatively the inability of the stormwater network to contain the local flood event the posterior probability p f t d is estimated empirically from the observed data as this probability is conditional on the dew point temperature any increase in this probability with higher temperatures is used as an indication of the hypothesis being supportable 4 observed local data twenty three point location time series of observed climate data precipitation depth surface air temperature and relative humidity and ten at site time sequences of historical flood depth records owned and operated by the department of drainage and sewerage dds bma were considered in this study dew point temperatures were derived using surface air temperature and relative humidity as per lawrence 2005 fig 2 shows a network of chosen climate stations see filled triangles that uniformly distribute over every polder in the city and a group of flood gauging stations representing flooding hotspots in the east of bangkok see blue circles notice that the west is less vulnerable to flooding than the east hence the above data configuration captures flood events adequately the relevant data are available at a 5 min time step and the total lengths of the climate and flood data are 7 years 2011 2017 and 6 years 2012 2017 respectively in the present study the scaling analysis is performed for daily maximum 60 minute precipitation hence we extracted the largest sum of 12 consecutive 5 min rainfalls 1 mm day on a wet day for each station the daily mean of wet day dew point temperature was selected for this application as a good surrogate for atmospheric moisture holding capacity especially for tropical environments ali et al 2018 bui et al 2019 hardwick jones et al 2010 lenderink et al 2011 park and min 2017 the frequency of a flood associated with the maximum precipitation for every location would be ascertained from the number of flooding days if observed depth above roadway in such a flood exceeded 1 cm 5 results 5 1 sensitivity of extreme rainfall to changes in dew point temperature the 90th percentile precipitation scaling rate estimates for daily maximum 60 minute rainfalls across bangkok are presented in fig 3 the red and white circles in the figure stand for positive and negative scaling rates respectively and the size of circle identifies the absolute rate of scaling in percent per c the overall result across the study area shows that the dew point temperature is a stable covariate for the scaling analysis of the maximum rainfalls because the scaling rates of most stations 19 out of 23 stations are positive and consistent with other studies for tropical locations ali et al 2018 ali and mishra 2017 bui et al 2019 roderick et al 2020 in addition the referred figure also demonstrates the scaling rates on the western part of the city are sub cc while the others are mostly super cc an issue that is investigated in greater detail below to examine why the scaling rates at nearby stations across the river are different fig 4 presents results for four representative stations west tlc and rbn east dmg and bkm along with a box plot representing the full distribution of scaling across the two zones there appears to be a consistent and significant difference in the scaling rates in the eastern stations as compared to those in the west a super cc 2 to 60 c scaling rate distribution is noticed in the east whereas the west exhibits sub cc rates 5 2 to 6 0 c given the geographical proximity of these two sets of locations this raises the question whether such differences are a result of site specific variations relating to the relatively short precipitation record available or due to more systemic changes in the precipitation temperature relationship to reduce the scatter in the above results a regionally pooled estimate is next ascertained wasko and sharma 2014 zhang et al 2017 fig 5 shows analysis result for the 90th percentile rate for the area using all observations for both the western and the eastern parts of the city the eastern side gradient is identified to be super cc with a magnitude of 12 0 c with the difference between the two sets deemed statistically significant at the 90 confidence level as per a bootstrap based test it is also notable that the scaling differences are consistent with the areas of flood increase noted in recent decades with inundation in the east being more severe and frequent than for the western part of the city fig 1 why thus should there be a difference between the east and the west given the close proximity of the regions and the lack of any argument supporting a difference in climate a further investigation of the scaling differences in the east and west of bangkok is presented in fig 6 and fig 7 some factors that could contribute to these differences are a variability in the short record used b a distinct difference in either the temperature or the humidity between the two regions and c a distinct pattern of change with time in the precipitation extremes or the covariate used dew point temperature while the first factor variability is important the use of pooled regional data and the fact that the data record spans the same period in both the east and the west gives us confidence that the differences above are more systemic than random it is interesting to note the differences between the humidity and temperature relationship shown in fig 6 temperature tends to be higher in the east compared to the west while the humidity varies similarly we suspect this is a result of the increasing rate of urbanization in the eastern part of bangkok with the urban heat island effect being more enhanced while a higher temperature by itself does not impact the estimated scaling rates a different trend in temperature can this is investigated in fig 7a with the rate of increase in the 90 percentile dew point temperature being greater for the east compared to the west also apparent is an overall increase in temperature greater than the increase expected due to warming again possibly a result of urbanization the reason for this increase appears to be the different population trends the two regions exhibit fig 7b the difference in the population trends arises from the boom of condominiums in the east which has increased migration from the west communication with the bma staff the change in flooding over time is illustrated in fig 8 shown is a series of observed flood days black circle in bangkok and the sequence of historical mean of dew point temperature records red triangle for each year from 2012 to 2017 the increase in flooding although based on a short sample is significant and clear the increase in dew point temperature is also significant and possibly a result of the global warming trend evident in temperature records elsewhere coupled to the added increase in temperatures because of urbanization in the eastern part of the city huong and pathirana 2013 thanvisitthpon et al 2018 it is important to note that the point scaling results here exhibit considerable uncertainty due to the short data record available for this study it is for this reason that we have adopted a less extreme percentile 90th which is more stable that the more extreme percentiles 99th used in related studies for other urban environments alexander et al 2019 hettiarachchi et al 2018 additionally we also substitute space for time in that we assess the consistency of the scaling results over space and identify reasons which may contribute to spatial differences hence while uncertainty is undeniable the assessment presented is robust and represents the best practice one can have in a typical urban environment subject to data limitations and on ground changes 5 2 assessment of change in stormwater flooding given the uncertainties in the precipitation scaling results presented earlier one needs an addition line of evidence to assess whether flooding is being caused due to rising temperatures in the region this is attempted here using flood inundation data via bayes theorem as described in section 3 2 fig 9 shows the probability of flooding given incident dew point temperature for the available data record it is clear that there is an increase in the frequency of flooding with rise in dew point temperature affirming the increase in precipitation that has been noted in earlier results the rate of increase in the frequency of flooding is ascertained using linear regression to give an increasing slope s equal to 1 6 c while this is not directly comparable to the positive scaling rates tabled before it is indicative of an increasing trend if dew point temperature continues to rise 6 can the increasing pattern of flooding be expected to continue a final part of our investigation focusses on whether the changes we have noted in earlier sections would continue into the future to address this question one needs information about change in temperature and population over bangkok this assessment is based on climate model simulations for the shared socio economic pathway ssp 3 and 5 scenarios for five global circulation models gcms from the ipcc cmip6 archive the models considered are ipsl cm6a lr ssp3 ssp5 access cm2 ssp3 ssp5 canesm5 ssp3 ssp5 cnrm cm6 1 ssp3 ssp5 and hadgem3 gc31 ll ssp3 the precipitation flux near surface temperature and relative humidity were assessed via https www wcrp climate org wgcm cmip wgcm cmip6 to create the results shown below the future climate simulation datasets used ranges from 2015 to 2100 it should be noted that while the models do consider changes in population with time added considerations necessary for an urban center such as bangkok may be absent consequently changes in temperature will align more with the overall change due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations globally what additional increase due to the urban heat island effect being absent dew point temperatures for each wet day were ascertained based on the surface temperature and the relative humidity lawrence 2005 the total series of these computed temperatures were then separated into 3 sub sequences i e near future 2020 to 2040 2030 s mid future 2050 to 2070 2060 s and far future 2080 to 2100 2090 s and their medians estimated respectively the median temperature scenarios were later compared with the appropriate temperature for the current period these comparisons indicated that the future temperatures tend to increase as a function of time see table 2 in addition the growth in the flood probability under the impact of the climate change was simply assessed as δ p f t d δ t d s where δ p f t d and δ t d were the changes in the probability of flooding and the dew point temperature between the future and current periods while s is the rate of change in this probability with rise in dew point temperature estimated from fig 9 fig 10 displays relative increases in ssp3 and ssp5 flood probabilities for the east of bangkok during the near mid and far future periods the increases shown in the figure are relative to the current period while the increases are not significantly different between the two scenarios considered what is concerning is the overall pattern of increase for a city that is already experiencing significant damage from flooding 7 conclusions this study focused on the increase in flooding in bangkok in recent times and whether this increase could partially be a result of global warming establishing the link between increasing temperatures and the rise in flooding in a complex changing city environment required a two step assessment first high resolution climate precipitation data from multiple locations in bangkok was used to assess intensification of maximum precipitation as a result of rise in temperature given a limitation of using air temperature for such analysis in tropical regions the assessment was based on using dew point temperature the second part of the method attempted to demonstrate that this increased precipitation intensity was resulting in an increase in flooding here bayes theorem was used to ascertain the conditional probability of flooding given dew point temperature this allowed us to then develop estimates of the change in probability using climate model simulations for the future given bangkok represents a highly urbanized area one would expect increase in precipitation intensity to correspond to a similar increase in flooding as the impact of drying soils due to higher temperatures is small assessing this impact was challenging as the urban system is under constant evolution with changing impervious fractions and hence a nonstationary relationship between precipitation and flow to complicate matters further it was noted that the city is experiencing a growth in population in its eastern zone and a decrease in population in the west leading to markedly different patterns of temperature change and hence estimates of the precipitation scaling rate to circumvent the changes in the urban drainage system data on flood levels that begin to exceed inlet capacity were consequently used to define overall possible flood events the definition further allowed us regionally robust backward linking the flood process with the corresponding dew point temperature phenomenon due to their comparable inlet capacities assessment into the future required the use of climate model simulations along with the relationship between the conditional probability of flooding as a function of dew point temperature established using observed data using current generation gcm simulations cmip6 we can conclude that increase in flooding in bangkok can be expected into the future furthermore we note that the extent of increase reported here may be an underestimate given the expected rise in population in the region and the associated temperature increase this will bring lastly while our assessment focusses on bangkok the analysis technique is of relevance to most urbanizing cities especially those with a rich history of stormwater drainage system development that is being stretched in its ability to contain urban flooding because of the pressures posed by humanity and the climate 8 data availability statement the available data present here

8563,in the study we analyze changes in groundwater pressure observed in several boreholes drilled in and around the mizunami underground research laboratory miu induced by the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquake mw 9 0 the aim of this project is a development of methodology to evaluate systematic fault activity by numerical analysis to reach this goal we investigate the behavior of the fault zones present in the area during the passing of seismic waves we built a simplified hydrogeological model of the miu site and performed a series of fluid flow simulations with tough2 flow numerical code we investigate how changes in permeability along three faults present in the study area the tsukiyoshi fault the hiyoshi fault and the main shaft fault may have influence the groundwater level monitored in boreholes intervals we also test the influence of the cone of depression at the miu site and the hydraulic connectivity between the sedimentary cover and the granite aquifers our results suggest that two main mechanisms are responsible for the observed changes in groundwater pressure 1 crustal dilation induced by the tohoku earthquake causing a groundwater recharge from the sedimentary aquifers to the toki granite aquifer where the sedimentary cover is thick and 2 permeability increase along faults critically oriented for shear reactivation and oriented in the direction of the passing seismic wave in this case the seismic wave increases the shear stress acting on the fault promoting slip and a change in permeability through a mechanism of slip induced dilation faults not critically stressed and faults critically oriented for shear reactivation but oriented perpendicular to the passing seismic wave are not reactivated keywords remote earthquake fault stability groundwater table variation changes in fault permeability tohoku earthquake mizunami underground research laboratory 1 introduction groundwater level changes caused by earthquakes have been investigated since the 1930 s leggette and taylor 1935 blanchard and byerly 1935 since then the response of groundwater levels to earthquakes has been widely observed and documented wang and manga 2010 two types of co and post seismic responses are usually recorded in groundwater levels water level oscillation blanchard and byerly 1935 cooper et al 1965 liu et al 1989 kitagawa et al 2011 and step like rises or falls wakita 1975 quilty and roeloffs 1997 and sustained gradual rises or falls for several days or weeks matsumoto 1992 roeloffs 1998 brodsky et al 2003 wang and chia 2008 niwa et al 2012 the mechanism of the latter type is uncertain several processes were proposed to explain these changes depending on the distance to the earthquake location in the near field of an earthquake water level changes can be explained by poroelastic pressure response to the earthquake s static strain field wakita 1975 quilty and roeloffs 1997 jónsson et al 2003 with groundwater changes proportional to volumetric strain quilty and roeloffs 1997 the water level rises in contraction zones and falls in regions of dilation king et al 1999 lee et al 2002 wang and manga 2010 in the intermediate and far fields earthquake induced groundwater level changes may result from the shaking of the rock by seismic waves and leading to an increase in permeability rojstaczer and wolf 1992 piombo et al 2005 elkhoury et al 2006 geballe et al 2011 shi et al 2013 sun et al 2015 xue et al 2016 this increase may be caused by the removal of gas from the pore space linde et al 1994 matsumoto and roeloffs 2003 the fracturing of solid rocks shi and wang 2016 and the removal of barriers clogging the groundwater flow brodsky et al 2003 these changes in hydraulic properties of the geological rock formations can enhance basin wide fluid transport extending to depths of a few kilometers this can have important implications in particular for geologic disposal of radioactive waste where the performance depends on the integrity of the natural system to contain radionuclides for tens of thousands of years it is thus of crucial interest to nuclear waste authorities that the permeability changes in response to earthquakes can be better understood and eventually be predicted with confidence it is particularly important in a country like japan where faulting is so ubiquitous that repository sites are expected to be co located with a number of fault zones in the study we analyze changes in groundwater pressure observed in several boreholes drilled in and around the mizunami underground research laboratory miu induced by the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquake mw 9 0 these groundwater pressure changes were fully described in niwa et al 2012 they proposed that co seismic changes of groundwater pressure could have resulted from i crustal dilation contraction induced by earthquakes ii permeability increase along local geological structures such as impermeable faults and iii by the complex hydraulic perturbations around the laboratory shafts here we analyze more deeply the behavior of the local faults and the difference in hydraulic properties between the different geological layers through numerical simulations with the fluid flow simulator tough2 pruess et al 2011 the goal is to better characterize the causes of the monitored groundwater pressure to understand the behavior of the fault zones during the propagation of seismic waves due to remote earthquakes 2 hydrogeological context of the mizunami underground research laboratory japan atomic energy agency jaea is pursuing a geoscientific research and development project namely the mizunami underground research laboratory miu project in crystalline rock environment in order to construct scientific and technological basis for the geological disposal of high level radioactive waste the geology of the site is as shortly as follows the basement granite called the toki granite late cretaceous and the overlying mizunami group miocene 0 to 300 m in thickness fig 1 c in the frame of multidisciplinary research conducted in and around the miu groundwater pressures and levels were continuously recorded in several boreholes drilled from ground surface in and around the miu fig 1 all the boreholes for groundwater monitoring were drilled into the toki granite a late cretaceous intrusion depth of these boreholes ranges approximately from 200 m to 1300 m karino et al 2011 multiple piezometers were installed in each boreholes except dh 15 and miz 1 between inflatable packers in dh 15 and miz 1 a hydraulic pressure transducer was inserted in a standpipe connected to each measurement interval bounded by packers all measurement intervals except shallower parts of dh 15 msb 1 and msb 3 are in the granite under in situ groundwater pressure conditions the shallower parts of dh 15 are in the basal conglomerate lying on the unconformity between the mizunami group and toki granite and the shallower parts of msb 1 and msb 3 are in the miocene sedimentary rocks of the mizunami group see niwa et al 2012 it should be noted that some very strange hydraulic head behavior can be caused by packer systems especially when multiple different tests are done by packing off different intervals in a borehole smart 1999 however several arguments suggest that the observed changes in groundwater pressure presented in this study are not artifact 1 the changes started with the arrival of the seismic waves generated by the tohoku earthquake and 2 all the multiple piezometers installed in each boreholes shown the exact same hydraulic behavior excepted if the well intersected a major fault zone and in this case two distinct behaviors can be observed in the hanging and in the footwall these multiple piezometers were installed to characterize i the regional groundwater flow which is an important factor in the assessment of contaminant migration in deep underground and ii changes in the groundwater environment caused by excavation of shafts and galleries at the miu site in 2005 ohyama et al 2005 calculated the distribution of hydraulic gradient in the miu area from groundwater flow simulation fig 1d the authors show that the principal direction of groundwater flow in the area is from north east to south west and that the groundwater flow is strongly affected by the tsukiyoshi fault which is the most significant structure in the area indeed the distribution of the hydraulic gradient is significantly different to north and south of the tsukiyoshi fault which acts as a low permeability barrier on the groundwater flow fig 1d the hiyoshi fault and the shab fault also seem to act as low permeability barriers on the groundwater flow with a higher hydraulic gradient on the west of the hiyoshi fault and on the east of the shab fault inversely the main shaft fault seems not to have a significant influence on the regional hydraulic gradient then the mw 9 0 tohoku earthquake occurred off the pacific coast on 11 march 2011 with observed changes in groundwater pressure in 15 boreholes drilled in and around the miu fig 1 3 changes in groundwater pressure induced by the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquake niwa et al 2012 present in details the water pressure responses observed in 15 boreholes around the miu site caused by the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquake here we pay special attention to the monitored total head evolution relative to the main faults present in the area the tsukiyoshi fault and the hiyoshi fault we can observe that north of the tsukiyoshi fault the tohoku earthquake caused a sharp drop in total head followed by a recovery period total head did not recover to its pre earthquake state even after six months in boreholes located west of the hiyoshi fault boreholes dh 7 and dh 9 fig 2 a east of the hiyoshi fault on the other hand the total head began to recover shortly after the earthquake and eventually reached a higher level after a few months boreholes dh 11 and dh 13 fig 2b south of the tsukiyoshi fault two behaviors were observed in the monitoring intervals present in the granite formation at the shobasama site the tohoku earthquake also caused a sharp drop in total head in boreholes followed by a recovery period of for several months boreholes an 1 an 3 miu 2 miu 3 and miu 4 fig 2c inversely at the miu site the earthquake causes a sharp increase in total heads boreholes dh 2 dh 15 msb 3 05me06 and miz 1 fig 2d 4 fluid flow simulation we performed numerical simulations with the fluid flow simulator tough2 pruess et al 2011 tough2 is a general purpose numerical simulation program for multi dimensional fluid and heat flows of multiphase multicomponent fluid mixtures in porous and fractured media tough2 solves mass and energy balance equations that describe fluid and heat flow in general multiphase multicomponent systems fluid advection is described with a multiphase extension of darcy s law in addition there is diffusive mass transport in all phases heat flow occurs by conduction and convection the latter including sensible as well as latent heat effects the description of thermodynamic conditions is based on the assumption of local equilibrium of all phases fluid and formation parameters can be arbitrary nonlinear functions of the primary thermodynamic variables chief application areas are in geothermal reservoir engineering nuclear waste isolation studies environmental assessment and remediation and flow and transport in variably saturated media and aquifers in this study we used tough2 to better understand the role and the behavior of the different fault zones present in the area on the observed groundwater pressure changes we built a simplified geological model of the study area and performed a series of simulations to investigate 1 changes in permeability along the tsukiyoshi fault the hiyoshi fault and the main shaft fault 2 the influence of the shaft excavation and 3 the hydraulic connectivity between the sedimentary cover and the underlying granite 4 1 model set up we used the software package groundwater modeling system gms aquaveo 2013 to build a 3d geological model the grid was created using the grid approach in gms to generate a 3d structured voronoi grid the grid convergence was reached and the grid was then linked to tough2 gms is a graphical user environment which consists of a graphical user interface the gms program providing tools for model conceptualization mesh and grid generation fault zones were also represented in these simulations albeit simplified to follow the grid orientations the 3d model is a simplified geological model it was built by using the map of the elevation of unconformity between toki granite and mizunami group determined by an electoromagnetic survey jaea research 2010 067 final report on the surface based investigation phase phase i fig 3 a geological logging from the borehole investigations at the regional hydrogeological scale at the miu site and at the shobasama site jaea research 2010 067 final report on the surface based investigation phase phase i the land digital elevation model fig 3b based on these subsurface horizons and on borehole data we used gms to construct a regional three dimensional geologic model including the miu site and the shobasama site our model includes from the top down the mizunami group that forms the sedimentary cover the upper fractured granite and the toki granite that is assumed to extend deep downward we then map this model onto a rectangular grid for use with the tough2 numerical simulator fig 3d the numerical model extends vertically from 200 to 900 m elevation relative to sea level and 4650 4300 m horizontally finally the tsukiyoshi fault and the main shaft fault are represented by attributing different hydraulic properties to a set of cells in our simulations the tsukiyoshi fault is oriented n090 70 s the hiyoshi fault is oriented n030 80 e and the main shaft fault is oriented n135 90 e 4 2 initial boundary conditions and initial parameters first we simulated a hydraulic gradient with a difference of 200 m in water level between the northwest and the southeast by imposing a constant fluid pressure on the northwest and the southeast corners of our model these two cells have open boundaries however the other vertical boundaries have a no flow boundaries conditions fig 3d the bottom and top boundaries have no flow and open flow boundaries conditions respectively for multiphase flow we also imposed a linear hydrostatic pressure gradient of 9 81 mpa km ρ g h with ρ density of the fluid g acceleration of gravity and h depth with depth and a constant temperature of 15 c these initial conditions are established through steady state and multiphase flow simulations until a steady state was reached fig 4 a in this case we use the permeability and porosity for the different geological unit established through field investigation and numerical simulations table 1 jaea research 2010 067 final report on the surface based investigation phase phase i the faults have a lower permeability than the other geological formations and act as low permeable barriers between the north and the south fault compartments then we simulated groundwater extraction at the miu site to simulate the influence of the shaft excavation fig 4b indeed the boreholes near the miu site have shown continuous drawdown since the shaft excavations started for example total heads have decreased approximately 35 m in msb 1 and 87 m in msb 3 niwa et al 2012 in our simulation we imposed a pumping rate of 6 m3 s during three months to simulate a pressure drop of 0 5 mpa at the miu site which correspond to a decrease in total head of 50 m roughly in the range of the measured total head dropped 4 3 simulation of crustal dilation caused by the tohoku earthquake niwa et al 2012 calculated the volumetric strain changes at a depth of 1 km in eastern japan due to the tohoku earthquake using a dislocation analysis based on the theory of okada 1992 they found approximately an amount of 2 10 7 dilation strain around the miu site then they calculated the theoretical amount of groundwater level changes due to this amount of crustal dilation 2 10 7 associated with the tohoku earthquake and the tidal response in each borehole around the miu site in this way niwa et al 2012 found consistent results between the calculated and observed single day drawdowns in the boreholes more than 1 km away from the miu site associated with the tohoku earthquake this means that crustal dilation was one of the principal phenomenon responsible for the monitored changes in groundwater level to simulate this crustal dilation associated with the tohoku earthquake we increased the porosity in each formation see table 1 porosity after quake and the gas saturation from 0 to 5 in the water saturated formations during the first time step of the fluid flow simulations the gas saturation was increased because in tough2 if we increase the porosity and keep the liquid saturation constant here 100 more water will be added to our model this behavior is unrealistic indeed when a crack is created it doesn t lead to the creation of groundwater so to avoid this and to simulate crustal dilation by the sudden appearance of new unsaturated porous space we slightly increased the gas saturation when we increased the porosity in this way no additional water was added to the model and we were able to simulate groundwater flow from the saturated porous space to the newly created unsaturated porous space resulting in a drop in the water table as observed in the field 4 4 influence of the changes in faults permeability it is well known that fault zone are thick corridors with a complex structure that is classically described as composed of 1 a single or multiple core zone and 2 a fractured damage zone chester et al 1993 typically the fault core permeability is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the host rock and may act as an impermeable barrier to fluid flow whereas in the damage zone the high fracture density make the damage zone more permeable than the host rock however all the complexity of fault zones has to be simplified in our regional flow model where the fault zones thickness are represented by only one cell in our study we chose to emphasis the role of the fault core and its impermeable behavior visible at the regional scale for this reason we chose to represent the fault zone with an initial very low isotropic permeability and then with an higher isotropic permeability to simulate to allow fluid flow between the two fault compartments so we performed three fluid flow simulations in which the isotropic permeability of one of the faults was increased by two orders of magnitude up to 10 13 m2 considering or not the presence of a depression cone at the miu site we calculated changes in total head at six control points cp located where observation wells are approximately located in the field to compare monitored and calculated changes in total head north of the tsukiyoshi fault we observe that an increase in permeability along the hiyoshi fault causes a diffusion of the hydraulic gradient from the west to the east of the hiyoshi fault this hydraulic diffusion results in a calculated drop in water level to the west see cp dh9 on fig 5 a and an increase to the east see cp dh11 and cp dh13 on fig 5a this behavior is similar to the field observations see dh9 dh11 and dh13 on fig 2a and 2b inversely an increase in permeability along the tsukiyoshi fault or along the main shaft fault fail to reproduce the observed data indeed an increase in permeability along the tsukiyoshi fault causes the diffusion of the hydraulic gradient from the north to the south compartments of the tsukiyoshi fault and therefore results in a drop in total head everywhere in the north compartment fig 5b whereas an increase in permeability of main shaft fault causes a slight decrease in total head at cp dh11 and cp dh13 due to the diffusion of the hydraulic gradient fig 5c south of the tsukiyoshi fault at the shobasama site we observed an increase in permeability along the tsukiyoshi fault causes a diffusion of the hydraulic gradient from the north to the south leading to an increase in total head in the south compartment fig 5e so to simulate the slow recovery observed at the shobasama site following the tohoku earthquake the permeability of the tsukiyoshi fault has to stay unchanged fig 5d or 5f the presence of a depression cone at the miu site has little effect on the calculated pressure level at the shobasama site compare fig 5d e f with fig 5g h i south of the tsukiyoshi fault at the miu site we observed an increase in total head calculated at all the control points cp dh2 cp dh15 and cp miz1 located near the top of the toki granite 240 m bsl in all the cases with or without the presence of a depression cone fig 5j to 5o a small drop in total head calculated in deeper control point cp msb1 z 840 m bsl calculated with or without a depression cone when the permeability of the tsukiyoshi fault is unchanged fig 5j 5 l 5 m and 5o 4 5 sensitivity analysis on sedimentary cover permeability the toki granite is overlaid by sedimentary rocks that are aquifers containing large volumes of groundwater to investigate how the hydraulic connectivity between these aquifers and the toki granite aquifer may have influenced the monitored changes in groundwater pressure we conducted a new set of simulations where the vertical permeability in the sedimentary cover and in the altered zone were decreased down to 10 16 m2 as previously we performed three fluid flow simulations where the permeability of one of the three faults was increased by two orders of magnitude up to 10 13 m2 here we did not simulate a depression cone at the miu site results are shown in fig 6 these simulations reveal a low influence of the vertical groundwater flow north of the tsukiyoshi fault on the calculated changes in groundwater pressure and a higher influence in the south of the tsukiyoshi fault indeed north of the tsukiyoshi fault the calculated total head fig 6a to 6c are very similar to those calculated with a higher vertical permeability in the formations above the toki granite fig 5a to 5c at the shobasama site in case of no change in permeability along the tsukiyoshi fault the recovery period is less than 200 days fig 5g and 5i and more than a year fig 6d and 6f in case of a high and lower vertical permeability in the upper formations respectively at the miu site despite the lower vertical permeability in the formations above the toki granite we still calculated a small increase in total head 2 to 3 time smaller than in case of a higher vertical permeability at all the control points cp dh2 cp dh 15 and cp miz1 located near the top of the toki granite fig 6g to 6 h also the higher the vertical permeability is the faster the groundwater level increase in the deepest part of the granite see cp msb1 on fig 5m and 6 g 5 discussion 5 1 causes of changes in groundwater pressure to understand the possible causes of the changes in groundwater pressure monitored in and around the miu site due to the remote tohoku earthquake we have performed a series of fluid flow simulations to investigate the behavior of three faults present in the area and the role of the aquifers present in the sedimentary cover our study indicates that the sudden increase in porosity within the rock formations due to crustal dilation led to a vertical groundwater flow from the upper aquifers in the sedimentary cover to the deeper toki granite this is of particular importance at the miu site where the sedimentary cover is thick between 150 to 300 m in this area the general increase in total head seems to be mostly due to a flux of groundwater coming from the upper aquifers indeed neither the presence of a depression cone nor an increase in permeability along the faults could explained the large increase in the monitored and calculated total head this groundwater recharge from the upper aquifers to the toki granite is smaller in areas with a thin sedimentary cover between 0 to 50 m as observed at the shobasama site and north of the tsukiyoshi fault in these cases changes in groundwater pressure following the earthquake seems to be influenced by changes in permeability along low permeability faults our study further indicates that only the permeability of the hiyoshi fault increased due to the tohoku earthquake indeed to reproduce the variations in total head monitored north of the tsuhyioshi fault and at the shobasama site the permeability along hiyoshi fault has to be increased whereas the permeability along the tsukiyoshi fault has to stay constant as stated previously there is no clear evidence that the changes in total head monitored at the miu site were caused by an increase in permeability along the main shaft fault on the contrary the observed total head across the main shaft fault fig 2 e suggest the fault acted as a barrier to vertical groundwater flow an increase in total head was observed in the upper part of the fault zone mostly due to a groundwater recharge from the upper formation fig 2 e intervals 7 and 8 and a decrease in the deeper part of the fault zone mostly due to an impermeable barrier within the fault zone fig 2 e intervals 9 to 11 5 2 causes of changes in fault permeability several explanations have been proposed to explain earthquake induced changes in permeability along a fault in the intermediate and far field of an earthquake the removal of gas from the pore space linde et al 1994 matsumoto and roeloffs 2003 the fracturing of solid rocks shi and wang 2016 and the removal of barriers clogging the groundwater flow brodsky et al 2003 may cause such permeability variations if one of these phenomena had occurred during the passing of seismic waves associated with the tohoku earthquake it is hard to understand why it occurred only along the hiyoshi fault and not along the other faults there are also a large number of observations showing that surface waves from remote earthquakes may trigger a slip along a pre existing fault freed 2005 and the fault reactivation could change its permeability to see if the tohoku earthquake was likely to induce slip along the faults in the vicinity of the miu site we used the mohr coulomb criterion jaeger et al 2007 it provides an approximation of the shear and normal stresses acting on a fault based principally on its orientation and the far field stresses for this reason the mohr coulomb criterion is the most commonly used criterion to describe fault stability in response to changes in shear stress and or effective normal stress at the miu site at 500 m depth the stress tensor was estimated to be a strike slip faulting regime with σ1 21 3 mpa σ2 12 7 mpa and σ3 11 7 mpa with maximum principal stress oriented nnw sse jaea research 2010 067 final report on the surface based investigation phase phase i under these conditions we calculated the normal and shear stresses acting on the hiyoshi fault n030 80e the main shaft fault 135 90 n and on the three fault segments composing the tsukiyoshi fault from west to east n080 70s n110 70s and n050 70s see fig 1 it appears that the hiyoshi fault and the main shaft fault are both critically oriented for shear reactivation fig 7 however our simulation results indicates that changes in permeability occurred only along the hiyoshi fault this different behavior between the two faults supposedly critically stressed may be caused by their different orientation and by the direction of the passing seismic waves generated by the tohoku earthquake indeed the seismic waves associated with the tohoku earthquake propagated at the miu site from the northeast to the southwest fig 1a in case of the main shaft fault the seismic waves propagated almost perpendicular to the fault potentially increasing the fault normal stress on the fault inversely in case of the hiyoshi fault the seismic waves propagated almost parallel to the fault potentially increasing the shear stress acting on the fault and favoring its reactivation northeast southwest this last observation suggests the response of faults to dynamic loading by remote seismic waves depends on how favorably oriented towards stress they are and on the direction of propagation of seismic waves which is in accordance with previous work hill 2008 for example at the miu site seismic wave propagating in the northeast southwest direction may trigger slip only along faults oriented n030 e g the hiyoshi fault whereas seismic wave propagating in the northwest southeast direction may trigger slip only along faults oriented n135 e g main shaft fault we can also suppose that seismic wave propagating in the north south or in the east west directions do not trigger any slip along these two fault families 6 conclusion we analyzed changes in groundwater pressure observed in several boreholes located in and around the mizunami underground research laboratory miu induced by the 2011 tohoku earthquake mw 9 0 to understand the behavior of the fault zones during the passing of seismic waves our results suggest that two main mechanisms are responsible for the observed changes in groundwater pressure 1 crustal dilation induced by the tohoku earthquake causing a groundwater recharge from the upper aquifers to the toki granite in area where the sedimentary cover is thick and 2 permeability increase along faults critically oriented for shear reactivation and oriented in the direction of the passing seismic wave in this case the seismic wave increases the shear stress acting on the fault promoting slip and a change in permeability on the contrary faults not critically stressed and faults critically oriented for shear reactivation but oriented

8563,in the study we analyze changes in groundwater pressure observed in several boreholes drilled in and around the mizunami underground research laboratory miu induced by the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquake mw 9 0 the aim of this project is a development of methodology to evaluate systematic fault activity by numerical analysis to reach this goal we investigate the behavior of the fault zones present in the area during the passing of seismic waves we built a simplified hydrogeological model of the miu site and performed a series of fluid flow simulations with tough2 flow numerical code we investigate how changes in permeability along three faults present in the study area the tsukiyoshi fault the hiyoshi fault and the main shaft fault may have influence the groundwater level monitored in boreholes intervals we also test the influence of the cone of depression at the miu site and the hydraulic connectivity between the sedimentary cover and the granite aquifers our results suggest that two main mechanisms are responsible for the observed changes in groundwater pressure 1 crustal dilation induced by the tohoku earthquake causing a groundwater recharge from the sedimentary aquifers to the toki granite aquifer where the sedimentary cover is thick and 2 permeability increase along faults critically oriented for shear reactivation and oriented in the direction of the passing seismic wave in this case the seismic wave increases the shear stress acting on the fault promoting slip and a change in permeability through a mechanism of slip induced dilation faults not critically stressed and faults critically oriented for shear reactivation but oriented perpendicular to the passing seismic wave are not reactivated keywords remote earthquake fault stability groundwater table variation changes in fault permeability tohoku earthquake mizunami underground research laboratory 1 introduction groundwater level changes caused by earthquakes have been investigated since the 1930 s leggette and taylor 1935 blanchard and byerly 1935 since then the response of groundwater levels to earthquakes has been widely observed and documented wang and manga 2010 two types of co and post seismic responses are usually recorded in groundwater levels water level oscillation blanchard and byerly 1935 cooper et al 1965 liu et al 1989 kitagawa et al 2011 and step like rises or falls wakita 1975 quilty and roeloffs 1997 and sustained gradual rises or falls for several days or weeks matsumoto 1992 roeloffs 1998 brodsky et al 2003 wang and chia 2008 niwa et al 2012 the mechanism of the latter type is uncertain several processes were proposed to explain these changes depending on the distance to the earthquake location in the near field of an earthquake water level changes can be explained by poroelastic pressure response to the earthquake s static strain field wakita 1975 quilty and roeloffs 1997 jónsson et al 2003 with groundwater changes proportional to volumetric strain quilty and roeloffs 1997 the water level rises in contraction zones and falls in regions of dilation king et al 1999 lee et al 2002 wang and manga 2010 in the intermediate and far fields earthquake induced groundwater level changes may result from the shaking of the rock by seismic waves and leading to an increase in permeability rojstaczer and wolf 1992 piombo et al 2005 elkhoury et al 2006 geballe et al 2011 shi et al 2013 sun et al 2015 xue et al 2016 this increase may be caused by the removal of gas from the pore space linde et al 1994 matsumoto and roeloffs 2003 the fracturing of solid rocks shi and wang 2016 and the removal of barriers clogging the groundwater flow brodsky et al 2003 these changes in hydraulic properties of the geological rock formations can enhance basin wide fluid transport extending to depths of a few kilometers this can have important implications in particular for geologic disposal of radioactive waste where the performance depends on the integrity of the natural system to contain radionuclides for tens of thousands of years it is thus of crucial interest to nuclear waste authorities that the permeability changes in response to earthquakes can be better understood and eventually be predicted with confidence it is particularly important in a country like japan where faulting is so ubiquitous that repository sites are expected to be co located with a number of fault zones in the study we analyze changes in groundwater pressure observed in several boreholes drilled in and around the mizunami underground research laboratory miu induced by the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquake mw 9 0 these groundwater pressure changes were fully described in niwa et al 2012 they proposed that co seismic changes of groundwater pressure could have resulted from i crustal dilation contraction induced by earthquakes ii permeability increase along local geological structures such as impermeable faults and iii by the complex hydraulic perturbations around the laboratory shafts here we analyze more deeply the behavior of the local faults and the difference in hydraulic properties between the different geological layers through numerical simulations with the fluid flow simulator tough2 pruess et al 2011 the goal is to better characterize the causes of the monitored groundwater pressure to understand the behavior of the fault zones during the propagation of seismic waves due to remote earthquakes 2 hydrogeological context of the mizunami underground research laboratory japan atomic energy agency jaea is pursuing a geoscientific research and development project namely the mizunami underground research laboratory miu project in crystalline rock environment in order to construct scientific and technological basis for the geological disposal of high level radioactive waste the geology of the site is as shortly as follows the basement granite called the toki granite late cretaceous and the overlying mizunami group miocene 0 to 300 m in thickness fig 1 c in the frame of multidisciplinary research conducted in and around the miu groundwater pressures and levels were continuously recorded in several boreholes drilled from ground surface in and around the miu fig 1 all the boreholes for groundwater monitoring were drilled into the toki granite a late cretaceous intrusion depth of these boreholes ranges approximately from 200 m to 1300 m karino et al 2011 multiple piezometers were installed in each boreholes except dh 15 and miz 1 between inflatable packers in dh 15 and miz 1 a hydraulic pressure transducer was inserted in a standpipe connected to each measurement interval bounded by packers all measurement intervals except shallower parts of dh 15 msb 1 and msb 3 are in the granite under in situ groundwater pressure conditions the shallower parts of dh 15 are in the basal conglomerate lying on the unconformity between the mizunami group and toki granite and the shallower parts of msb 1 and msb 3 are in the miocene sedimentary rocks of the mizunami group see niwa et al 2012 it should be noted that some very strange hydraulic head behavior can be caused by packer systems especially when multiple different tests are done by packing off different intervals in a borehole smart 1999 however several arguments suggest that the observed changes in groundwater pressure presented in this study are not artifact 1 the changes started with the arrival of the seismic waves generated by the tohoku earthquake and 2 all the multiple piezometers installed in each boreholes shown the exact same hydraulic behavior excepted if the well intersected a major fault zone and in this case two distinct behaviors can be observed in the hanging and in the footwall these multiple piezometers were installed to characterize i the regional groundwater flow which is an important factor in the assessment of contaminant migration in deep underground and ii changes in the groundwater environment caused by excavation of shafts and galleries at the miu site in 2005 ohyama et al 2005 calculated the distribution of hydraulic gradient in the miu area from groundwater flow simulation fig 1d the authors show that the principal direction of groundwater flow in the area is from north east to south west and that the groundwater flow is strongly affected by the tsukiyoshi fault which is the most significant structure in the area indeed the distribution of the hydraulic gradient is significantly different to north and south of the tsukiyoshi fault which acts as a low permeability barrier on the groundwater flow fig 1d the hiyoshi fault and the shab fault also seem to act as low permeability barriers on the groundwater flow with a higher hydraulic gradient on the west of the hiyoshi fault and on the east of the shab fault inversely the main shaft fault seems not to have a significant influence on the regional hydraulic gradient then the mw 9 0 tohoku earthquake occurred off the pacific coast on 11 march 2011 with observed changes in groundwater pressure in 15 boreholes drilled in and around the miu fig 1 3 changes in groundwater pressure induced by the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquake niwa et al 2012 present in details the water pressure responses observed in 15 boreholes around the miu site caused by the 2011 off the pacific coast of tohoku earthquake here we pay special attention to the monitored total head evolution relative to the main faults present in the area the tsukiyoshi fault and the hiyoshi fault we can observe that north of the tsukiyoshi fault the tohoku earthquake caused a sharp drop in total head followed by a recovery period total head did not recover to its pre earthquake state even after six months in boreholes located west of the hiyoshi fault boreholes dh 7 and dh 9 fig 2 a east of the hiyoshi fault on the other hand the total head began to recover shortly after the earthquake and eventually reached a higher level after a few months boreholes dh 11 and dh 13 fig 2b south of the tsukiyoshi fault two behaviors were observed in the monitoring intervals present in the granite formation at the shobasama site the tohoku earthquake also caused a sharp drop in total head in boreholes followed by a recovery period of for several months boreholes

performed numerical simulations with the fluid flow simulator tough2 pruess et al 2011 tough2 is a general purpose numerical simulation program for multi dimensional fluid and heat flows of multiphase multicomponent fluid mixtures in porous and fractured media tough2 solves mass and energy balance equations that describe fluid and heat flow in general multiphase multicomponent systems fluid advection is described with a multiphase extension of darcy s law in addition there is diffusive mass transport in all phases heat flow occurs by conduction and convection the latter including sensible as well as latent heat effects the description of thermodynamic conditions is based on the assumption of local equilibrium of all phases fluid and formation parameters can be arbitrary nonlinear functions of the primary thermodynamic variables chief application areas are in geothermal reservoir engineering nuclear waste isolation studies environmental assessment and remediation and flow and transport in variably saturated media and aquifers in this study we used tough2 to better understand the role and the behavior of the different fault zones present in the area on the observed groundwater pressure changes we built a simplified geological model of the study area and performed a series of simulations to investigate 1 changes in permeability along the tsukiyoshi fault the hiyoshi fault and the main shaft fault 2 the influence of the shaft excavation and 3 the hydraulic connectivity between the sedimentary cover and the underlying granite 4 1 model set up we used the software package groundwater modeling system gms aquaveo 2013 to build a 3d geological model the grid was created using the grid approach in gms to generate a 3d structured voronoi grid the grid convergence was reached and the grid was then linked to tough2 gms is a graphical user environment which consists of a graphical user interface the gms program providing tools for model conceptualization mesh and grid generation fault zones were also represented in these simulations albeit simplified to follow the grid orientations the 3d model is a simplified geological model it was built by using the map of the elevation of unconformity between toki granite and mizunami group determined by an electoromagnetic survey jaea research 2010 067 final report on the surface based investigation phase phase i fig 3 a geological logging from the borehole investigations at the regional hydrogeological scale at the miu site and at the shobasama site jaea research 2010 067 final report on the surface based investigation phase phase i the land digital elevation model fig 3b based on these subsurface horizons and on borehole data we used gms to construct a regional three dimensional geologic model including the miu site and the shobasama site our model includes from the top down the mizunami group that forms the sedimentary cover the upper fractured granite and the toki granite that is assumed to extend deep downward we then map this model onto a rectangular grid for use with the tough2 numerical simulator fig 3d the numerical model extends vertically from 200 to 900 m elevation relative to sea level and 4650 4300 m horizontally finally the tsukiyoshi fault and the main shaft fault are represented by attributing different hydraulic properties to a set of cells in our simulations the tsukiyoshi fault is oriented n090 70 s the hiyoshi fault is oriented n030 80 e and the main shaft fault is oriented n135 90 e 4 2 initial boundary conditions and initial parameters first we simulated a hydraulic gradient with a difference of 200 m in water level between the northwest and the southeast by imposing a constant fluid pressure on the northwest and the southeast corners of our model these two cells have open boundaries however the other vertical boundaries have a no flow boundaries conditions fig 3d the bottom and top boundaries have no flow and open flow boundaries conditions respectively for multiphase flow we also imposed a linear hydrostatic pressure gradient of 9 81 mpa km ρ g h with ρ density of the fluid g acceleration of gravity and h depth with depth and a constant temperature of 15 c these initial conditions are established through steady state and multiphase flow simulations until a steady state was reached fig 4 a in this case we use the permeability and porosity for the different geological unit established through field investigation and numerical simulations table 1 jaea research 2010 067 final report on the surface based investigation phase phase i the faults have a lower permeability than the other geological formations and act as low permeable barriers between the north and the south fault compartments then we simulated groundwater extraction at the miu site to simulate the influence of the shaft excavation fig 4b indeed the boreholes near the miu site have shown continuous drawdown since the shaft excavations started for example total heads have decreased approximately 35 m in msb 1 and 87 m in msb 3 niwa et al 2012 in our simulation we imposed a pumping rate of 6 m3 s during three months to simulate a pressure drop of 0 5 mpa at the miu site which correspond to a decrease in total head of 50 m roughly in the range of the measured total head dropped 4 3 simulation of crustal dilation caused by the tohoku earthquake niwa et al 2012 calculated the volumetric strain changes at a depth of 1 km in eastern japan due to the tohoku earthquake using a dislocation analysis based on the theory of okada 1992 they found approximately an amount of 2 10 7 dilation strain around the miu site then they calculated the theoretical amount of groundwater level changes due to this amount of crustal dilation 2 10 7 associated with the tohoku earthquake and the tidal response in each borehole around the miu site in this way niwa et al 2012 found consistent results between the calculated and observed single day drawdowns in the boreholes more than 1 km away from the miu site associated with the tohoku earthquake this means that crustal dilation was one of the principal phenomenon responsible for the monitored changes in groundwater level to simulate this crustal dilation associated with the tohoku earthquake we increased the porosity in each formation see table 1 porosity after quake and the gas saturation from 0 to 5 in the water saturated formations during the first time step of the fluid flow simulations the gas saturation was increased because in tough2 if we increase the porosity and keep the liquid saturation constant here 100 more water will be added to our model this behavior is unrealistic indeed when a crack is created it doesn t lead to the creation of groundwater so to avoid this and to simulate crustal dilation by the sudden appearance of new unsaturated porous space we slightly increased the gas saturation when we increased the porosity in this way no additional water was added to the model and we were able to simulate groundwater flow from the saturated porous space to the newly created unsaturated porous space resulting in a drop in the water table as observed in the field 4 4 influence of the changes in faults permeability it is well known that fault zone are thick corridors with a complex structure that is classically described as composed of 1 a single or multiple core zone and 2 a fractured damage zone chester et al 1993 typically the fault core permeability is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the host rock and may act as an impermeable barrier to fluid flow whereas in the damage zone the high fracture density make the damage zone more permeable than the host rock however all the complexity of fault zones has to be simplified in our regional flow model where the fault zones thickness are represented by only one cell in our study we chose to emphasis the role of the fault core and its impermeable behavior visible at the regional scale for this reason we chose to represent the fault zone with an initial very low isotropic permeability and then with an higher isotropic permeability to simulate to allow fluid flow between the two fault compartments so we performed three fluid flow simulations in which the isotropic permeability of one of the faults was increased by two orders of magnitude up to 10 13 m2 considering or not the presence of a depression cone at the miu site we calculated changes in total head at six control points cp located where observation wells are approximately located in the field to compare monitored and calculated changes in total head north of the tsukiyoshi fault we observe that an increase in permeability along the hiyoshi fault causes a diffusion of the hydraulic gradient from the west to the east of the hiyoshi fault this hydraulic diffusion results in a calculated drop in water level to the west see cp dh9 on fig 5 a and an increase to the east see cp dh11 and cp dh13 on fig 5a this behavior is similar to the field observations see dh9 dh11 and dh13 on fig 2a and 2b inversely an increase in permeability along the tsukiyoshi fault or along the main shaft fault fail to reproduce the observed data indeed an increase in permeability along the tsukiyoshi fault causes the diffusion of the hydraulic gradient from the north to the south compartments of the tsukiyoshi fault and therefore results in a drop in total head everywhere in the north compartment fig 5b whereas an increase in permeability of main shaft fault causes a slight decrease in total head at cp dh11 and cp dh13 due to the diffusion of the hydraulic gradient fig 5c south of the tsukiyoshi fault at the shobasama site we observed an increase in permeability along the tsukiyoshi fault causes a diffusion of the hydraulic gradient from the north to the south leading to an increase in total head in the south compartment fig 5e so to simulate the slow recovery observed at the shobasama site following the tohoku earthquake the permeability of the tsukiyoshi fault has to stay unchanged fig 5d or 5f the presence of a depression cone at the miu site has little effect on the calculated pressure level at the shobasama site compare fig 5d e f with fig 5g h i south of the tsukiyoshi fault at the miu site we observed an increase in total head calculated at all the control points cp dh2 cp dh15 and cp miz1 located near the top of the toki granite 240 m bsl in all the cases with or without the presence of a depression cone fig 5j to 5o a small drop in total head calculated in deeper control point cp msb1 z 840 m bsl calculated with or without a depression cone when the permeability of the tsukiyoshi fault is unchanged fig 5j 5 l 5 m and 5o 4 5 sensitivity analysis on sedimentary cover permeability the toki granite is overlaid by sedimentary rocks that are aquifers containing large volumes of groundwater to investigate how the hydraulic connectivity between these aquifers and the toki granite aquifer may have influenced the monitored changes in groundwater pressure we conducted a new set of simulations where the vertical permeability in the sedimentary cover and in the altered zone were decreased down to 10 16 m2 as previously we performed three fluid flow simulations where the permeability of one of the three faults was increased by two orders of magnitude up to 10 13 m2 here we did not simulate a depression cone at the miu site results are shown in fig 6 these simulations reveal a low influence of the vertical groundwater flow north of the tsukiyoshi fault on the calculated changes in groundwater pressure and a higher influence in the south of the tsukiyoshi fault indeed north of the tsukiyoshi fault the calculated total head fig 6a to 6c are very similar to those calculated with a higher vertical permeability in the formations above the toki granite fig 5a to 5c at the shobasama site in case of no change in permeability along the tsukiyoshi fault the recovery period is less than 200 days fig 5g and 5i and more than a year fig 6d and 6f in case of a high and lower vertical permeability in the upper formations respectively at the miu site despite the lower vertical permeability in the formations above the toki granite we still calculated a small increase in total head 2 to 3 time smaller than in case of a higher vertical permeability at all the control points cp dh2 cp dh 15 and cp miz1 located near the top of the toki granite fig 6g to 6 h also the higher the vertical permeability is the faster the groundwater level increase in the deepest part of the granite see cp msb1 on fig 5m and 6 g 5 discussion 5 1 causes of changes in groundwater pressure to understand the possible causes of

fault potentially increasing the shear stress acting on the fault and favoring its reactivation northeast southwest this last observation suggests the response of faults to dynamic loading by remote seismic waves depends on how favorably oriented towards stress they are and on the direction of propagation of seismic waves which is in accordance with previous work hill 2008 for example at the miu site seismic wave propagating in the northeast southwest direction may trigger slip only along faults oriented n030 e g the hiyoshi fault whereas seismic wave propagating in the northwest southeast direction may trigger slip only along faults oriented n135 e g main shaft fault we can also suppose that seismic wave propagating in the north south or in the east west directions do not trigger any slip along these two fault families 6 conclusion we analyzed changes in groundwater pressure observed in several boreholes located in and around the mizunami underground research laboratory miu induced by the 2011 tohoku earthquake mw 9 0 to understand the behavior of the fault zones during the passing of seismic waves our results suggest that two main mechanisms are responsible for the observed changes in groundwater pressure 1 crustal dilation induced by the tohoku earthquake causing a groundwater recharge from the upper aquifers to the toki granite in area where the sedimentary cover is thick and 2 permeability increase along faults critically oriented for shear reactivation and oriented in the direction of the passing seismic wave in this case the seismic wave increases the shear stress acting on the fault promoting slip and a change in permeability on the contrary faults not critically stressed and faults critically oriented for shear reactivation but oriented perpendicular to the passing seismic wave are not reactivated credit authorship contribution statement pierre jeanne conceptualization formal analysis software writing original draft yves guglielmi

efficiency of the data assimilation system is assessed in the results section by comparisons with the corresponding open loop no data assimilation simulations using ground observations as reference the main conclusions are drawn in the last section which also points to future research directions 2 materials and methodology in this work smap soil moisture data are incorporated in the noah mp land surface model niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 using an ensemble kalman filter enkf to simulate surface and root zone soil moisture this section describes in detail the experimental setup including a discussion of the smap products assimilated within noah mp and the data assimilation system the experiment focuses on the oklahoma domain and on the april to july 2015 time period during which the smap radar was operational 2 1 the soil moisture active passive smap products the nasa soil moisture active passive smap mission was launched on january 31st 2015 with the goal of measuring land surface brightness temperature and radar backscatter but the radar failed in july 2015 entekhabi 2016 and provide information on surface soil moisture top 5 cm of the soil column entekhabi et al 2010b this work considers two level 3 l3 products of the smap suite the l3 radiometer global daily 36 km ease grid soil moisture product hereinafter smap 36 km and the l3 radar radiometer global daily 9 km ease grid soil moisture product hereinafter smap 9 km the smap 36 km product is a global surface soil moisture nominally at 5 cm retrieved from passive radiometer measurements o neill et al 2016 this data set is adjusted for the presence of water bodies and calibrated at the surface level that corrects for sky radiation and atmospheric contributions de lannoy et al 2015 for this study we have used the most recent version version 7 of smap 36 km fig 1 a the recent improvement and features of this version of the smap products are discussed in detail in a previous study by oneill et al 2020 smap 9 km is obtained by downscaling the radiometer retrievals from 36 km to 9 km using radar observations based on techniques that combine the active passive microwave retrievals das et al 2014 akbar et al 2016 the temporal coverage of smap 9 km ranges from april 13 2015 to july 7 2015 due to the unfortunate failure of the smap radar system entekhabi 2016 which dictated the choice of the experiment temporal coverage for this study the most recent version 4 of smap 9 km is used fig 1b 2 2 validation dataset the oklahoma mesonet network is adopted here as a reference for validating surface and root zone soil moisture simulations the oklahoma mesonet shown in fig 2 is a network designed and managed by the university of oklahoma and oklahoma state university fig 2 shows the average of surface soil moisture and root zone soil moisture observed at each mesonet station during april july 2015 the network contains 120 automated stations that provide measurements of a suite of hydrometeorological variables at 5 minute intervals soil moisture is measured at each station by thermocouples located at four depths within the soil column 5 25 60 and 75 cm the dataset is also quality controlled and quality flags are provided along with soil moisture values more technical details for calculating soil moisture can be found in martens et al 2017 mesonet n d to avoid the systematic difference between the ground observations and the model estimates we evaluate anomaly time series of soil moisture thus standard normal deviates are computed by subtracting the mean from the soil moisture time series and dividing it by the corresponding standard deviation although soil moisture data are available at four measurement depths at the mesonet sites there is a difference in the vertical resolution of land surface model estimates and the one of observations here we consider surface soil moisture as soil moisture measured at 5 cm depth at the mesonet sites and soil moisture estimated in the 0 10 cm layer by noah mp we refer to root zone soil moisture as the mesonet observations at 60 cm and the one simulated in the 40 100 cm layer with the mid point being 70 cm by noah mp the use of standard normal deviates depicts the phase correspondence between the model estimates and in situ observations disregarding the potential presence of mean biases or differences in the dynamic range entekhabi et al 2010b maggioni et al 2011 2 3 the noah mp land surface model the noah mp land surface model lsm with the multi parameterization mp options version 3 6 is adopted in this study niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 this improved version of the noah model has been successfully implemented in the past for simulating the land atmosphere exchange of water energy and carbon in several regions of the world including the study area chosen for this study rouf et al 2021 but also in mountainous areas e g high mountain asia xue et al 2021 2019 the noah mp is run within the nasa land information system lis peters lidard et al 2007 a system for high performance land surface modeling and data assimilation the noah mp model is forced using two sets of atmospheric forcing variables at different resolutions 12 5 km and 500 m the first is the nldas 2 north america land data assimilation system suite of atmospheric variables at its original 12 5 km spatial resolution next 500 m spatial resolution data are derived from nldas 2 using the downscaling frameworks proposed by rouf et al 2019 and mei et al 2020 specifically for all atmospheric variables but precipitation i e air temperature pressure and humidity longwave and shortwave radiation wind speed and direction we used the physically based downscaling techniques mentioned above these techniques rely on information about local topography and vegetation which have a dominant impact over surface atmospheric conditions the spatially downscaled nldas 2 were shown to produce high correlations and low errors with respect to ground observations across oklahoma rouf et al 2019 a random forest rf algorithm is then used to estimate 500 m precipitation relevant predictors in the random forest framework are selected by a recursive feature elimination procedure the successful validation of this framework is presented in rouf et al 2021 over oklahoma and in mei et al 2020 over high mountain asia the noah mp model is run with an hourly time step to guarantee consistency with the temporal resolution of the oklahoma mesonet network which collects data at 5 min intervals but also produces hourly data for research purposes all analyses are also performed at hourly resolutions 2 4 the land data assimilation system surface and root zone soil moisture are simulated by different noah mp model runs an open loop simulation hereinafter ol in which no satellite data are assimilated and two data assimilation da simulations that adopt an enkf to merge smap observations to assess the impact of the resolution of the satellite retrievals in the data assimilation system we run two da simulations as summarized in table 1 i assimilation of the smap 36 km product and ii assimilation of the smap 9 km product the enkf evensen 2003 reichle et al 2002b assimilation system is adopted to assimilate the smap retrievals within noah mp kumar et al 2008a in the enkf method a forecast is produced a number of times from slightly different initial conditions converging to the mean the complete set of forecasts is referred to as the ensemble with each individual forecast being an ensemble member this method combines the noah mp forecast background and the smap soil moisture observations to produce improved modeled soil moisture estimates the model surface soil moisture predictions are corrected towards the smap observations using a stochastic filtering technique that considers the relative observation and model uncertainties based on multiple previous studies kumar et al 2008b maggioni et al 2012 reichle et al 2002a yin et al 2015 an ensemble size of 24 members is chosen for all the da simulations in this study the enkf assumes that both observations and model simulations follow a gaussian distribution in the da runs hourly nldas 2 shortwave longwave radiation and precipitation are perturbed using techniques adopted in previous work by kumar et al 2019 2018 2014 multiplicative perturbations with mean 1 and standard deviations of 0 3 and 0 5 are applied to shortwave radiation and precipitation respectively whereas for longwave radiation perturbations are applied using an error model with a standard deviation of 30 w m2 three cross correlations meteorological forcing variables are imposed with a value of 0 8 between shortwave radiation and precipitation a value of 0 5 between longwave radiation and precipitation and a cross correlation of 0 5 between shortwave radiation and longwave radiation an additive model with a standard deviation of 0 01 cm3 cm3 is then imposed to perturb the smap observations kumar et al 2012 at each assimilation step the new updated state of each ensemble member is calculated from the weighted average of observations satellite soil moisture retrievals and the model background information as adopted in our previous study rouf et al 2021 3 results the oklahoma mesonet soil moisture data are compared to soil moisture output from the simulations described in the methodology and listed in table 1 to assess the efficiency of assimilating smap in noah mp we focus on the time series of surface and root zone soil moisture standard normal deviates defined by subtracting the mean and dividing by the corresponding standard deviation as discussed in the previous chapter this is due to several reasons i there are scale differences between ground observations satellite products and model simulations due to the distributed character of the two latter ones with respect to the point scale of in situ data ii there is a mismatch in the soil layers and depths at which available ground measurements satellite products and the land surface modeled estimates are available iii the nature of the three estimates is very different in situ thermocouple measurements for the mesonet data brightness temperature retrieved by a passive microwave radiometer in space and model simulations in addition to that one of the inherent assumptions of the enkf is unbiasedness in the model and observations biases in the smap products are removed viacumulative distribution function cdf matching a simple method of bias removal to match the cumulative distribution functions cdf of satellite data and model simulations for this reason biases are not tested in the evaluation phase soil moisture model estimates are assessed against the mesonet in situ observations using time series of standard normal deviates in order to evaluate the phase correspondence between two estimates model simulation and ground observation regardless of possible biases and or differences in their dynamic range maggioni et al 2011 to investigate the temporal variability of soil moisture fig 3 presents daily station average time series of surface and root zone soil moisture for noah mp model simulations corresponding mesonet in situ observations and smap satellite observations the thiessen polygon method is applied here to obtain domain averaged soil moisture values from the in situ mesonet observations thiessen polygons are generated to reflect the contributing area of each station the soil moisture within each polygon is then assumed to be equal to the one measured at the station location and the domain averaged soil moisture is computed by taking the weighted average of each polygon area s soil moisture when comparing the performance of the nldas ol to downscaled ol we observe how by forcing the model with higher resolution data the output moves closer to the ground observations fig 3 this is consistent with a previous study conducted across the same domain which concluded that downscaled nldas 2 atmospheric variables are able to bring anomalies of both modeled surface and root zone soil moisture closer to in situ observations rouf et al 2021 this is even more pronounced in drier than usual cases i e negative values of standard normal deviates thanks to the better detection of missed events and no rain cases of the downscaled precipitation product results in fig 3 also show that the data assimilation of smap retrievals largely impacts the model free run i e ol confirming that smap adds information on the soil dynamics to the ones modeled by noah mp fig 3 demonstrates how soil moisture estimates are pushed towards the smap products and further from the ol run when the latter are merged into the land surface model as smap products are drier than the modeled soil moisture the da runs also result drier than their corresponding ol simulations furthermore regardless of which smap product is assimilated either smap 36 km or smap 9 km the da runs pushing the ol run closer to the mesonet ground observations which in this work represent the benchmark soil moisture values although root zone soil moisture is not directly assimilated its estimate is impacted by the assimilation of smap observations because of the physical relationships in the soil column between soil type total number of soil layers containing roots and total depth of root zone modeled by noah mp as shown in the bottom plots of fig 3 for both surface and root zone soil moisture the da runs are closer to the reference mesonet time series than the corresponding ol simulations showing that smap is able to improve the noah mp performance what observed in the time series is corroborated by the statistics presented in fig 4 and fig 5 correlation coefficients and rmses are computed for soil moisture standard normal deviates at each mesonet station at hourly resolution and corresponding model pixel boxplots in figs 4 and 5 present a series of percentiles 25th 50th and 75th together with minimum and maximum values for each model simulation nldas ol nldas da 36 km nldas da 9 km downscaled ol downscaled da 36 km and downscaled da 9 km for surface and root zone soil moisture across the study area in terms of correlations fig 4 not only improvements are observed in the high resolution runs in which the downscaled products are used but the variability around the median also shrinks with respect to the simulations in which the original nldas 2 dataset is adopted specifically the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles also known as interquartile difference and the difference between the maximum and minimum values are largely reduced when the model is forced with a higher resolution dataset this behavior is noted in both surface and root zone soil moisture standard normal deviates when comparing the efficiency of assimilating two different smap products of different nature and different resolution we observe a slight increase in the correlation coefficient when the smap 9 km product is assimilated with respect to the smap 36 km one once again for both soil moisture depths the rmse of the nldas ol simulation is largely reduced when the downscaled atmospheric variables are used to force noah mp and it is reduced even further when smap data are assimilated within the land surface model for both surface and root zone soil moisture standard normal deviates for surface soil moisture very little difference is observed between the assimilation of smap 36 km and smap 9 km although overall the best rmse distribution i e smallest interquartile difference lowest maximum is obtained when smap 9 km is assimilated and the downscaled atmospheric dataset is used to force noah mp the rmses of root zone soil moisture deviates are slightly higher than the corresponding surface soil moisture cases in the da simulations which is expected since root zone soil moisture is not directly updated in the enkf when nldas 2 data force the land surface model the smallest interquartile difference is observed when smap 9 km is assimilated whereas the rmse median values are similar in both da experiments when the downscaled products are used as atmospheric forcings the lowest rmse median is obtained when merging smap 9 km whereas the variability around such median value is similar to the one of the downscaled da 36 km run in order to further investigate the effect of forcing resolutions 12 5 km and 500 m and smap resolutions 36 km and 9 km on the noah mp simulation of soil moisture we present maps of correlation coefficients computed between each mesonet station time series and model simulations at the corresponding pixel fig 6 shows the maps of correlation coefficients of standard normal deviates of surface soil moisture whereas fig 7 presents the same maps for root zone soil moisture deviates smap data assimilation improves correlation coefficients with respect to the open loop runs for both atmospheric forcing resolutions original nldas 2 dataset and downscaled product for both smap products and consistently across the study region specifically correlation coefficients computed at each single mesonet station prove how the improvement is not region dependent as highlighted above the assimilation of smap 9 km yields higher correlations than the corresponding simulation with smap 36 km and the runs forced with the downscaled atmospheric dataset bottom panels outperform the ones forced with the original resolution nldas 2 products top panels the correlation coefficient values obtained for surface soil moisture deviates in the two ol runs are lower and characterized by wider spread around the median than the corresponding values for root zone soil moisture estimates as presented in fig 4 this is due to the natural higher variability of surface soil moisture with respect to the water content in deep soil layers however the maps in fig 7 show how at some locations correlation coefficients that were particularly low in the ol run are improved by the assimilation of smap and the downscaled atmospheric forcings in conclusion the downscaled da 9 km experiment shown in the bottom right panel in fig 7 is the one that yields the highest correlation coefficient across the study area for the period of interest similarly the root mean square errors rmses of soil moisture deviates simulated by the ol run are reduced by the assimilation of smap at several mesonet locations as shown in figs 8 and 9 for surface and root zone soil moisture respectively the downscaled atmospheric forcings further reduces the rmses observed in the simulations forced by nldas 2 at its original spatial resolution 4 conclusions land data assimilation systems that combine information from remotely sensed retrievals and the spatially and temporally complete estimate from land surface models have the potential to provide a soil moisture product that is superior to the two parenting ones specifically an ldas incorporates observations e g from satellites that are limited in terms of temporal and spatial coverage e g with soil depth with estimates from a land surface model that captures the key land surface processes such as the vertical transfer of water between the surface and root zone reservoirs in this work we considered two sets of atmospheric forcing nldas 2 at 12 5 km forcing and downscaled nldas 2 forcing at 500 m as input to the noah mp land surface model the first is the nldas 2 dataset at a native resolution of 12 5 km the second is a suite of higher resolution products generated by downscaling the nldas 2 data to 500 m using physical and nonparametric statistical corrections next two sets of smap soil moisture products smap 36 km and smap 9 km were assimilated within noah mp using an enkf this framework is tested across oklahoma from march 31 to july 7 2015 when the smap radar was still operational and the smap l3 radar radiometer 9 km product available the analysis of times series of soil moisture standard deviates shows how estimates of extremely different nature ground observations satellite products and model simulations all capture the seasonality and variability of such anomalies and present correlations between each other results show that the assimilation of smap soil moisture retrievals in a land surface model has the potential to improve the estimation of surface and root zone soil moisture increasing the correlation and reducing the random error between the model and the reference data although root zone soil moisture is not directly assimilated it is impacted nonetheless by the assimilation of smap observations at the surface level which brings root zone soil moisture estimates closer to the in situ observations runs forced with the downscaled higher resolution atmospheric variables produce superior estimates of soil moisture with respect to the ones forced with the original nldas 2 dataset this may be due to the physical and statistical corrections applied to nldas 2 that improved the quality of such estimates reducing biases and improving correlations with ground observations as demonstrated by rouf et al 2019 moreover assimilating different smap products smap 36 km and smap 9 km also affects the simulated soil moisture with the smap 9 km providing higher correlation coefficients and smaller errors with respect to the reference this result confirms the utility of the high resolution information of the smap radar backscatter in conclusion the results presented in this manuscript show that forcing data at finer spatial resolution can improve estimates of surface and root zone soil moisture modeled by noah mp by producing higher correlations and lower errors in soil moisture anomalies furthermore the resolution of the smap products assimilated within the land surface model also plays a critical role in estimating standard normal deviates of surface and root zone soil moisture improved and downscaled soil moisture observations are useful to predict floods by identifying saturated soil conditions and droughts by identifying drier than usual soil conditions this information will be extremely beneficial to water resources managers and local stakeholders to provide informed water usage decisions

surface brightness temperature and radar backscatter but the radar failed in july 2015 entekhabi 2016 and provide information on surface soil moisture top 5 cm of the soil column entekhabi et al 2010b this work considers two level 3 l3 products of the smap suite the l3 radiometer global daily 36 km ease grid soil moisture product hereinafter smap 36 km and the l3 radar radiometer global daily 9 km ease grid soil moisture product hereinafter smap 9 km the smap 36 km product is a global surface soil moisture nominally at 5 cm retrieved from passive radiometer measurements o neill et al 2016 this data set is adjusted for the presence of water bodies and calibrated at the surface level that corrects for sky radiation and atmospheric contributions de lannoy et al 2015 for this study we have used the most recent version version 7 of smap 36 km fig 1 a the recent improvement and features of this version of the smap products are discussed in detail in a previous study by oneill et al 2020 smap 9 km is obtained by downscaling the radiometer retrievals from 36 km to 9 km using radar observations based on techniques that combine the active passive microwave retrievals das et al 2014 akbar et al 2016 the temporal coverage of smap 9 km ranges from april 13 2015 to july 7 2015 due to the unfortunate failure of the smap radar system entekhabi 2016 which dictated the choice of the experiment temporal coverage for this study the most recent version 4 of smap 9 km is used fig 1b 2 2 validation dataset the oklahoma mesonet network is adopted here as a reference for validating surface and root zone soil moisture simulations the oklahoma mesonet shown in fig 2 is a network designed and managed by the university of oklahoma and oklahoma state university fig 2 shows the average of surface soil moisture and root zone soil moisture observed at each mesonet station during april july 2015 the network contains 120 automated stations that provide measurements of a suite of hydrometeorological variables at 5 minute intervals soil moisture is measured at each station by thermocouples located at four depths within the soil column 5 25 60 and 75 cm the dataset is also quality controlled and quality flags are provided along with soil moisture values more technical details for calculating soil moisture can be found in martens et al 2017 mesonet n d to avoid the systematic difference between the ground observations and the model estimates we evaluate anomaly time series of soil moisture thus standard normal deviates are computed by subtracting the mean from the soil moisture time series and dividing it by the corresponding standard deviation although soil moisture data are available at four measurement depths at the mesonet sites there is a difference in the vertical resolution of land surface model estimates and the one of observations here we consider surface soil moisture as soil moisture measured at 5 cm depth at the mesonet sites and soil moisture estimated in the 0 10 cm layer by noah mp we refer to root zone soil moisture as the mesonet observations at 60 cm and the one simulated in the 40 100 cm layer with the mid point being 70 cm by noah mp the use of standard normal deviates depicts the phase correspondence between the model estimates and in situ observations disregarding the potential presence of mean biases or differences in the dynamic range entekhabi et al 2010b maggioni et al 2011 2 3 the noah mp land surface model the noah mp land surface model lsm with the multi parameterization mp options version 3 6 is adopted in this study niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 this improved version of the noah model has been successfully implemented in the past for simulating the land atmosphere exchange of water energy and carbon in several regions of the world including the study area chosen for this study rouf et al 2021 but also in mountainous areas e g high mountain asia xue et al 2021 2019 the noah mp is run within the nasa land information system lis peters lidard et al 2007 a system for high performance land surface modeling and data assimilation the noah mp model is forced using two sets of atmospheric forcing variables at different resolutions 12 5 km and 500 m the first is the nldas 2 north america land data assimilation system suite of atmospheric variables at its original 12 5 km spatial resolution next 500 m spatial resolution data are derived from nldas 2 using the downscaling frameworks proposed by rouf et al 2019 and mei et al 2020 specifically for all atmospheric variables but precipitation i e air temperature pressure and humidity longwave and shortwave radiation wind speed and direction we used the physically based downscaling techniques mentioned above these techniques rely on information about local topography and vegetation which have a dominant impact over surface atmospheric conditions the spatially downscaled nldas 2 were shown to produce high correlations and low errors with respect to ground observations across oklahoma rouf et al 2019 a random forest rf algorithm is then used to estimate 500 m precipitation relevant predictors in the random forest framework are selected by a recursive feature elimination procedure the successful validation of this framework is presented in rouf et al 2021 over oklahoma and in mei et al 2020 over high mountain asia the noah mp model is run with an hourly time step to guarantee consistency with the temporal resolution of the oklahoma mesonet network which collects data at 5 min intervals but also produces hourly data for research purposes all analyses are also performed at hourly resolutions 2 4 the land data assimilation system surface and root zone soil moisture are simulated by different noah mp model runs an open loop simulation hereinafter ol in which no satellite data are assimilated and two data assimilation da simulations that adopt an enkf to merge smap observations to assess the impact of the resolution of the satellite retrievals in the data assimilation system we run two da simulations as summarized in table 1 i assimilation of the smap 36 km product and ii assimilation of the smap 9 km product the enkf evensen 2003 reichle et al 2002b assimilation system is adopted to assimilate the smap retrievals within noah mp kumar et al 2008a in the enkf method a forecast is produced a number of times from slightly different initial conditions converging to the mean the complete set of forecasts is referred to as the ensemble with each individual forecast being an ensemble member this method combines the noah mp forecast background and the smap soil moisture observations to produce improved modeled soil moisture estimates the model surface soil moisture predictions are corrected towards the smap observations using a stochastic filtering technique that considers the relative observation and model uncertainties based on multiple previous studies kumar et al 2008b maggioni et al 2012 reichle et al 2002a yin et al 2015 an ensemble size of 24 members is chosen for all the da simulations in this study the enkf assumes that both observations and model simulations follow a gaussian distribution in the da runs hourly nldas 2 shortwave longwave radiation and precipitation are perturbed using techniques adopted in previous work by kumar et al 2019 2018 2014 multiplicative perturbations with mean 1 and standard deviations of 0 3 and 0 5 are applied to shortwave radiation and precipitation respectively whereas for longwave radiation perturbations are applied using an error model with a standard deviation of 30 w m2 three cross correlations meteorological forcing variables are imposed with a value of 0 8 between shortwave radiation and precipitation a value of 0 5 between longwave radiation and precipitation and a cross correlation of 0 5 between shortwave radiation and longwave radiation an additive model with a standard deviation of 0 01 cm3 cm3 is then imposed to perturb the smap observations kumar et al 2012 at each assimilation step the new updated state of each ensemble member is calculated from the weighted average of observations satellite soil moisture retrievals and the model background information as adopted in our previous study rouf et al 2021 3 results the oklahoma mesonet soil moisture data are compared to soil moisture output from the simulations described in the methodology and listed in table 1 to assess the efficiency of assimilating smap in noah mp we focus on the time series of surface and root zone soil moisture standard normal deviates defined by subtracting the mean and dividing by the corresponding standard deviation as discussed in the previous chapter this is due to several reasons i there are scale differences between ground observations satellite products and model simulations due to the distributed character of the two latter ones with respect to the point scale of in situ data ii there is a mismatch in the soil layers and depths at which available ground measurements satellite products and the land surface modeled estimates are available iii the nature of the three estimates is very different in situ thermocouple measurements for the mesonet data brightness temperature retrieved by a passive microwave radiometer in space and model simulations in addition to that one of the inherent assumptions of the enkf is unbiasedness in the model and observations biases in the smap products are removed viacumulative distribution function cdf matching a simple method of bias removal to match the cumulative distribution functions cdf of satellite data and model simulations for this reason biases are not tested in the evaluation phase soil moisture model estimates are assessed against the mesonet in situ observations using time series of standard normal deviates in order to evaluate the phase correspondence between two estimates model simulation and ground observation regardless of possible biases and or differences in their dynamic range maggioni et al 2011 to investigate the temporal variability of soil moisture fig 3 presents daily station average time series of surface and root zone soil moisture for noah mp model simulations corresponding mesonet in situ observations and smap satellite observations the thiessen polygon method is applied here to obtain domain averaged soil moisture values from the in situ mesonet observations thiessen polygons are generated to reflect the contributing area of each station the soil moisture within each polygon is then assumed to be equal to the one measured at the station location and the domain averaged soil moisture is computed by taking the weighted average of each polygon area s soil moisture when comparing the performance of the nldas ol to downscaled ol we observe how by forcing the model with higher resolution data the output moves closer to the ground observations fig 3 this is consistent with a previous study conducted across the same domain which concluded that downscaled nldas 2 atmospheric variables are able to bring anomalies of both modeled surface and root zone soil moisture closer to in situ observations rouf et al 2021 this is even more pronounced in drier than usual cases i e negative values of standard normal deviates thanks to the better detection of missed events and no rain cases of the downscaled precipitation product results in fig 3 also show that the data assimilation of smap retrievals largely impacts the model free run i e ol confirming that smap adds information on the soil dynamics to the ones modeled by noah mp fig 3 demonstrates how soil moisture estimates are pushed towards the smap products and further from the ol run when the latter are merged into the land surface model as smap products are drier than the modeled soil moisture the da runs also result drier than their corresponding ol simulations furthermore regardless of which smap product is assimilated either smap 36 km or smap 9 km the da runs pushing the ol run closer to the mesonet ground observations which in this work represent the benchmark soil moisture values although root zone soil moisture is not directly assimilated its estimate is impacted by the assimilation of smap observations because of the physical relationships in the soil column between soil type total number of soil layers containing roots and total depth of root zone modeled by noah mp as shown in the bottom plots of fig 3 for both surface and root zone soil moisture the da runs are closer to the reference mesonet time series than the corresponding ol simulations showing that smap is able to improve the noah mp performance what observed in the time series is corroborated by the statistics presented in fig 4 and fig 5 correlation coefficients and rmses are computed for soil moisture standard normal deviates at each mesonet station at hourly resolution and corresponding model pixel boxplots in figs 4 and 5 present a series of percentiles 25th 50th and 75th together with minimum and maximum values for each model simulation nldas ol nldas da 36 km nldas da 9 km downscaled ol downscaled da 36 km and downscaled da 9 km for surface and root zone soil moisture across the study area in terms of correlations fig 4 not only improvements are observed in the high resolution runs in which the downscaled products are used but the variability around the median also shrinks with respect to the simulations in which the original nldas 2 dataset is adopted specifically the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles also known as interquartile difference and the difference between the maximum and minimum values are largely reduced when the model is forced with a higher resolution dataset this behavior is noted in both surface and root zone soil moisture standard normal deviates when comparing the efficiency of assimilating two different smap products of different nature and different resolution we observe a slight increase in the correlation coefficient when the smap 9 km product is assimilated with respect to the smap 36 km one once again for both soil moisture depths the rmse of the nldas ol simulation is largely reduced when the downscaled atmospheric variables are used to force noah mp and it is reduced even further when smap data are assimilated within the land surface model for both surface and root zone soil moisture standard normal deviates for surface soil moisture very little difference is observed between the assimilation of smap 36 km and smap 9 km although overall the best rmse distribution i e smallest interquartile difference lowest maximum is obtained when smap 9 km is assimilated and the downscaled atmospheric dataset is used to force noah mp the rmses of root zone soil moisture deviates are slightly higher than the corresponding surface soil moisture cases in the da simulations which is expected since root zone soil moisture is not directly updated in the enkf when nldas 2 data force the land surface model the smallest interquartile difference is observed when smap 9 km is assimilated whereas the rmse median values are similar in both da experiments when the downscaled products are used as atmospheric forcings the lowest rmse median is obtained when merging smap 9 km whereas the variability around such median value is similar to the one of the downscaled da 36 km run in order to further investigate the effect of forcing resolutions 12 5 km and 500 m and smap resolutions 36 km and 9 km on the noah mp simulation of soil moisture we present maps of correlation coefficients computed between each mesonet station time series and model simulations at the corresponding pixel fig 6 shows the maps of correlation coefficients of standard normal deviates of surface soil moisture whereas fig 7 presents the same maps for root zone soil moisture deviates smap data assimilation improves correlation coefficients with respect to the open loop runs for both atmospheric forcing resolutions original nldas 2 dataset and downscaled product for both smap products and consistently across the study region specifically correlation coefficients computed at each single mesonet station prove how the improvement is not region dependent as highlighted above the assimilation of smap 9 km yields higher correlations than the corresponding simulation with smap 36 km and the runs forced with the downscaled atmospheric dataset bottom panels outperform the ones forced with the original resolution nldas 2 products top panels the correlation coefficient values obtained for surface soil moisture deviates in the two ol runs are lower and characterized by wider spread around the median than the corresponding values for root zone soil moisture estimates as presented in fig 4 this is due to the natural higher variability of surface soil moisture with respect to the water content in deep soil layers however the maps in fig 7 show how at some locations correlation coefficients that were particularly low in the ol run are improved by the assimilation of smap and the downscaled atmospheric forcings in conclusion the downscaled da 9 km experiment shown in the bottom right panel in fig 7 is the one that yields the highest correlation coefficient across the study area for the period of interest similarly the root mean square errors rmses of soil moisture deviates simulated by the ol run are reduced by the assimilation of smap at several mesonet locations as shown in figs 8 and 9 for surface and root zone soil moisture respectively the downscaled atmospheric forcings further reduces the rmses observed in the simulations forced by nldas 2 at its original spatial resolution 4 conclusions land data assimilation systems that combine information from remotely sensed retrievals and the spatially and temporally complete estimate from land surface models have the potential to provide a soil moisture product that is superior to the two parenting ones specifically an ldas incorporates observations e g from satellites that are limited in terms of temporal and spatial coverage e g with soil depth with estimates from a land surface model that captures the key land surface processes such as the vertical transfer of water between the surface and root zone reservoirs in this work we considered two sets of atmospheric forcing nldas 2 at 12 5 km forcing and downscaled nldas 2 forcing at 500 m as input to the noah mp land surface model the first is the nldas 2 dataset at a native resolution of 12 5 km the second is a suite of higher resolution products generated by downscaling the nldas 2 data to 500 m using physical and nonparametric statistical corrections next two sets of smap soil moisture products smap 36 km and smap 9 km were assimilated within noah mp using an enkf this framework is tested across oklahoma from march 31 to july 7 2015 when the smap radar was still operational and the smap l3 radar radiometer 9 km product available the analysis of times series of soil moisture standard deviates shows how estimates of extremely different nature ground observations satellite products and model simulations all capture the seasonality and variability of such anomalies and present correlations between each other results show that the assimilation of smap soil moisture retrievals in a land surface model has the potential to improve the estimation of surface and root zone soil moisture increasing the correlation and reducing the random error between the model and the reference data although root zone soil moisture is not directly assimilated it is impacted nonetheless by the assimilation of smap observations at the surface level which brings root zone soil moisture estimates closer to the in situ observations runs forced with the downscaled higher resolution atmospheric variables produce superior estimates of soil moisture with respect to the ones forced with the original nldas 2 dataset this may be due to the physical and statistical corrections applied to nldas 2 that improved the quality of such estimates reducing biases and improving correlations with ground observations as demonstrated by rouf et al 2019 moreover assimilating different smap products smap 36 km and smap 9 km also affects the simulated soil moisture with the smap 9 km providing higher correlation coefficients and smaller errors with respect to the reference this result confirms the utility of the high resolution information of the smap radar backscatter in conclusion the results presented in this manuscript show that forcing data at finer spatial resolution can improve estimates of surface and root zone soil moisture modeled by noah mp by producing higher correlations and lower errors in soil moisture anomalies furthermore the resolution of the smap products assimilated within the land surface model also plays a critical role in estimating standard normal deviates of surface and root zone soil moisture improved and downscaled soil moisture observations are useful to predict floods by identifying saturated soil conditions and droughts by identifying drier than usual soil conditions this information will be extremely beneficial to water resources managers and local stakeholders to provide informed water usage decisions
