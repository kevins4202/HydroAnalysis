11960,the elementary objective of this current study estimates groundwater limitation in the mehsana district of gujarat by the aid of downscaling grace gravity recovery and climate experiment spherical harmonics sh and jet propulsion laboratory jpl mascon regional solutions data a set of post monsoonal data from 2003 to 2019 is taken for this research and evaluated with a statistical model derived from empirical regression the grace data spherical harmonics derived terrestrial water storage tws and analysis of regional scale solution of grace jpl mascon estimates the groundwater storage anomaly gwsa both the grace solutions observe a negative anomaly of groundwater storage gws change across the study area for these 15 years with 60 33 5 00 mm year and 80 00 6 12 mm year from downscaled grace sh and jpl mascon respectively downscaling sh solutions has given 0 14 0 54 km3 year 5 12 0 54 km3 year and 7 40 0 54 km3 year and jpl mascon has derived 0 44 0 43 km3 year 0 63 0 43 km3 year and 0 11 0 43 km3 year mass loss across northern gujarat for 2003 to 2007 2008 to 2013 and 2014 to 2019 respectively therefore a highly correlated groundwater declining rates and mass loss exists between downscaling grace sh and jpl mascon but the total correlation between downscaling grace sh derived gwsa and ground well data anomaly is higher compared to the correlation between jpl mascon anomaly and ground data anomaly also downscaling sh has shown sensitive estimation with gws change at a significant rate while comparing with jpl mascon derivations by overcoming the signal loss of the filtered sh solutions thus the study implies that statistical regression can downscale the grace sh solution successfully and is applicable for water management scale studies graphical abstract image 1 keywords grace spherical harmonics downscaling jpl mascon gwsa dwindling 1 introduction groundwater is one of the demandable sources around the globe and used in a surplus amount especially in highly populated regions in the world like china india and parched regions where there is lack of adequate surrogated freshwater resources like the middle east and north africa chen et al 2014 haque et al 2020 adimalla and taloor et al 2020 adimalla et al 2020 being a primary source of freshwater rodell et al 2009 some regions of india are overly dependent on it subsurface water is a crucial source to achieve sustainable goals in the environment food production social and economy due to water create the conditions for limits of life and land the overexploitation of groundwater is due to human s reliance on non renewable resources which counts on high risk over water and food production castellazzi et al 2016 khan et al 2020 taloor et al 2020 land subsidence kannaujiya et al 2020 for instance the san joaquin valley in california seems to be a suitable example sneed and brandt 2015 besides high increment of flood risk as well as seasonal droughts is also experienced in cities like bangkok thailand and jakarta indonesia chen et al 2014 coastal tianjin city china hu et al 2009 tapley et al 2019 the rate of consumption of groundwater is relatively fast compared to its natural rate of replenishment thus resulting in water tables to dwindle continuously rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 chinnasamy et al 2013 singh et al 2017 jasrotia et al 2018 2019 the first alarm about groundwater over extraction rang almost three decades ago in mehsana northern gujarat coastal saurashtra and kachchh in gujarat coimbatore in tamil nadu kolar in karnataka jaipur in rajasthan chandigarh in haryana and punjab and dewas district in narmada valley in madhya pradesh satellite data like grace and geophysical studies of central ground water board cgwb of india exemplifies that escalated rate of groundwater extraction resulted in the steady lowering of the gws level over the northern west india rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 chatterjee et al 2020 a recent study showing gws changes around water stress areas in india by 36 8 8 0 mm year 36 2 7 0 mm year 31 0 8 7 mm year 27 3 6 0 mm year was observed in delhi meerut dehradun and chandigarh respectively from january 2003 to may 2010 sarkar et al 2020 the overexploitation of groundwater effects on negative aspects of groundwater development foster and chilton 2004 mart√≠nez cortina et al 2009 and leads to the dreadful consequences that include 1 extensive and continuous drops in groundwater level over a long period time 2 sizeable seasonal level drops in water levels in wells and drying up wells in the summer 3 increase salinity of groundwater 4 land subsidence 5 enormous increase in the cost of groundwater extraction and 6 reduction of groundwater dependent vegetation including crops and seepage the negative biasing of groundwater development and future climate change impacts of drought events are well recognised deliberated serious situation in northern india due to the constant over consuming of groundwater amarasinghe et al 2007 hence the over extraction of groundwater not only develops severe water storage but alsoleads to land deformation in many parts of northern west india although groundwater is the critical component of the hydrological cycle the complexity of gws dynamics and insufficient ground data drops a challenge for estimating the groundwater storage variation chinnasamy et al 2013 tiwari et al 2009 as confirmed by previous researcher grace is a powerful tool in measuring terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa by tracking satellite orbit perturbation due to the earth s gravitational field variations but it is a perfect remote sensing tool to monitor groundwater storage change scenarios directly over a long duration on the global and regional scale chen et al 2014 with different grace solutions like grace sh and mass concentration mascon respectively grace data throughout the past decade estimate large scale gws changes in other parts of the world gautam et al 2017 su et al 2020 for instance the mississippi river basin and its four sub basins rodell et al 2007 northern china plain huang et al 2015 california central valley in the usa scanlon et al 2012 the middle east voss et al 2013 bengal basin india shamsudduha et al 2012 and other water stress regions in india sarkar et al 2020 the integrated grace and global positioning system gps data evaluate that groundwater depletion leads to ground subsidence in twin city ahemadabad and gandhinagar chopra et al 2013 although grace data can produce a quantitative estimation of groundwater storage change both temporally and spatially but it is only applicable at continental scale water management studies previous studies carried out in this region documents a high subsidence rate calculated from gps measurements which are relatively high compared to the subsidence rate estimated from low spatial resolution grace data the reason behind high surface subsidence rate 5 mm yr was overexploitation of groundwater 1 3 m year from that region choudhury et al 2018 a decline in groundwater level and over exploitation of aquifer system in this region reported back in 1960 1995 and 1986 2000 when decline rate was 2 4 m year and 1 5 m year respectively gupte 2011 the objective of this research work is to estimate the diminishing rate of groundwater storage in the mehsana district of gujarat by downscaling of grace sh and jpl mascon solution 2 study area the mehsana district lies between 23 15 23 53 north and 72 07 72 26 east in the northern part of the gujarat alluvium plains fig 1 the semi arid mehsana district significantly depends on the subsurface water resource and the rate of groundwater development 151 17 it segregates into the alluvial plain dissected hilly terrain and piedmont plain with inselbergs a narrow belt of 20 30 km width in northeastern portion of the district specialises with moderate relief alluvium gravel beds and occasional inliers of older rocks sinha 2014 the multi layers of aquifer systems found in this district lies beneath precambrian hard rocks semi consolidated mesozoic and tertiary formations and unconsolidated quaternary alluvial deposits gupte 2011 groundwater in fissured formation hard rock composed of meta sediments and post delhi intrusives whereas the soft rock or porous formation comprises mainly coarse sand gravel silt clay and claystone the groundwater occurring beneath the arenaceous horizons is present in both phreatic and confined conditions two major upper layer aquifer units identified as a is in unconfined condition comprising relatively coarse grained sediments some regions of the aquifer system are semi confined to confine the lower unit of the aquifer system divided into b c d and e layers which comprise of coarse to fine grained sand with occasional gravel beds of the post miocene age and f and g layers that consist of fine to medium grained sand sandstone with interbedded clay claystone and siltstone of miocene age a local aquifer system marked as h northeastern part composed of coarse grained and friable cretaceous himmatnagar sandstone table 1 in mehsana groundwater gets exploited by deep tube wells of depth up to 400m here the condition of groundwater is continuously deteriorating due to over extraction of groundwater with depleting groundwater table 2m 4m per year ghulyani et al

respect to the earth sphere for measuring the gps of the cap mascon location both the spherical harmonics and the unconstrained mascon data shares the same fundamental grace acquired signals as well as the same correction models for removing tidal atmospheric and oceanic signals the processed level 3 spherical harmonic solutions apply at a global scale 1 whereas level 3 mascon products apply at

to the manifests of other research the noah model shows a better correlation with grace data concerning with clm mosaic and vic model the noah model data of jet propulsion laboratory jpl jing et al 2020 and gldas noah twc downloaded directly from https podaac jpl nasa gov table 3 3 2 effective downscaling of grace data the grace derived tws is applicable in fields of hydrological hydrogeological and climatic applications downscaling of grace data employs statistical method regression models like linear non linear multivariate and machine learning because it is simple widely used and less time consuming unlike dynamic downscaling piles et al 2011 in this study the downscaling of level 3 grace sh derived tws grace and grace fo mission analyses depletion of groundwater level the data downscaled effectively from grace 1 pixels to grace 0 25 pixels an empirical regression used between grace derived tws 1 and gldas data derived water storage change Œ¥s from the water mass balance equation the gws estimated as an integrated value of groundwater recharge rate groundwater discharge rate and the net rate of extraction by pumping and parameters that are insensitive to the water mass balance equation the previous work on grace states that in low altitudes areas precipitation plays a very dominant role in tws variations in rainy seasons still the effect of water accumulation due to precipitation evapotranspiration and storm surface runoff is quite a time taking process so their data retrieval becomes complicated and extensive ning et al 2014 in this study grace twsa has shifted forward by two months because of the water accumulation time lag effect for calculation of the empirical regression equation with Œ¥s the downscaling of grace sh derived twsa 10 process involves several steps in which the monthly resolution of gldas precipitation 0 25 p 0 25 evapotranspiration 0 25 et 0 25 and storm surface runoff 0 25 sr 0 25 data aggregated to p 1 et 1 and sr 1 by using pixel average method then the monthly Œ¥s1 calculated by water mass balance equation 4 for each month where t denotes the month and i represent the spatial resolution in degree eq 4 Œ¥ s t i p t

of the data multiplied with the corresponding scaling factor recovering the leakage error before averaging and obtaining missing data by the linear interpolation of the contiguous months an empirical regression relationship estimated between grace derived twsa 1 and the aggregated gldas parameters derived from Œ¥s 1 the linear regression equation estimated as where t denotes the month i denotes the spatial resolution in degree x or Œ¥ s t i is regressor predictor y or grace t 2 i is dependent predictor Œ≤ 1 is slope and Œ≤ is the intercept of the linear regression equation eq 5 y ÀÜ Œ≤ 1 x

equation 4 using gldas 0 25 parameters p 0 25 et 0 25 and sr 0 25 derived grace twsa 0 25 data from equation 4 the results obtained from equation 7 subtracted from the system residual derived from the difference between grace twsa 1 obtained from Œ¥s 1 and grace twsa 1 obtained from average grace sh data and resample to 0 25 degree the system residual considered as the amount which is difficult to derive from the regression equation or uncertainty thus accomplishing as an essential step in the downscaling procedure 3 3 groundwater storage change estimation with downscaling grace sh and mascon in grace sh derived twsa sh solution uses spherical coefficients and values of each month whereas for grace mascon derived twsa mass concentration mascon and mascon utilises gravitational disturbance observed at the location of each mascon cap therefore total radial gravitational disturbance due to the cap mascon derived from eq 8 eq 8 Œ¥ g i g j 1 t Œ¥ m j r acos œà ij a 2 r 2 2 arcos œà ij 3 2 here Œ¥mj 1 2 t and here Œ¥mj is the point where mascon parameters estimated Œ¥gi 1 2 n and here Œ¥gi is the location points of the satellite when observing gravity disturbance a 2 r 2 2 arcos œà ij 3 2 is euclidean distance between satellite and ground point œà is the angle between the satellite point and ground point location on the surface r is altitude and a is the radius of the earth s surface the spatial resolution of mascon is 300km and geophysical constraints can easily filter out its noise factor even in grace level 2 observations so mascon solutions deal well with mass leakage problems which is a concern for sh solutions and even beneficial for regional level case studies these reasons qualify the latest jpl mascon rl06 data product for deriving groundwater storage anomaly gwsa across the study realm from 2003 to 2019 the mascon derived twsa is relative to the 2004 to 2009 time mean baseline and multiplied by the relevant scaling factor downloaded from jpl website for resolving mass leakage error the missing month data in mascon calculated by linear interpolation to estimate the gwsa grace 0 25 and mascon 0 5 derived twsa subtracts from gldas derived canopy water storage anomaly cwsa and soil moisture anomaly sma calculated from equation 9 and equation 10 respectively eq 9 cwsa t i cw s t i gldas cw s i gldas 2005 2010 eq 10 sma t i s m t i gldas s m i gldas

downscale grace sh and mascon solutions eq 11 gwsa t i twsa t i cws t i sm t i here t represents the month and i denotes the spatial resolution in degree the two dimensional gwsa maps generated on applying kernel interpolation method along with polynomial interpolation to recover gaps between data points this method allows interpolating contaminated zones of water bodies compared to other methods which do not adjust with the barriers sarkar et al 2020 3 4 uncertainty estimation for grace solution derived gwsa the pixel base uncertainty of each component including grace solutions and gldas parameters estimated from standard deviation since 2003 to 2019 and the final associated uncertainty error calculated with first order error propagation from equation 12 corresponds with gwsa derived equation 13 with grace and gldas parameters jpl mascon data associated with monthly uncertainty data and the average of 30 months uncertainty data from 2003 to 2019 used for calculating the

from 2005 to 2015 statistics of some raw in situ well observations have high quality issues with abnormal jumps missing data temporal gaps and variations in numbers of time series data for well to well therefore the mentioned errors have been removed by pre processing the data categorised as dug well and tube well but the raw data do not classify the aquifer type confined or unconfined two dimensional maps generated with polynomial interpolation of kernel interpolation and the maps derived from long term non linear trends plotted to compare with the non linear trends of grace solutions of ten years 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial distribution of gwsa the temporal changes of gws derived from downscale grace sh solution over three time periods as 2003 to 2007 2008 to 2013 and 2014 to 2019 in the post monsoon season across mehsana and surrounding districts namely ahmadabad gandhinagar and kheda fig 2 a exhibits the gws change trend from 2003 to 2007 which varies from 60 0 5 00 to 72 42 5 00 mm year fig 2 b also shows positive anomaly gws change varies from 75 00 5 00 to 114 63 5 00 mm year but in the year 2014 2019 as the groundwater decline rate shows a negative anomaly of high amplitude by 48 70 5 00 to 24 89 5 00 mm year fig 2 c whereas for the respective period 2003 to 2007 2008 to 2013 and 2014 to 2019 mascon jpl solutions estimates the gws rate fig 3 a 3 b and 3 c according to fig 3 a the subsurface water change rate varies from 100 09 6 12 to 78 39 6 12 mm year same as grace sh solution during the intermediate period from 2008 to 2013 shows positive bias gws varying rate as 17 5 6 12 to 28 33 6 12 mm year 2014 to 2019 shows a high rate of groundwater declining anomaly as 46 58 6 12 to 28 32 6 12 mm year both downscale grace sh and jpl mascon solutions have shown the same groundwater storage changing manner and marked volatile change of the groundwater store from 2014 to 2019 the spatial distribution of average gwsa in the post monsoon season from 2003 to 2019 derived from downscaled grace sh and jpl mascon across the mehsana and surrounding districts gwsa 0 25 has exhibited variation from 7 00 5 00 to 45 00 5 00 mm year in and around mehsana by fig 4 a the gwsa 0 5 represents the range in between 80 00 6 12 and 60 00 6 12 mm year fig 4 c in both solutions mehsana district experiences declining gwsa throughout the period and which marked depletion of gws in mehsana district in both water management level scale and regional level scale but grace sh derived average gws change rate exhibits detail spatial distribution image with long range variation respect to mascon solution the present study uncertainties of grace solutions derived gwsa include inherent grace data errors propagation of bias leakage errors of grace data and error accumulated in the land surface model gldas data fig 4 b and d shows the two dimensional maps of uncertainty accumulated with grace solutions downscaled grace sh shows 15 04 mm year maximum uncertainty and jpl mascon shows 8 50 mm year as the highest error grace sh shows more excellent uncertainty value than jpl mascon due to the usage of more components including components of hydrology fluxes 4 2 temporal gwsa trends of downscaled grace sh and jpl mascon the seasonal component is a significant character in the long term hydrological time series like groundwater storage level precipitation or streamflow and removing of accumulated seasonal effect is essential to identify actual scenario which has been happening related to the considering component over the period the long term monthly average gws changing signals decomposed on applying traditional seasonal component calculating method known as the centred moving average the seasonal component obtained from both grace sh and mascon solutions shows a significant correlation with amplitudes and patterns of both seasonal factors derived from the two grace solutions fig 5 the non linear trends of groundwater storage change show a dashed line that exhibits raw signal from jpl mascon grace solutions and a solid line represents a non linear trend of the fluctuation of gws deseasonalisation fig 6 the remarked linear trends of deseasonalised non linear trends of gwsa shown for three different periods 2003 to 2007 2008 to 2013 and 2014 to 2019 respectively the graphs have highlighted the negative correlation of downscaled grace sh and mascon jpl fig 7 a c the disagreement between grace sh and mascon jpl solutions correlates partially to different processing standards of the grace sh solution and mascon whereas the unfiltered sh solutions and unconstrained mascon solution specially jpl mascon show a significant correlation as both are level 1 data as well as relies on the same primary grace satellite data and the models used for removing atmospheric oceanic and tidal signals however after data pre processing jpl mascon used at regional to the global scale and sh is only applicable to the global scale because the higher land signals leaks to lower oceanic signals scanlon et al 2016 the other reason is that jpl mascon used global 3 equal area of spherical cap mascon whereas csr mascon uses a collection of hexagonal tiles which has 1 longitudinal distance at the equator jing et al 2020 watkins et al 2015 in the present study downscaling of grace sh show more significant signal than mascon jpl while taking into consideration the trends of gwsa as well as the spatial distribution of gwsa according to the plotted slope values downscale grace sh show high gws decline rates in all three periods compared to the jpl mascon derived slope values the 2014 2019 period marks a negative anomaly linear gws changing of 104 91 5 00 mm year fig 8 the mascon does not show significant variation in gws changing velocities for the three different periods in the study area it offers a maximum linear rate of 8 14 5 00 mm year in 2008 2013 fig 8 the current research observed groundwater depletion velocities as 1 91 5 00 mm year 66 03 5 00 mm year and 95 49 5 00 mm year from grace sh and 5 71 6 12 mm year 8 14 6 12 mm year and 1 43 6 12 mm year from jpl mascon solution these velocity values calculated for 2003 2007 2008 2013 and 2014 2019 periods respectively and also correlate closely with the gps measurements of the previous research though filtered grace sh shows less sensitivity with gps measurements jpl mascon has represented close compliment but the downscaled sh solution of the present study has derived enhanced values like 1 91 5 00 mm year 66 03 5 00 mm year and 95 49 5 00 mm year for the same periods respectively therefore downscale grace sh can derive more enhanced results for groundwater dwindling respect to mascon and gps measurements both grace solution derived declining slope values and each period slope value derived mass loss has shown in table 4 the previous records had been highlighted groundwater lessening in and around northern gujarat region since 1960 ahmedabad had shown groundwater level decline rate as 2 4 m year for 1960 1995 gupte 2011 gandhinagar had marked groundwater level decline as 1 5 m year for 1986 2000 p gupte 2011 and 1 3 m year for 2009 2017 chopra et al 2013 mehsana has experience groundwater level falling 3 6 m year for 2003 to 2012 sinha 2014 as observed by previous researches long term groundwater level decline leads to land subsidence many urbanise cities in the world chopra et al 2013 sun et al 1999 teatini et al 2006 zhu et al 2015 the trends values of storage loss derived from downscale sh shows 0 14 0 54 km3 year as a minimum and 7 40 0 54 km3 year storage degradation across the northern gujarat for 2003 to 2019 table 4 thus enhancement of ground deformation in northern gujarat region can be catalysis by the water mass loss 4 3 the comparison between grace solutions and in situ well data some researchers suggested that twsa monitored by grace satellite provides unique and integrative measurement and it does not have direct analogue with ground based values scanlon et al 2016 but the recent studies done across the groundwater stress region in india has shown higher agreement with in situ well in phase and amplitude both sarkar et al 2020 therefore gwsa obtained from grace sh 0 25 and jpl mascon 0 5 have been compared with groundwater level anomaly of the period from 2005 to 2015 across the mehsana and the surrounding districts due to low spatial resolution of grace solutions derived from grace for temporal changes in gws do not coincide with the real time changes the jpl mascon derived gwsa downscaling grace sh derived gwsa shows a close relationship with the anomaly of groundwater well data the estimated gwsa from downscaled grace sh shows groundwater level upliftment or depletion as represented by the anomaly of in situ well data fig 9 it implies that the utter impact of gravity changes as driven by the total mass change in the current year has been reflected one year later by grace the correlation coefficient estimated between the downscaled grace sh derived gws and groundwater level data is 0 64 and the corelation coefficient calculated between jpl mascon derived gws and groundwater level data is 0 22 this variation in numbers is because the jpl mascon data overestimates the value of gws decreasing trend as compared to grace sh data jing et al 2019 according to the previous researches carried out in low altitude areas observes the response of gravity due to variation in water mass as reflected by grace data after two months of change in mass the possible reason for it can be precipitation which plays a dominant role in terrestrial water storage changes over tropical regions and the combined process between hydrological fluxes like precipitation evapotranspiration and surface runoff doesnot finish off instantly on a large area ning et al 2014 5 conclusion mehsana district in gujarat faces critical groundwater development issues with 151 17 of groundwater over exploiting over eight talukas in the district since 2004 despite grace mascon providing regional scale measurements for twsa it has been a challenge to apply in water management scale studies the present research overcomes the limitation mentioned above of grace by employing a statistical regression based grace data downscaling model for a period of 15 years grace sh and jpl mascon has shown a negative correlation with gwsa trends also validated by previous studies this comprehensive research hingeson the comparison of different grace solutions with the variations in basin size climate and intensity of irrigation identified that different grace solution possesses various merits with above variabilities for instance csr mascon shows higher uncertainty compared to jpl mascon with large scale basins the model developed in this study is only applicable to post monsoon season across the arid northern gujarat region therefore the study has encouraged in carrying out grace solutions downscaling with different basin scale under different climatic conditions the both grace solution marked the dwindling gwsa in and around mehsana district the downscaling of sh derived gwsa compares positively with the pattern of the groundwater level fluctuating data anomaly than the jpl mascon derived gwsa the upliftment or decline in a year s value of ground well data anomaly observed in the next year s calculated grace sh anomaly therefore the study around mehsana block of northern cambay basin indicates ground deformation around the district declaration of competing interest the

11960,the elementary objective of this current study estimates groundwater limitation in the mehsana district of gujarat by the aid of downscaling grace gravity recovery and climate experiment spherical harmonics sh and jet propulsion laboratory jpl mascon regional solutions data a set of post monsoonal data from 2003 to 2019 is taken for this research and evaluated with a statistical model derived from empirical regression the grace data spherical harmonics derived terrestrial water storage tws and analysis of regional scale solution of grace jpl mascon estimates the groundwater storage anomaly gwsa both the grace solutions observe a negative anomaly of groundwater storage gws change across the study area for these 15 years with 60 33 5 00 mm year and 80 00 6 12 mm year from downscaled grace sh and jpl mascon respectively downscaling sh solutions has given 0 14 0 54 km3 year 5 12 0 54 km3 year and 7 40 0 54 km3 year and jpl mascon has derived 0 44 0 43 km3 year 0 63 0 43 km3 year and 0 11 0 43 km3 year mass loss across northern gujarat for 2003 to 2007 2008 to 2013 and 2014 to 2019 respectively therefore a highly correlated groundwater declining rates and mass loss exists between downscaling grace sh and jpl mascon but the total correlation between downscaling grace sh derived gwsa and ground well data anomaly is higher compared to the correlation between jpl mascon anomaly and ground data anomaly also downscaling sh has shown sensitive estimation with gws change at a significant rate while comparing with jpl mascon derivations by overcoming the signal loss of the filtered sh solutions thus the study implies that statistical regression can downscale the grace sh solution successfully and is applicable for water management scale studies graphical abstract image 1 keywords grace spherical harmonics downscaling jpl mascon gwsa dwindling 1 introduction groundwater is one of the demandable sources around the globe and used in a surplus amount especially in highly populated regions in the world like china india and parched regions where there is lack of adequate surrogated freshwater resources like the middle east and north africa chen et al 2014 haque et al 2020 adimalla and taloor et al 2020 adimalla et al 2020 being a primary source of freshwater rodell et al 2009 some regions of india are overly dependent on it subsurface water is a crucial source to achieve sustainable goals in the environment food production social and economy due to water create the conditions for limits of life and land the overexploitation of groundwater is due to human s reliance on non renewable resources which counts on high risk over water and food production castellazzi et al 2016 khan et al 2020 taloor et al 2020 land subsidence kannaujiya et al 2020 for instance the san joaquin valley in california seems to be a suitable example sneed and brandt 2015 besides high increment of flood risk as well as seasonal droughts is also experienced in cities like bangkok thailand and jakarta indonesia chen et al 2014 coastal tianjin city china hu et al 2009 tapley et al 2019 the rate of consumption of groundwater is relatively fast compared to its natural rate of replenishment thus resulting in water tables to dwindle continuously rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 chinnasamy et al 2013 singh et al 2017 jasrotia et al 2018 2019 the first alarm about groundwater over extraction rang almost three decades ago in mehsana northern gujarat coastal saurashtra and kachchh in gujarat coimbatore in tamil nadu kolar in karnataka jaipur in rajasthan chandigarh in haryana and punjab and dewas district in narmada valley in madhya pradesh satellite data like grace and geophysical studies of central ground water board cgwb of india exemplifies that escalated rate of groundwater extraction resulted in the steady lowering of the gws level over the northern west india rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 chatterjee et al 2020 a recent study showing gws changes around water stress areas in india by 36 8 8 0 mm year 36 2 7 0 mm year 31 0 8 7 mm year 27 3 6 0 mm year was observed in delhi meerut dehradun and chandigarh respectively from january 2003 to may 2010 sarkar et al 2020 the overexploitation of groundwater effects on negative aspects of groundwater development foster and chilton 2004 mart√≠nez cortina et al 2009 and leads to the dreadful consequences that include 1 extensive and continuous drops in groundwater level over a long period time 2 sizeable seasonal level drops in water levels in wells and drying up wells in the summer 3 increase salinity of groundwater 4 land subsidence 5 enormous increase in the cost of groundwater extraction and 6 reduction of groundwater dependent vegetation including crops and seepage the negative biasing of groundwater development and future climate change impacts of drought events are well recognised deliberated serious situation in northern india due to the constant over consuming of groundwater amarasinghe et al 2007 hence the over extraction of groundwater not only develops severe water storage but alsoleads to land deformation in many parts of northern west india although groundwater is the critical component of the hydrological cycle the complexity of gws dynamics and insufficient ground data drops a challenge for estimating the groundwater storage variation chinnasamy et al 2013 tiwari et al 2009 as confirmed by previous researcher grace is a powerful tool in measuring terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa by tracking satellite orbit perturbation due to the earth s gravitational field variations but it is a perfect remote sensing tool to monitor groundwater storage change scenarios directly over a long duration on the global and regional scale chen et al 2014 with different grace solutions like grace sh and mass concentration mascon respectively grace data throughout the past decade estimate large scale gws changes in other parts of the world gautam et al 2017 su et al 2020 for instance the mississippi river basin and its four sub basins rodell et al 2007 northern china plain huang et al 2015 california central valley in the usa scanlon et al 2012 the middle east voss et al 2013 bengal basin india shamsudduha et al 2012 and other water stress regions in india sarkar et al 2020 the integrated grace and global positioning system gps data evaluate that groundwater depletion leads to ground subsidence in twin city ahemadabad and gandhinagar chopra et al 2013 although grace data can produce a quantitative estimation of groundwater storage change both temporally and spatially but it is only applicable at continental scale water management studies previous studies carried out in this region documents a high subsidence rate calculated from gps measurements which are relatively high compared to the subsidence rate estimated from low spatial resolution grace data the reason behind high surface subsidence rate 5 mm yr was overexploitation of groundwater 1 3 m year from that region choudhury et al 2018 a decline in groundwater level and over exploitation of aquifer system in this region reported back in 1960 1995 and 1986 2000 when decline rate was 2 4 m year and 1 5 m year respectively gupte 2011 the objective of this research work is to estimate the diminishing rate of groundwater storage in the mehsana district of gujarat by downscaling of grace sh and jpl mascon solution 2 study area the mehsana district lies between 23 15 23 53 north and 72 07 72 26 east in the northern part of the gujarat alluvium plains fig 1 the semi arid mehsana district significantly depends on the subsurface water resource and the rate of groundwater development 151 17 it segregates into the alluvial plain dissected hilly terrain and piedmont plain with inselbergs a narrow belt of 20 30 km width in northeastern portion of the district specialises with moderate relief alluvium gravel beds and occasional inliers of older rocks sinha 2014 the multi layers of aquifer systems found in this district lies beneath precambrian hard rocks semi consolidated mesozoic and tertiary formations and unconsolidated quaternary alluvial

2020 and gldas noah twc downloaded directly from https podaac jpl nasa gov table 3 3 2 effective downscaling of grace data the grace derived tws is applicable in fields of hydrological hydrogeological and climatic applications downscaling of grace data employs statistical method regression models like linear non linear multivariate and machine learning because it is simple widely used and less time consuming unlike dynamic downscaling piles et al 2011 in this study the downscaling of level 3 grace sh derived tws grace and grace fo mission analyses depletion of groundwater level the data downscaled effectively from grace 1 pixels to grace 0 25 pixels an empirical regression used between grace derived tws 1 and gldas data derived water storage change Œ¥s from the water mass balance equation the gws estimated as an integrated value of groundwater recharge rate groundwater discharge rate and the net rate of extraction by pumping and parameters that are insensitive to the water mass balance equation the previous work on grace states that in low altitudes areas precipitation plays a very dominant role in tws variations in rainy seasons still the effect of water accumulation due to precipitation evapotranspiration and storm surface runoff is quite a time taking process so their data retrieval becomes complicated and extensive ning et al 2014 in this study grace twsa has shifted forward by two months because of the water accumulation time lag effect for calculation of the empirical regression equation with Œ¥s the downscaling of grace sh derived twsa 10 process involves several steps in which the monthly resolution of gldas precipitation 0 25 p 0 25 evapotranspiration 0 25 et 0 25 and storm surface runoff 0 25 sr 0 25 data aggregated to p 1 et 1 and sr 1 by using pixel average method then the monthly Œ¥s1 calculated by water mass balance equation 4 for each month where t denotes the month and i represent the spatial resolution in degree eq 4 Œ¥ s t i p t

equation 4 using gldas 0 25 parameters p 0 25 et 0 25 and sr 0 25 derived grace twsa 0 25 data from equation 4 the results obtained from equation 7 subtracted from the system residual derived from the difference between grace twsa 1 obtained from Œ¥s 1 and grace twsa 1 obtained from average grace sh data and resample to 0 25 degree the system residual considered as the amount which is difficult to derive from the regression equation or uncertainty thus accomplishing as an essential step in the downscaling procedure 3 3 groundwater storage change estimation with downscaling grace sh and mascon in grace sh derived twsa sh solution uses spherical coefficients and values of each month whereas for grace mascon derived twsa mass concentration mascon and mascon utilises gravitational disturbance observed at the location of each mascon cap therefore total radial gravitational disturbance due to the cap mascon derived from eq 8 eq 8 Œ¥ g i g j 1 t Œ¥ m j r acos œà ij a 2 r 2 2 arcos œà ij 3 2

2 is euclidean distance between satellite and ground point œà is the angle between the satellite point and ground point location on the surface r is altitude and a is the radius of the earth s surface the spatial resolution of mascon is 300km and geophysical constraints can easily filter out its noise factor even in grace level 2 observations so mascon solutions deal well with mass leakage problems which is a concern for sh solutions and even beneficial for regional level case studies these reasons qualify the latest jpl mascon rl06 data product for deriving groundwater storage anomaly gwsa across the study realm from 2003 to 2019 the mascon derived twsa is relative to the 2004 to 2009 time mean baseline and multiplied by the relevant scaling factor downloaded from jpl website for resolving mass leakage error the missing month data in mascon calculated by linear interpolation to estimate the gwsa grace 0 25 and mascon 0 5 derived twsa subtracts from gldas derived canopy water

applying kernel interpolation method along with polynomial interpolation to recover gaps between data points this method allows interpolating contaminated zones of water bodies compared to other methods which do not adjust with the barriers sarkar et al 2020 3 4 uncertainty estimation for grace solution derived gwsa the pixel base uncertainty of each component including grace solutions and gldas parameters estimated from standard deviation since 2003 to 2019 and the final associated uncertainty error calculated with first order error propagation from equation 12 corresponds with gwsa derived equation 13 with grace and gldas parameters jpl mascon data associated with monthly uncertainty data and the average of 30 months uncertainty data from 2003 to 2019 used for calculating the

from 2005 to 2015 statistics of some raw in situ well observations have high quality issues with abnormal jumps missing data temporal gaps and variations in numbers of time series data for well to well therefore the mentioned errors have been removed by pre processing the data categorised as dug well and tube well but the raw data do not classify the aquifer type confined or unconfined two dimensional maps generated with polynomial interpolation of kernel interpolation and the maps derived from long term non linear trends plotted to compare with the non linear trends of grace solutions of ten years 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial distribution of gwsa the temporal changes of gws derived from downscale grace sh solution over three time periods as 2003 to 2007 2008 to 2013 and 2014 to 2019 in the post monsoon season across mehsana and surrounding districts namely ahmadabad gandhinagar and kheda fig 2 a exhibits the gws change trend from 2003 to 2007 which varies from 60 0 5 00 to 72 42 5 00 mm year fig 2 b also shows positive anomaly gws change varies from 75 00 5 00 to 114 63 5 00 mm year but in the year 2014 2019 as the groundwater decline rate shows a negative anomaly of high amplitude by 48 70 5 00 to 24 89 5 00 mm year fig 2 c whereas for the respective period 2003 to 2007 2008 to 2013 and 2014 to 2019 mascon jpl solutions estimates the gws rate fig 3 a 3 b and 3 c according to fig 3 a the subsurface water change rate varies from 100 09 6 12 to 78 39 6 12 mm year same as grace sh solution during the intermediate period from 2008 to 2013 shows positive bias gws varying rate as 17 5 6 12 to 28 33 6 12 mm year 2014 to 2019 shows a high rate of groundwater declining anomaly as 46 58 6 12 to 28 32 6 12 mm year both downscale grace sh and jpl mascon solutions have shown the same groundwater storage changing manner and marked volatile change of the groundwater store from 2014 to 2019 the spatial distribution of average gwsa in the post monsoon season from 2003 to 2019 derived from downscaled grace sh and jpl mascon across the mehsana and surrounding districts gwsa 0 25 has exhibited variation from 7 00 5 00 to 45 00 5 00 mm year in and around mehsana by fig 4 a the gwsa 0 5 represents the range in between 80 00 6 12 and 60 00 6 12 mm year fig 4 c in both solutions mehsana district experiences declining gwsa throughout the period and which marked depletion of gws in mehsana district in both water management level scale and regional level scale but grace sh derived average gws change rate exhibits detail spatial distribution image with long range variation respect to mascon solution the present study uncertainties of grace solutions derived gwsa include inherent grace data errors propagation of bias leakage errors of grace data and error accumulated in the land surface model gldas data fig 4 b and d shows the two dimensional maps of uncertainty accumulated with grace solutions downscaled grace sh shows 15 04 mm year maximum uncertainty and jpl mascon shows 8 50 mm year as the highest error grace sh shows more excellent uncertainty value than jpl mascon due to the usage of more components including components of hydrology fluxes 4 2 temporal gwsa trends of downscaled grace sh and jpl mascon the seasonal component is a significant character in the long term hydrological time series like groundwater storage level precipitation or streamflow and removing of accumulated seasonal effect is essential to identify actual scenario which has been happening related to the considering component over the period the long term monthly average gws changing signals decomposed on applying traditional seasonal component calculating method known as the centred moving average the seasonal component obtained from both grace sh and mascon solutions shows a significant correlation with amplitudes and patterns of both seasonal factors derived from the two grace solutions fig 5 the non linear trends of groundwater storage change show a dashed line that exhibits raw signal from jpl mascon grace solutions and a solid line represents a non linear trend of the fluctuation of gws deseasonalisation fig 6 the remarked linear trends of deseasonalised non linear trends of gwsa shown for three different periods 2003 to 2007 2008 to 2013 and 2014 to 2019 respectively the graphs have highlighted the negative correlation of downscaled grace sh and mascon jpl fig 7 a c the disagreement between grace sh and mascon jpl solutions correlates partially to different processing standards of the grace sh solution and mascon whereas the unfiltered sh solutions and unconstrained mascon solution specially jpl mascon show a significant correlation as both are level 1 data as well as relies on the same primary grace satellite data and the models used for removing atmospheric oceanic and tidal signals however after data pre processing jpl mascon used at regional to the global scale and sh is only applicable to the global scale because the higher land signals leaks to lower oceanic signals scanlon et al 2016 the other reason is that jpl mascon used global 3 equal area of spherical cap mascon whereas csr mascon uses a collection of hexagonal tiles which has 1 longitudinal distance at the equator jing et al 2020 watkins et al 2015 in the present study downscaling of grace sh show more significant signal than mascon jpl while taking into consideration the trends of gwsa as well as the spatial distribution of gwsa according to the plotted slope values downscale grace sh show high gws decline rates in all three periods compared to the jpl mascon derived slope values the 2014 2019 period marks a negative anomaly linear gws changing of 104 91 5 00 mm year fig 8 the mascon does not show significant variation in gws changing velocities for the three different periods in the study area it offers a maximum linear rate of 8 14 5 00 mm year in 2008 2013 fig 8 the current research observed groundwater depletion velocities as 1 91 5 00 mm year 66 03 5 00 mm year and 95 49 5 00 mm year from grace sh and 5 71 6 12 mm year 8 14 6 12 mm year and 1 43 6 12 mm year from jpl mascon solution these velocity values calculated for 2003 2007 2008 2013 and 2014 2019 periods respectively and also correlate closely with the gps measurements of the previous research though filtered grace sh shows less sensitivity with gps measurements jpl mascon has represented close compliment but the downscaled sh solution of the present study has derived enhanced values like 1 91 5 00 mm year 66 03 5 00 mm year and 95 49 5 00 mm year for the same periods respectively therefore downscale grace sh can derive more enhanced results for groundwater dwindling respect to mascon and gps measurements both grace solution derived declining slope values and each period slope value derived mass loss has shown in table 4 the previous records had been highlighted groundwater lessening in and around northern gujarat region since 1960 ahmedabad had shown groundwater level decline rate as 2 4 m year for 1960 1995 gupte 2011 gandhinagar had marked groundwater level decline as 1 5 m year for 1986 2000 p gupte 2011 and 1 3 m year for 2009 2017 chopra et al 2013 mehsana has experience groundwater level falling 3 6 m year for 2003 to 2012 sinha 2014 as observed by previous researches long term groundwater level decline leads to land subsidence many urbanise cities in the world chopra et al 2013 sun et al 1999 teatini et al 2006 zhu et al 2015 the trends values of storage loss derived from downscale sh shows 0 14 0 54 km3 year as a minimum and 7 40 0 54 km3 year storage degradation across the northern gujarat for 2003 to 2019 table 4 thus enhancement of ground deformation in northern gujarat region can be catalysis by the water mass loss 4 3 the comparison between grace solutions and in situ well data some researchers suggested that twsa monitored by grace satellite provides unique and integrative measurement and it does not have direct analogue with ground based values scanlon et al 2016 but the recent studies done across the groundwater stress region in india has shown higher agreement with in situ well in phase and amplitude both sarkar et al 2020 therefore gwsa obtained from grace sh 0 25 and jpl mascon 0 5 have been compared with groundwater level anomaly of the period from 2005 to 2015 across the mehsana and the surrounding districts due to low spatial resolution of grace solutions derived from grace for temporal changes in gws do not coincide with the real time changes the jpl mascon derived gwsa downscaling grace sh derived gwsa shows a close relationship with the anomaly of groundwater well data the estimated gwsa from downscaled grace sh shows groundwater level upliftment or depletion as represented by the anomaly of in situ well data fig 9 it implies that the utter impact of gravity changes as driven by the total mass change in the current year has been reflected one year later by grace the correlation coefficient estimated between the downscaled grace sh derived gws and groundwater level data is 0 64 and the corelation coefficient calculated between jpl mascon derived gws and groundwater level data is 0 22 this variation in numbers is because the jpl mascon data overestimates the value of gws decreasing trend as compared to grace sh data jing et al 2019 according to the previous researches carried out in low altitude areas observes the response of gravity due to variation in water mass as reflected by grace data after two months of change in mass the possible reason for it can be precipitation which plays a dominant role in terrestrial water storage changes over tropical regions and the combined process between hydrological fluxes like precipitation evapotranspiration and surface runoff doesnot finish off instantly on a large area ning et al 2014 5 conclusion mehsana district in gujarat faces critical groundwater development issues with 151 17 of groundwater over exploiting over eight talukas in the district since 2004 despite grace mascon providing regional scale measurements for twsa it has been a challenge to apply in water management scale studies the present research overcomes the limitation mentioned above of grace by employing a statistical regression based grace data downscaling model for a period of 15 years grace sh and jpl mascon has shown a negative correlation with gwsa trends also validated by previous studies this comprehensive research hingeson the comparison of different grace solutions with the variations in basin size climate and intensity of irrigation identified that different grace solution possesses various merits with above variabilities for instance csr mascon shows higher uncertainty compared to jpl mascon with large scale basins the model developed in this study is only applicable to post monsoon season across the arid northern gujarat region therefore the study has encouraged in carrying out grace solutions downscaling with different basin scale under different climatic conditions the both grace solution marked the dwindling gwsa in and around mehsana district the downscaling of sh derived gwsa compares positively with the pattern of the groundwater level fluctuating data anomaly than the jpl mascon derived gwsa the upliftment or decline in a year s value of ground well data anomaly observed in the next year s calculated grace sh anomaly therefore the study around mehsana block of northern cambay basin indicates ground deformation around the district declaration of competing interest the

11961,formation water is the water produced jointly with oil as part of oil production process which in ecuador it is performed mainly within the amazon region despite this region is highly vulnerable due to its biodiversity and hydrological richness formation water is produced in large volumes contains toxic substances and receives limited treatment this research determined the spatial distribution of the potential environmental risks associated to formation water chemical composition using geographic information systems to generate risk and vulnerability maps specifically the objectives were 1 to analyze the chemical composition of formation water 2 to compare formation water chemical composition between oil fields 3 to determine the level of vulnerability of the environment and nearby populations 4 to map the potential environmental risks associated to formation water and 5 to review the current water treatment methods results show that formation water contains elements that are carcinogenic and with high bioaccumulation potential like cadmium moreover their concentration varies depending on the reservoir from where the water is extracted and the geographical location of the field the potential risk of an area is determined by its well density formation water quality and production volume and the course of any nearby river therefore blocks 15 and 57 and the basin of the aguarico river are associated to high environmental risk finally water treatment process removes suspended solids and oil while production chemicals slightly contribute to its toxicity to track environmental potential risks it is suggested periodical water quality evaluations of nearby rivers similar environmental studies and better land use planning by the local governments considering the potential risks associated to oil production activities graphical abstract image 1 keywords amazon region environmental risk formation water oriente basin oil production risk mapping 1 introduction during oil production oil is extracted in a mixture with water and gas this water is called formation water or produced water arnold and steward 2008 in ecuador most of the oil production process is developed within the amazon region which is the home of a significant number of indigenous communities and colonist as well as the habitat of an immense amount of species it is often argued that oil industry activities only affect at the operation point however there are rivers that cross the entire region flowing through inhabited areas natural reserves and oil fields as a consequence they connect the whole region and spread the effects of oil industry to areas beyond oil fields lessmann et al 2016 examples of the effects of the oil industry in ecuador including oil and formation water spills are found in the article published by guaranda 2010 in contrast of the environmental impacts of oil spills formation water spills are usually more discrete they are linked to what is considered an invisible threat becerra et al 2013 which means that a community perceives that a threat less dangerous than it actually is mo√±ino and galdos 2008 developed an investigation about the consequences on the health of populations due to the contamination produced by oil and formation water spills while bravo 2007 describes the effects of formation water when it reaches any body of water the chemical composition of formation water is complex as it is brine or salty in quality and may contain toxic substances such as hydrocarbons dissolved solids heavy metals high concentration of salts and gases arnold and steward 2008 in addition chemicals are added to oil water separation processes which are usually empirical to a great extent wang et al 2015 therefore formation water can be highly toxic to human health and the environment at the present time ecuador produces around two million barrels 320 000 m3 of formation water per day which is a significant volume in addition the water proportion at ecuadorian oil fields is near 80 this means that oil companies in ecuador produce more water than oil petroamazonas e p 2019 the formation water produced from all the wells in an oil field is directed to a central processing station where it is collected separated from oil treated and stored before its final disposal arnold and steward 2008 the treatment given to formation water varies depending on the quality parameters required and its final disposal in ecuador this information is found at the raohe reglamento ambiental para las operaciones hidrocarbur√≠feras en el ecuador environmental regulations for hydrocarbon operations in ecuador which recommends reinjection as a method of reduction treatment and disposal nevertheless reinjection water requires minimal treatment as the objective is mainly to reduce the hydrocarbon content arnold and steward 2008 shams et al 2007 as a result formation water cannot be considered safe even after its treatment considering formation water toxicity its limited treatment and large production volume within a highly vulnerable area the main purpose of this research was to determine the spatial distribution of the potential environmental risks associated to formation water chemical composition specifically the objectives were 1 to analyze the chemical composition of formation water 2 to compare formation water chemical composition between oil fields 3 to determine the level of vulnerability of the environment and nearby populations 4 to map the potential environmental risks associated to formation water and 5 to review the current water treatment methods arcgis was used to perform the spatial analysis manage geographic data show the relation between threats formation water and vulnerabilities inhabited areas and ecosystems and share the results obtained the importance of this research is that it is the first regional study that attempted to understand and describe formation water chemical composition and its effects on human health and the environment to then delimit the areas associated to the highest potential risk due to formation water production the results obtained will give the environmental authorities and oil companies a better vision of the potential environmental risks associated to formation water composition in this way the oil industry will be able to evaluate their prevention and contingency plans as well as their water treatment facilities and redesign them if needed this would optimize its fluids production and water treatment processes furthermore knowing the spatial distribution of the potential risks would allow a better planning for land use and the creation corrective and monitoring plans 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area of this project is located within the amazon region at the northern part of the oriente basin in ecuador fig 1 it is made up of 11 oil blocks all of them operated by petroamazonas e p which is the national oil operator company the production of these blocks represents the 70 of the total oil production of the country petroamazonas e p 2019 within the study area 90 of the oil production comes from u t and hollin reservoirs petroamazonas ep 2018 therefore this project analyzed and mapped the potential risk associated to the chemical composition of formation water produced from these three reservoirs at the oil fields within the study area 2 2 water composition analysis to analyze the chemical composition of formation water a total of 312 formation water physicochemical analyses records provided by petroamazonas e p were used they were from the oil fields at blocks 07 56 57 58 and 61 in these analyses were by well and reservoir the concentration present in formation water of sodium magnesium calcium barium chloride iron sulfate and hydrogen sulfide the analyses also had the api quality of the oil produced this information was classified by block and then by reservoir u t and hollin sodium magnesium calcium and chloride were considered as a general salinity measure for block 61 there were analyses of metals and heavy metals present in formation water these analyses had the concentration of aluminum arsenic beryllium boron cadmium cobalt cooper cyanide chromium fluoride lead lithium manganese mercury molybdenum nickel nitrates nitrites selenium total petroleum hydrocarbons dissolved in formation water vanadium and zinc this information was classified only by reservoir the concentration of each component was compared with the world health organization recommendations for water consumption supplementary materials appendix a for all compounds which concentrations were above the recommended one or close to it their health effects or toxicity and bioaccumulation potential were evaluated 2 3 risk mapping for this project risk was considered as the point where the threats and vulnerabilities meet to generate the potential risk map it was proposed a risk measure which considers the multiplication of three risk factors that were formation water composition water production volume and well density the layers used to generate the risk maps were from different sources from diva gis was downloaded the ecuadorian limits layer the layers of inhabited areas natural reserves and river were from the webpage of the sni sistema nacional de informaci√≥n national information system the pras programa de reparaci√≥n ambiental y social environmental and social reparation program provided us the coordinates of the oil wells and central stations the layers of the oil blocks and fields was obtained from the bachelor s thesis of gordillo vallejo 2017 finally the biodiversity layer was created by adding the raster layers of biodiversity from mapping org web page the analysis performed serves as a general picture of potential risk due to formation water chemical composition the specific risk and real impacts should be evaluated in detail for each area 2 3 1 water composition factor the water composition risk factor of each oil field was given by the percentage of water produced from each reservoir the concentration of each component and its risk index the concentration of formation water components depends on the reservoir from where the water is produced and the geographical location of the oil field while their risk index is given by their health effects or toxicity and bioaccumulation potential the risk index value for all compounds which concentration was above the maximum recommended one or close to it was assigned according to their health effects or toxicity and potential for bioaccumulation based on who guidelines who 2017 and other references it was given special priority to bioaccumulation as it remains and magnifies in nature the risk index values potential health effects and potential for bioaccumulation for the analyzed compounds are at the supplementary materials appendix a the concentration of formation water components is given by the reservoir from where the water is extracted and the geographical location of the oil field the components considered to map the water composition risk factor were salinity barium sulfate and hydrogen sulfide the qualitative variation of their concentration depending on the geographical location of the oil field is at table 1 for each component values from 1 to 3 were set to quantify respectively a low medium and high concentration to approximate the concentration of formation water components at the areas with no information arcgis interpolation tools were used for u and t reservoirs the idw interpolation tool was used while for hollin reservoir the tool kriging with linear model two different interpolation tools were required because of the data distribution in a same location the concentration of formation water components varies depending on the reservoir from where the water comes from this qualitative variation is at table 2 to differentiate whether the water comes from a reservoir with a high medium or low concentration of a specific component the value obtained from each component raster layer was multiplied by a factor from 1 to 3 respectively for calculating the proportion in which each reservoir contributes to the total water production the official list of nomenclature listado oficial de nomenclatura of petroamazonas e p was used in this document are all the wells drilled up to 2018 and their perforations at the different reservoirs for each field the number of wells drilled and their perforations at each reservoir were counted considering that a larger number of perforations at a reservoir means more water production volume from it the equations below were used to calculate the value of the water composition risk factor 1 u r i s k u p r o d u c t i o n u s a l i n i t y r i s k s a l i n i t y u b a r i s k b a u s o 4 r i s k s o 4 u h 2 s r i s k h 2 s 2 t r i s k t p

the official list of nomenclature of petroamazonas e p the number of wells drilled in each oil field was counted and then normalized by the area of the field in which they are located it was assumed that all wells drilled were production wells 2 3 3 water production volume risk factor to approximate the water production volume of each oil field the operations executive summary resumen ejecutivo de operaciones of petroamazonas e p was used in this document is the daily production volume of oil gas and water of each activo 1 1 activo a group of oil fields that are located close to each other but may or may not be within the same block it is the administrative division that petroamazonas e p uses to manage its oil fields it was taken into account the average water production volume from january to june 2019 the water production volume of each activo was normalized by the number of wells drilled in it assuming that all oil fields within the activo produce the same amount of water 2 4 vulnerability analysis and mapping vulnerability is the quality of being easily hurt or attacked by a threat this study considered analyzed and mapped the vulnerability of biodiversity and inhabited areas and related these two with the course of the rivers for biodiversity it was analyzed the amount of species that live within the study area as well as the spatial location of the nearby natural reserves and protected zones as for inhabited areas the spatial location in relation with rivers and oil fields was examined to analyze the population in these areas it was considered that cities especially the capital of the province have a larger number of inhabitants while small rural villages a lower 2 5 water treatment process to review the water treatment process it was considered the station diagrams of the most important stations within the study area and the list of chemicals used in them gallardo 2018 paredes 2018 cajamarca 2017 cantos 2017 solano and tomal√° 2015 montoya 2013 jim√©nez 2009 as the stations reviewed practically had and used the same equipment and chemicals it was assumed that all central stations within the study area manage the same water treatment process the function of each chemicals and treatment facility was analyzed as well as the injection point usage frequency toxicity and occurrence in water at the disposal point of each chemical 3 results and discussion 3 1 water composition analysis the results obtained after processing the information from formation water physicochemical analyses provided by petroamazonas e p show that the chemical composition of formation water is very similar within the study area it has salts barium sulfate hydrogen sulfide metals and heavy metals however the concentration of these components varies depending on the reservoir from where the water is extracted vertical variation and the geographical location of the oil field horizontal variation the observed lateral and vertical changes in the concentration of formation water components were explained through the geological model proposed by smith in 1989 3 1 1 model of the regional variation in formation water salinity smith 1989 the model proposed by smith 1989 suggests that meteoric water entered to hollin reservoir through the elevated and exposed section at the west part of the oriente basin this section is elevated due to the presence of the andes mountain range the geological location of these three reservoirs from bottom to top is hollin t and u reservoirs once fresh water entered into hollin reservoir and mixed with its fluids it should have flowed eastward beneath the impermeable layer of shales between hollin and t reservoirs to then reach t reservoir as water entered t sandstone and became laterally diffused within it less water would have been available to go up into u reservoir smith s study analyzed the variation in formation water salinity but did not consider any other component such as barium sulfate hydrogen sulfide metals or heavy metals baby et al 2004 canfield et al 1982 smith 1989 3 1 2 regional variation in the concentration of formation water components the variation in the concentration of the formation water components depending on the reservoir from where the water is extracted vertical variation shows that formation water from u reservoir has the highest concentration of salts and barium but the lowest content of sulfate and hydrogen sulfide in contrast at hollin reservoir formation water has the lowest concentration of salts and barium but the highest content of sulfurs furthermore at hollin reservoir except from fluoride the concentration of formation water components is well below the maximum recommended one whereas at u reservoir the concentration of all formation water components is close or above the who threshold at t reservoir only boron cobalt and manganese exceed the maximum recommended concentration analyzing the maps at the supplementary materials appendix b there is a variation in the concentration of formation water components within the same reservoir depending on the geographical location of the field horizontal variation for instance considering u reservoir at block 57 formation water has the highest concentration of salts and barium but the lowest concentration of hydrogen sulfide on the other hand block 58 has the lowest content of salts and barium but the highest of sulfurs in a similar way at t reservoir block 58 has the lowest concentration of salts and barium but the highest of sulfate and hydrogen sulfide however it is at block 61 were the highest concentration of salts and barium is but also the lowest content of sulfurs within hollin reservoir formation water has the highest concentration of salts barium and sulfate at block 56 while the lowest at block 07 in general where there is a high content of salts in formation water the concentration of sulfurs is typically low as well as the api quality of the oil produced the vertical variation of formation water salinity observed in this study totally coincides with smith s model however the bearing of the horizontal salinity variation is slightly different this is because at the time smith s study was performed oil fields at the west only produced oil and water from hollin reservoir so there were insufficient information about the others reservoirs also many wells produced from the three reservoirs jointly mixing their fluids thus it was impossible to characterize them by reservoir finally many of the oil fields at block 07 18 21 44 and 58 were not discovered yet 3 1 3 toxicity and bioaccumulation potential of formation water components formation water within the study area has sodium magnesium calcium chloride barium sulfate hydrogen sulfide iron aluminum boron cadmium cobalt fluoride lithium manganese nickel vanadium chromium selenium and total petroleum hydrocarbons sodium magnesium calcium chloride were considered as a general salinity measure as they are always in association with other ions world health organization 2017 furthermore the presence of iron is mainly a corrosion indicator so it is particular for each well and not characteristic of a reservoir or block all these compounds their health effects potential for bioaccumulation and maximum recommended concentration are at supplementary materials appendix a evaluating the health effects of formation water components only cadmium nickel and chromium are carcinogenic world health organization 2017 salinity may not be carcinogenic but is a major contributor of toxicity as it affects all major processes in plants neff 2002 parida and das 2005 high salinity levels affect the growth productivity photosynthesis protein synthesis and energy and lipid metabolism of the plant it may also cause its death hasegawa et al 2000 parida and das 2005 additionally low salinity concentrations of formation water are associated with high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and hydrocarbons which are highly toxic to freshwater animals neff 2002 beside salinity the size molecular weight of the hydrocarbon also influences on its solubility in formation water studies show that the aqueous solubility of petroleum hydrocarbons decreases as their size increases neff 2002 therefore at hollin reservoir where the salinity is low and the api quality of the oil produced is high formation water has a high concentration of dissolved hydrocarbons it is important to mention that the separation equipment is only efficient in removing oil droplets but not dissolved oil also most of the petroleum hydrocarbons dissolved in formation water are low molecular weight aromatic and saturated hydrocarbons which are carcinogenic neff 2002 world health organization 2017 for cobalt lithium and vanadium the world health organization has not stablished any drinking water guideline value as there is no conclusive evidence of their effects on humans because of ingestion nonetheless studies suggest that the exposure to high concentrations of these elements may cause adverse effects for example inhalation of cobalt and vanadium is associated with respiratory effects and some studies suggest that they may be carcinogenic kim et al 2006 world health organization 2000 in a similar way the ingestion of high doses of lithium is associated with increased risk of reduced urinary concentrating ability hypothyroidism hyperparathyroidism and weight gain mcknight et al 2012 the bioaccumulation or biomagnification of a chemical is the process whereby it reaches increasingly higher concentration in tissues of animals at each higher trophic level neff 2002 from the elements and compounds at the supplementary materials appendix a most of them have a medium bioaccumulation potential they tend to accumulate in tissues of different species but there is no conclusive evidence that they can actually biomagnify camargo 2003 jakimska et al 2011 kim et al 2006 s√°nchez bayo et al 2011 seenayya and prahalad 1987 world health organization 2000 2003a 2003b 2004 2009 only cadmium tends to biomagnify in some food chains jakimska et al 2011 s√°nchez bayo et al 2011 there are no studies that prove the accumulation in tissues or biomagnification of sulfate hydrogen sulfide and lithium aral and vecchio sadus 2008 chou world health organization 2003 3 2 risk mapping to generate the potential risk map it was proposed a risk measure which considers three risk factors that were formation water composition water production volume and well density the results obtained for formation water composition analysis and each factor are described below 3 2 1 water composition risk factor the water composition risk factor of each oil field fig 2 was given by the percentage of water produced from each reservoir the concentration of each component and its risk index the concentration of formation water components depends on the reservoir from where formation water is produced and the geographical location of the oil field while their risk index is given by their health effects or toxicity and bioaccumulation potential salinity barium sulfate and hydrogen sulfide were considered to determine the potential risk associated to formation water composition comparing the toxicity or health effects and potential for bioaccumulation of these four components salts and barium are the most dangerous therefore formation water from u and t reservoirs is more hazardous than formation water from hollin reservoir even if this last one has a higher sulfate and hydrogen sulfide content thus at fig 2 the potential risk of an oil field increases in the areas where formation water is more toxic which means higher concentration of salts and barium in it comparing the percentage of water produced from each reservoir by block table 3 the maps at the supplementary materials appendix b and the water composition risk map fig 2 blocks 07 and 21 have a low risk as their water production comes mainly from hollin reservoir which has the lowest concentration of salts and barium even though block 58 produces only from u and t reservoirs where formation water has the highest salts and barium content its risk is also low this is because at block 58 formation water within these two reservoirs has the lowest concentration of both components the oil fields from blocks 18 44 55 56 60 and 61 produce formation water from the three reservoirs so they are associated to a medium risk in contrast blocks 15 and 57 not only produce mainly from u and t reservoirs but also is at this location where the highest concentration of salts and barium within both reservoirs is therefore they are associated to a high risk due to the insufficient information about metals and heavy metals they were not considered to map the potential risk associated to formation water chemical composition yet the presence of carcinogenic compounds or chemicals with a high bioaccumulation potential may increase the potential risk from formation water produced from u reservoir 3 2 2 well density risk factor the potential risk associated to well density risk factor is the number of wells drilled per square kilometer fig 3 in this way the risk of an oil field increases with the number of wells per square kilometer drilled comparing fig 3 and number of wells drilled within each block table 4 despite that block 57 has the highest number of wells drilled it has a low risk because the two oil fields where most of these wells are located are huge due to the small number of wells drilled blocks 21 44 55 and 56 have a low risk blocks 07 15 18 and 58 not necessarily have a large number of wells drilled but most of them are gathered in small oil fields as a result these fields have a medium to high risk 3 2 3 water production volume risk factor the potential risk associated to the water production volume fig 4 depends on the amount of water that each activo produces and the number of wells drilled within it in this map the risk of an oil field increases with the water production volume per well table 5 shows the average water production per day and the number of wells drilled at each activo relating the water production volume and the number of wells that produce it the fields within activos palo azul and cuyabeno have a high risk even if their water production volume is relatively low this is because there are a small number of wells that produce that large amount of water due to the water production volume the oil fields that are part of the activos shushufindi oso yuralpa and indillana have a higher risk as their water production volume is also high on the other hand the fields at the activos lago agrio sacha and auca have the lowest risk as their water production volume is also low 3 2 4 total potential risk the total potential risk map fig 5 was generated from the multiplication of the three risk factors explained before the total potential risk map fig 5 was analyzed by comparing it with the risk maps obtained for each risk factor figs 2 figure 3 and fig 4 the results show that the oil fields with the lowest risk have a low water production volume a low well density or both despite the quality of the water that they produce this is the case of the oil fields within the blocks 55 56 60 and 61 as well as the those with low risk at blocks 07 15 18 21 44 57 and 58 in an opposite way a higher potential risk is associated with large water production volume and high well density as for example the oil fields with high risk at blocks 07 18 and 58 the chemical composition of formation water only affects when an oil field produces a significant volume of water and has a low well density such as the oil fields with high risk within blocks 15 and 57 as a result the factors that influence the most on the total risk of an oil field are well density then water production volume and finally formation water composition this means that if formation water does not reach the surface small number of wells or low water production volume it does not represent an environmental threat within the study area it coincides that the areas of blocks 15 and 57 not only produce the largest volumes of formation water but also are the ones where formation water has the highest concentration of salts and barium therefore they represent the highest environmental risk 3 3 vulnerability one of the main characteristic of the amazon region is the immense amount of species that live within in ecuador the areas with higher biodiversity are located in the amazon region where the study area of this project is located too in addition the study area coincides spatially with some natural reserves and protected areas fig 6 analyzing the course of the nearby rivers fig 6 they flow through inhabited areas natural reserves or protected zones and oil fields connecting the whole region this is the main reason why the effects of the oil industry can affect to areas beyond the fields moreover most of the drinking water of this region comes from the rivers the inhabited zones within and around the study area are mainly small villages and towns with a low population most of them are located within or near the oil fields and close to the rivers there is also a short distance between them which increases the population density of the region additionally these small villages and towns may not necessarily have enough resources like technology or infrastructure to undergo critical situations such as oil and water spills 3 4 risk evaluation for the risk evaluation fig 7 it was considered the connection between the total potential risk of each field fig 5 the biodiversity and the inhabited areas fig 6 because rivers connect the entire region it was paid special attention to the populations and ecosystems downstream the study area the main zones of the map at fig 7 are the basin of the aguarico river the river at the southern part of block 61 the basin of the napo river and block 58 the aguarico river and its tributaries cross blocks 56 and 57 just before entering to cuyabeno natural reserve both rivers cross high potential risk oil fields that produce large volumes of formation water with high salinity there are some inhabited zones mostly with low population near the course of these rivers at block 56 within an oil field and near the aguarico river is a capital of province lago agrio in or contiguous to cuyabeno natural reserve live some communities of native people such as siona ai cofan secoya shuar and quichua runa tribes mena et al 2006 there is a river that crosses the southern part of block 61 this river flows through a low risk oil field which produces relatively low amounts of water with low content of salts and then enters to yasuni national park in addition to its natural biodiversity yasuni national park is the home of waorani population and several uncontacted indigenous communities primarily tagaeri taromenane and possibly o√±amenane people martin 2011 the napo river and its tributaries flow through most of the study area they flow through or near blocks that produce large volumes of formation water and the ones at the east with high content of salts they also flow near a large number of populated areas which are mostly small ones except from the capital of the province el coca at block 07 considering the course of the napo river downstream the study area this river does not totally enter to any protected zone or natural reserve but skirts them in addition the napo river is a wide fast flowing river so the concentration of contaminants within it may tend to decrease block 58 has one river that crosses it entirely and other that surrounds its northern part even though the oil fields at this block are located within or near a protected area the salinity of the formation water at this block is low additionally there are not many inhabited zones after analyzing the four zones within the study area the basin of the aguarico river is the zone associated to the highest environmental potential risk the rivers in this zone flow through oil fields where large volumes of formation water with high salinity are produced then they enter to cuyabeno natural reserve where besides its natural biodiversity a considerable number of native people live in small villages additionally these villages not necessarily have enough resources to undergo critical situations it is important to mention that there are more oil fields outside the study area and closer to cuyabeno natural reserve and yasuni national park secretar√≠a de hidrocarburos 2018 the consideration of these fields may give a better view of the actual potential risk of the region furthermore within blocks 07 18 and 21 are a great number of rivers that flow into the napo river as a consequence the development of these areas may have an impact on the napo river basin and the ecosystems at the nearby natural reserve in addition blocks 57 60 and 61 have the most productive oil fields within the study area petroamazonas e p 2019 therefore it is expected their development and growth in a near future finally to tack the potential environmental risk of the area it is suggested to periodically perform further reginal studies considering the oil blocks outside the study area and evaluate the water quality of the rivers at the zone 3 5 water treatment process at central stations central stations are designed to separate oil gas water and solids treat the oil to meet sales specifications measure and sample the oil to determine its value and deliver it to the transportation system they can also treat gas and water before their final disposal as a secondary process arnold and steward 2008 in ecuador formation water treatment facilities are mainly separator unit where oil gas and water are separated from each other skimmer tank that removes suspended oil sedimentation tank and flotation unit which separate and remove oil and solids and filters that remove solids in this way the treatment that formation water receives is only intended to remove suspended solids and oil chemicals are constantly added through all this process the chemicals used at central stations their function injection point and usage frequency are at the supplementary materials appendix c the chemical injection point influences in the amount that may be discharged in formation water moreover if a chemical is more soluble in oil than in water it remains in the oil phase while if it is more water soluble like scale inhibitors it may remain in formation water and may be discharged with it neff 2002 analyzing the occurrence of the chemicals at the disposal point scale inhibitors and paraffin inhibitors are often present in formation water discharge stream but in a concentration well below the toxic one biocides are destroyed rapidly by reaction with organic matter so little is discharged corrosion inhibitors are usually oil soluble so they are not likely to be present at the treated formation water neff 2002 from the chemicals used biocides corrosion inhibitors and paraffin inhibitors are the most toxic ones neff 2002 however studies suggest that production chemicals only make a small contribution to the overall acute toxicity of formation water discharges in fact even chemicals which are classified as highly toxic may not actually present an acute toxicity threat to the environment just some chemicals at a high loading dose can markedly increase the toxicity of the formation water but these dosages are unlikely to be used under normal operating conditions henderson et al 1999 even though the production chemicals added to formation water do not contribute to its toxicity the concentration of salts metals and heavy metals can be considered the same before and after the water treatment process thus formation water cannot be considered safe even after it is treated 4 conclusions the present research is the first regional study that attempted to understand and describe formation water chemical composition and its effects on human health and the environment it determined the spatial distribution of the potential environmental risks associated to formation water chemical composition within the amazon region in ecuador throughout the research it was described formation water chemical composition its potential impact on human health and the environment reviewed its treatment process and mapped the potential environmental risks associated to it within the study area formation water chemical composition is very similar between oil fields but the concentration of its components varies depending on the reservoir from the water is extracted and geographical location of the field consequently was found a regional variation vertical and horizontal in the concentration of formation water components this variation was partially explained through the model proposed by smith 1989 while comparing the results of the present study with the previous model the vertical variation of formation water salinity coincides in both however the horizontal variation is slightly different as at that time several oil fields were not discovered yet and the production condition were different because of this regional variation in the concentration of formation water components formation water from u reservoir is the most toxic from the reservoirs considered in the study as besides containing the highest levels of salts and barium it has elements that are carcinogenic and with high bioaccumulation potential moreover the potential risk of an oil field is mainly determined by its water production volume and well density the chemical composition of formation water only affects when an oil field produces a significant volume of water and has a low well density analyzing the potential risk of the oil fields in each block and the course of any nearby river the areas associated to the highest environmental risk within the study area are blocks 15 and 57 and the basin of the aguarico river these two blocks produce large volumes of formation water with the high concentration of salts and barium whereas aguarico river crosses one of them to enter cuyabeno natural reserve where native people and a large number of species live the water treatment process is only intended to remove the suspended solids and oil in it so the concentration of salts metals and heavy metals can be considered the same before and after its treatment process furthermore the production chemicals added slightly contribute to formation water toxicity finally to track environmental potential risks it is suggested periodical water quality evaluations of nearby rivers similar environmental studies and better land use planning by the local governments considering the potential risks associated to oil production

11961,formation water is the water produced jointly with oil as part of oil production process which in ecuador it is performed mainly within the amazon region despite this region is highly vulnerable due to its biodiversity and hydrological richness formation water is produced in large volumes contains toxic substances and receives limited treatment this research determined the spatial distribution of the potential environmental risks associated to formation water chemical composition using geographic information systems to generate risk and vulnerability maps specifically the objectives were 1 to analyze the chemical composition of formation water 2 to compare formation water chemical composition between oil fields 3 to determine the level of vulnerability of the environment and nearby populations 4 to map the potential environmental risks associated to formation water and 5 to review the current water treatment methods results show that formation water contains elements that are carcinogenic and with high bioaccumulation potential like cadmium moreover their concentration varies depending on the reservoir from where the water is extracted and the geographical location of the field the potential risk of an area is determined by its well density formation water quality and production volume and the course of any nearby river therefore blocks 15 and 57 and the basin of the aguarico river are associated to high environmental risk finally water treatment process removes suspended solids and oil while production chemicals slightly contribute to its toxicity to track environmental potential risks it is suggested periodical water quality evaluations of nearby rivers similar environmental studies and better land use planning by the local governments considering the potential risks associated to oil production activities graphical abstract image 1 keywords amazon region environmental risk formation water oriente basin oil production

oil production process is developed within the amazon region which is the home of a significant number of indigenous communities and colonist as well as the habitat of an immense amount of species it is often argued that oil industry activities only affect at the operation point however there are rivers that cross the entire region flowing through inhabited areas natural reserves and oil fields as a consequence they connect the whole region and spread the effects of oil industry to areas beyond oil fields lessmann et al 2016 examples of the effects of the oil industry in ecuador including oil and formation water spills are found in the article published by guaranda 2010 in contrast of the environmental impacts of oil spills formation water spills are usually more discrete they are linked to what is considered an invisible threat becerra et al 2013 which means that a community perceives that a threat less dangerous than it actually is mo√±ino and galdos 2008 developed an investigation about the consequences on the health of populations due to the contamination produced by oil and formation water spills while bravo 2007 describes the effects of formation water when it reaches any body of water the chemical composition of formation water is complex as it is brine or salty in quality and may contain toxic substances such as hydrocarbons dissolved solids heavy metals high concentration of salts and gases arnold and steward 2008 in addition chemicals are added to oil water separation processes which are usually empirical to a great extent wang et al 2015 therefore formation water can be highly toxic to human health and the environment at the present time ecuador produces around two million barrels 320 000 m3 of formation water per day which is a significant volume in addition the water proportion at ecuadorian oil fields is near 80 this means that oil companies in ecuador produce more water than oil petroamazonas e p 2019 the formation water produced from all the wells in an oil field is directed to a central processing station where it is collected separated from oil treated and stored before its final disposal arnold and steward 2008 the treatment given to formation water varies depending on the quality parameters required and its final disposal in ecuador this information is found at the raohe reglamento ambiental para las operaciones hidrocarbur√≠feras en el ecuador environmental regulations for hydrocarbon operations in ecuador which recommends reinjection as a method of reduction treatment and disposal nevertheless reinjection water requires minimal treatment as the objective is mainly to reduce the hydrocarbon content arnold and steward 2008 shams et al 2007 as a result formation water cannot be considered safe even after its treatment considering formation water toxicity its limited treatment and large production volume within a highly vulnerable area the main purpose of this research was to determine the spatial distribution of the potential environmental risks associated to formation water chemical composition specifically the objectives were 1 to analyze the chemical composition of formation water 2 to compare formation water chemical composition between oil fields 3 to determine the level of vulnerability of the environment and nearby populations 4 to map the potential environmental risks associated to formation water and 5 to review the current water treatment methods arcgis was used to perform the spatial analysis manage geographic data show the relation between threats formation water and vulnerabilities inhabited areas and ecosystems and share the results obtained the importance of this research is that it is the first regional study that attempted to understand and describe formation water chemical composition and its effects on human health and the environment to then delimit the areas associated to the highest potential risk due to formation water production the results obtained will give the environmental authorities and oil companies a better vision of the potential environmental risks associated to formation water composition in this way the oil industry will be able to evaluate their prevention and contingency plans as well as their water treatment facilities and redesign them if needed this would optimize its fluids production and water treatment processes furthermore knowing the spatial distribution of the potential risks would allow a better planning for land use and the creation corrective and monitoring plans 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area of this project is located within the amazon region at the northern part of the oriente basin in ecuador fig 1 it is made up of 11 oil blocks all of them operated by petroamazonas e p which is the national oil operator company the production of these blocks represents the 70 of the total oil production of the country petroamazonas e p 2019 within the study area 90 of the oil production comes from u t and hollin reservoirs petroamazonas ep 2018 therefore this project analyzed and mapped the potential risk associated to the chemical composition of formation water produced from these three reservoirs at the oil fields within the study area 2 2 water composition analysis to analyze the chemical composition of formation water a total of 312 formation water physicochemical analyses records provided by petroamazonas e p were used they were from the oil fields at blocks 07 56 57 58 and 61 in these analyses were by well and reservoir the concentration present in formation water of sodium magnesium calcium barium chloride iron sulfate and hydrogen sulfide the analyses also had the api quality of the oil produced this information was classified by block and then by reservoir u t and hollin sodium magnesium calcium and chloride were considered as a general salinity measure for block 61 there were analyses of metals and heavy metals present in formation water these analyses had the concentration of aluminum arsenic beryllium boron cadmium cobalt cooper cyanide chromium fluoride lead lithium manganese mercury molybdenum nickel nitrates nitrites selenium total petroleum hydrocarbons dissolved in formation water vanadium and zinc this information was classified only by reservoir the concentration of each component was compared with the world health organization recommendations for water consumption supplementary materials appendix a for all compounds which concentrations were above the recommended one or close to it their health effects or toxicity and bioaccumulation potential were evaluated 2 3 risk mapping for this project risk was considered as the point where the threats and vulnerabilities meet to generate the potential risk map it was proposed a risk measure which considers the multiplication of three risk factors that were formation water composition water production volume and well density the layers used to generate the risk maps were from different sources from diva gis was downloaded the ecuadorian limits layer the layers of inhabited areas natural reserves and river were from the webpage of the sni sistema nacional de informaci√≥n national information system the pras programa de reparaci√≥n ambiental y social environmental and social reparation program provided us the coordinates of the oil wells and central stations the layers of the oil blocks and fields was obtained from the bachelor s thesis of gordillo vallejo 2017 finally the biodiversity layer was created by adding the raster layers of biodiversity from mapping org web page the analysis performed serves as a general picture of potential risk due to formation water chemical composition the specific risk and real impacts should be evaluated in detail for each area 2 3 1 water composition factor the water composition risk factor of each oil field was given by the percentage of water produced from each reservoir the concentration of each component and its risk index the concentration of formation water components depends on the reservoir from where the water is produced and the geographical location of the oil field while their risk index is given by their health effects or toxicity and bioaccumulation potential the risk index value for all compounds which concentration was above the maximum recommended one or close to it was assigned according to their health effects or toxicity and potential for bioaccumulation based on who guidelines who 2017 and other references it was given special priority to bioaccumulation as it remains and magnifies in nature the risk index values potential health effects and potential for bioaccumulation for the analyzed compounds are at the supplementary materials appendix a the concentration of formation water components is given by the reservoir from where the water is extracted and the geographical location of the oil field the components considered to map the water composition risk factor were salinity barium sulfate and hydrogen sulfide the qualitative variation of their concentration depending on the geographical location of the oil field is at table 1 for each component values from 1 to 3 were set to quantify respectively a low medium and high concentration to approximate the concentration of formation water components at the areas with no information arcgis interpolation tools were used for u and t reservoirs the idw interpolation tool was used while for hollin reservoir the tool kriging with linear model two different interpolation tools were required because of the data distribution in a same location the concentration of formation water components varies depending on the reservoir from where the water comes from this qualitative variation is at table 2 to differentiate whether the water comes from a reservoir with a high medium or low concentration of a specific component the value obtained from each component raster layer was multiplied by a factor from 1 to 3 respectively for calculating the proportion in which each reservoir contributes to the total water production the official list of nomenclature listado oficial de nomenclatura of petroamazonas e p was used in this document are all the wells drilled up to 2018 and their perforations at the different reservoirs for each field the number of wells drilled and their perforations at each reservoir were counted considering that a larger number of perforations at a reservoir means more water production volume from it the equations below were used to calculate the value of the water composition risk factor 1 u r i s k u p r o d u c t i o n u s a l i n i t y r i s k s a l i n i t y u b a r i s k b a u s o 4 r i s k s o 4 u h 2 s r i s k h 2 s 2 t r i s k t p

the official list of nomenclature of petroamazonas e p the number of wells drilled in each oil field was counted and then normalized by the area of the field in which they are located it was assumed that all wells drilled were production wells 2 3 3 water production volume risk factor to approximate the water production volume of each oil field the operations executive summary resumen ejecutivo de operaciones of petroamazonas e p was used in this document is the daily production volume of oil gas and water of each activo 1 1 activo a group of oil fields that are located close to each other but may or may not be within the same block it is the administrative division that petroamazonas e p uses to manage its oil fields it was taken into account the average water production volume from january to june 2019 the water production volume of each activo was normalized by the number of wells drilled in it assuming that all oil fields within the activo produce the same amount of water 2 4 vulnerability analysis and mapping vulnerability is the quality of being easily hurt or attacked by a threat this study considered analyzed and mapped the vulnerability of biodiversity and inhabited areas and related these two with the course of the rivers for biodiversity it was analyzed the amount of species that live within the study area as well as the spatial location of the nearby natural reserves and protected zones as for inhabited areas the spatial location in relation with rivers and oil fields was examined to analyze the population in these areas it was considered that cities especially the capital of the province have a larger number of inhabitants while small rural villages a lower 2 5 water treatment process to review the water treatment process it was considered the station diagrams of the most important stations within the study area and the list of chemicals used in them gallardo 2018 paredes 2018 cajamarca 2017 cantos 2017 solano and tomal√° 2015 montoya 2013 jim√©nez 2009 as the stations reviewed practically had and used the same equipment and chemicals it was assumed that all central stations within the study area manage the same water treatment process the function of each chemicals and treatment facility was analyzed as well as the injection point usage frequency toxicity and occurrence in water at the disposal point of each chemical 3 results and discussion 3 1 water composition analysis the results obtained after processing the information from formation water physicochemical analyses provided by petroamazonas e p show that the chemical composition of formation water is very similar within the study area it has salts barium sulfate hydrogen sulfide metals and heavy metals however the concentration of these components varies depending on the reservoir from where the water is extracted vertical variation and the geographical location of the oil field horizontal variation the observed lateral and vertical changes in the concentration of formation water components were explained through the geological model proposed by smith in 1989 3 1 1 model of the regional variation in formation water salinity smith 1989 the model proposed by smith 1989 suggests that meteoric water entered to hollin reservoir through the elevated and exposed section at the west part of the oriente basin this section is elevated due to the presence of the andes mountain range the geological location of these three reservoirs from bottom to top is hollin t and u reservoirs once fresh water entered into hollin reservoir and mixed with its fluids it should have flowed eastward beneath the impermeable layer of shales between hollin and t reservoirs to then reach t reservoir as water entered t sandstone and became laterally diffused within it less water would have been available to go up into u reservoir smith s study analyzed the variation in formation water salinity but did not consider any other component such as barium sulfate hydrogen sulfide metals or heavy metals baby et al 2004 canfield et al 1982 smith 1989 3 1 2 regional variation in the concentration of formation water components the variation in the concentration of the formation water components depending on the reservoir from where the water is extracted vertical variation shows that formation water from u reservoir has the highest concentration of salts and barium but the lowest content of sulfate and hydrogen sulfide in contrast at hollin reservoir formation water has the lowest concentration of salts and barium but the highest content of sulfurs furthermore at hollin reservoir except from fluoride the concentration of formation water components is well below the maximum recommended one whereas at u reservoir the concentration of all formation water components is close or above the who threshold at t reservoir only boron cobalt and manganese exceed the maximum recommended concentration analyzing the maps at the supplementary materials appendix b there is a variation in the concentration of formation water components within the same reservoir depending on the geographical location of the field horizontal variation for instance considering u reservoir at block 57 formation water has the highest concentration of salts and barium but the lowest concentration of hydrogen sulfide on the other hand block 58 has the lowest content of salts and barium but the highest of sulfurs in a similar way at t reservoir block 58 has the lowest concentration of salts and barium but the highest of sulfate and hydrogen sulfide however it is at block 61 were the highest concentration of salts and barium is but also the lowest content of sulfurs within hollin reservoir formation water has the highest concentration of salts barium and sulfate at block 56 while the lowest at block 07 in general where there is a high content of salts in formation water the concentration of sulfurs is typically low as well as the api quality of the oil produced the vertical variation of formation water salinity observed in this study totally coincides with smith s model however the bearing of the horizontal salinity variation is slightly different this is because at the time smith s study was performed oil fields at the west only produced oil and water from hollin reservoir so there were insufficient information about the others reservoirs also many wells produced from the three reservoirs jointly mixing their fluids thus it was impossible to characterize them by reservoir finally many of the oil fields at block 07 18 21 44 and 58 were not discovered yet 3 1 3 toxicity and bioaccumulation potential of formation water components formation water within the study area has sodium magnesium calcium chloride barium sulfate hydrogen sulfide iron aluminum boron cadmium cobalt fluoride lithium manganese nickel vanadium chromium selenium and total petroleum hydrocarbons sodium magnesium calcium chloride were considered as a general salinity measure as they are always in association with other ions world health organization 2017 furthermore the presence of iron is mainly a corrosion indicator so it is particular for each well and not characteristic of a reservoir or block all these compounds their health effects potential for bioaccumulation and maximum recommended concentration are at supplementary materials appendix a evaluating the health effects of formation water components only cadmium nickel and chromium are carcinogenic world health organization 2017 salinity may not be carcinogenic but is a major contributor of toxicity as it affects all major processes in plants neff 2002 parida and das 2005 high salinity levels affect the growth productivity photosynthesis protein synthesis and energy and lipid metabolism of the plant it may also cause its death hasegawa et al 2000 parida and das 2005 additionally low salinity concentrations of formation water are associated with high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and hydrocarbons which are highly toxic to freshwater animals neff 2002 beside salinity the size molecular weight of the hydrocarbon also influences on its solubility in formation water studies show that the aqueous solubility of petroleum hydrocarbons decreases as their size increases neff 2002 therefore at hollin reservoir where the salinity is low and the api quality of the oil produced is high formation water has a high concentration of dissolved hydrocarbons it is important to mention that the separation equipment is only efficient in removing oil droplets but not dissolved oil also most of the petroleum hydrocarbons dissolved in formation water are low molecular weight aromatic and saturated hydrocarbons which are carcinogenic neff 2002 world health organization 2017 for cobalt lithium and vanadium the world health organization has not stablished any drinking water guideline value as there is no conclusive evidence of their effects on humans because of ingestion nonetheless studies suggest that the exposure to high concentrations of these elements may cause adverse effects for example inhalation of cobalt and vanadium is associated with respiratory effects and some studies suggest that they may be carcinogenic kim et al 2006 world health organization 2000 in a similar way the ingestion of high doses of lithium is associated with increased risk of reduced urinary concentrating ability hypothyroidism hyperparathyroidism and weight gain mcknight et al 2012 the bioaccumulation or biomagnification of a chemical is the process whereby it reaches increasingly higher concentration in tissues of animals at each higher trophic level neff 2002 from the elements and compounds at the supplementary materials appendix a most of them have a medium bioaccumulation potential they tend to accumulate in tissues of different species but there is no conclusive evidence that they can actually biomagnify camargo 2003 jakimska et al 2011 kim et al 2006 s√°nchez bayo et al 2011 seenayya and prahalad 1987 world health organization 2000 2003a 2003b 2004 2009 only cadmium tends to biomagnify in some food chains jakimska et al 2011 s√°nchez bayo et al 2011 there are no studies that prove the accumulation in tissues or biomagnification of sulfate hydrogen sulfide and lithium aral and vecchio sadus 2008 chou world health organization 2003 3 2 risk mapping to generate the potential risk map it was proposed a risk measure which considers three risk factors that were formation water composition water production volume and well density the results obtained for formation water composition analysis and each factor are described below 3 2 1 water composition risk factor the water composition risk factor of each oil field fig 2 was given by the percentage of water produced from each reservoir the concentration of each component and its risk index the concentration of formation water components depends on the reservoir from where formation water is produced and the geographical location of the oil field while their risk index is given by their health effects or toxicity and bioaccumulation potential salinity barium sulfate and hydrogen sulfide were considered to determine the potential risk associated to formation water composition comparing the toxicity or health effects and potential for bioaccumulation of these four components salts and barium are the most dangerous therefore formation water from u and t reservoirs is more hazardous than formation water from hollin reservoir even if this last one has a higher sulfate and hydrogen sulfide content thus at fig 2 the potential risk of an oil field increases in the areas where formation water is more toxic which means higher concentration of salts and barium in it comparing the percentage of water produced from each reservoir by block table 3 the maps at the supplementary materials appendix b and the water composition risk map fig 2 blocks 07 and 21 have a low risk as their water production comes mainly from hollin reservoir which has the lowest concentration of salts and barium even though block 58 produces only from u and t reservoirs where formation water has the highest salts and barium content its risk is also low this is because at block 58 formation water within these two reservoirs has the lowest concentration of both components the oil fields from blocks 18 44 55 56 60 and 61 produce formation water from the three reservoirs so they are associated to a medium risk in contrast blocks 15 and 57 not only produce mainly from u and t reservoirs but also is at this location where the highest concentration of salts and barium within both reservoirs is therefore they are associated to a high risk due to the insufficient information about metals and heavy metals they were not considered to map the potential risk associated to formation water chemical composition yet the presence of carcinogenic compounds or chemicals with a high bioaccumulation potential may increase the potential risk from formation water produced from u reservoir 3 2 2 well density risk factor the potential risk associated to well density risk factor is the number of wells drilled per square kilometer fig 3 in this way the risk of an oil field increases with the number of wells per square kilometer drilled comparing fig 3 and number of wells drilled within each block table 4 despite that block 57 has the highest number of wells drilled it has a low risk because the two oil fields where most of these wells are located are huge due to the small number of wells drilled blocks 21 44 55 and 56 have a low risk blocks 07 15 18 and 58 not necessarily have a large number of wells drilled but most of them are gathered in small oil fields as a result these fields have a medium to high risk 3 2 3 water production volume risk factor the potential risk associated to the water production volume fig 4 depends on the amount of water that each activo produces and the number of wells drilled within it in this map the risk of an oil field increases with the water production volume per well table 5 shows the average water production per day and the number of wells drilled at each activo relating the water production volume and the number of wells that produce it the fields within activos palo azul and cuyabeno have a high risk even if their water production volume is relatively low this is because there are a small number of wells that produce that large amount of water due to the water production volume the oil fields that are part of the activos shushufindi oso yuralpa and indillana have a higher risk as their water production volume is also high on the other hand the fields at the activos lago agrio sacha and auca have the lowest risk as their water production volume is also low 3 2 4 total potential risk the total potential risk map fig 5 was generated from the multiplication of the three risk factors explained before the total potential risk map fig 5 was analyzed by comparing it with the risk maps obtained for each risk factor figs 2 figure 3 and fig 4 the results show that the oil fields with the lowest risk have a low water production volume a low well density or both despite the quality of the water that they produce this is the case of the oil fields within the blocks 55 56 60 and 61 as well as the those with low risk at blocks 07 15 18 21 44 57 and 58 in an opposite way a higher potential risk is associated with large water production volume and high well density as for example the oil fields with high risk at blocks 07 18 and 58 the chemical composition of formation water only affects when an oil field produces a significant volume of water and has a low well density such as the oil fields with high risk within blocks 15 and 57 as a result the factors that influence the most on the total risk of an oil field are well density then water production volume and finally formation water composition this means that if formation water does not reach the surface small number of wells or low water production volume it does not represent an environmental threat within the study area it coincides that the areas of blocks 15 and 57 not only produce the largest volumes of formation water but also are the ones where formation water has the highest concentration of salts and barium therefore they represent the highest environmental risk 3 3 vulnerability one of the main characteristic of the amazon region is the immense amount of species that live within in ecuador the areas with higher biodiversity are located in the amazon region where the study area of this project is located too in addition the study area coincides spatially with some natural reserves and protected areas fig 6 analyzing the course of the nearby rivers fig 6 they flow through inhabited areas natural reserves or protected zones and oil fields connecting the whole region this is the main reason why the effects of the oil industry can affect to areas beyond the fields moreover most of the drinking water of this region comes from the rivers the inhabited zones within and around the study area are mainly small villages and towns with a low population most of them are located within or near the oil fields and close to the rivers there is also a short distance between them which increases the population density of the region additionally these small villages and towns may not necessarily have enough resources like technology or infrastructure to undergo critical situations such as oil and water spills 3 4 risk evaluation for the risk evaluation fig 7 it was considered the connection between the total potential risk of each field fig 5 the biodiversity and the inhabited areas fig 6 because rivers connect the entire region it was paid special attention to the populations and ecosystems downstream the study area the main zones of the map at fig 7 are the basin of the aguarico river the river at the southern part of block 61 the basin of the napo river and block 58 the aguarico river and its tributaries cross blocks 56 and 57 just before entering to cuyabeno natural reserve both rivers cross high potential risk oil fields that produce large volumes of formation water with high salinity there are some inhabited zones mostly with low population near the course of these rivers at block 56 within an oil field and near the aguarico river is a capital of province lago agrio in or contiguous to cuyabeno natural reserve live some communities of native people such as siona ai cofan secoya shuar and quichua runa tribes mena et al 2006 there is a river that crosses the southern part of block 61 this river flows through a low risk oil field which produces relatively low amounts of water with low content of salts and then enters to yasuni national park in addition to its natural biodiversity yasuni national park is the home of waorani population and several uncontacted indigenous communities primarily tagaeri taromenane and possibly o√±amenane people martin 2011 the napo river and its tributaries flow through most of the study area they flow through or near blocks that produce large volumes of formation water and the ones at the east with high content of salts they also flow near a large number of populated areas which are mostly small ones except from the capital of the province el coca at block 07 considering the course of the napo river downstream the study area this river does not totally enter to any protected zone or natural reserve but skirts them in addition the napo river is a wide fast flowing river so the concentration of contaminants within it may tend to decrease block 58 has one river that crosses it entirely and other that surrounds its northern part even though the oil fields at this block are located within or near a protected area the salinity of the formation water at this block is low additionally there are not many inhabited zones after analyzing the four zones within the study area the basin of the aguarico river is the zone associated to the highest environmental potential risk the rivers in this zone flow through oil fields where large volumes of formation water with high salinity are produced then they enter to cuyabeno natural reserve where besides its natural biodiversity a considerable number of native people live in small villages additionally these villages not necessarily have enough resources to undergo critical situations it is important to mention that there are more oil fields outside the study area and closer to cuyabeno natural reserve and yasuni national park secretar√≠a de hidrocarburos 2018 the consideration of these fields may give a better view of the actual potential risk of the region furthermore within blocks 07 18 and 21 are a great number of rivers that flow into the napo river as a consequence the development of these areas may have an impact on the napo river basin and the ecosystems at the nearby natural reserve in addition blocks 57 60 and 61 have the most productive oil fields within the study area petroamazonas e p 2019 therefore it is expected their development and growth in a near future finally to tack the potential environmental risk of the area it is suggested to periodically perform further reginal studies considering the oil blocks outside the study area and evaluate the water quality of the rivers at the zone 3 5 water treatment process at central stations central stations are designed to separate oil gas water and solids treat the oil to meet sales specifications measure and sample the oil to determine its value and deliver it to the transportation system they can also treat gas and water before their final disposal as a secondary process arnold and steward 2008 in ecuador formation water treatment facilities are mainly separator unit where oil gas and water are separated from each other skimmer tank that removes suspended oil sedimentation tank and flotation unit which separate and remove oil and solids and filters that remove solids in this way the treatment that formation water receives is only intended to remove suspended solids and oil chemicals are constantly added through all this process the chemicals used at central stations their function injection point and usage frequency are at the supplementary materials appendix c the chemical injection point influences in the amount that may be discharged in formation water moreover if a chemical is more soluble in oil than in water it remains in the oil phase while if it is more water soluble like scale inhibitors it may remain in formation water and may be discharged with it neff 2002 analyzing the occurrence of the chemicals at the disposal point scale inhibitors and paraffin inhibitors are often present in formation water discharge stream but in a concentration well below the toxic one biocides are destroyed rapidly by reaction with organic matter so little is discharged corrosion inhibitors are usually oil soluble so they are not likely to be present at the treated formation water neff 2002 from the chemicals used biocides corrosion inhibitors and paraffin inhibitors are the most toxic ones neff 2002 however studies suggest that production chemicals only make a small contribution to the overall acute toxicity of formation water discharges in fact even chemicals which are classified as highly toxic may not actually present an acute toxicity threat to the environment just some chemicals at a high loading dose can markedly increase the toxicity of the formation water but these dosages are unlikely to be used under normal operating conditions henderson et al 1999 even though the production chemicals added to formation water do not contribute to its toxicity the concentration of salts metals and heavy metals can be considered the same before and after the water treatment process thus formation water cannot be considered safe even after it is treated 4 conclusions the present research is the first regional study that attempted to understand and describe formation water chemical composition and its effects on human health and the environment it determined the spatial distribution of the potential environmental risks associated to formation water chemical composition within the amazon region in ecuador throughout the research it was described formation water chemical composition its potential impact on human health and the environment reviewed its treatment process and mapped the potential environmental risks associated to it within the study area formation water chemical composition is very similar between oil fields but the concentration of its components varies depending on the reservoir from the water is extracted and geographical location of the field consequently was found a regional variation vertical and horizontal in the concentration of formation water components this variation was partially explained through the model proposed by smith 1989 while comparing the results of the present study with the previous model the vertical variation of formation water salinity coincides in both however the horizontal variation is slightly different as at that time several oil fields were not discovered yet and the production condition were different because of this regional variation in the concentration of formation water components formation water from u reservoir is the most toxic from the reservoirs considered in the study as besides containing the highest levels of salts and barium it has elements that are carcinogenic and with high bioaccumulation potential moreover the potential risk of an oil field is mainly determined by its water production volume and well density the chemical composition of formation water only affects when an oil field produces a significant volume of water and has a low well density analyzing the potential risk of the oil fields in each block and the course of any nearby river the areas associated to the highest environmental risk within the study area are blocks 15 and 57 and the basin of the aguarico river these two blocks produce large volumes of formation water with the high concentration of salts and barium whereas aguarico river crosses one of them to enter cuyabeno natural reserve where native people and a large number of species live the water treatment process is only intended to remove the suspended solids and oil in it so the concentration of salts metals and heavy metals can be considered the same before and after its treatment process furthermore the production chemicals added slightly contribute to formation water toxicity finally to track environmental potential risks it is suggested periodical water quality evaluations of nearby rivers similar environmental studies and better land use planning by the local governments considering the potential risks associated to oil production

in the amount of precipitation in response to urbanization however analysis of long term groundwater level data suggests a steady decline in the depth to groundwater level the declining trend is attributed to urbanization and population growth the increase in impervious surface coverage due to urbanization have extensively reduced the areas of high potential groundwater recharge zones and thereby dropping the level of groundwater in the wells graphical abstract image 1 keywords urbanization land use and land cover change detection study groundwater guwahati city 1 introduction land use

mcgrane 2016 the intensity of these changes worldwide during recent times is at an alarming level according to a study conducted by the world bank 2007 developing countries will have the most number of world s megacities by 2020 urbanization is mainly associated with cutting of trees and destroying vegetation in forest land and transforming these areas to build houses industries developing road networks and modern infrastructures dewan and yamaguchi 2009 these transformations are the results of migration of population from rural to urban areas sahana et al 2018 the above processes could potentially lead to an increase in the percentage of impervious surface coverage of an area the modification of earth surfaces during the urbanization processes often changes existing groundwater recharge pathways alteration of hydrodynamic framework and floodplain structures mcgrane 2016 therefore a detailed understanding of the spatio temporal dynamics of urbanization is essential to protect our environment from degradation and facilitate sustainability in the future urbanization can lead to varied stream flow conditions vegetation dynamics and surface subsurface aqueous system

freshwater shortages and declining groundwater levels together with rapid transformation of wetlands forests and or open areas into high rise buildings and shopping malls das and goswami 2013 bhattacharya and borah 2014 such an unplanned development could impact water quality by releasing toxic substances like arsenic fluoride and mercury in the surface and groundwater of guwahati city bhattacharyya and kapil 2010 singh et al 2017 therefore an attempt has been made to establish a correlation between lulc change and the declining trend of groundwater level implying those changes to temporal variation in groundwater quality was depicted and that could form a basis for a future spatio temporal analysis time series landsat satellite images from 1990 to 2020 temporal groundwater level and water quality data have been analyzed to answer three specific research questions i how does urbanization influence spatio temporal changes in land use and land cover ii what are the factors and processes associated with land use and land cover changes and iii how does degradation of wetlands vegetation forest cover and development of open areas affect the groundwater level 2 study area and data used 2 1 study area guwahati is located within 26 10 20 n latitude and 91 44 45 e longitude and is the largest urban center in north east india fig 1 the study area falls within the guwahati municipal corporation gmc commonly known as guwahati city the city has an extension project under a master plan 2025 for industrial development and to accommodate growing urban population the total planned area is 328 km2 excluding brahmaputra river under guwahati metropolitan development authority gmda the population of gmc is approximately 1 million as per the census 2011 and was estimated to grow 2 8 million by 2025 the anthropogenic activities have been increasing rapidly due to rapid growth of population and changing land use and land cover at an alarming level kumar 2017 the topography is dominated by undulating hills and alluvial plains the elevation is up to 327 m in the hills while in the plains the elevation ranges between 49 5 and 55 5 m above mean sea level patowary and sarma 2018 climate is subtropical humid with heavy rainfall during may to july and hot summer with high humidity the average annual rainfall is 1752 mm and average temperature is 16 5 c in winter and 26 c in summer the study area consists of two broad hydrogeological units pre cambrian basement areas which are confined to hilly areas and inselbergs and quaternary alluvium which are scattered throughout the study area das and goswami 2013 groundwater in pre cambrian basement areas occurs in shallow weathered zones and can be developed through open wells in quaternary alluvium groundwater occurs in regionally extensive aquifers down to the depth of 305 m the aquifer consists of sands of various types with gravel and occurs under unconfined to semi confined conditions cgwb 2013 the hydrogeomorphological units are younger alluvial deposits valley fill deposits older alluvial deposits and basement rocks in order of high to low groundwater potentiality the study area can further be grouped into three high medium and low potential groundwater recharge zones das and goswami 2013 2 2 satellite data a combination of landsat 5 tm thematic mapper and landsat 8 oli tirs operational land imager thermal infrared sensor satellite data products with a spatial resolution of 30 m and temporal resolution of 16 days were used in this study time series satellite images were collected for the year 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 to quantify land use and land cover change the scenes were collected for the month of january and february to avoid any seasonal changes in vegetation dynamics and seasonal land use activities the date of pass over the study area was chosen based on cloud free conditions table 1 2 3 population groundwater level and rainfall data population data were collected from the census report of india https censusindia gov in depth to water level was collected from central ground water board cgwb india website http cgwb gov in gw data access html the cgwb measures depth to water level during the month of january april august and november each year and these data are freely accessible from their website rainfall data were collected from the regional meteorological centre borjhar guwahati 3 methodology the satellite images used in this study were all have a 30 m spatial resolution both landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli tirs and similar spectral resolution but with different radiometric resolutions therefore both landsat 5 tm 8 bit and landsat 8 oli tirs 12 bit data were transformed to surface reflectance products using radiometric correction radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction in envi 5 5 3 software l3harris geospatial radiometric correction is a pre processing technique used in remote sensing to reduce or correct errors in the digital numbers of satellite images this correction is particularly important when comparing data sets over multiple time periods typically due to radiometric inconsistencies between different satellite sensors and atmospheric conditions during different times of the data collection therefore radiometric errors must be corrected in order to obtain a true ground radiance and reflectance values the technique produces physically calibrated values by taking into consideration the effects of sensors sun angle topography and the atmosphere for this study landsat surface reflectance products have been acquired from usgs the detailed surface reflectance algorithm can be found in the usgs website usgs 2020 prior to image analysis and classification satellite data were analyzed in detail for spectral profiles histograms and scatter plots of different band combinations to ascertain the digital numbers dns of different lulc categories for spectral indices calculation and preparation of visual composites surface reflectance products were used 3 1 spectral indices three spectral indices were calculated from the multispectral data of four scenes 1 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is a well known and widely used vegetation index that is effective in quantifying green vegetation ndvi uses spectral reflectance from near infrared nir and red wavelength regions and normalizes green leaf scattering in the nir wavelength region and chlorophyll absorption in the red wavelength region ndvi value ranges between 1 and 1 the values close to 1 represent water bodies and the values close to 1 represent dense vegetation and or deep tropical rainforests 2 normalized difference built up index ndbi was calculated to examine the growth and extent of urban areas in the study area ndbi values also range between 1 and 1 the low values typically represent non urban features while high values indicate built up areas 3 modified normalized difference water index mndwi was calculated to differentiate the extent of water bodies and built up areas mndwi values also range between 1 and 1 built up areas typically have negative mndwi values due to higher reflectance in swir band than the water resulting in positive values for water features 3 2 supervised classification five major land use classes were identified based on visual interpretation and spectral reflectance profiles these land use classes were then classified using supervised classification schemes the land use classes are as follows 1 vegetation including dense vegetation open forest and agricultural land with crops trees and shrubs 2 built up area including residential commercial and industrial areas 3 fallow land including exposed bare soil and agricultural land currently fallow 4 river sand river sands and other exposed sandy areas and 5 water body including wetlands table 2 in supervised classification the following steps were taken 1 selection of training samples from known areas for five classes using high resolution satellite images e g sentinel 2a image and google earth image of the classification date 2 generation of signature file of training samples using roi tool in envi 5 5 3 software 3 assessment of spectral profile of training samples for uniqueness of each land use classes by analyzing histograms of different bands and 3 run classification using training samples to classify unknown pixels based on the maximum likelihood algorithm a minimum of 120 spectral signatures i e 20 times the number of bands were collected for each land use and land cover classes through random selection of pixels for accuracy assessments 3 3 change detection studies post classification change detection studies were performed to detect land use and land cover change post classification analysis have been effectively used by various researchers to study urban growth because such analysis can efficiently detect the location nature and rate of change hardin et al 2007 dewan and yamaguchi 2009 visual composites and cross tabulation methods were used to obtain the changes in land use and land cover during the specified time period visual composites were produced from ndvi ndbi and mndwi images of four scenes by assigning rgb color guns to make an interpretation of what was there and what is there cross tabulation analysis was performed on classified images the analysis provides a quantitative estimate of change e g percentage and area of change from a particular land use and land cover class to another class over the evaluated period on a pixel to pixel basis a new thematic change map was produced to visualize the changes that have occurred 3 4 accuracy assessment accuracy assessment is an important step to assess an individual performance of how well a classification was carried out and a tool to interpret the usefulness of a classified image mas 1999 it is a useful measure parameter in the change detection studies for the accuracy assessment ground truth data for each classified land use and land cover classes were extracted using visual interpretation of original satellite images high resolution google earth images sentinel 2a images and authors field knowledge of the study area about 100 randomly distributed points in the images were selected to collect ground truth pixels the classification results were compared with reference data using post classification confusion matrix based on ground truth rois in envi 5 5 3 software overall accuracy producer accuracy user accuracy omission error and commission error were calculated table 3 kappa coefficient was also calculated to measure the percentage correct values based on the 1 agreement between classified and reference pixels and 2 chance agreement indicated by the marginal if kappa coefficient is 0 00 there is a poor agreement between the classified image and the reference data if kappa coefficient is 0 81 then the classified image and the reference data are almost perfect agreement landis and koch 1977 the overall accuracy and the corresponding kappa coefficient of our classified images agrees well with the reported global accuracy of 85 90 for lulc mapping as recommended by anderson et al 1976 the accuracy of thematic change map change detection study was also determined by generating samples of 10 random pixels for each class changed and not changed using envi s post classification tool pixels that fell within the area comprising mixed land use and land cover classes were discarded in total 250 ground truth pixel information were recorded for twenty five classes 20 changed and 5 not changed classes the nature of change within each pixel were determined by comparing color composites high resolution google earth images and sentinel 2a images the overall accuracy of the change detection study is 67 however if we exclude five changed classes that classified inaccurately the overall accuracy for the remaining 20 classes would improve to 82 4 results 4 1 satellite images and spectral reflectance signature the visual analysis of satellite images false color composites bands 742 for landsat 5 and bands 753 for landsat 8 show 5 major land use types vegetation in green color water body in blue color fallow land in light grey color built up area in purple color and river sand in white color fig 2 the image shows the spatial expansion of built up areas with time spreading towards south and southeastern direction from the city center urban expansion has also occurred along the east west by pass road connecting the airport on the west and the inter state highway on the east the spatial patterns of urban sprawl is indicated by light purple color surface reflectance profiles mean values of 5 random pixels for each category of five major classes are shown in fig 3 according to the profile river sand have the highest reflectance values in all the bands and these are the brightest features in the image fallow land also showed higher reflectance values but the values lie between built up area and river sand vegetation showed low reflectance value in the visible region but showed higher values in the near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum water body showed slightly higher reflectance values in the visible range but showed most absorption in the higher wavelength region the spectral profiles are mostly similar for all years except in 2010 when the range of reflectance values were narrower 4 2 spectral indices and visual composites the results of the spectral indices are shown in table 4 the ndvi values are ranging between 0 23 and 0 95 for all years but the range was narrow during the year 2000 ranges between 0 23 and 0 57 the ndbi values are ranging between 1 00 and 0 78 the range was much wider in 1990 because of a few outlier pixels the mndwi values are ranging between 0 85 and 1 00 the mndwi range was wider in 1990 compared with all other years vegetation has the highest ndvi values while water body has the lowest ndvi values built up areas have ndvi values in the intermediate range however the ndvi values of built up areas are quite similar to fallow land bare soils and open areas and river sands dense vegetation typically has ndvi values 0 5 the ndbi values are the highest for built up areas and lowest for water bodies vegetation have the ndbi values in the intermediate range ndbi values of built up areas fallow land and river sand are quite similar because the difference between spectral reflectance of swir and nir bands are comparable between these three classes the mndwi values are greater for water bodies typically 0 4 while vegetation along with fallow land and river sand have the lowest mndwi values typically 0 3 built up areas have mndwi values in the intermediate range 0 1 to 0 3 visual composites were prepared by assigning red color guns to ndvi green color guns to ndbi and blue color guns to mndwi to understand land use and land cover characteristics in different years fig 4 vegetation is seen as a red color but the color intensity increases with density while clear water is blue although river sand fallow land and built up areas all have similar ndbi values the visual composites of three indices could separate these three classes here the green color determines fallow land white color determines river sand and light blue cyan color determines built up areas in visual composites temporal change in spectral indices can be seen the vegetation becomes much brighter and denser in 2020 in comparison with other years this has also been indicated by much higher mean ndvi values in 2020 table 4 visual composites also indicated that during 1990 and 2000 the hills in the study area have much lower canopy cover which is indicated by greenish color suggesting barren hill surfaces while ndbi values did not show much temporal change which could be due to conflicts in reflectance profile of built up areas fallow land and river sand mndwi values remained nearly stable throughout the study period 4 3 land use and land cover classification the results of the supervised classification using maximum likelihood classification mlc are shown in fig 5 according to the confusion matrix the overall accuracy is greater than 85 and the corresponding kappa coefficient is greater than 0 81 for all years this suggests an almost perfect agreement of the classification and the reference data the mlc schemes identified the spatial extent of five land use classes in 1990 two major wetlands deepor lake in the southwest and silsako lake in the east classified as a water body are identifiable these wetlands with time were partially replaced by built up areas and vegetation as marked by green cyan and red color respectively in the imagery the road networks are also clearly visible in 1990 mainly because of low density built up areas with time these built up areas were not only expanded but also became more densely populated some of the fallow land open spaces were also converted to built up areas mainly in the southern part of the study area the city s expansion in the northern bank of the river and near the airport in the west can be seen but the growth is much slower compared with other parts of the study area the results show that the areas under the water body remained nearly constant during 1990 2020 while vegetation cover has decreased from 42 41 in 1990 to 31 97 in 2020 fig 6 built up areas have increased from 18 07 in 1990 to 36 67 to 2020 mostly by replacing vegetation however vegetation remained as a major portion of the land cover till 2010 while between 2010 and 2020 built up areas became the major portion of the land cover fallow land had declined rapidly from 1990 to 2000 and then declined slowly till 2020 the area under river sand had changed slightly consistent with river hydrodynamic conditions there is a slight change in the area of water bodies during initial phases typically the wetlands which were mostly converted to built up areas some of the areas within the hills in the center of the study area were misclassified as an urban area during 1990 and 2000 due to lack of vegetation but the conversion to urban areas were actually seen during 2020 4 4 changes in land use and land cover classes the results of the change detection study initial state 1990 and final state 2020 showed a reduction in vegetation cover by 40 km2 and fallow land by 22 km2 with a corresponding increase in the urban land cover by 71 km2 in the study area table 5 change detection study showed some urban areas classified in 1990 have converted to vegetation this could potentially be due to mixing of spectral signatures of two classes within a pixel of 30 m spatial resolution thus contributing to potentially incorrect classification while some built area areas have shown to be converted to river sand fallow land and water body conversion of initially classified urban areas to river sand fallow land and water body is highly unlikely and there could be an incorrect classification this has been confirmed later with ground truth pixels which indicate that no urban areas have converted to other land use classes urban areas also gained from fallow land and water bodies including wetlands however the chances of urban areas gained from river sand is highly unlikely and this could be associated with incorrect classification overall our change detection study showed approximately 68 urban areas persisted from 1990 to 2020 this could potentially be due to incorrect classification associated with low density urban housing along with the presence of high vegetation cover during 1990 overall there is a gain of 103 in urban areas over 30 year s period the loss of vegetation to urban class suggests that the trees or other vegetative surfaces were cut down for human use while vegetation to fallow land suggests that there was a destruction of vegetation for either urban use or use for other activities conversion of vegetation to water body suggests that some of the vegetative areas within the wetland disappeared during the final state additionally the loss of vegetation to river sand could be possible due to sand deposition over the vegetative surfaces typically shrubs near the river which is about 0 81 km2 in area vegetative areas gained from river sand could possibly due to agricultural activity along the river bank vegetative areas gained from fallow land and water body are also possible for example agricultural activity in the fallow land and vegetation grown in the wetland water body overall approximately 53 vegetation class remained persisted with an overall loss of 25 in area conversion of river sand to water body is possibly due to erosional activities in the river while river sand to fallow land could be due to gradual deposition of finer sediments over sandy surfaces the gain of river sand from fallow land is likely due to sand deposition over the surfaces of fallow land near the river river sand gained from the water body could be due to deposition of sand in the river bed overall approximately 39 river sand class remained persisted with an overall loss of 10 4 in area fallow land to water bodies can happen near the river or flooding during final state approximately 39 fallow land class remained persisted with an overall loss of 25 in area the loss of water body to fallow land is possibly due to flooding during initial state and become fallow land during final state approximately 58 water body class remained persisted with an overall loss of 17 in area the data suggests that urbanization has dramatically changed the landscape during the last 30 years and most of these changes have happened due to cutting down of forest vegetation and reclamation of fallow land and open areas there are some limitations in the change detection study because the classified images have already contained inaccuracies and that could contribute to the overall accuracy of the change detection map therefore it is important to have a high resolution ground truth data to validate the results for change detection study the overall accuracy was found to be 67 5 discussion 5 1 how does urbanization influence spatio temporal changes in land use and land cover urbanization is a process by which a rural forested and or agricultural landscape is transformed to an urban landscape to accommodate the need of growing population and upgrading people s way of living a large part of the inhabited world is continuously being transformed by the rapid population growth and urbanization currently there are little over 55 of the world s population living in urban areas https ourworldindata org people are now more attracted to an urban life due to benefits associated with living within the limits of an urban area such as better job opportunities education healthcare transportation communication and business in developing countries the intensity of land use and land cover changes due to urbanization are more extensive and rapid than in the developed countries dewan and yamaguchi 2009 however the impact of the changes in landscape on the natural environment due to urbanization are highly variable and complex carlson and traci arthur 2000 xiao et al 2006 dewan and yamaguchi 2009 guwahati is a major commercial hub and a business center in the northeast india and it is connected by road to all other northeastern states of india the region is also one of the major oil and gas producers in india the growth of guwahati is accelerating due to increasing population demand and implementation of various developmental projects an increase of 103 in urban areas over three decades from 1990 to 2020 is enormous and most of these changes have occurred at the expenses of vegetation which was decreased by 25 fallow land which was decreased by 25 and water body wetlands which was decreased by 17 in area the thematic map showed spatio temporal patterns of the changes in land use and land cover classes during 1990 2020 fig 6 the growth of urban areas is marked by light gray color while the areas that have not changed i e persisted are marked by dark gray color the most notable changes were observed through time is the development of i east west national highway 37 in the south during 2000 ii modernization of the international airport that has further caused major change to land use and land cover in 2010 and iii since 2010 an increase in the density of urban areas throughout the city was observed based on the high resolution satellite imagery from google earth in addition to that the growth and development of built up areas can be seen on the hills based on the close examination of high resolution google earth images 5 2 what are the factors and processes associated with land use and land cover changes the land use and land cover change together with urban expansion through space and time is mainly governed by the combination of natural phenomenon and anthropogenic activities e g climate population growth and economic development xiao et al 2006 among the natural factors the changes in rainfall pattern intensity and climatic condition of a region can influence the changes in land use and land cover because the intensity and variation in rainfall patterns can control natural vegetation dynamics as there is a direct relationship between rainfall and vegetation growth herrmann et al 2005 however the overall rainfall pattern in the study area has not changed dramatically over the 30 years period as represented by the moving average of monthly rainfall amount fig 7 a previous studies showed micro level changes in rainfall patterns associated with urban heat island effects shepherd et al 2002 kharol et al 2013 typically within urban areas and downwind regions liu and niyogi 2019 because with urbanization the cutting of trees reduces the amount of transpiration by the plants together with evaporation from the urban areas in comparison with non urban areas the changes in evapotranspiration increases the chances of precipitation in an urbanized setting than in a non urbanized setting pickett et al 2001 in the present case the rainfall pattern follows a steady trend with some temporal alterations which seems unlikely to cause any significant reduction in vegetation cover and or declining agricultural activities the overall rainfall patterns depicted here are mostly resulted from regional climatic variabilities e g temporal variations in monsoonal rain and are not related to urbanization on the contrary the population of guwahati has been increasing at a rapid rate rather exponentially during the last couple of decades and it is predicted to grow at a rapid rate fig 7b the decadal population growth rate was 40 12 between 1990 and 2000 however the decadal population growth rate had declined to 17 53 between 2000 and 2010 compared to earlier decades this has further reflected in the lowering of urban growth rate of 20 compared with previous decades this suggests that the major transformation of landscapes had occurred during 1990 and 2000 fig 6 showed decadal population growth in different gmc wards symbols are at centroid position associated with changes in lulc most of the population growth has occurred further away from the city center coinciding with increase in urban areas overall the population grew by 65 between 1990 and 2010 which is consistent with 78 increase in built up areas during the same time period there is an indication that the decadal population growth rate will peak during 2011 2021 and this has already reflected in the decadal growth rate in urban areas of 14 this is the reason why guwahati municipal corporation has initiated an urban extension project called master plan 2025 to accommodate more people in a sustainable manner and carry on the developmental work although the rate of land development follows population growth the demand for lands for various commercial and business activities have increased significantly with increasing numbers of people living within smaller urban spaces e g multi storied residential buildings therefore it can be concluded that the urban expansion is primarily driven by the concentration of population in the city that has drastically changed the land use of guwahati metropolitan areas there could be contributions from other factors such as economic development modernization and other physical factors to the urbanization of guwahati city 5 3 how does degradation of wetlands vegetation forest cover and development of open areas affect the groundwater level population explosion together with urbanization can be a driving force for increased groundwater use hazarika and nitivattananon 2016 urbanization increases imperviousness of a land surface which in turn reduces infiltration and recharge to groundwater jat et al 2009 mcgrane 2016 and thereby can act as a negative feedback to environmental sustainability arnold and gibbons 1996 as the imperviousness increases the rainwater runs off faster than it was previously due to less time available for water to infiltrate o driscoll et al 2010 therefore the ability of soil layers which normally act as a filter to pollution is impaired due to creation of an impermeable barrier thereby the diffuse pollutants from urban areas can be transported through the storm drains and directly into the waterways the groundwater level data from 1996 to 2018 reveals that the depth to water level is increasing rapidly with time in the areas that have experienced intense urbanization which is indicated by the changes in the percentage of built up areas fig 8 the lulc change map indicated that built up areas have increased from 17 to 45 in the areas that have a high groundwater recharge potentiality the open areas fallow land have decreased from 30 to 20 while vegetation have decreased from 42 to 26 fig 9 this suggests a significant loss of surface areas that had a very high groundwater recharge potentiality in the study area the demand for fresh water is rising exponentially due to the combined impact of rapid population growth and subsequent urbanization industrialization and irrigation devi and nair 2018 the extraction of groundwater is increasing through time to fulfill the demand for households and industrial activities over pumping is a major issue in the study area which is further complicated by poor regulation and management of groundwater resources hazarika and nitivattananon 2016 because urban lifestyles demand more water than non urban lifestyles kataoka 2010 thus the growth of population in guwahati city increases the chance of more water withdrawal because 69 population are directly dependent on groundwater and merely 27 depend on piped water supply goswami et al 2005 according to the estimate the pressure of population explosion and urbanization on groundwater is 79 million liters a day mld which exceeds the safe yield amount goswami et al 2005 hazarika and nitivattananon 2016 there is a general decline in groundwater level in the greater city areas kamrup metropolitan district during the pre monsoon period with a maximum falling trend of 0 812 m year cgwb 2017 however the annual rainfall in the area has not changed significantly indeed the amount of rainfall during 2010 2012 has increased slightly as indicated by the higher moving averages fig 7a these areas usually have moderate to high levels of groundwater recharge potential das and goswami 2013 despite the fact that the study area had received higher amounts of rainfall during 2010 2012 the groundwater level continues to decline at an unprecedented rate goswami and rabha 2020 observed a general rise in the depths of groundwater levels in post monsoon and winter albeit small represented by the troughs of the upper moving average devi and nair 2018 evaluated the status of groundwater in the region based on grace satellite data and observed decrease in dynamic groundwater reserves thus the increasing utilization of groundwater and reduced subsurface infiltration due to urbanization schueler 1987 could have already started showing signs of stress of groundwater availability in parts of guwahati city the likely future groundwater level scenario would be an important consideration given that the changes in groundwater dynamics have already started to show the estimate of the change in recharge and new abstraction regime needs to be studied further 6 implication to water quality and further studies land use and land cover change due to urbanization can have a major impact on natural resources especially on the quality of water air and soil haas and ban 2014 liu et al 2019 deforestation increases soil erosion in the watershed and increases flooding risks due to siltation of major drainage channels the changes in land use and land cover can modify the hydrodynamic condition of an area by altering the hydrologic cycle for example reduced evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge imperviousness increases the volume of surface runoff and therefore the diffuse pollutants from urban areas directly enters the surface water bodies in the absence of wetlands or open areas that acts a buffer between land and water for pollutants sink bufÔ¨Çeben et al 2002 therefore it is important to investigate the impact of urbanization of the natural environment and consider proper planning prior to any major developmental project and modernization of a city nih 1998 had studied detailed water quality of greater guwahati city in 1994 1995 and found that the groundwater is generally safe for drinking with the exception of slightly high fluoride and iron concentrations in parts of guwahati city bhattacharyya and kapil 2010 reported the presence of high levels of toxic elements such as arsenic fluoride and mercury in surface waters of deepor lake that receives urban storm water from guwahati city high levels of chloride were also observed in both the surface and groundwater of guwahati city borah et al 2020 gogoi 2017 further showed high levels of fluoride arsenic selenium and chromium in groundwater of the city and suggested that the groundwater is highly vulnerable to these water quality parameters a comparison of fluoride concentration based on two time measurements in 1994 1995 by nih 1998 and in 2016 2017 by gogoi 2017 of different wells was depicted to show if any changes to groundwater quality have occurred fig 10 the spatial pattern shows much larger areas within guwahati city have fluoride concentrations much above the permission limit in drinking water as stipulated by the bureau of indian standards bis bureau of indian standard 2012 therefore it is important to compare these results with the current surface and groundwater quality and study the geochemical processes in response to urbanization as the majority of the population living within the city are dependent on groundwater for drinking and other purposes a detailed time series analysis of water quality would be essential to safeguard the health of millions living in the city 7 conclusion this study assessed land use and land cover changes and expansion of urban areas in guwahati city india using remote sensing data guwahati city has experienced rapid changes in land use and land cover particularly built up urban areas with an overall increase of 103 in area over the last 30 years there has been a substantial reduction in the areas of vegetation cultivated fallow land and wetlands lowland the changes in the land use and land cover are primarily driven by the rapid growth in urban population economic development and modernization of the city during the studied period urban expansion has resulted in the transformation of land surfaces with high groundwater recharge potentiality the percentage of open areas and vegetation have reduced significantly in the zone with the highest groundwater yield fluoride concentrations in groundwater have observed in extensive areas of guwahati city during the current decades based on the assessment of published articles suggesting an alarming sign of groundwater pollution a future study is directed to understand the affect urbanization on the geochemical processes and groundwater pollution and therefore could play an important role in safeguarding the health of millions living within the city declaration of competing

11962,urban environment continues to expand at an unprecedented rate to meet the demand of increasing population and economic development the resulting changes to landscapes have increased stress to hydrological cycles biogeochemical processes and environmental sustainability of natural resources this study evaluated spatio temporal changes of land use and land cover lulc between 1990 and 2020 in guwahati city india time series landsat satellite images were analyzed using supervised classification schemes followed by quantification of lulc change over time five broad lulc classes were identified on the basis of spectral reflectance signature confusion matrix determined high classification accuracy with kappa coefficient 0 81 in all cases the results showed that the urban built environment has doubled in area in 30 years 1990 2020 the urban environments have increased at the expense of vegetation fallow land and open areas and to some extent wetlands notably the expansions of urban areas have taken place from city center to the south to the south east and along the east west national highway 37 connecting other ne states of india there is no clear indication of change in the amount of precipitation in response to urbanization however analysis of long term groundwater level data suggests a steady decline in the depth to groundwater level the declining trend is attributed to urbanization and population growth the increase in impervious surface coverage due to urbanization have extensively reduced the areas of high potential groundwater recharge zones and thereby dropping the level of groundwater in the wells graphical abstract image 1 keywords urbanization land use and land cover change detection study groundwater guwahati city 1 introduction land use and land cover lulc change due to urbanization plays an important role in local climate hydrogeological condition floodplain biogeochemical processes and environmental sustainability lambin et al 2001 mcgrane 2016 the intensity of these changes worldwide during recent times is at an alarming level according to a study conducted by the world bank 2007 developing countries will have the most number of world s megacities by 2020 urbanization is mainly associated with cutting of trees and destroying vegetation in forest land and transforming these areas to build houses industries developing road networks and modern infrastructures dewan and yamaguchi 2009 these transformations are the results of migration of population from rural to urban areas sahana et al 2018 the above processes could potentially lead to an increase in the percentage of impervious surface coverage of an area the modification of earth surfaces during the urbanization processes often changes existing groundwater recharge pathways alteration of hydrodynamic framework and floodplain structures mcgrane 2016 therefore a detailed understanding of the spatio temporal dynamics of urbanization is essential to protect our environment from degradation and facilitate sustainability in the future urbanization can lead to varied stream flow conditions vegetation dynamics and surface subsurface aqueous system contamination graniel et al 1999 mcgrane 2016 in particular the conversion of land to human dominated uses may increase stresses to the ecosystem by releasing large contaminant loads e g metals and nutrients within relatively a short span of time and impacting downstream water quality and aquatic habitats horowitz et al 1999 sorme and lagerkvist 2002 jat et al 2009 the changes in impervious surface cover increases the contaminant load to receiving water bodies due to high volume of surface runoff and hydraulic efficiency of drainage networks arnold and gibbons 1996 blanco et al 2011 lack of infiltration due to impervious surface cover reduces groundwater recharge and lowering the water level previous studies have shown that anthropogenic activities have considerably inÔ¨Çuenced urban water quality alberti et al 2003 patra et al 2018 graniel et al 1999 observed changes in groundwater chemistry associated with the degree of urbanization in mexico kaushal et al 2017 reported increased transport of major ions in streams due to weathering and anthropogenic salts with urbanization there are several processes responsible for water quality deterioration e g increased wastewater recharge leakages from sewers and urban drainage soakaways jat et al 2009 the problem of urbanization in india is at the critical level due to the fact that 16 of the world s population live within 2 5 of the world s geographical area unep 2001 patra et al 2018 in the last fifty years india s population has doubled this has resulted in the rapid growth of many cities in an unplanned manner among them guwahati city has experienced rapid urban population growth in recent decades www censusindia gov in the growth of population together with the development and modernization of the city without proper planning has made guwahati as one of the most unplanned cities in india patowary and sarma 2018 previous studies have reported large scale deforestation of the hills and transforming those areas to urban settlements have caused landslides soil erosion and urban Ô¨Çash Ô¨Çoods in guwahati city sarma 2011 patowary and sarma 2018 in recent decades the rapid growth of population has led to an increased demand for housing and groundwater causing serious concerns to geo environmental sustainability das and goswami 2013 the city is currently facing large scale freshwater shortages and declining groundwater levels together with rapid transformation of wetlands forests and or open areas into high rise buildings and shopping malls das and goswami 2013 bhattacharya and borah 2014 such an unplanned development could impact water quality by releasing toxic substances like arsenic fluoride and mercury in the surface and groundwater of guwahati city bhattacharyya and kapil 2010 singh et al 2017 therefore an attempt has been made to establish a correlation between lulc change and the declining trend of groundwater level implying those changes to temporal variation in groundwater quality was depicted and that could form a basis for a future spatio temporal analysis time series landsat satellite images from 1990 to 2020 temporal groundwater level and water quality data have been analyzed to answer three specific research questions i how does urbanization influence spatio temporal changes in land use and land cover ii what are the factors and processes associated with land use and land cover changes and iii how does degradation of wetlands vegetation forest cover and development of open areas affect the groundwater level 2 study area and data used 2 1 study area guwahati is located within 26 10 20 n latitude and 91 44 45 e longitude and is the largest urban center in north east india fig 1 the study area falls within the guwahati municipal corporation gmc commonly known as guwahati city the city has an extension project under a master plan 2025 for industrial development and to accommodate growing urban population the total planned area is 328 km2 excluding brahmaputra river under guwahati metropolitan development authority gmda the population of gmc is approximately 1 million as per the census 2011 and was estimated to grow 2 8 million by 2025 the anthropogenic activities have been increasing rapidly due to rapid growth of population and changing land use and land cover at an alarming level kumar 2017 the topography is dominated by undulating hills and alluvial plains the elevation is up to 327 m in the hills while in the plains the elevation ranges between 49 5 and 55 5 m above mean sea level patowary and sarma 2018 climate is subtropical humid with heavy rainfall during may to july and hot summer with high humidity the average annual rainfall is 1752 mm and average temperature is 16 5 c in winter and 26 c in summer the study area consists of two broad hydrogeological units pre cambrian basement areas which are confined to hilly areas and inselbergs and quaternary alluvium which are scattered throughout the study area das and goswami 2013 groundwater in pre cambrian basement areas occurs in shallow weathered zones and can be developed through open wells in quaternary alluvium groundwater occurs in regionally extensive aquifers down to the depth of 305 m the aquifer consists of sands of various types with gravel and occurs under unconfined to semi confined conditions cgwb 2013 the hydrogeomorphological units are younger alluvial deposits valley fill deposits older alluvial deposits and basement rocks in order of high to low groundwater potentiality the study area can further be grouped into three high medium and low potential groundwater recharge zones das and goswami 2013 2 2 satellite data a combination of landsat 5 tm thematic mapper and landsat 8 oli tirs operational land imager thermal infrared sensor satellite data products with a spatial resolution of 30 m and temporal resolution of 16 days were used in this study time series satellite images were collected for the year 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 to quantify land use and land cover change the scenes were collected for the month of january and february to avoid any seasonal changes in vegetation dynamics and seasonal land use activities the date of pass over the study area was chosen based on cloud free conditions table 1 2 3 population groundwater level and rainfall data population data were collected from the census report of india https censusindia gov in depth to water level was collected from central ground water board cgwb india website http cgwb gov in gw data access html the cgwb measures depth to water level during the month of january april august and november each year and these data are freely accessible from their website rainfall data were collected from the regional meteorological centre borjhar guwahati 3 methodology the satellite images used in this study were all have a 30 m spatial resolution both landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli tirs and similar spectral resolution but with different radiometric resolutions therefore both landsat 5 tm 8 bit and landsat 8 oli tirs 12 bit data were transformed to surface reflectance products using radiometric correction radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction in envi 5 5 3 software l3harris geospatial radiometric correction is a pre processing technique used in remote sensing to reduce or correct errors in the digital numbers of satellite images this correction is particularly important when comparing data sets over multiple time periods typically due to radiometric inconsistencies between different satellite sensors and atmospheric conditions during different times of the data collection therefore radiometric errors must be corrected in order to obtain a true ground radiance and reflectance values the technique produces physically calibrated values by taking into consideration the effects of sensors sun angle topography and the atmosphere for this study landsat surface reflectance products have been acquired from usgs the detailed surface reflectance algorithm can be found in the usgs website usgs 2020 prior to image analysis and classification satellite data were analyzed in detail for spectral profiles histograms and scatter plots of different band combinations to ascertain the digital numbers dns of different lulc categories for spectral indices calculation and preparation of visual composites surface reflectance products were used 3 1 spectral indices three spectral indices were calculated from the multispectral data of four scenes 1 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is a well known and widely used vegetation index that is effective in quantifying green vegetation ndvi uses spectral reflectance from near infrared nir and red wavelength regions and normalizes green leaf scattering in the nir wavelength region and chlorophyll absorption in the red wavelength region ndvi value ranges between 1 and 1 the values close to 1 represent water bodies and the values close to 1 represent dense vegetation and or deep tropical rainforests 2 normalized difference built up index ndbi was calculated to examine the growth and extent of urban areas in the study area ndbi values also range between 1 and 1 the low values typically represent non urban features while high values indicate built up areas 3 modified normalized difference water index mndwi was calculated to differentiate the extent of water bodies and built up areas mndwi values also range between 1 and 1 built up areas typically have negative mndwi values due to higher reflectance in swir band than the water resulting in positive values for water features 3 2 supervised classification five major land use classes were identified based on visual interpretation and spectral reflectance profiles these land use classes were then classified using supervised classification schemes the land use classes are as follows 1 vegetation including dense vegetation open forest and agricultural land with crops trees and shrubs 2 built up area including residential commercial and industrial areas 3 fallow land including exposed bare soil and agricultural land currently fallow 4 river sand river sands and other exposed sandy areas and 5 water body including wetlands table 2 in supervised classification the following steps were taken 1 selection of training samples from known areas for five classes using high resolution satellite images e g sentinel 2a image and google earth image of the classification date 2 generation of signature file of training samples using roi tool in envi 5 5 3 software 3 assessment of spectral profile of training samples for uniqueness of each land use classes by analyzing histograms of different bands and 3 run classification using training samples to classify unknown pixels based on the maximum likelihood algorithm a minimum of 120 spectral signatures i e 20 times the number of bands were collected for each land use and land cover classes through random selection of pixels for accuracy assessments 3 3 change detection studies post classification change detection studies were performed to detect land use and land cover change post classification analysis have been effectively used by various researchers to study urban growth because such analysis can efficiently detect the location nature and rate of change hardin et al 2007 dewan and yamaguchi 2009 visual composites and cross tabulation methods were used to obtain the changes in land use and land cover during the specified time period visual composites were produced from ndvi ndbi and mndwi images of four scenes by assigning rgb color guns to make an interpretation of what was there and what is there cross tabulation analysis was performed on classified images the analysis provides a quantitative estimate of change e g percentage and area of change from a particular land use and land cover class to another class over the evaluated period on a pixel to pixel basis a new thematic change map was produced to visualize the changes that have occurred 3 4 accuracy assessment accuracy assessment is an important step to assess an individual performance of how well a classification was carried out and a tool to interpret the usefulness of a classified image mas 1999 it is a useful measure parameter in the change detection studies for the accuracy assessment ground truth data for each classified land use and land cover classes were extracted using visual interpretation of original satellite images high resolution google earth images sentinel 2a images and authors field knowledge of the study area about 100 randomly distributed points in the images were selected to collect ground truth pixels the classification results were compared with reference data using post classification confusion matrix based on ground truth rois in envi 5 5 3 software overall accuracy producer accuracy user accuracy omission error and commission error were calculated table 3 kappa coefficient was also calculated to measure the percentage correct values based on the 1 agreement between classified and reference pixels and 2 chance agreement indicated by the marginal if kappa coefficient is 0 00 there is a poor agreement between the classified image and the reference data if kappa coefficient is 0 81 then the classified image and the reference data are almost perfect agreement landis and koch 1977 the overall accuracy and the corresponding kappa coefficient of our classified images agrees well with the reported global accuracy of 85 90 for lulc mapping as recommended by anderson et al 1976 the accuracy of thematic change map change detection study was also determined by generating samples of 10 random pixels for each class changed and not changed using envi s post classification tool pixels that fell within the area comprising mixed land use and land cover classes were discarded in total 250 ground truth pixel information were recorded for twenty five classes 20 changed and 5 not changed classes the nature of change within each pixel were determined by comparing color composites high resolution google earth images and sentinel 2a images the overall accuracy of the change detection study is 67 however if we exclude five changed classes that classified inaccurately the overall accuracy for the remaining 20 classes would improve to 82 4 results 4 1 satellite images and spectral reflectance signature the visual analysis of satellite images false color composites bands 742 for landsat 5 and bands 753 for landsat 8 show 5 major land use types vegetation in green color water body in blue color fallow land in light grey color built up area in purple color and river sand in white color fig 2 the image shows the spatial expansion of built up areas with time spreading towards south and southeastern direction from the city center urban expansion has also occurred along the east west by pass road connecting the airport on the west and the inter state highway on the east the spatial patterns of urban sprawl is indicated by light purple color surface reflectance profiles mean values of 5 random pixels for each category of five major classes are shown in fig 3 according to the profile river sand have the highest reflectance values in all the bands and these are the brightest features in the image fallow land also showed higher reflectance values but the values lie between built up area and river sand vegetation showed low reflectance value in the visible region but showed higher values in the near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum water body showed slightly higher reflectance values in the visible range but showed most absorption in the higher wavelength region the spectral profiles are mostly similar for all years except in 2010 when the range of reflectance values were narrower 4 2 spectral indices and visual composites the results of the spectral indices are shown in table 4 the ndvi values are ranging between 0 23 and 0 95 for all years but the range was narrow during the year 2000 ranges between 0 23 and 0 57 the ndbi values are ranging between 1 00 and 0 78 the range was much wider in 1990 because of a few outlier pixels the mndwi values are ranging between 0 85 and 1 00 the mndwi range was wider in 1990 compared with all other years vegetation has the highest ndvi values while water body has the lowest ndvi values built up areas have ndvi values in the intermediate range however the ndvi values of built up areas are quite similar to fallow land bare soils and open areas and river sands dense vegetation typically has ndvi values 0 5 the ndbi values are the highest for built up areas and lowest for water bodies vegetation have the ndbi values in the intermediate range ndbi values of built up areas fallow land and river sand are quite similar because the difference between spectral reflectance of swir and nir bands are comparable between these three classes the mndwi values are greater for water bodies typically 0 4 while vegetation along with fallow land and river sand have the lowest mndwi values typically 0 3 built up areas have mndwi values in the intermediate range 0 1 to 0 3 visual composites were prepared by assigning red color guns to ndvi green color guns to ndbi and blue color guns to mndwi to understand land use and land cover characteristics in different years fig 4 vegetation is seen as a red color but the color intensity increases with density while clear water is blue although river sand fallow land and built up areas all have similar ndbi values the visual composites of three indices could separate these three classes here the green color determines fallow land white color determines river sand and light blue cyan color determines built up areas in visual composites temporal change in spectral indices can be seen the vegetation becomes much brighter and denser in 2020 in comparison with other years this has also been indicated by much higher mean ndvi values in 2020 table 4 visual composites also indicated that during 1990 and 2000 the hills in the study area have much lower canopy cover which is indicated by greenish color suggesting barren hill surfaces while ndbi values did not show much temporal change which could be due to conflicts in reflectance profile of built up areas fallow land and river sand mndwi values remained nearly stable throughout the study period 4 3 land use and land cover classification the results of the supervised classification using maximum likelihood classification mlc are shown in fig 5 according to the confusion matrix the overall accuracy is greater than 85 and the corresponding kappa coefficient is greater than 0 81 for all years this suggests an almost perfect agreement of the classification and the reference data the mlc schemes identified the spatial extent of five land use classes in 1990 two major wetlands deepor lake in the southwest and silsako lake in the east classified as a water body are identifiable these wetlands with time were partially replaced by built up areas and vegetation as marked by green cyan and red color respectively in the imagery the road networks are also clearly visible in 1990 mainly because of low density built up areas with time these built up areas were not only expanded but also became more densely populated some of the fallow land open spaces were also converted to built up areas mainly in the southern part of the study area the city s expansion in the northern bank of the river and near the airport in the west can be seen but the growth is much slower compared with other parts of the study area the results show that the areas under the water body remained nearly constant during 1990 2020 while vegetation cover has decreased from 42 41 in 1990 to 31 97 in 2020 fig 6 built up areas have increased from 18 07 in 1990 to 36 67 to 2020 mostly by replacing vegetation however vegetation remained as a major portion of the land cover till 2010 while between 2010 and 2020 built up areas became the major portion of the land cover fallow land had declined rapidly from 1990 to 2000 and then declined slowly till 2020 the area under river sand had changed slightly consistent with river hydrodynamic conditions there is a slight change in the area of water bodies during initial phases typically the wetlands which were mostly converted to built up areas some of the areas within the hills in the center of the study area were misclassified as an urban area during 1990 and 2000 due to lack of vegetation but the conversion to urban areas were actually seen during 2020 4 4 changes in land use and land cover classes the results of the change detection study initial state 1990 and final state 2020 showed a reduction in vegetation cover by 40 km2 and fallow land by 22 km2 with a corresponding increase in the urban land cover by 71 km2 in the study area table 5 change detection study showed some urban areas classified in 1990 have converted to vegetation this could potentially be due to mixing of spectral signatures of two classes within a pixel of 30 m spatial resolution thus contributing to potentially incorrect classification while some built area areas have shown to be converted to river sand fallow land and water body conversion of initially classified urban areas to river sand fallow land and water body is highly unlikely and there could be an incorrect classification this has been confirmed later with ground truth pixels which indicate that no urban areas have converted to other land use classes urban areas also gained from fallow land and water bodies including wetlands however the chances of urban areas gained from river sand is highly unlikely and this could be associated with incorrect classification overall our change detection study showed approximately 68 urban areas persisted from 1990 to 2020 this could potentially be due to incorrect classification associated with low density urban housing along with the presence of high vegetation cover during 1990 overall there is a gain of 103 in urban areas over 30 year s period the loss of vegetation to urban class suggests that the trees or other vegetative surfaces were cut down for human use while vegetation to fallow land suggests that there was a destruction of vegetation for either urban use or use for other activities conversion of vegetation to water body suggests that some of the vegetative areas within the wetland disappeared during the final state additionally the loss of vegetation to river sand could be possible due to sand deposition over the vegetative surfaces typically shrubs near the river which is about 0 81 km2 in area vegetative areas gained from river sand could possibly due to agricultural activity along the river bank vegetative areas gained from fallow land and water body are also possible for example agricultural activity in the fallow land and vegetation grown in the wetland water body overall approximately 53 vegetation class remained persisted with an overall loss of 25 in area conversion of river sand to water body is possibly due to erosional activities in the river while river sand to fallow land could be due to gradual deposition of finer sediments over sandy surfaces the gain of river sand from fallow land is likely due to sand deposition over the surfaces of fallow land near the river river sand gained from the water body could be due to deposition of sand in the river bed overall approximately 39 river sand class remained persisted with an overall loss of 10 4 in area fallow land to water bodies can happen near the river or flooding during final state approximately 39 fallow land class remained persisted with an overall loss of 25 in area the loss of water body to fallow land is possibly due to flooding during initial state and become fallow land during final state approximately 58 water body class remained persisted with an overall loss of 17 in area the data suggests that urbanization has dramatically changed the landscape during the last 30 years and most of these changes have happened due to cutting down of forest vegetation and reclamation of fallow land and open areas there are some limitations in the change detection study because the classified images have already contained inaccuracies and that could contribute to the overall accuracy of the change detection map therefore it is important to have a high resolution ground truth data to validate the results for change detection study the overall accuracy was found to be 67 5 discussion 5 1 how does urbanization influence spatio temporal changes in land use and land cover urbanization is a process by which a rural forested and or agricultural landscape is transformed to an urban landscape to accommodate the need of growing population and upgrading people s way of living a large part of the inhabited world is continuously being transformed by the rapid population growth and urbanization currently there are little over 55 of the world s population living in urban areas https ourworldindata org people are now more attracted to an urban life due to benefits associated with living within the limits of an urban area such as better job opportunities education healthcare transportation communication and business in developing countries the intensity of land use and land cover changes due to urbanization are more extensive and rapid than in the developed countries dewan and yamaguchi 2009 however the impact of the changes in landscape on the natural environment due to urbanization are highly variable and complex carlson and traci arthur 2000 xiao et al 2006 dewan and yamaguchi 2009 guwahati is a major commercial hub and a business center in the northeast india and it is connected by road to all other northeastern states of india the region is also one of the major oil and gas producers in india the growth of guwahati is accelerating due to increasing population demand and implementation of various developmental projects an increase of 103 in urban areas over three decades from 1990 to 2020 is enormous and most of these changes have occurred at the expenses of vegetation which was decreased by 25 fallow land which was decreased by 25 and water body wetlands which was decreased by 17 in area the thematic map showed spatio temporal patterns of the changes in land use and land cover classes during 1990 2020 fig 6 the growth of urban areas is marked by light gray color while the areas that have not changed i e persisted are marked by dark gray color the most notable changes were observed through time is the development of i east west national highway 37 in the south during 2000 ii modernization of the international airport that has further caused major change to land use and land cover in 2010 and iii since 2010 an increase in the density of urban areas throughout the city was observed based on the high resolution satellite imagery from google earth in addition to that the growth and development of built up areas can be seen on the hills based on the close examination of high resolution google earth images 5 2 what are the factors and processes associated with land use and land cover changes the land use and land cover change together with urban expansion through space and time is mainly governed by the combination of natural phenomenon and anthropogenic activities e g climate population growth and economic development xiao et al 2006 among the natural factors the changes in rainfall pattern intensity and climatic condition of a region can influence the changes in land use and land cover because the intensity and variation in rainfall patterns can control natural vegetation dynamics as there is a direct relationship between rainfall and vegetation growth herrmann et al 2005 however the overall rainfall pattern in the study area has not changed dramatically over the 30 years period as represented by the moving average of monthly rainfall amount fig 7 a previous studies showed micro level changes in rainfall patterns associated with urban heat island effects shepherd et al 2002 kharol et al 2013 typically within urban areas and downwind regions liu and niyogi 2019 because with urbanization the cutting of trees reduces the amount of transpiration by the plants together with evaporation from the urban areas in comparison with non urban areas the changes in evapotranspiration increases the chances of precipitation in an urbanized setting than in a non urbanized setting pickett et al 2001 in the present case the rainfall pattern follows a steady trend with some temporal alterations which seems unlikely to cause any significant reduction in vegetation cover and or declining agricultural activities the overall rainfall patterns depicted here are mostly resulted from regional climatic variabilities e g temporal variations in monsoonal rain and are not related to urbanization on the contrary the population of guwahati has been increasing at a rapid rate rather exponentially during the last couple of decades and it is predicted to grow at a rapid rate fig 7b the decadal population growth rate was 40 12 between 1990 and 2000 however the decadal population growth rate had declined to 17 53 between 2000 and 2010 compared to earlier decades this has further reflected in the lowering of urban growth rate of 20 compared with previous decades this suggests that the major transformation of landscapes had occurred during 1990 and 2000 fig 6 showed decadal population growth in different gmc wards symbols are at centroid position associated with changes in lulc most of the population growth has occurred further away from the city center coinciding with increase in urban areas overall the population grew by 65 between 1990 and 2010 which is consistent with 78 increase in built up areas during the same time period there is an indication that the decadal population growth rate will peak during 2011 2021 and this has already reflected in the decadal growth rate in urban areas of 14 this is the reason why guwahati municipal corporation has initiated an urban extension project called master plan 2025 to accommodate more people in a sustainable manner and carry on the developmental work although the rate of land development follows population growth the demand for lands for various commercial and business activities have increased significantly with increasing numbers of people living within smaller urban spaces e g multi storied residential buildings therefore it can be concluded that the urban expansion is primarily driven by the concentration of population in the city that has drastically changed the land use of guwahati metropolitan areas there could be contributions from other factors such as economic development modernization and other physical factors to the urbanization of guwahati city 5 3 how does degradation of wetlands vegetation forest cover and development of open areas affect the groundwater level population explosion together with urbanization can be a driving force for increased groundwater use hazarika and nitivattananon 2016 urbanization increases imperviousness of a land surface which in turn reduces infiltration and recharge to groundwater jat et al 2009 mcgrane 2016 and thereby can act as a negative feedback to environmental sustainability arnold and gibbons 1996 as the imperviousness increases the rainwater runs off faster than it was previously due to less time available for water to infiltrate o driscoll et al 2010 therefore the ability of soil layers which normally act as a filter to pollution is impaired due to creation of an impermeable barrier thereby the diffuse pollutants from urban areas can be transported through the storm drains and directly into the waterways the groundwater level data from 1996 to 2018 reveals that the depth to water level is increasing rapidly with time in the areas that have experienced intense urbanization which is indicated by the changes in the percentage of built up areas fig 8 the lulc change map indicated that built up areas have increased from 17 to 45 in the areas that have a high groundwater recharge potentiality the open areas fallow land have decreased from 30 to 20 while vegetation have decreased from 42 to 26 fig 9 this suggests a significant loss of surface areas that had a very high groundwater recharge potentiality in the study area the demand for fresh water is rising exponentially due to the combined impact of rapid population growth and subsequent urbanization industrialization and irrigation devi and nair 2018 the extraction of groundwater is increasing through time to fulfill the demand for households and industrial activities over pumping is a major issue in the study area which is further complicated by poor regulation and management of groundwater resources hazarika and nitivattananon 2016 because urban lifestyles demand more water than non urban lifestyles kataoka 2010 thus the growth of population in guwahati city increases the chance of more water withdrawal because 69 population are directly dependent on groundwater and merely 27 depend on piped water supply goswami et al 2005 according to the estimate the pressure of population explosion and urbanization on groundwater is 79 million liters a day mld which exceeds the safe yield amount goswami et al 2005 hazarika and nitivattananon 2016 there is a general decline in groundwater level in the greater city areas kamrup metropolitan district during the pre monsoon period with a maximum falling trend of 0 812 m year cgwb 2017 however the annual rainfall in the area has not changed significantly indeed the amount of rainfall during 2010 2012 has increased slightly as indicated by the higher moving averages fig 7a these areas usually have moderate to high levels of groundwater recharge potential das and goswami 2013 despite the fact that the study area had received higher amounts of rainfall during 2010 2012 the groundwater level continues to decline at an unprecedented rate goswami and rabha 2020 observed a general rise in the depths of groundwater levels in post monsoon and winter albeit small represented by the troughs of the upper moving average devi and nair 2018 evaluated the status of groundwater in the region based on grace satellite data and observed decrease in dynamic groundwater reserves thus the increasing utilization of groundwater and reduced subsurface infiltration due to urbanization schueler 1987 could have already started showing signs of stress of groundwater availability in parts of guwahati city the likely future groundwater level scenario would be an important consideration given that the changes in groundwater dynamics have already started to show the estimate of the change in recharge and new abstraction regime needs to be studied further 6 implication to water quality and further studies land use and land cover change due to urbanization can have a major impact on natural resources especially on the quality of water air and soil haas and ban 2014 liu et al 2019 deforestation increases soil erosion in the watershed and increases flooding risks due to siltation of major drainage channels the changes in land use and land cover can modify the hydrodynamic condition of an area by altering the hydrologic cycle for example reduced evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge imperviousness increases the volume of surface runoff and therefore the diffuse pollutants from urban areas directly enters the surface water bodies in the absence of wetlands or open areas that acts a buffer between land and water for pollutants sink bufÔ¨Çeben et al 2002 therefore it is important to investigate the impact of urbanization of the natural environment and consider proper planning prior to any major developmental project and modernization of a city nih 1998 had studied detailed water quality of greater guwahati city in 1994 1995 and found that the groundwater is generally safe for drinking with the exception of slightly high fluoride and iron concentrations in parts of guwahati city bhattacharyya and kapil 2010 reported the presence of high levels of toxic elements such as arsenic fluoride and mercury in surface waters of deepor lake that receives urban storm water from guwahati city high levels of chloride were also observed in both the surface and groundwater of guwahati city borah et al 2020 gogoi 2017 further showed high levels of fluoride arsenic selenium and chromium in groundwater of the city and suggested that the groundwater is highly vulnerable to these water quality parameters a comparison of fluoride concentration based on two time measurements in 1994 1995 by nih 1998 and in 2016 2017 by gogoi 2017 of different wells was depicted to show if any changes to groundwater quality have occurred fig 10 the spatial pattern shows much larger areas within guwahati city have fluoride concentrations much above the permission limit in drinking water as stipulated by the bureau of indian standards bis bureau of indian standard 2012 therefore it is important to compare these results with the current surface and groundwater quality and study the geochemical processes in response to urbanization as the majority of the population living within the city are dependent on groundwater for drinking and other purposes a detailed time series analysis of water quality would be essential to safeguard the health of millions living in the city 7 conclusion this study assessed land use and land cover changes and expansion of urban areas in guwahati city india using remote sensing data guwahati city has experienced rapid changes in land use and land cover particularly built up urban areas with an overall increase of 103 in area over the last 30 years there has been a substantial reduction in the areas of vegetation cultivated fallow land and wetlands lowland the changes in the land use and land cover are primarily driven by the rapid growth in urban population economic development and modernization of the city during the studied period urban expansion has resulted in the transformation of land surfaces with high groundwater recharge potentiality the percentage of open areas and vegetation have reduced significantly in the zone with the highest groundwater yield fluoride concentrations in groundwater have observed in extensive areas of guwahati city during the current decades based on the assessment of published articles suggesting an alarming sign of groundwater pollution a future study is directed to understand the affect urbanization on the geochemical processes and groundwater pollution and therefore could play an important role in safeguarding the health of millions living within the city declaration of competing

introduction pollution of groundwater and increasing salinity in the azarshahr and shabestar sufyan plains located in the northwest of iran are major concerns for water supply in these regions the values of electrical conductivity of the sampled groundwater of these areas vary between 301 Œºs cm and 262 000 Œºs cm aquifer salinity is affected by different interlinked and complex processes the variations in river flow evaporation and precipitation quickly affect groundwater salinity and circulation patterns mashiatullah et al 2002 khaledi bieitari and fatahi 2011 and mahsafar et al 2011 have shown that the changes in groundwater salinity are because of decrease of the water level in urmia lake as a result of climate change impacts the assessment of urmia lake water interactions with the surrounding aquifers has been considered by jafari and eftekhari 2013 they showed that the flow direction around the lake has recently changed and the amount of input water from adjacent aquifer to the lake is decreasing as indicated by their results large parts of the aquifers around the lake had been subjected to saltwater influx by a change in the direction of the groundwater flow while

the inflow of saline ocean water through the large estuaries the evaporation process seems to be negligible at the mouth of this river lambs et al 2007 ettayfi et al 2012 divided aquifers into three major groundwater groups in the lakhssas plateau at the anti atlas mountains of south western morocco based on different hydrochemical results their results showed that the differences in Œ¥18o and

overexploitation or salinization by evaporation of irrigation water appear to be the secondary important processes although the evaporative effects are localized as mentioned above some researchers declare that the effects of climate change lake water interactions saltwater intrusion into surrounding aquifers and human activities are the main reasons behind the urmia lake becoming salty the geochemical structures play major effective role in determining the groundwater composition the groundwater quality depends on the solubility of the minerals in the flow pathways and their saturation

water line lmwl to determine sources of ground water recharge c investigation of the temporal and spatial variations of Œ¥18o Œ¥2h and the chemical composition of ground water samples to observe the effect of basin geology on water salinity this study will provide valuable results on how the source of salinity changes in the study area this will help determine the best managerial schemes for dealing with this phenomenon in the urmia lake several factors have contributed to water salinity we demonstrate the effectiveness of using isotope tracers to observe the effect of basin geology on water salinity conventional hydrochemical methods can not sufficiently describe the groundwater salinity sources using hydrochemical methods for water quality evaluation it is prone to a few problems such as difficulty in distinguishing between certain water types and data clustering obscuring interpretations so stable isotopes of water used in conjunction with other hydrochemical indicators are recognized as a powerful tool in determined of salinity sources in groundwater and surface water systems 2 methodology the methodology of this study comprises six major steps the first step is to define water quality variables and the isotopes utilized as trace the minimum level of analysis should include testing for all the parameters that affect the quality of water in the environment these indicators can be the physical properties of water quality like temperature and the chemical factors including the main cations and anions the second step is to conduct a water sampling in the catchment area to gain knowledge about water properties and to analyze them before data collection knowledge of the water resources and the connection between them is an important factor thirdly the deterministic methods should be tested to discover the best fitted line on rainwater samples and to develop the lmwl in the study area in the absence of rainwater in the study area and to use the database of the nearest global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip station located in the study basin fourthly the sampling data distributions must be plotted and the isotopic composition compared with lmwl in the fifth step the interpolated maps of isotopes and chemical tracers are overlaid to find the relationship between their variation schemes in the sixth and the final step a series of water analyses are plotted on the piper diagram and then the chemistry of the samples are interpreted and classified the flowchart of the study is represented in fig 1 3 case study the urmia basin is located between 35 39 and 38 30 n and 42 52 and 44 13 e in the north western part of iran the urmia lake the outlet of this basin is one of the largest permanent hypersaline lakes in the world the weather in urmia basin is pleasant and temperate in summer and cold in winter the effects of the mediterranean winds that come from the mountain chains located at the north west and west of the study area are quite apparent the urmia lake naturally affects the region s humidity the average annual rainfall of the region is about 350 mm most of which falls in october and november the annual average of the basin surface evaporation is estimated to be 1500 mm which varies between 1000 and 2100 mm marjani and jamali 2014 the basin area is more than 51951 km2 and is divided into 21 sub basins the two major sub basins in this region are the azarshahr and shabestar sufyan plains shabestar sufyan with an area of 2630 km2 is located on the northeast of the urmia lake the azarshahr plain is located on the east of the lake fig 2 there are three main rivers in the azarshahr plain azarshahr chie haft cheshmeh and aji chie and two main rivers in the shabestar sufyan plain daryan chie and tiel chie on azarshahr chie haft cheshmeh and tiel chie rivers reservoirs built for water supply purposes store almost all the influent water therefore only a small flow is provided in the river beds this flow decreases very quickly and the river dries up a short distance away from the dam as a result of water infiltration into the ground in the last five years the electric conductivity of the groundwater has steadily increased directly showing an increase in the groundwater salinity in these plains on the other hand the groundwater level is depleting in the dry season the values of electrical conductivity in all samples collected in the azarshahr and shabestar sufyan plains vary from 1164 to 18910 Œºs cm and 301 to 262 000 Œºs cm respectively faramarzi 2012 jafari and eftekhari 2013 3 1 geology the geological setting of this basin is described by the geological survey of iran gsi the age of the geological formations in the azarshahr ranges from the cambrian to the quaternary periods pyroclastic rocks of sahand cover vast areas of the region the plain is composed of quaternary sediments and consists of travertine young terraces and alluvial fan deposits which are locally cultivated the geological formations developed during the paleozoic to the quaternary phase this plain is formed by moderately consolidated conglomerate and carbonate deposit represented by salty marl layers asadian et al 2002 3 2 data altogether 130 water samples were collected during two observations by the water research institute of iran wri the first observation was during june and july 2013 and the second in september 2012 as the representatives of dry and wet seasons respectively the average monthly precipitation that occurs in june is 14 2 mm while that in september equals 4 4 mm the average monthly air temperature in the urmia basin is 20 2 c in june and 19 c in september marjani and jamali 2014 the samples were taken from wells boreholes springs qanat rainwater and the urmia lake in different points of the study area a total of 54 samples were taken from the azarshahr 66 from the shabestar sufyan two from the urmia lake for chemical analysis water samples were individually collected in high quality polyethylene plastic bottles i e 200 ml each for cation and anions and for stable isotope samples were collected in 50 ml in polyethylene bottles including double caps in order to avoid post sampling evaporation the bottles were filled completely lids tightly closed and kept in refrigerated no air bubbles were permitted in the samples all the samples were analyzed to determine their chemical and isotopic compositions Œ¥18o Œ¥2h as well as the temperature ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and total acidity chemical analyses were carried out using ion chromatography the isotope concentration was determined by los gatos research lgr balderer et al 2013 balderer 2012 the results for the stable isotopes are reported relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and Œ¥ notation in with precision and accuracy 0 5 Œ¥2h for and 0 050 for Œ¥18o the chemical and isotope compositions of the water samples in dry and wet season are presented in table 1 and table 2 respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 stable isotope signature to provide an understanding of the contrast between the stable isotope in the sampling data and in precipitation the gnip data were statistically analyzed from the nearest station in tehran the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values are interpreted in comparison with lmwl which shows a linear relationship between oxygen 18 and deuterium the lmwl for monthly precipitation of tehran iran during 1960 1987 under the gnip programme was developed as follows mosaffa and nasiri saleh 2013 mosaffa et al 2015 1 Œ¥ 2 h 6 48 Œ¥ 18 o 3 06 figs 3 and 4 show the relationship between the two stable isotope values for the shabestar sufyan and azarshar plains respectively the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values vary widely in shabestar sufyan between 8 75 and 10 72 and between 55 5 and 74 7 respectively in the dry season and wet season Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h vary from 6 08 to 10 92 and 45 3 to 68 4 respectively in the azarshar plains the Œ¥18o values during time sampling ranged from 5 29 to 11 25 and 7 43 to 11 22 respectively in the dry and wet seasons while the Œ¥2h value ranged from 50 5 to 72 4 and 51 7 to 96 7 respectively in the dry and wet seasons these figures show that the groundwater samples are close to tehran lmwl but for all the samples collected the slope of the fitted line is lower than the slope of the lmwl of tehran our isotopic framework was based on the interpretation of local evaporation lines lel as described by wolfe et al 2007 the lel is useful for determining the evaporation processes that have occurred in the various water sources it is defined by a regression line through isotopic compositions of water surface samples in the catchment such as shallow groundwater yevenes and mannaerts 2011 the concentration of isotopes at groundwater is much less than isotope concentrations in precipitation which indicates that the main source of groundwater is from rain and surface water where rainfall can undergo evaporation barbieri et al 2013 lee et al 2007 4 2 isotope composition of groundwater besides the recharge by percolated irrigation water with an increased salt load due to surface evaporation experts have suggested that the following additional causes may also be responsible for the observed increase in groundwater salinity in these areas i deforestation ii weathering of rocks containing easily soluble minerals iii water rock interaction with salty marls within the quaternary deposits and the dissolution of evaporative rocks iv effects of evaporation on salinity farid et al 2013 in the plot of Œ¥18o vs tds total dissolved solids given in fig 5 the isotope samples for dry season in the shabestar sufyan testify to the mineralization mechanism in this basin it can be concluded that a main processes causing the dissolution of evaporative rocks among the above reasons contribute to water salinization in the shabestar sufyan area indeed in the dissolution process with an increasing tds value the isotopic concentration of water remains constant the observed trends are further quantified in samples6 7 13 14 16 38 39 and 51 taken from the shabestar sufyan area in this region the salinity of groundwater is controlled by the dissolution process as shown in the spatial distribution of the hydrochemical data fig 6 illustrates the spatial variability of the chemical concentration of all the samples in the study area in the dry season according to this figure wells samples6 7 13 14 16 38 39 and 51 are located in evaporative rocks which have proportions of chemical elements such as cl so4 2 mg 2 na sr 2 and ca 2 fig 7 also shows a relationship between Œ¥18o and tds variations in the azarshahr plain according to this figure two main processes could be identified in contributing to water salinization in the studied aquifer first this relation shows that samples 23 25 28 and 29 have a considerable concentration of dissolved solids due to water rock interaction with salty marls the second trend reflects evaporation process in this case the isotopic compositions of shabestar sufyan samples are positively correlated with tds values and thus provide evidence that water loss by evaporation is an important process in this region the spatial distribution of the chemical elements reflects this relation in the azarshahr plain too fig 8 in the northeast of the region there is an overlap between the different chemical elements most of the deposits in the evaporative rocks contain high concentrations of chemical elements as shown in fig 7 these diagrams reflect the different chemical patterns the concentration of the ions change around the samples 23 25 28 and 29 and can be obviously perceived the same behavioural pattern around the sample between the linear regression and spatial analysis methods is the basis of sample classification in figs 5 and 7 4 3 hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater to better analyze the chemical composition of the water samples the chemical data is plotted on the piper diagram fig 9 kamdee et al 2013 samples 12 13 and 14 these samples have high ec values are from the north east of the shabestar sufyan plain these are the samples near to the urmia lake the dispersion of the groundwater rain and urmia lake samples are shown in piper diagram water sample of urmia lake is characterized by lower amount of ca2 and mg2 and represented predominated cl so4 2 the location of these samples and the urmia lake in the piper diagram show that there is no strong relationship between these samples and the urmia lake in terms of the cation triangle these samples 12 13 and 14 show a composition similar to the rainwater sample but in the anion triangle these samples show the maximum value of chloride 100 and the minimum value of sulphate 0 in the corner of the triangle therefore these sample analysis results indicate that these groundwater resources are mainly recharged by precipitation which is affected by the evaporation process the high electrical conductivity of sample 3 is closed to water rock interaction process in the piper diagram this sample is located in the vicinity of the two saline samples 38 and 39 this result is consistent with the isotope sample analysis results discussed previously according to the cation composition triangle fig 10 there is no relationship between groundwater samples and the urmia lake in azarshahr regarding to fig 9 the chemical composition of groundwater with respect to anion indicates that the high mineralized groundwater is situated in the chloride corner this is probably caused by an evaporation process starting from the low mineralized water and agrees with the results of the previous section moreover high hco3 concentrations are probably related to the rising co2 level along the tectonic fault zones as can be specifically observed from the two travertine springs samples 34 and 35 shvartsev et al 2017 in general despite piper diagram is commonly used as a graphical tool for water quality evaluation it is prone to a few problems such as difficulty in distinguishing between certain water types and data clustering it can be said that despite little resemblance between of the samples in some ternary plots we cannot definitely say that these samples have the same sources so this work suggests identify source of samples refer to isotope analysis results 4 4 spatial isotope effect the main streams in the basins enter from the east and north and extend toward the east and west across these regions the spatial and temporal isotopic abundance in water depends on the geographical and climatic factors by analyzing the time series from a global survey of the stable isotopes in a hydrological cycle a specific pattern in their geographic and climatic distribution is observed figs 11 and 12 show a clear geographic variation in the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h concentrations dominated by the distance from the surface water resources and along the basin towards the downstream the lowest values were observed in samples 3 and 68 which are from the upper part of the basin and the highest values were observed in samples 47 and 64 from the lower part of the basin in shabestar sufyan the variation in isotope concentration is due to the fractionation of the isotopes as a function of temperature and altitude cui and li 2015 ma et al 2012 the stable isotopes of water flow downstream through river flow and along the river the isotope ratios change due to isotopic fractionation during the evaporation process lighter isotopes preferentially evaporate while heavier isotopes remain in the stream path 5 conclusion urmia lake is one of the largest salt lakes in the world during last decade many factors lead to the drying up of the lake turning it into a salt marsh which will adversely affect the climate of the region and caused some ecological and environmental problems a review of literature has been carried out to investigate the causes of increasing salinity in lake and aquifer which are located around the lake hydrochemical analysis based methods is one of the important tools to provide adequate information about salinity source using hydrochemical methods for water quality evaluation it is prone to a few problems such as difficulty in distinguishing between certain water types and data clustering obscuring interpretations in this article combine stable isotopes data with hydrochemical indicators are recognized as a powerful tool in determined of salinity sources in groundwater and surface water systems this methods was used to indicate and evaluated the causes of increasing salinity in aquifer around the urmia lake beside all reason which are mentioned by several researches the catchment geology has the strong effect on surface and groundwater quality this paper shows the effectiveness of using isotope tracers and hydrochemical properties of water to observe the effect of the basin s geology on water salinity the wide variation of groundwater salinity issues in terms of its origin and prevention necessitates the use of integrated hydrochemical and isotopic methods to interpret the salinity problems this study examines the changes in chemical salinity and isotope concentrations of groundwater in the azarshahr and shabestar sufyan aquifers samples were collected in dry and wet seasons the relationship between the variations of these samples isotopes and chemical compositions were investigated to evaluate the response of oxygen 18 and deuterium to the chemical properties of these regions the following conclusions were drawn this study showed that there is not strong relationship between isotopic value in the urmia lake water and groundwater samples salinity of the urmia lake water does not influences the ground water quantity based on stable isotope signature the mean stable isotope compositions of the groundwater were mainly derived from rainfall and affected by the evaporation process gis maps and isotope composition of the groundwater the spatial variations in salinity chemical and isotope analyses of water from the azarshahr and shabestar sufyan aquifers show that the salinity of groundwater is mainly affected by the dissolution process in evaporation rocks and there is not strong interaction between the urmia lake and groundwater isotope concentration is dominated by the distance from the source of water the fraction of isotopes is controlled by temperature and altitude however just two samplings at the site cannot be truly representative of the average aquifer conditions and it seems important to monitor the groundwater quality and isotope concentration over a long period of time to obtain robustness of results this article emphasizes that more samples from the study area cam lead to more accurate results declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

of the groundwater for each hydrochemical and isotope sampling data the standardized mean spatial kriging variance achieved and their interpolated values are plotted by gis the main objectives of this study are a evaluation of the urmia lake effect on surrounding groundwater quality b assessment of the stable isotopes in the groundwater samples and comparison of the results with the local meteoric water line lmwl to determine sources of ground water recharge c investigation of the temporal and spatial variations of Œ¥18o Œ¥2h and the chemical composition of ground water samples to observe the effect of basin geology on water salinity this study will provide valuable results on how the source of salinity changes in the study area this will help determine the best managerial schemes for dealing with this phenomenon in the urmia lake several factors have contributed to water salinity we demonstrate the effectiveness of using isotope tracers to observe the effect of basin geology on water salinity conventional hydrochemical methods can not sufficiently describe the groundwater salinity sources using hydrochemical methods for water quality evaluation it is prone to a few problems such as difficulty in distinguishing between certain water types and data clustering obscuring interpretations so stable isotopes of water used in conjunction with other hydrochemical indicators are recognized as a powerful tool in determined of salinity sources in groundwater and surface water systems 2 methodology the methodology of this study comprises six major steps the first step is to define water quality variables and the isotopes utilized as trace the minimum level of analysis should include testing for all the parameters that affect the quality of water in the environment these indicators can be the physical properties of water quality like temperature and the chemical factors including the main cations and anions the second step is to conduct a water sampling in the catchment area to gain knowledge about water properties and to analyze them before data collection knowledge of the water resources and the connection between them is an important factor thirdly the deterministic methods should be tested to discover the best fitted line on rainwater samples and to develop the lmwl in the study area in the absence of rainwater in the study area and to use the database of the nearest global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip station located in the study basin fourthly the sampling data distributions must be plotted and the isotopic composition compared with lmwl in the fifth step the interpolated maps of isotopes and chemical tracers are overlaid to find the relationship between their variation schemes in the sixth and the final step a series of water analyses are plotted on the piper diagram and then the chemistry of the samples are interpreted and classified the flowchart of the study is represented in fig 1 3 case study the urmia basin is located between 35 39 and 38 30 n and 42 52 and 44 13 e in the north western part of iran the urmia lake the outlet of this basin is one of the largest permanent hypersaline lakes in the world the weather in urmia basin is pleasant and temperate in summer and cold in winter the effects of the mediterranean winds that come from the mountain chains located at the north west and west of the study area are quite apparent the urmia lake naturally affects the region s humidity the average annual rainfall of the region is about 350 mm most of which falls in october and november the annual average of the basin surface evaporation is estimated to be 1500 mm which varies between 1000 and 2100 mm marjani and jamali 2014 the basin area is more than 51951 km2 and is divided into 21 sub basins the two major sub basins in this region are the azarshahr and shabestar sufyan plains shabestar sufyan with an area of 2630 km2 is located on the northeast of the urmia lake the azarshahr plain is located on the east of the lake fig 2 there are three main rivers in the azarshahr plain azarshahr chie haft cheshmeh and aji chie and two main rivers in the shabestar sufyan plain daryan chie and tiel chie on azarshahr chie haft cheshmeh and tiel chie rivers reservoirs built for water supply purposes store almost all the influent water therefore only a small flow is provided in the river beds this flow decreases very quickly and the river dries up a short distance away from the dam as a result of water infiltration into the ground in the last five years the electric conductivity of the groundwater has steadily increased directly showing an increase in the groundwater salinity in these plains on the other hand the groundwater level is depleting in the dry season the values of electrical conductivity in all samples collected in the azarshahr and shabestar sufyan plains vary from 1164 to 18910 Œºs cm and 301 to 262 000 Œºs cm respectively faramarzi 2012 jafari and eftekhari 2013 3 1 geology the geological setting of this basin is described by the geological survey of iran gsi the age of the geological formations in the azarshahr ranges from the cambrian to the quaternary periods pyroclastic rocks of sahand cover vast areas of the region the plain is composed of quaternary sediments and consists of travertine young terraces and alluvial fan deposits which are locally cultivated the geological formations developed during the paleozoic to the quaternary phase this plain is formed by moderately consolidated conglomerate and carbonate deposit represented by salty marl layers asadian et al 2002 3 2 data altogether 130 water samples were collected during two observations by the water research institute of iran wri the first observation was during june and july 2013 and the second in september 2012 as the representatives of dry and wet seasons respectively the average monthly precipitation that occurs in june is 14 2 mm while that in september equals 4 4 mm the average monthly air temperature in the urmia basin is 20 2 c in june and 19 c in september marjani and jamali 2014 the samples were taken from wells boreholes springs qanat rainwater and the urmia lake in different points of the study area a total of 54 samples were taken from the azarshahr 66 from the shabestar sufyan two from the urmia lake for chemical analysis water samples were individually collected in high quality polyethylene plastic bottles i e 200 ml each for cation and anions and for stable isotope samples were collected in 50 ml in polyethylene bottles including double caps in order to avoid post sampling evaporation the bottles were filled completely lids tightly closed and kept in refrigerated no air bubbles were permitted in the samples all the samples were analyzed to determine their chemical and isotopic compositions Œ¥18o Œ¥2h as well as the temperature ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and total acidity chemical analyses were carried out using ion chromatography the isotope concentration was determined by los gatos research lgr balderer et al 2013 balderer 2012 the results for the stable isotopes are reported relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and Œ¥ notation in with precision and accuracy 0 5 Œ¥2h for and 0 050 for Œ¥18o the chemical and isotope compositions of the water samples in dry and wet season are presented in table 1 and table 2 respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 stable isotope signature to provide an understanding of the contrast between the stable isotope in the sampling data and in precipitation the gnip data were statistically analyzed from the nearest station in tehran the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values are interpreted in comparison with lmwl which shows a linear relationship between oxygen 18 and deuterium the lmwl for monthly precipitation of tehran iran during 1960 1987 under the gnip programme was developed as follows mosaffa and nasiri saleh 2013 mosaffa et al 2015 1 Œ¥ 2 h 6 48 Œ¥ 18 o 3 06 figs 3 and 4 show the relationship between the two stable isotope values for the shabestar sufyan and azarshar plains respectively the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values vary widely in shabestar sufyan between 8 75 and 10 72 and between 55 5 and 74 7 respectively in the dry season and wet season Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h vary from 6 08 to 10 92 and 45 3 to 68 4 respectively in the azarshar plains the Œ¥18o values during time sampling ranged from 5 29 to 11 25 and 7 43 to 11 22 respectively in the dry and wet seasons while the Œ¥2h value ranged from 50 5 to 72 4 and 51 7 to 96 7 respectively in the dry and wet seasons these figures show that the groundwater samples are close to tehran lmwl but for all the samples collected the slope of the fitted line is lower than the slope of the lmwl of tehran our isotopic framework was based on the interpretation of local evaporation lines lel as described by wolfe et al 2007 the lel is useful for determining the evaporation processes that have occurred in the various water sources it is defined by a regression line through isotopic compositions of water surface samples in the catchment such as shallow groundwater yevenes and mannaerts 2011 the concentration of isotopes at groundwater is much less than isotope concentrations in precipitation which indicates that the main source of groundwater is from rain and surface water where rainfall can undergo evaporation barbieri et al 2013 lee et al 2007 4 2 isotope composition of groundwater besides the recharge by percolated irrigation water with an increased salt load due to surface evaporation experts have suggested that the following additional causes may also be responsible for the observed increase in groundwater salinity in these areas i deforestation ii weathering of rocks containing easily soluble minerals iii water rock interaction with salty marls within the quaternary deposits and the dissolution of evaporative rocks iv effects of evaporation on salinity farid et al 2013 in the plot of Œ¥18o vs tds total dissolved solids given in fig 5 the isotope samples for dry season in the shabestar sufyan testify to the mineralization mechanism in this basin it can be concluded that a main processes causing the dissolution of evaporative rocks among the above reasons contribute to water salinization in the shabestar sufyan area indeed in the dissolution process with an increasing tds value the isotopic concentration of water remains constant the observed trends are further quantified in samples6 7 13 14 16 38 39 and 51 taken from the shabestar sufyan area in this region the salinity of groundwater is controlled by the dissolution process as shown in the spatial distribution of the hydrochemical data fig 6 illustrates the spatial variability of the chemical concentration of all the samples in the study area in the dry season according to this figure wells samples6 7 13 14 16 38 39 and 51 are located in evaporative rocks which have proportions of chemical elements such as cl so4 2 mg 2 na sr 2 and ca 2 fig 7 also shows a relationship between Œ¥18o and tds variations in the azarshahr plain according to this figure two main processes could be identified in contributing to water salinization in the studied aquifer first this relation shows that samples 23 25 28 and 29 have a considerable concentration of dissolved solids due to water rock interaction with salty marls the second trend reflects evaporation process in this case the isotopic compositions of shabestar sufyan samples are positively correlated with tds values and thus provide evidence that water loss by evaporation is an important process in this region the spatial distribution of the chemical elements reflects this relation in the azarshahr plain too fig 8 in the northeast of the region there is an overlap between the different chemical elements most of the deposits in the evaporative rocks contain high concentrations of chemical elements as shown in fig 7 these diagrams reflect the different chemical patterns the concentration of the ions change around the samples 23 25 28 and 29 and can be obviously perceived the same behavioural pattern around the sample between the linear regression and spatial analysis methods is the basis of sample classification in figs 5 and 7 4 3 hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater to better analyze the chemical composition of the water samples the chemical data is plotted on the piper diagram fig 9 kamdee et al 2013 samples 12 13 and 14 these samples have high ec values are from the north east of the shabestar sufyan plain these are the samples near to the urmia lake the dispersion of the groundwater rain and urmia lake samples are shown in piper diagram water sample of urmia lake is characterized by lower amount of ca2 and mg2 and represented predominated cl so4 2 the location of these samples and the urmia lake in the piper diagram show that there is no strong relationship between these samples and the urmia lake in terms of the cation triangle these samples 12 13 and 14 show a composition similar to the rainwater sample but in the anion triangle these samples show the maximum value of chloride 100 and the minimum value of sulphate 0 in the corner of the triangle therefore these sample analysis results indicate that these groundwater resources are mainly recharged by precipitation which is affected by the evaporation process the high electrical conductivity of sample 3 is closed to water rock interaction process in the piper diagram this sample is located in the vicinity of the two saline samples 38 and 39 this result is consistent with the isotope sample analysis results discussed previously according to the cation composition triangle fig 10 there is no relationship between groundwater samples and the urmia lake in azarshahr regarding to fig 9 the chemical composition of groundwater with respect to anion indicates that the high mineralized groundwater is situated in the chloride corner this is probably caused by an evaporation process starting from the low mineralized water and agrees with the results of the previous section moreover high hco3 concentrations are probably related to the rising co2 level along the tectonic fault zones as can be specifically observed from the two travertine springs samples 34 and 35 shvartsev et al 2017 in general despite piper diagram is commonly used as a graphical tool for water quality evaluation it is prone to a few problems such as difficulty in distinguishing between certain water types and data clustering it can be said that despite little resemblance between of the samples in some ternary plots we cannot definitely say that these samples have the same sources so this work suggests identify source of samples refer to isotope analysis results 4 4 spatial isotope effect the main streams in the basins enter from the east and north and extend toward the east and west across these regions the spatial and temporal isotopic abundance in water depends on the geographical and climatic factors by analyzing the time series from a global survey of the stable isotopes in a hydrological cycle a specific pattern in their geographic and climatic distribution is observed figs 11 and 12 show a clear geographic variation in the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h concentrations dominated by the distance from the surface water resources and along the basin towards the downstream the lowest values were observed in samples 3 and 68 which are from the upper part of the basin and the highest values were observed in samples 47 and 64 from the lower part of the basin in shabestar sufyan the variation in isotope concentration is due to the fractionation of the isotopes as a function of temperature and altitude cui and li 2015 ma et al 2012 the stable isotopes of water flow downstream through river flow and along the river the isotope ratios change due to isotopic fractionation during the evaporation process lighter isotopes preferentially evaporate while heavier isotopes remain in the stream path 5 conclusion urmia lake is one of the largest salt lakes in the world during last decade many factors lead to the drying up of the lake turning it into a salt marsh which will adversely affect the climate of the region and caused some ecological and environmental problems a review of literature has been carried out to investigate the causes of increasing salinity in lake and aquifer which are located around the lake hydrochemical analysis based methods is one of the important tools to provide adequate information about salinity source using hydrochemical methods for water quality evaluation it is prone to a few problems such as difficulty in distinguishing between certain water types and data clustering obscuring interpretations in this article combine stable isotopes data with hydrochemical indicators are recognized as a powerful tool in determined of salinity sources in groundwater and surface water systems this methods was used to indicate and evaluated the causes of increasing salinity in aquifer around the urmia lake beside all reason which are mentioned by several researches the catchment geology has the strong effect on surface and groundwater quality this paper shows the effectiveness of using isotope tracers and hydrochemical properties of water to observe the effect of the basin s geology on water salinity the wide variation of groundwater salinity issues in terms of its origin and prevention necessitates the use of integrated hydrochemical and isotopic methods to interpret the salinity problems this study examines the changes in chemical salinity and isotope concentrations of groundwater in the azarshahr and shabestar sufyan aquifers samples were collected in dry and wet seasons the relationship between the variations of these samples isotopes and chemical compositions were investigated to evaluate the response of oxygen 18 and deuterium to the chemical properties of these regions the following conclusions were drawn this study showed that there is not strong relationship between isotopic value in the urmia lake water and groundwater samples salinity of the urmia lake water does not influences the ground water quantity based on stable isotope signature the mean stable isotope compositions of the groundwater were mainly derived from rainfall and affected by the evaporation process gis maps and isotope composition of the groundwater the spatial variations in salinity chemical and isotope analyses of water from the azarshahr and shabestar sufyan aquifers show that the salinity of groundwater is mainly affected by the dissolution process in evaporation rocks and there is not strong interaction between the urmia lake and groundwater isotope concentration is dominated by the distance from the source of water the fraction of isotopes is controlled by temperature and altitude however just two samplings at the site cannot be truly representative of the average aquifer conditions and it seems important to monitor the groundwater quality and isotope concentration over a long period of time to obtain robustness of results this article emphasizes that more samples from the study area cam lead to more accurate results declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

11964,rapid urbanisation in dhaka bangladesh with high dependency on the groundwater have recently raised concern over the sustainability of the aquifers the present study focusses on quantifying the dynamic groundwater resource vis √† vis the status of groundwater development and understanding the different recharge processes in the dhaka city using the water balance based lumped and distributed approaches in the lumped approach the groundwater assessment is carried out using groundwater balance method following the methodology and norms recommended by the groundwater estimation committee 2015 referred hereafter as gec in the distributed approach a physics based hydrological model variable infiltration capacity vic is utilised to model the baseflow i e potential recharge then an attempt is made to establish the relation between vic based baseflow and actual gec based groundwater recharge from rainfall remote sensing data derived spatio temporal information along with field based observations have been used in the process dhaka city is divided into 10 zones and the groundwater assessment is made individually in these zones as well as for the entire city during 2001 2015 period the total annual recharge is estimated as 635 35 million m3 or 2065 mm year per unit area lateral and unaccounted recharge is found to be the dominant 51 8 process in the study area followed by recharge from urban return flow 35 5 rainfall 7 1 and surface water bodies wetlands 5 6 the study underscores that the lateral and unaccounted recharge must not be ignored in the urban landscape underlain by alluvial aquifers and with non hydrologic unit boundaries the stage of groundwater development is found to vary from 117 to 320 thus indicating overexploitation of aquifers in all the zones the higher groundwater abstraction as compared to recharge in all the zones has led to consistent decline in groundwater level by 2 3 2 m year across the study area the vic model on the other hand depicted that nearly 17 2 of the annual rainfall contributes towards baseflow further it is observed that 31 of baseflow contributes to groundwater recharge due to rainfall researchers can use this relationship for quick assessment of the groundwater recharge from rainfall in dhaka based on hydrological models with varying meteorological and land cover scenarios especially in the light of climate change and rapid urbanisation graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater recharge gec vic hydrological modelling dhaka 1 introduction groundwater is an unseen but the most easily accessible and reliable source of freshwater llamas and custodio 2003 a vital resource required for the sustenance of life and the environment although groundwater abstraction is being practiced since historical times the dependency on aquifers has increased significantly in the last few decades to meet the ever increasing water requirement llamas and custodio 2003 villholth 2006 thomas et al 2008 excessive pumping from the aquifers has led to permanent decline in the groundwater levels in many parts of the world especially in fluvio deltaic aquifers the overexploitation of groundwater has increased the problem of saline water intrusion in the useful shallow aquifers shamsudduha et al 2019 an assessment of groundwater resources in terms of present status of availability vis √† vis draft is thus essential for sustainable management of aquifers de vries and simmers 2002 thomas et al 2008 groundwater being the dynamic and replenishable natural resource its availability is generally assessed based on the annual recharge to the aquifers groundwater recharge is defined as the downward flow of water reaching the water table forming an addition to the groundwater reservoir de vries and simmers 2002 and is critical for planning the further scope of groundwater development in an area sinha and sharma 1988 rushton 1988 hydrogeologists have developed and used many methods for quantifying the groundwater recharge van der lee and gehrels 1990 divided these methods into two major groups 1 direct methods and 2 indirect methods the direct methods e g hydrologic budgeting based rainfall runoff models estimate recharge using top down approach such hydrologic models essentially provide potential recharge rushton 1988 wherein the water available at the base of the root zone i e rainfall runoff evapotranspiration is generally estimated through physically based distributed approach the estimated potential recharge however may be higher than the actual recharge as all the water available at the base of the root zone may or may not reach the aquifer on the other hand the indirect methods provide actual groundwater recharge using the water table fluctuations several papers dealing with the issues related to groundwater recharge are published in the hydrogeology journal vol 10 issue 1 2002 in a theme issue on groundwater recharge which may be referred for further details although a number of groundwater recharge estimation methods are available today each method has its own advantages and limitations and there is always an uncertainty associated with the estimated recharge therefore multiple methods are used in order to reduce the uncertainty in the estimated groundwater recharge de vries and simmers 2002 healy and cook 2002 scanlon et al 2002 the water table fluctuation method wtfm by virtue of providing actual recharge is one of the most commonly used methods for groundwater recharge estimation healy and cook 2002 shamsudduha et al 2011 the ground water estimation committee gec constituted by the government of india to standardize the methodology for recharge estimation thus adopted the wtfm along with the rainfall infiltration factor method rifm for recharge estimation the underlying principle of the gec methodology is the groundwater balance approach the detailed methodology and guidelines of the gec were first published in 1984 and were revised subsequently in 1997 and 2017 these guidelines are referred as gec 1984 mowr 1984 gec 1997 mowr 1997 and gec 2015 mowr rd gr 2017 the intricate linkage between surface water and groundwater systems affects recharge discharge processes sophocleous 2002 cherepansky et al n d according to cherepansky et al n d there are essentially two types of interconnections between surface and groundwater 1 infiltration of surface water through the unsaturated zone and 2 exfiltration discharge of groundwater into surface water bodies further the interactions between surface and groundwater depend on a complex combination of geomorphic hydrogeologic hydrologic climatic and landscape factors sophocleous 2002 cherepansky et al n d many of the groundwater assessment methods tend to ignore the climatic and landscape factors however advanced land surface or surface hydrological models incorporate them for better representation of the hydrological processes the variable infiltration capacity vic model is one such model developed by liang et al 1994 1996 with a variety of updates since its development bowling et al 2000 cherkauer et al 2003 yang and xie 2003 it has been extensively used in hydrologic data set preparation trend analysis of hydrological fluxes and states macro scale hydrological modelling aggarwal et al 2013 garg et al 2013 2016 data evaluation and assimilation nikam et al 2018 behera et al 2019 coupled climate modelling climate change impact assessment aggarwal et al 2012 hamman et al 2018 nikam et al 2018 garg et al 2019 land cover change impact assessment garg et al 2012 2017 etc the vic model estimates all the surface hydrological components at a spatially and temporally distributed scale however as the model primarily works with the parameters of the aeration zone the primary interlink between surface water and groundwater i e baseflow or potential groundwater recharge can be estimated using this model the potential recharge estimated using the surface hydrological model such as vic can in turn be used to estimate actual groundwater recharge due to rainfall by coupling it with groundwater recharge assessment method s and or observations geospatial techniques primarily remote sensing along with the geographical information system gis and satellite navigation systems have unique capability to provide the spatio temporal information about many of the land surface and climatic variables and processes which are often required as inputs to the recharge estimation methods and surface hydrological models some of the important land surface variables and hydrologic fluxes provided by the remote sensing systems are topography through digital elevation model dem land use and land cover lulc including distribution of surface water bodies wetlands and vegetation cover soil moisture evapotranspiration irrigation network variability in lithology and soils structurally weak zones or lineaments and climate further besides providing specific inputs to recharge estimation methods the spatially complete and temporal information provided by the remote sensing data significantly help improving the understanding of the hydrogeological system hoffmann and sander 2007 dhaka the capital city of bangladesh and one of the world s fastest growing megacities is facing serious challenge to meet the increased water demand due to rapid growth in population industrial development and urbanization groundwater forms the primary source of freshwater supply in dhaka according to dhaka water supply and sewerage authority dwasa 2019 out of the total water supply of 2550 million litres per day mld in dhaka city and adjoining narayanganj area about 78 i e 2000 mld is being met by tapping the aquifers through deep tube wells apart from this significant groundwater withdrawal is taking place through private wells for meeting the domestic and industrial requirements this has led to significant decline 60 m in the last five decades in groundwater levels in the central part of dhaka with the present rate of decline being about 2 3 m per year akhter et al 2009 khan et al 2011 khan et al 2016 dwasa 2019 the condition in dhaka is expected to deteriorate in the future if the excessive and indiscriminate withdrawal of groundwater continues the groundwater recharge process in the densely urbanised dhaka are more complex due to nature of the relationship between urbanisation and subsurface flow dynamics like the combined role of the urban surface presence of water management and drainage networks and other surface subsurface characteristics e g geology soil vegetation topography the aquifer in dhaka is characterised by large contribution from seasonal floods and river leakage shamsudduha et al 2011 further studies have proven the significant impact of faulty urban water distribution supply and collection sewage networks on groundwater recharge mcgrane 2016 a few studies have been carried out by the researchers to assess the status of groundwater potential in and around dhaka bhuiyan and bhuiyan 1997 khan et al 2011 buet 2000 dwasa 2016 islam et al 2017 however comprehensive assessment of groundwater resources in a distributed semi distributed framework utilising the geospatial inputs is lacking the present study focusses on assessing the groundwater resource and understanding different groundwater recharge processes in the dhaka city bangladesh one of the most rapidly urbanising cities in the world in a semi distributed manner using the groundwater balance approach we also investigate the applicability of distributed surface hydrological model vic which better represents the changing land surface conditions in assessment of annual groundwater recharge due to rainfall in the area gec 2015 methodology and norms are followed for quantifying the different components of groundwater recharge which are in turn used in groundwater balance equation for assessment of total recharge and status of groundwater utilisation the strength of the study is the usage of semi distributed distributed approach supplemented with the geospatial data in achieving the objectives 2 study area and datasets the study area dhaka city hereafter referred to as dhaka is located in the heart of the bengal delta and in the centre of bangladesh fig 1 it is bound by longitudes 90 328 e 90 514 e and latitudes 23 668 n 23 902 n and extends for 19 km in e w direction and 24 km in n s covering a total area of 307 6 km2 dhaka is economic cultural and political centre of bangladesh and is home to nearly 20 million people dwasa 2019 dhaka is divided into 10 geographic zones from water supply point of view fig 1 the elevation of the area varies from 1 5 to 25 m above mean sea level amsl with an average height of 10 m amsl fig 2 a urban built up dominates the land use land cover lulc of the study area water bodies wetlands vegetation and bare land are the other lulc classes fig 2 b d many streams and their distributaries flow in and around dhaka the important ones flowing through the study area include buriganga balu and turag rivers and their distributaries which along with wetlands form the important source of recharge to the upper aquifer the area enjoys subtropical monsoon climate with mean 1981 2010 annual rainfall of 2085 mm and mean monthly minimum and maximum temperatures range from 13 1 to 26 4 c and 25 1 33 8 c respectively khatun et al 2016 a major portion of rainfall takes place during southwest monsoon in june september months the hydrologic year is thus taken as june may the area is covered by the madhapur formation clay silt and silty clay of pleistocene age and late pleistocene holocene alluvium of older and younger flood plains the madhupur formation and alluvium are underlain by the dupi tila formation of plio peistocene age which forms the main aquifer system the dupi tila aquifer system 400 m thick is divided into 1 upper dupi tila aquifer and 2 lower dupi tila aquifer hoque et al 2007 rahman et al 2013 akhter and hossain 2017 islam et al 2017 both the upper and lower dupi tila aquifers in turn comprise of two aquifers thus total four aquifers which are separated by aquitard layers akhter and hossain 2017 the upper dupi tila aquifer is of unconfined to semi confined nature while the lower dupi tila aquifer is of semi confined to confined nature the abstraction of groundwater in dhaka initially started from upper aquifer but subsequently due to lowering of groundwater level deeper aquifer is being exploited the input data used for carrying out the present study and their sources are listed in table 1 these include the topographic map temporal lulc maps prepared from high resolution remote sensing data digital elevation model dem satellite images groundwater related data and information viz depth to groundwater level draft location of wells aquifer parameters soil map and soil characteristics and meteorological parameters the data are of both spatial remote sensing or its derived products thematic maps topo maps and non spatial point or station based observational data nature further many of these data are time series data collected during the study period i e 2001 2015 3 methodology the methodology followed to achieve the objectives of the present study consists of three main parts 1 assessment of groundwater resource and understanding quantifying all the groundwater recharge processes using the groundwater balance approach 2 estimation of hydrological fluxes using a physics based distributed hydrological model vic 3 investigation of relationship between actual annual rainfall recharge and hydrological model estimated baseflow potential groundwater recharge the gec 2015 hereafter referred to as gec methodology and norms are used for estimating the recharge from different sources rainfall return flow from groundwater draft seepage from surface water bodies and wetlands which have been used in groundwater balance equation to estimate total recharge availability and stage of groundwater development remote sensing data derived information along with other geospatial inputs ground observations and ancillary data were used while implementing both the gec methodology and hydrological modelling fig 3 shows the overall methodology framework the details are provided in the next sections 3 1

adopted for estimating different components of groundwater recharge and draft and the resource available for further development is elaborated in the following sections 3 1 1 estimation of groundwater recharge from rainfall as suggested by gec assessment of groundwater recharge from rainfall is carried out using two methods 1 rainfall infiltration factor method rifm and 2 water table fluctuation method wtfm the water supply zones of dhaka represented as z 1 z 2 z 10 in fig 1 are used as unit for groundwater resource assessment further the assessment is made annually during 2001 2015 period for implementing both the methods the monsoon season is considered from june to september 4 months and non monsoon season from october to may 8 months the information on aquifer parameters and groundwater draft is collected from the line departments and published literature the remote sensing data are used to capture the lulc dynamics viz the impervious area and surface area of water bodies and wetlands in each zone that affect actual groundwater recharge the impervious surface area recharge correction factors isf estimated from remote sensing data in each zone are used in the rifm to estimate the annual rainfall recharge while the extent of water bodies and wetlands in each zone is used to estimate the groundwater recharge through leakage fig 4 shows the broad framework for estimating rainfall recharge using the rifm and wtfm 3 1 1 1 rainfall infiltration factor method for estimating the annual groundwater recharge from rainfall r r using rifm recharge during the monsoon mr r and non monsoon nmr r seasons are estimated separately and then summed up as given in the following equations 3 m r r r f i f a r m a 1000 4 n m r r r f i f a r n m a 1000 5 r r mr r nmr r where rfif is the rainfall infiltration factor a is the area of the assessment unit in m2 r m and r nm represent monsoon and non monsoon rainfall in mm respectively and a is the minimum rainfall threshold in mm that can induce groundwater recharge the urbanisation has taken place at a rapid pace in dhaka resulting in increase in impervious built up area with time fig 2 b d it means that the actual area through which rainfall infiltration can happen has decreased with time to account for this change in land cover an additional term called as impervious surface area recharge correction factor isf is incorporated in equations 3 and 4 the revised equations are given below equations 6 and 7 which along with equation 5 are finally used for estimating the rainfall recharge in different zones of dhaka using rifm 6 m r r r f i f i s f a r m a 1000 7 n m r r r f i f i s f a r n m a 1000 8 where isf 1 fractional urban impervious cover in the assessment unit rfif is taken as 0 16 the average value as proposed by gec for east coast alluvium having clayey soils further 10 of the normal annual rainfall taken as average of total duration studied in present case i e 2001 2015 is taken as the value of a as suggested by gec the non monsoon rainfall recharge nmr r will be zero if r nm is less than a the isf equation 8 is estimated using remote sensing inputs the impervious surface area for the years 2000 2010 and 2015 were derived using lulc maps generated by survey of bangladesh sob using high resolution aerial and satellite remote sensing data the fractional land cover under the built up class was calculated for each year using the zonal statistics tool of arcgis and accordingly isf was estimated however for all the intermediate years for which the lulc maps were not available the isf was estimated using remote sensing derived land surface temperature lst following the procedure given below the satellite images of the study area acquired by landsat 5 thematic mapper tm and landsat 8 operational land imager oli thermal infrared sensor tirs during pre monsoon season march to may of 2001 2015 were downloaded from usgs earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov the remote sensing data were converted to at sensor level spectral radiance and reflectance using the rescaling factors provided in the metadata the lst for each pixel is estimated using a simplified radiative transfer theory based method mao et al 2005 zhang and he 2013 rozenstein et al 2014 nikam et al 2016 generally the anthropogenic impervious surfaces exhibit higher lst as compared to other natural vegetated landscapes however other land covers such as the barren land and dry sand which also exhibit higher lst would have been misclassified as anthropogenic impervious surfaces if lst threshold was directly used further since the dates of acquisition of satellite images were different despite being of pre monsoon season using the absolute value of lst as a threshold for mapping impervious surface area would have also not been the correct approach to overcome this difficulty an innovative approach was used for the selection of appropriate lst threshold for accurate mapping of impervious surface area in the dhaka region in the first step the masks for barren land including dry riverbed and built up area were prepared from lulc maps of 2000 2010 and 2015 the masks generated using lulc map of 2000 were used for lst analysis for the 2001 2007 period while the masks generated from lulc maps of 2010 and 2015 were used for lst analysis for the 2008 2012 and 2013 2015 periods respectively in the second step the median values of lst were calculated for all the built up land for the years 2000 2010 and 2015 using the respective built up masks the range of lst values in terms of standard deviation stddev from the median values i e median nstddev were found out for the built up areas of 2010 and 2015 using manual inspection technique this lst threshold was then tested for the year 2000 which yielded good results in the third step the standard deviation threshold from the median lst value using the built up mask of the reference year was then applied on all the years except 2010 and 2015 to map the impervious surface area in each year the isf for each zone was estimated using these impervious surface area maps this way the temporal dynamics of urbanisation was incorporated in the gec methodology using remote sensing inputs 3 1 1 2 water table fluctuation method as suggested by the gec the wtfm method is used for estimating the mr r based on change in groundwater storage during the monsoon season Œ¥s mon and groundwater balance method equations 9 and 10 as given below 9 Œ¥ s mon Œ¥ h s y a 10 Œ¥ s m o n m r r m r s w m r r f d m l f i n m d d u m d i r m d i u m l f o u t where s y is the specific yield of the aquifer Œ¥h is the fluctuation in groundwater level between pre monsoon and post monsoon a is the area of the assessment unit zones of dhaka mr r is the recharge from rainfall during monsoon mr sw is the recharge from surface water bodies and wetlands during monsoon mr rfd is the recharge from return flow of draft during monsoon md du md ir and md iu are the groundwater draft during monsoon for domestic irrigation and industrial uses respectively and mlf in and mlf out are the lateral inflow recharge and outflow during monsoon respectively assuming mlf in and mlf out as negligible and by rearranging the terms in equation 10 the mr r has been estimated using the following equation 11 m r r Œ¥ h s y a m r s w m r r f d m d d u m d i r m d i u data on the monthly groundwater level from 58 observation wells for the period 2001 2015 were collected from dhaka water supply and sewerage authority dwasa the data were analysed to estimate the general trend in the groundwater level in different zones of dhaka groundwater level data of may representing pre monsoon and october representing post monsoon are used to calculate the fluctuation in the water table the seasonal pre and post monsoon groundwater levels in each zone of dhaka were estimated for each year by taking the spatial weighted average of the observed groundwater levels of all the observation wells for the corresponding zone and year the s y of aquifer for the study area is taken as 0 15 based on the recommendations of dwasa and published literature akhter and hossain 2017 the methodology for estimating the mr sw mr rfd md du md ir and md iu fluxes is given in the next section according to the gec methodology the mr r estimates made using the rifm and wtfm are compared by computing the percentage difference pd between them as given below 12 p d m r r w t f m m r r r i f m 100 m r r r i f m if 20 pd 20 the final value of mr r is taken as mr r of wtfm if pd 20 then final mr r 0 8 mr r of rifm and if pd 20 then final mr r 1 2 mr r of rifm the mr r estimated using either of the rifm or wtfm method is then added to nmr r estimated using rifm to obtain annual groundwater recharge from rainfall r r 3 1 2 estimation of recharge from other sources the recharge from other sources r sw r rfd are estimated based on norms suggested by the gec the recharge from surface water bodies and wetlands during the monsoon mr sw and non monsoon nmr sw periods are estimated by multiplying the water spread area with the number of days the water is available in the water body and recharge factor rf 1 44 as per gec guidelines the spatio temporal dynamics of water spread area of all the water bodies between the years 2001 2015 was estimated using lulc maps 2000 2010 and 2015 of the study area the surface area of all the water bodies during the years 2000 2010 and 2015 in all the zones of dhaka was estimated using the zonal statistics tool of arcgis it is observed that the water bodies and wetlands in the study area have shrunk with time assuming that the rate of shrinkage of the water bodies is linear with time the rate of shrinkage was estimated for each zone using lulc maps of 2000 2010 and 2015 for all the intermediate years 2001 2009 and 2011 2014 the area of water bodies in each zone is estimated using this derived rate of shrinkage and reference area of water bodies the incorporation of the temporal dynamics of surface water bodies in the traditional gec methodology is likely to increase the accuracy of estimated groundwater recharge the recharge from return flow of groundwater draft during the monsoon mr rfd and non monsoon nmr rfd periods are estimated by applying the return flow factor on the groundwater draft the groundwater draft in different zones of dhaka is discussed in section 3 1 4 the return flow factor for groundwater draft is taken as 30 buet 2000 rahman 2003 cited in hoque 2004 in the dhaka area dominant groundwater recharge happens due to infiltration of rainfall knappett et al 2016 river bank leakages hoque et al 2014 khan et al 2016 islam et al 2017 leakages from urban water supply dwasa 2012 and from pluvial drainage as well as sewers and unsewered sanitation morris et al 2003 hoque et al 2014 the contribution of rainfall to the groundwater r r is estimated using rifm and wtfm section 3 1 1 the contribution of leakages from urban supply sewers and sanitation system is taken care by considering the return flow from groundwater draft r rfd and the contribution of surface water bodies and wetlands existing within the study area r sw is considered based on gec norms considering the presence of alluvial aquifer system dense network of perennial streams urban land cover and also that the study area including zones follows the administrative boundary and not the hydrologic boundary the contributions of lateral inflow outflow and unaccounted recharge discharge are important we address these processes by introducing the term net lateral and unaccounted recharge r lua and estimate its quantum using groundwater balance equation by rearranging the terms in equation 2 13 r l u a Œ¥ s a n n u a l d d u d i r d i u r r r s w r r f d 14 where r l u a l f i n l f o u t unaccounted recharge discharge since all the terms in equation 13 are known r lua can be estimated 3 1 3 estimation of available groundwater resource and stage of development the total annual groundwater recharge r tgw from all sources is estimated by adding r r r sw r rfd and r lua further the annual surplus deficit of groundwater gw aval is determined as given below 15 gw aval r tgw d agw where d agw is the annual groundwater draft for all purposes refer section 3 1 4 to quantify the status of groundwater utilisation in the study area the stage of groundwater development s gwd in each zone is estimated as given below 16 s g w d d a g w r u t g w 100 where r utgw is the utilisable total annual groundwater recharge which is taken as 90 of r tgw as per the gec guidelines 10 of r tgw is deducted to take care of unaccounted natural discharges based on s gwd and seasonal trends of groundwater level the categorization of each zone i e safe semi critical critical and over exploited is done according to the gec guidelines for better understanding of the status of groundwater resources and decision making for further development 3 1 4 groundwater draft the information on seasonal monsoon and non monsoon and annual groundwater draft for years 2001 2015 was collected from dwasa out of total water supplied by dwasa 78 is withdrawn from groundwater in and around dhaka dwasa 2016 in addition to groundwater abstraction done by dwasa a large amount of groundwater abstraction takes place through private wells authentic data on groundwater abstraction through private wells are not available in this study the seasonal and annual groundwater draft through private wells domestic and industrial in all the zones of dhaka are taken as 36 long term average of the total dwasa draft burgess et al 2011 cited in islam et al 2017 the draft for irrigation purpose is considered as negligible the total annual groundwater draft d agw in dhaka i e draft by dwasa draft by private wells is shown in table 2 the draft for monsoon and non monsoon seasons are apportioned accordingly from the d agw it is evident from table 2 that the d agw in the study area nearly doubled during the study period 3 2 hydrological modelling 3 2 1 the variable infiltration capacity vic model the vic model is a macro scale spatially distributed hydrological model developed at the university of washington liang et al 1994 1996 as discussed earlier it has been widely used by the researchers for hydrological studies in many river basins around the globe behera et al 2019 bowling et al 2000 garg et al 2013 2016 2017 2019 hamman et al 2018 nikam et al 2015 2018 wood et al 1997 2011 using topographic soil land cover vegetation data along with meteorological forcing vic solves the water balance or both water and energy balance together for every active grid in the study area further vic can deal with complicated hydrological processes using limited observed meteorological precipitation temperature wind speed data behera et al 2019 cherkauer et al 2003 nikam et al 2015 the governing equations for estimating the infiltration evapotranspiration runoff and baseflow used by the vic model liang et al 1994 1996 are summarised below the infiltration i is estimated using the following equations 17 i i m 1 1 a 1 b i 18 i m 1 b i Œ∏ s z in the above equations i m is maximum infiltration capacity of the soil mm a is fraction of area for which the infiltration capacity is less than i b i is infiltration shape parameter Œ∏ s is soil porosity and z is soil depth m all these variables are for the top thin soil layer the evapotranspiration is estimated according to the penman monteith equation as 19 e n 1 n c n e c n e t n c n 1 e 1 where e is evapotranspiration e 1 is evaporation from soil layer e t n is transpiration e c n is evaporation from canopy layer mm c n is vegetation fractional coverage for the nth tile c n 1 is bare soil fraction and n 1 n 1 c n 1 the vic model is based on the variable infiltration curve zhao et al 1980 to accommodate the spatial heterogeneity of runoff the total runoff q can be expressed similar to the total evapotranspiration as 20 q n 1 n 1 c n q d n q b n where q d n and q b n are the direct runoff and baseflow in mm for each grid in the vic setup the study area is horizontally divided into square grids of suitable size the soil column in each grid is then divided into layers with a minimum of two layers mostly preferred to any number of discrete layers depending upon the availability of observed data of soil strata the baseflow from each model grid is derived as the function of soil moisture in the lowest soil layer using arno nonlinear formula franchini and pacciani 1991 as 21 q b d s d m w s Œ∏ s Œ∏ i 0 Œ∏ i w s Œ∏ s d s d m w s Œ∏ s Œ∏ i d m d s d m w s Œ∏ i w s Œ∏ s Œ∏ s w s Œ∏ s 2 Œ∏ i w s Œ∏ s where d m is the maximum subsurface flow mm d d s is fraction of d m w s is fraction of maximum soil moisture Œ∏ s soil porosity and Œ∏ i is volumetric soil moisture content of ith soil layer in present case i 3 the baseflow recession curve is linear below a threshold w s Œ∏ s and nonlinear above the threshold the first derivative at the transition from the linear to nonlinear drainage is continuous it is evident from equation 21 that the baseflow from the bottom most soil layer is the contribution of excess water of the soil layers due to gravity to the sub surface system i e groundwater since vic model considers only productive top layer of soil in the hydrological simulation the baseflow of the bottom most soil layer can t be directly considered as contribution to groundwater i e groundwater recharge hence in the present study the baseflow of the bottom most soil layer is considered as the potential groundwater recharge to assess the relationship between actual groundwater recharge due to rainfall in the study area for further details

fluxes the methodology adopted for vic model setup and estimating hydrological fluxes is shown in fig 5 vic requires four essential input files viz soil parameter file vegetation parameter file vegetation library meteorological forcing files in addition to a global parameter file readers may refer garg et al 2017 and nikam et al 2018 for detailed procedure of generating the input parameter files global parameter file and running vic in the windows environment with linux emulator a brief description with particular reference to this study is provided here generation of grid in the present study grids of 0 003 0 003 resolution are generated for the extent 23 66 23 912 n and 90 31 90 52 e using fishnet tool available in arcgis software out of 5880 grids generated for the geographical bound of the study area 3068 grids falling within the study area are marked as active run grids for simulation in vic attributes such as run grid grid number average elevation average slope average annual rainfall and soil texture of the dominant soil in the grid are added subsequently to the grid file soil parameters file vic 3l is implemented in the current study considering 3 soil layers z1 z2 z3 of 0 300 300 700 and 700 1500 mm depth the soil parameters file describes the characteristics of each soil layer for each grid cell it defines grid cell number its active status run or not geo location latitude longitude the texture of majority soil type in the grid depth of each soil layer and other hydrological parameters the primary data used to prepare this input is taken from the fao harmonized world soil database v 1 2 table 1 vegetation parameters and vegetation library the vegetation parameter file explicitly represents sub grid heterogeneity in land cover classes by defining the vegetative composition of each grid cell along with their fractional coverage and root depth the vegetation library file on the other hand describes hydrologically important characteristics of different land cover types and their temporal variability by taking phenological changes into account such as leaf area index lai albedo canopy resistance and relative fraction of roots in each of the soil layers liang et al 1996 the lulc map of year 2015 is used to generate the vegetation parameter file of the study area the vegetation library and other associated parameters of vegetation parameter file are taken from garg et al 2017 and nikam et al 2018 meteorological forcing files these files are prepared for the 09 observation stations in and around the study area the daily data for the years 2001 2015 are arranged in the columnar format as daily maximum temperature tmax in c daily minimum temperature tmin in c and rainfall in mm the long term annual average rainfall and mean temperature for each grid are calculated using observed data and appended in the grid file the meteorological forcing files for each active run grid are generated by ingesting the updated grid file and meteorological forcing files of observations stations in the user friendly vic tool developed by gupta 2012 global parameter file this is the control file of the vic model which contains information about the number of soil layers nodes time step start and end year month day hour of simulation start and end year month day hour of meteorological forcing location of the input and output files and mode of run water balance or water energy balance the global parameter file and other input parameter files are generated using the vic tool the vic model is run at a daily time step for the years 2001 2015 in water balance mode to solve the complete water balance for each grid in the study area total 3068 flux files containing all the components of hydrological water balance i e precipitation runoff evaporation transpiration soil moisture in each layer and baseflow are generated after model run the information at daily time step from flux files is aggregated at monthly seasonal and annual time step and spatial maps of different hydrological fluxes precipitation runoff evapotranspiration and baseflow are generated using the code developed in interactive data language idl the annual baseflow maps are considered as potential groundwater recharge due to rainfall which are in turn used to analyse the relationship between actual gec based groundwater recharge due to rainfall and model derived potential groundwater recharge in the study area 3 3 relationship between actual groundwater recharge and vic based baseflow an attempt is made in the present study to investigate the relationship between baseflow i e potential groundwater recharge due to rainfall derived from the spatially distributed surface hydrological model vic with actual groundwater recharge due to rainfall r r estimated using groundwater balance based gec methodology for establishing the relation vic based annual baseflow and gec based annual r r are estimated for the entire study area for the 2010 2015 period taking lulc map of 2015 as a reference for the land surface parameters to maintain consistency only these 6 years are used since in the present study due to the non availability of spatial lulc maps for all the years 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of input data 4 1 1 spatio temporal change in land use land cover and impervious surface area the lulc maps for the years 2000 2010 and 2015 fig 2 b d obtained from sob were prepared using high resolution remote sensing data the analysis of these maps indicated that in the year 2000 34 of the study area was covered under built up class while 42 was occupied by water bodies and wetland by the year 2010 and 2015 the extent of built up land increased to 49 and 57 respectively at the same time the area under water bodies and wetland shrunk to 18 and 12 in 2010 and 2015 respectively such changes in land cover have significant bearing on the groundwater recharge hence the change in impervious area i e built up land with time is estimated using lst derived from remote sensing data landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli and tirs as described in section 3 1 1 the lst thresholds for mapping the built up land are derived using lst and lulc maps of 2010 and 2015 it is observed that 1 19 standard deviation stddev from the median lst of built up pixels derived using the settlement mask of reference years could map the actual built up land with good accuracy as validated with lulc map of year 2000 using this approach the built up land and also its fraction in each zone of dhaka are estimated for all the years the highest rate of urbanisation 7 10 per year is observed in the northern and north eastern zones e g zone 9 uttara zone 10 pallabi and zone 8 gulshan the primary reason for this rapid growth of built up land in these zones appears to be the availability of open land barren vegetated land wetland the analysis of lulc maps indicate that wetlands in these three zones have shrunk by 75 from 2000 to 2015 further though the percent increase in urbanisation is higher in these three zones the highest fraction of settlement area is present in motijheel zone 1 based on the fraction of built up land the isf values are estimated for each zone and for each year of the study period table 3 it is clear from table 3 that the isf values in each zone have decreased with time these derived isf values were used in the rifm for estimation of seasonal and annual groundwater recharge due to rainfall 4 1 2 trend in groundwater levels the monthly groundwater level data from 58 observation wells were collected from dwasa for the study period 2001 2015 the average monthly groundwater levels in each zone are estimated using these data fig 6 which clearly show that the groundwater levels declined significantly in all the zones of dhaka the rate of groundwater decline is estimated table 4 from monthly groundwater level data using the 1 least squares approach and 2 non parametric mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 with sen s slope method sen 1968 krishan et al 2018 the rate of decline in groundwater level varies between 2 and 3 m year on an average during 2001 2015 in all the zones of dhaka the trend is statistically significant at 99 9 confidence level the absolute decline in groundwater level from 2001 to 2015 is observed to be in the range of 30 44 m in both the pre and post monsoon seasons the highest decline occurred in zone 4 mirpur 44 m during 2001 2015 followed by zone 1 motijheel 42 m and zone 3 dhanmondi 40 m the steepest rate of groundwater level decline 3 3 2 m year also occurred in these three zones during both the pre and post monsoon seasons the groundwater level in the central zone of dhaka zone 1 reached 86 m bgl by 2015 with annual rate of decline being 3 1 m year these results are in agreement with the results published by akther et al 2009 in the dhaka area the rainfall recharge mainly happens in the upper aquifer however seasonal variations sinusoidal or cyclic behaviour in the water table are not observed except in zone 4 mirpur this is mainly because the annual groundwater draft is significantly higher than the annual recharge 4 2 groundwater resource assessment using groundwater balance approach 4 2 1 rainfall recharge the monsoon rainfall recharge to groundwater mr r in all the zones of dhaka are estimated using rifm and wtfm as per the methodology and inputs described in section 3 1 1 the percent difference pd equation 12 in the mr r estimates from both the methods is calculated for all the zones and for each year of the study period high pd beyond 20 is observed in almost all the zones during all the years of analysis the wtfm estimates are much higher than rifm estimates in 131 cases out of 150 cases the reason for high positive pd is that rifm takes into account the recharge only from rainfall in the season whereas wtfm solves the groundwater balance equation taking into account the recharge from all the sources in the dhaka area leakage from rivers pluvial drainage and lateral recharge are the main source of groundwater recharge hoque et al 2014 khan et al 2016 islam et al 2017 while estimating the mr r in the present case equation 11 lateral groundwater recharge including the recharge from river leakage particularly from rivers lying at the boundary of the study area and recharge from pluvial drainage are ignored due to non availability of such data at zone level the discounting of contributions from lateral and unaccounted sources in the wtfm has resulted in higher values of mr r due to the out of bound values of pd in almost 146 cases 131 with greater than 20 and 15 with less than 20 the final mr r in each zone is dominantly estimated by adjusting the rifm based mr r as per the gec norms discussed in section 3 1 1 table 5 provides the final mr r estimates in the study area the average zonal mr r varies from 2 3 to 6 3 million m3 the total average mr r in dhaka is estimated as 34 7 million m3 which works out to 8 3 of monsoon rainfall the highest mr r is found to occur in zone 9 uttara followed by zone 8 gulshan owing to their large size and comparatively less impervious area zone 2 lalbagh has the lowest mr r due to higher proportion of impervious area in the zone during the study period the lowest values of mr r in different zones are observed in the year 2012 which is due to 30 deficit rainfall during this year on the contrary highest values of mr r are observed in the year 2007 which received 43 excess rainfall with respect to long term average rainfall the non monsoon rainfall recharge nmr r estimated for each zone of dhaka is given in table 6 the average zonal nmr r varies from 0 65 million m3 in zone 2 lalbagh to 1 77 million m3 in zone 9 uttara the total average nmr r in dhaka is estimated as 10 3 million m3 therefore average annual monsoon non monsoon rainfall recharge r r for the entire study area during the study period is estimated as 44 9 million m3 i e 146 mm per year per unit area which is equivalent to 7 6 of average annual rainfall 4 2 2 recharge from other sources the average annual recharge from surface water bodies and wetlands r sw in different zones of dhaka is estimated to vary from 1 19 to 5 54 million m3 during 2001 2015 with the highest contribution coming from zone 9 uttara followed by zone 10 pallabi the gradual reduction in r sw is observed with time the r sw reduced from 2 20 to 9 79 million m3 in 2001 to 0 54 2 71 million m3 in 2015 due to the reduction of water bodies and wetlands in the study area bhuiyan and bhuiyan 1997 as also discussed in section 4 1 1 the 15 year average annual r sw for the entire dhaka is estimated as 35 62 million m3 which is almost equal to rainfall recharge during monsoon season mr r the annual recharge from return flow of groundwater draft r rfd in different zones is estimated to vary from 8 76 to 30 71 million m3 in 2001 and 16 68 55 38 million m3 in 2015 respectively the 15 year average annual r rfd contribution for the entire study area is estimated as 225 78 million m3 while in 2015 it is estimated as 307 1 million m3 the average annual r rfd is around five times of the average annual rainfall recharge r r in the present study the return flow factor is taken as 30 of the total groundwater draft as discussed in section 3 1 2 the uncertainty in groundwater draft is likely to induce uncertainty in the groundwater recharge solving equation 13 the annual contribution from lateral and unaccounted recharge r lua is estimated in all the zones table 7 it can be seen from table 7 that the zonal and total contribution of r lua is in general many times higher than r r further it also evident that r lua has increased significantly with time in all the zones as discussed earlier in section 4 2 1 the pd between mr r estimated using wtfm and rifm was found to be very high the reason for this can be explained from the values of r lua in case of wtfm mr r is estimated using seasonal groundwater balance method however in the present case the contribution of lateral recharge was ignored at a hydrological unit scale the mr r estimates of wtfm dominates the results in most of the cases as the assumption of insignificant lateral recharge holds good in the present case the assessment units are the administrative zones of dhaka which do not follow the hydrological boundaries further the alluvial aquifer system generally cut across the surface hydrological boundaries hence the assumption of insignificant lateral recharge fails here this emphasises that in such cases i e sedimentary aquifers non hydrologic assessment units and urban landscapes the groundwater assessment done without complete groundwater balance may not yield correct results it also implies that if the rainfall recharge estimation is made using rifm closure of the groundwater balance equation must be done for accurate assessment of groundwater recharge in the area 4 2 3 total annual groundwater recharge the contributions from different sources to groundwater recharge across the study period are shown in fig 7 the total annual groundwater recharge r tgw of each zone and total for dhaka is estimated by adding the annual contribution of all the sources r r r sw r rfd r lua the annual zonal and total dhaka recharge estimates from 2001 to 2015 are shown in table 8 the zonal annual recharge in the study period varies from 10 4 to 172 7 million m3 the highest annual groundwater recharge is found to be in zone 6 tejgaon followed by zone 7 sutrapur and zone 9 uttara the average annual groundwater recharge in the study area dhaka is estimated as 635 35 million m3 2065 mm year per unit area a clear increasing trend in r tgw can be seen from table 8 and fig 7 in contrast to the reducing trend observed in mr r r r and r sw this indicates that the annual groundwater recharge process in the dhaka is dominated by the other components r rfd and r lua to understand the relative importance of all the recharge processes in the dhaka area the fractional contribution from each source of recharge to r tgw is estimated these are 3 3 12 6 from rainfall 2 13 6 from the surface water bodies and wetlands 34 7 36 6 from the return flow of domestic and other water uses and 39 7 59 5 from the lateral flow and unaccounted recharge sources at the scale of the study area the rainfall recharge accounts for only 7 1 equivalent to 7 6 of annual rainfall and the remaining part comes from other sources the highest contribution comes from the lateral and unaccounted recharge 51 8 followed by recharge from return flow of urban groundwater draft 35 5 and surface water bodies and wetlands 5 6 4 2 4 groundwater availability and stage of development the total annual recharge r tgw estimated using groundwater balance approach is compared with the annual groundwater draft d agw in the study area fig 8 the difference in d agw and r tgw fig 8 indicates the overexploitation of groundwater in dhaka which has resulted in decline of the groundwater level the annual groundwater deficit estimated using equation 15 is provided in table 9 it shows that the groundwater deficit has increased with time which is due to the combined effect of increased groundwater abstraction and reduced recharge due to increasing impervious surface area as a result of urbanisation for checking the results the excess groundwater withdrawal in each year in the study area was converted into decline in groundwater level by dividing the excess groundwater withdrawal with specific s y and total area of the study from 2001 to 2015 and compared with the observed values both the estimated and observed rates of decline in groundwater level are found to be in agreement with each other thereby validating the recharge estimates the zone wise stage of groundwater development s gwd during the study period is estimated table 10 using the utilisable annual groundwater recharge and the annual draft equation 16 the s gwd values are in the range of 116 9 319 5 table 10 in all the zones an environmentally unsustainable scenario the highest s gwd is observed in zone 8 gulshan the s gwd values and continuous declining trend in groundwater level in both the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons suggest that the dhaka falls in over exploited category as discussed earlier the rate of decline of groundwater level is increasing with time and the present rate of groundwater abstraction is not sustainable from the increasing trend of urbanization it is anticipated that more groundwater would be abstracted to meet the water demand of city dwellers this would result in further decline in groundwater levels and worsening of the prevailing situation it is recommended that the authorities should explore the possibility of artificial recharge in the water table and decrease the dependency on groundwater by tapping alternative sources of water the continuous monitoring of the groundwater levels and abstraction status along with frequent groundwater assessment using different techniques are also recommended for planning strategies towards sustainable water management 4 3 estimation of rainfall recharge using hydrological modelling following the methodology described in section 3 2 monthly and annual raster maps of rainfall evapotranspiration runoff and baseflow from 2001 to 2015 were generated using the daily hydrological fluxes obtained from vic model simulation table 11 fig 9 it is important to note that the lulc map of 2015 was used as input to the vic model for the entire study period due to unavailability of temporal maps of the total annual precipitation the average contribution to evapotranspiration surface runoff and baseflow is estimated as 56 1 25 9 and 17 2 respectively as discussed in section 3 3 an attempt is made to establish a relationship between actual annual groundwater recharge due to rainfall r r gec estimates and potential rainfall recharge baseflow estimated using vic since the lulc of the study area has changed substantially during the study period 2001 2015 the analysis of relationship between r r and annual baseflow is done only for the latest condition of the study area i e lulc of 2015 as discussed in section 3 3 initially the annual zonal r r is regressed with annual zonal baseflow estimates for this the baseflow is plotted against corresponding r r values for all the ten zones for six years 2010 2015 however this analysis did not yield any statistically significant result in a hydrological unit watershed basin dominated with natural landscapes a relationship is generally expected between r r and baseflow the absence of statistically significant relationship in the present study could possibly be attributed to the fact that the dominant factors governing the surface hydrology and groundwater recharge in the present case are anthropogenic in nature it also implies that while vic hydrological model can be used to simulate hydrological behaviour in natural landscapes it might not be effective in modelling urban hydrology such as of the study area it is observed that at the aggregate scale of the study area dhaka about 20 8 5 1 of annual rainfall during 2010 2015 contributes to the baseflow the contribution of annual rainfall during 2010 2015 20 8 is observed to be higher than that of during 2001 2015 17 2 mainly due to four deficit rainfall years in this duration according to gec methodology it is estimated that about 6 3 1 1 of annual rainfall contributes to groundwater recharge during 2010 2015 this translates into the following relation between annual rr and annual baseflow 22 annual r r 0 313 annual baseflow the major advantage of this empirical relation is that the vic model can be run for different climatic and land cover conditions of dhaka and the modelled baseflow can be quickly converted to estimate the rainfall recharge to groundwater further if the future water demand is known the change in water table can be predicted equation 22 therefore finds applicability in quick assessment of the impact of climate and policy change on groundwater resources the usage of yearly lulc maps as input to the vic model is likely to improve the results the developed empirical relation for dhaka however may not be applicable to other areas the researchers may also explore developing such relationship in other physiographic climatic and environment setting preferably in natural landscapes 5 conclusions the present study focussed on the groundwater resource assessment and understanding the different groundwater recharge processes in dhaka bangladesh one of the most rapidly urbanising cities in the world two approaches have been used 1 groundwater balance approach and 2 distributed hydrological modelling the first approach is used for estimating the annual groundwater recharge including contributions from different sources i e from rainfall return flow of groundwater draft surface water bodies and lateral and unaccounted recharge and stage of groundwater development gec methodology and norms are used in this process the second approach is used to assess the potential groundwater recharge from rainfall in the form of baseflow an output of the vic model and then the relation between potential vic based and actual gec based rainfall recharge to groundwater is analysed further the groundwater resource assessment has been carried out in a semi distributed manner by dividing the study area in 10 water supply zones of dhaka for a period of 15 years 2001 2015 spatial and temporal information derived primarily from remote sensing data helped in providing the improved inputs in both the approaches the major conclusions and recommendations drawn from this study are following 1 the average annual groundwater recharge in the study area dhaka is estimated as 635 35 million m3 2065 mm year per unit area detailed groundwater balance analysis helped understanding the recharge processes occurring in the dhaka aquifers out of the total annual recharge the rainfall recharge accounts for only 7 1 equivalent to 7 6 of annual rainfall and the remaining part comes from other sources the highest contribution comes from the lateral and unaccounted recharge 51 8 followed by recharge from return flow of urban groundwater draft 35 5 and surface water bodies and wetlands 5 6 2 the assumption of negligible contribution of lateral and unaccounted recharge in urban landscape underlain by alluvial aquifers and with non hydrologic unit boundaries may lead to high uncertainty in estimated annual recharge as shown in the present case therefore we strongly recommended that the lateral flow component must not be ignored in such conditions and all the components in the groundwater balance equation should be addressed as far as possible 3 the stage of groundwater development is found to vary from 117 to 320 in the study period thereby indicating that all the zones of dhaka are overexploited the consistently higher annual groundwater draft in comparison with the annual recharge has led to the average rate of decline in groundwater level from 2 to 3 2 m year during 2001 2015 with the motijheel dhanmondi and mirpur zones experiencing average decline of 3 m year 4 the hydrological fluxes simulated using the vic model during 2001 2015 indicated that nearly 17 2 of the annual rainfall contributes towards baseflow further it is estimated that 31 of baseflow contributes to groundwater recharge at the aggregate level the established relation between vic based baseflow and actual groundwater recharge from rainfall will help the researchers and water resource managers analyse the impact of the changed state of meteorological inputs and land cover on groundwater recharge for futuristic planning especially in the context of climate change and rapid urbanisation around dhaka 5 as large scale urbanisation is taking place around dhaka such study may be extended to its surrounding areas the results call for an immediate need to explore the possibility of artificial recharge of the dhaka aquifers and decrease the dependency on groundwater by tapping alternative sources of water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

11964,rapid urbanisation in dhaka bangladesh with high dependency on the groundwater have recently raised concern over the sustainability of the aquifers the present study focusses on quantifying the dynamic groundwater resource vis √† vis the status of groundwater development and understanding the different recharge processes in the dhaka city using the water balance based lumped and distributed approaches in the lumped approach the groundwater assessment is carried out using groundwater balance method following the methodology and norms recommended by the groundwater estimation committee 2015 referred hereafter as gec in the distributed approach a physics based hydrological model variable infiltration capacity vic is utilised to model the baseflow i e potential recharge then an attempt is made to establish the relation between vic based baseflow and actual gec based groundwater recharge from rainfall remote sensing data derived spatio temporal information along with field based observations have been used in the process dhaka city is divided into 10 zones and the groundwater assessment is made individually in these zones as well as for the entire city during 2001 2015 period the total annual recharge is estimated as 635 35 million m3 or 2065 mm year per unit area lateral and unaccounted recharge is found to be the dominant 51 8 process in the study area followed by recharge from urban return flow 35 5 rainfall 7 1 and surface water bodies wetlands 5 6 the study underscores that the lateral and unaccounted recharge must not be ignored in the urban landscape underlain by alluvial aquifers and with non hydrologic unit boundaries the stage of groundwater development is found to vary from 117 to 320 thus indicating overexploitation of aquifers in all the zones the higher groundwater abstraction as compared to recharge in all the zones has led to consistent decline in groundwater level by 2 3 2 m year across the study area the vic model on the other hand depicted that nearly 17 2 of the annual rainfall contributes towards baseflow further it is observed that 31 of baseflow contributes to groundwater recharge due to rainfall researchers can use this relationship for quick assessment of the groundwater recharge from rainfall in dhaka based on hydrological models with varying meteorological and land cover scenarios especially in the light of climate change and rapid urbanisation graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater recharge gec vic hydrological modelling dhaka 1 introduction groundwater is an unseen but the most easily accessible and reliable source of freshwater llamas and custodio 2003 a vital resource required for the sustenance of life and the environment although groundwater abstraction is being practiced since historical times the dependency on aquifers has increased significantly in the last few decades to meet the ever increasing water requirement llamas and custodio 2003 villholth 2006 thomas et al 2008 excessive pumping from the aquifers has led to permanent decline in the groundwater levels in many parts of the world especially in fluvio deltaic aquifers the overexploitation of groundwater has increased the problem of saline water intrusion in the useful shallow aquifers shamsudduha et al 2019 an assessment of groundwater resources in terms of present status of availability vis √† vis draft is thus essential for sustainable management of aquifers de vries and simmers 2002 thomas et al 2008 groundwater being the dynamic and replenishable natural resource its availability is generally assessed based on the annual recharge to the aquifers groundwater recharge is defined as the downward flow of water reaching the water table forming an addition to the groundwater reservoir de vries and simmers 2002 and is critical for planning the further scope of groundwater development in an area sinha and sharma 1988 rushton 1988 hydrogeologists have developed and used many methods for quantifying the groundwater recharge van der lee and gehrels 1990 divided these methods into two major groups 1 direct methods and 2 indirect methods the direct methods e g hydrologic budgeting based rainfall runoff models estimate recharge using top down approach such hydrologic models essentially provide potential recharge rushton 1988 wherein the water available at the base of the root zone i e rainfall runoff evapotranspiration is generally estimated through physically based distributed approach the estimated potential recharge however may be higher than the actual recharge as all the water available at the base of the root zone may or may not reach the aquifer on the other hand the indirect methods provide actual groundwater recharge using the water table fluctuations several papers dealing with the issues related to groundwater recharge are published in the hydrogeology journal vol 10 issue 1 2002 in a theme issue on groundwater recharge which may be referred for further details although a number of groundwater recharge estimation methods are available today each method has its own advantages and limitations and there is always an uncertainty associated with the estimated recharge therefore multiple methods are used in order to reduce the uncertainty in the estimated groundwater recharge de vries and simmers 2002 healy and cook 2002 scanlon et al 2002 the water table fluctuation method wtfm by virtue of providing actual recharge is one of the most commonly used methods for groundwater recharge estimation healy and cook 2002 shamsudduha et al 2011 the ground water estimation committee gec constituted by the government of india to standardize the methodology for recharge estimation thus adopted the wtfm along with the rainfall infiltration factor method rifm for recharge estimation the underlying principle of the gec methodology is the groundwater balance approach the detailed methodology and guidelines of the gec were first published in 1984 and were revised subsequently in 1997 and 2017 these guidelines are referred as gec 1984 mowr 1984 gec 1997 mowr 1997 and gec 2015 mowr rd gr 2017 the intricate linkage between surface water and groundwater systems affects recharge discharge processes sophocleous 2002 cherepansky et al n d according to cherepansky et al n d there are essentially two types of interconnections between surface and groundwater 1 infiltration of surface water through the unsaturated zone and 2 exfiltration discharge of groundwater into surface water bodies further the interactions between surface and groundwater depend on a complex combination of geomorphic hydrogeologic hydrologic climatic and landscape factors sophocleous 2002 cherepansky et al n d many of the groundwater assessment methods tend to ignore the climatic and landscape factors however advanced land surface or surface hydrological models incorporate them for better representation of the hydrological processes the variable infiltration capacity vic model is one such model developed by liang et al 1994 1996 with a variety of updates since its development bowling et al 2000 cherkauer et al 2003 yang and xie 2003 it has been extensively used in hydrologic data set preparation trend analysis of hydrological fluxes and states macro scale hydrological modelling aggarwal et al 2013 garg et al 2013 2016 data evaluation and assimilation nikam et al 2018 behera et al 2019 coupled climate modelling climate change impact assessment aggarwal et al 2012 hamman et al 2018 nikam et al 2018 garg et al 2019 land cover change impact assessment garg et al 2012 2017 etc the vic model estimates all the surface hydrological components at a spatially and temporally distributed scale however as the model primarily works with the parameters of the aeration zone the primary interlink between surface water and groundwater i e baseflow or potential groundwater recharge can be estimated using this model the potential recharge estimated using the surface hydrological model such as vic can in turn be used to estimate actual groundwater recharge due to rainfall by coupling it with groundwater recharge assessment method s and or observations geospatial techniques primarily remote sensing along with the geographical information system gis and satellite navigation systems have unique capability to provide the spatio temporal information about many of the land surface and climatic variables and processes which are often required as inputs to the recharge estimation methods and surface hydrological models some of the important land surface variables and hydrologic fluxes provided by the remote sensing systems are topography through digital elevation model dem land use and land cover lulc including distribution of surface water bodies wetlands and vegetation cover soil moisture evapotranspiration irrigation network variability in lithology and soils structurally weak zones or lineaments and climate further besides providing specific inputs to recharge estimation methods the spatially complete and temporal information provided by the remote sensing data significantly help improving the understanding of the hydrogeological system hoffmann and sander 2007 dhaka the capital city of bangladesh and one of the world s fastest growing megacities is facing serious challenge to meet the increased water demand due to rapid growth in population industrial development and urbanization groundwater forms the primary source of freshwater supply in dhaka according to dhaka water supply and sewerage authority dwasa 2019 out of the total water supply of 2550 million litres per day mld in dhaka city and adjoining narayanganj area about 78 i e 2000 mld is being met by tapping the aquifers through deep tube wells apart from this significant groundwater withdrawal is taking place through private wells for meeting the domestic and industrial requirements this has led to significant decline 60 m in the last five decades in groundwater levels in the central part of dhaka with the present rate of decline being about 2 3 m per year akhter et al 2009 khan et al 2011 khan et al 2016 dwasa 2019 the condition in dhaka is expected to deteriorate in the future if the excessive and indiscriminate withdrawal of groundwater continues the groundwater recharge process in the densely urbanised dhaka are more complex due to nature of the relationship between urbanisation and subsurface flow dynamics like the combined role of the urban surface presence of water management and drainage networks and other surface subsurface characteristics e g geology soil vegetation topography the aquifer in dhaka is characterised by large contribution from seasonal floods and river leakage shamsudduha et al 2011 further studies have proven the significant impact of faulty urban water distribution supply and collection sewage networks on groundwater recharge mcgrane 2016 a few studies have been carried out by the researchers to assess the status of groundwater potential in and around dhaka bhuiyan and bhuiyan 1997 khan et al 2011 buet 2000 dwasa 2016 islam et al 2017 however comprehensive assessment of groundwater resources in a distributed semi distributed framework utilising the geospatial inputs is lacking the present study focusses on assessing the groundwater resource and understanding different groundwater recharge processes in the dhaka city bangladesh one of the most rapidly urbanising cities in the world in a semi distributed manner using the groundwater balance approach we also investigate the applicability of distributed surface hydrological model vic which better represents the changing land surface conditions in assessment of annual groundwater recharge due to rainfall in the area gec 2015 methodology and norms are followed for quantifying the different components of groundwater recharge which are in turn used in groundwater balance equation for assessment of total recharge and status of groundwater utilisation the strength of the study is the usage of semi distributed distributed approach supplemented with the geospatial data in achieving the objectives 2 study area and datasets the study area dhaka city hereafter referred to as dhaka is located in the heart of the bengal delta and in the centre of bangladesh fig 1 it is bound by longitudes 90 328 e 90 514 e and latitudes 23 668 n 23 902 n and extends for 19 km in e w direction and 24 km in n s covering a total area of 307 6 km2 dhaka is economic cultural and political centre of bangladesh and is home to nearly 20 million people dwasa 2019 dhaka is divided into 10 geographic zones from water supply point of view fig 1 the elevation of the area varies from 1 5 to 25 m above mean sea level amsl with an average height of 10 m amsl fig 2 a urban built up dominates the land use land cover lulc of the study area water bodies wetlands vegetation and bare land are the other lulc classes fig 2 b d many streams and their distributaries flow in and around dhaka the important ones flowing through the study area include buriganga balu and turag rivers and their distributaries which along with wetlands form the important source of recharge to the upper aquifer the area enjoys subtropical monsoon climate with mean 1981 2010 annual rainfall of 2085 mm and mean monthly minimum and maximum temperatures range from 13 1 to 26 4 c and 25 1 33 8 c respectively khatun et al 2016 a major portion of rainfall takes place during southwest monsoon in june september months the hydrologic year is thus taken as june may the area is covered by the madhapur formation clay silt and silty clay of pleistocene age and late pleistocene holocene alluvium of older and younger flood plains the madhupur formation and alluvium are underlain by the dupi tila formation of plio peistocene age which forms the main aquifer system the dupi tila aquifer system 400 m thick is divided into 1 upper dupi tila aquifer and 2 lower dupi tila aquifer hoque et al 2007 rahman et al 2013 akhter and hossain 2017 islam et al 2017 both the upper and lower dupi tila aquifers in turn comprise of two aquifers thus total four aquifers which are separated by aquitard layers akhter and hossain 2017 the upper dupi tila aquifer is of unconfined to semi confined nature while the lower dupi tila aquifer is of semi confined to confined nature the abstraction of groundwater in dhaka initially started from upper aquifer but subsequently due to lowering of groundwater level deeper aquifer is being exploited the input data used for carrying out the present study and their sources are listed in table 1 these include the topographic map temporal lulc maps prepared from high resolution remote sensing data digital elevation model dem satellite images groundwater related data and information viz depth to groundwater level draft location of wells aquifer parameters soil map and soil characteristics and meteorological parameters the data are of both spatial remote sensing or its derived products thematic maps topo maps and non spatial point or station based observational data nature further many of these data are time series data collected during the study period i e 2001 2015 3 methodology the methodology followed to achieve the objectives of the present study consists of three main parts 1 assessment of groundwater resource and understanding quantifying all the groundwater recharge processes using the groundwater balance approach 2 estimation of hydrological fluxes using a physics based distributed hydrological model vic 3 investigation of relationship between actual annual rainfall recharge and hydrological model estimated baseflow potential groundwater recharge the gec 2015 hereafter referred to as gec methodology and norms are used for estimating the recharge from different sources rainfall return flow from groundwater draft seepage from surface water bodies and wetlands which have been used in groundwater balance equation to estimate total recharge availability and stage of groundwater development remote sensing data derived information along with other geospatial inputs ground observations and ancillary data were used while implementing both the gec methodology and hydrological modelling fig 3 shows the overall methodology framework the details are provided in the next sections 3 1 groundwater balance approach considering the various inflow and outflow components in a given study area the groundwater balance equation can be written as mowr rd gr 2017 1 Œ¥ s inflow recharge lateral inflow outflow draft lateral outflow 2 or Œ¥ s a n n u a l r r r s w r r f d l f i n d d u d i r d i u l f o u t where Œ¥s is the change in groundwater storage during a given time period Œ¥s annual is the annual change in storage r r is the annual recharge from rainfall r sw is annual recharge from surface water bodies and wetlands r rfd is the annual recharge from return flow of draft d du d ir and d iu are the annual groundwater draft for domestic irrigation and industrial uses respectively lf in and lf out are the annual lateral inflow and outflow respectively the methodology adopted for estimating different components of groundwater recharge and draft and the resource available for further development is elaborated in the following sections 3 1 1 estimation of groundwater recharge from rainfall as suggested by gec assessment of groundwater recharge from rainfall is carried out using two methods 1 rainfall infiltration factor method rifm and 2 water table fluctuation method wtfm the water supply zones of dhaka represented as z 1 z 2 z 10 in fig 1 are used as unit for groundwater resource assessment further the assessment is made annually during 2001 2015 period for implementing both the methods the monsoon season is considered from june to september 4 months and non monsoon season from october to may 8 months the information on aquifer parameters and groundwater draft is collected from the line departments and published literature the remote sensing data are used to capture the lulc dynamics viz the impervious area and surface area of water bodies and wetlands in each zone that affect actual groundwater recharge the impervious surface area recharge correction factors isf estimated from remote sensing data in each zone are used in the rifm to estimate the annual rainfall recharge while the extent of water bodies and wetlands in each zone is used to estimate the groundwater recharge through leakage fig 4 shows the broad framework for estimating rainfall recharge using the rifm and wtfm 3 1 1 1 rainfall infiltration factor method for estimating the annual groundwater recharge from rainfall r r using rifm recharge during the monsoon mr r and non monsoon nmr r seasons are estimated separately and then summed up as given in the following equations 3 m r r r f i f a r m a 1000 4 n m r r r f i f a r n m a 1000 5 r r mr r nmr r where rfif is the rainfall infiltration factor a is the area of the assessment unit in m2 r m and r nm represent monsoon and non monsoon rainfall in mm respectively and a is the minimum rainfall threshold in mm that can induce groundwater recharge the urbanisation has taken place at a rapid pace in dhaka resulting in increase in impervious built up area with time fig 2 b d it means that the actual area through which rainfall infiltration can happen has decreased with time to account for this change in land cover an additional term called as impervious surface area recharge correction factor isf is incorporated in equations 3 and 4 the revised equations are given below equations 6 and 7 which along with equation 5 are finally used for estimating the rainfall recharge in different zones of dhaka using rifm 6 m r r r f i f i s f a r m a 1000 7 n m r r r f i f i s f a r n m a 1000 8 where isf 1 fractional urban impervious cover in the assessment unit rfif is taken as 0 16 the average value as proposed by gec for east coast alluvium having clayey soils further 10 of the normal annual rainfall taken as average of total duration studied in present case i e 2001 2015 is taken as the value of a as suggested by gec the non monsoon rainfall recharge nmr r will be zero if r nm is less than a the isf equation 8 is estimated using remote sensing inputs the impervious surface area for the years 2000 2010 and 2015 were derived using lulc maps generated by survey of bangladesh sob using high resolution aerial and satellite remote sensing data the fractional land cover under the built up class was calculated for each year using the zonal statistics tool of arcgis and accordingly isf was estimated however for all the intermediate years for which the lulc maps were not available the isf was estimated using remote sensing derived land surface temperature lst following the procedure given below the satellite images of the study area acquired by landsat 5 thematic mapper tm and landsat 8 operational land imager oli thermal infrared sensor tirs during pre monsoon season march to may of 2001 2015 were downloaded from usgs earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov the remote sensing data were converted to at sensor level spectral radiance and reflectance using the rescaling factors provided in the metadata the lst for each pixel is estimated using a simplified radiative transfer theory based method mao et al 2005 zhang and he 2013 rozenstein et al 2014 nikam et al 2016 generally the anthropogenic impervious surfaces exhibit higher lst as compared to other natural vegetated landscapes however other land covers such as the barren land and dry sand which also exhibit higher lst would have been misclassified as anthropogenic impervious surfaces if lst threshold was directly used further since the dates of acquisition of satellite images were different despite being of pre monsoon season using the absolute value of lst as a threshold for mapping impervious surface area would have also not been the correct approach to overcome this difficulty an innovative approach was used for the selection of appropriate lst threshold for accurate mapping of impervious surface area in the dhaka region in the first step the masks for barren land including dry riverbed and built up area were prepared from lulc maps of 2000 2010 and 2015 the masks generated using lulc map of 2000 were used for lst analysis for the 2001 2007 period while the masks generated from lulc maps of 2010 and 2015 were used for lst analysis for the 2008 2012 and 2013 2015 periods respectively in the second step the median values of lst were calculated for all the built up land for the years 2000 2010 and 2015 using the respective built up masks the range of lst values in terms of standard deviation stddev from the median values i e median nstddev were found out for the built up areas of 2010 and 2015 using manual inspection technique this lst threshold was then tested for the year 2000 which yielded good results in the third step the standard deviation threshold from the median lst value using the built up mask of the reference year was then applied on all the years except 2010 and 2015 to map the impervious surface area in each year the isf for each zone was estimated using these impervious surface area maps this way the temporal dynamics of urbanisation was incorporated in the gec methodology using remote sensing inputs 3 1 1 2 water table fluctuation method as suggested by the gec the wtfm method is used for estimating the mr r based on change in groundwater storage during the monsoon season Œ¥s mon and groundwater balance method equations 9 and 10 as given below 9 Œ¥ s mon Œ¥ h s y a 10 Œ¥ s m o n m r r m r s w m r r f d m l f i n m d d u m d i r m d i u m l f o u t where s y is the specific yield of the aquifer Œ¥h is the fluctuation in groundwater level between pre monsoon and post monsoon a is the area of the assessment unit zones of dhaka mr r is the recharge from rainfall during monsoon mr sw is the recharge from surface water bodies and wetlands during monsoon mr rfd is the recharge from return flow of draft during monsoon md du md ir and md iu are the groundwater draft during monsoon for domestic irrigation and industrial uses respectively and mlf in and mlf out are the lateral inflow recharge and outflow during monsoon respectively assuming mlf in and mlf out as negligible and by rearranging the terms in equation 10 the mr r has been estimated using the following equation 11 m r r Œ¥ h s y a m r s w m r r f d m d d u m d i r m d i u data on the monthly groundwater level from 58 observation wells for the period 2001 2015 were collected from dhaka water supply and sewerage authority dwasa the data were analysed to estimate the general trend in the groundwater level in different zones of dhaka groundwater level data of may representing pre monsoon and october representing post monsoon are used to calculate the fluctuation in the water table the seasonal pre and post monsoon groundwater levels in each zone of dhaka were estimated for each year by taking the spatial weighted average of the observed groundwater levels of all the observation wells for the corresponding zone and year the s y of aquifer for the study area is taken as 0 15 based on the recommendations of dwasa and published literature akhter and hossain 2017 the methodology for estimating the mr sw mr rfd md du md ir and md iu fluxes is given in the next section according to the gec methodology the mr r estimates made using the rifm and wtfm are compared by computing the percentage difference pd between them as given below 12 p d m r r w t f m m r r r i f m 100 m r r r i f m if 20 pd 20 the final value of mr r is taken as mr r of wtfm if pd 20 then final mr r 0 8 mr r of rifm and if pd 20 then final mr r 1 2 mr r of rifm the mr r estimated using either of the rifm or wtfm method is then added to nmr r estimated using rifm to obtain annual groundwater recharge from rainfall r r 3 1 2 estimation of recharge from other sources the recharge from other sources r sw r rfd are estimated based on norms suggested by the gec the recharge from surface water bodies and wetlands during the monsoon mr sw and non monsoon nmr sw periods are estimated by multiplying the water spread area with the number of days the water is available in the water body and recharge factor rf 1 44 as per gec guidelines the spatio temporal dynamics of water spread area of all the water bodies between the years 2001 2015 was estimated using lulc maps 2000 2010 and 2015 of the study area the surface area of all the water bodies during the years 2000 2010 and 2015 in all the zones of dhaka was estimated using the zonal statistics tool of arcgis it is observed that the water bodies and wetlands in the study area have shrunk with time assuming that the rate of shrinkage of the water bodies is linear with time the rate of shrinkage was estimated for each zone using lulc maps of 2000 2010 and 2015 for all the intermediate years 2001 2009 and 2011 2014 the area of water bodies in each zone is estimated using this derived rate of shrinkage and reference area of water bodies the incorporation of the temporal dynamics of surface water bodies in the traditional gec methodology is likely to increase the accuracy of estimated groundwater recharge the recharge from return flow of groundwater draft during the monsoon mr rfd and non monsoon nmr rfd periods are estimated by applying the return flow factor on the groundwater draft the groundwater draft in different zones of dhaka is discussed in section 3 1 4 the return flow factor for groundwater draft is taken as 30 buet 2000 rahman 2003 cited in hoque 2004 in the dhaka area dominant groundwater recharge happens due to infiltration of rainfall knappett et al 2016 river bank leakages hoque et al 2014 khan et al 2016 islam et al 2017 leakages from urban water supply dwasa 2012 and from pluvial drainage as well as sewers and unsewered sanitation morris et al 2003 hoque et al 2014 the contribution of rainfall to the groundwater r r is estimated using rifm and wtfm section 3 1 1 the contribution of leakages from urban supply sewers and sanitation system is taken care by considering the return flow from groundwater draft r rfd and the contribution of surface water bodies and wetlands existing within the study area r sw is considered based on gec norms considering the presence of alluvial aquifer system dense network of perennial streams urban land cover and also that the study area including zones follows the administrative boundary and not the hydrologic boundary the contributions of lateral inflow outflow and unaccounted recharge discharge are important we address these processes by introducing the term net lateral and unaccounted recharge r lua and estimate its quantum using groundwater balance equation by rearranging the terms in equation 2 13 r l u a Œ¥ s a n n u a l d d u d i r d i u r r r s w r r f d 14 where r l u a l f i n l f o u t unaccounted recharge discharge since all the terms in equation 13 are known r lua can be estimated 3 1 3 estimation of available groundwater resource and stage of development the total annual groundwater recharge r tgw from all sources is estimated by adding r r r sw r rfd and r lua further the annual surplus deficit of groundwater gw aval is determined as given below 15 gw aval r tgw d agw where d agw is the annual groundwater draft for all purposes refer section 3 1 4 to quantify the status of groundwater utilisation in the study area the stage of groundwater development s gwd in each zone is estimated as given below 16 s g w d d a g w r u t g w 100 where r utgw is the utilisable total annual groundwater recharge which is taken as 90 of r tgw as per the gec guidelines 10 of r tgw is deducted to take care of unaccounted natural discharges based on s gwd and seasonal trends of groundwater level the categorization of each zone i e safe semi critical critical and over exploited is done according to the gec guidelines for better understanding of the status of groundwater resources and decision making for further development 3 1 4 groundwater draft the information on seasonal monsoon and non monsoon and annual groundwater draft for years 2001 2015 was collected from dwasa out of total water supplied by dwasa 78 is withdrawn from groundwater in and around dhaka dwasa 2016 in addition to groundwater abstraction done by dwasa a large amount of groundwater abstraction takes place through private wells authentic data on groundwater abstraction through private wells are not available in this study the seasonal and annual groundwater draft through private wells domestic and industrial in all the zones of dhaka are taken as 36 long term average of the total dwasa draft burgess et al 2011 cited in islam et al 2017 the draft for irrigation purpose is considered as negligible the total annual groundwater draft d agw in dhaka i e draft by dwasa draft by private wells is shown in table 2 the draft for monsoon and non monsoon seasons are apportioned accordingly from the d agw it is evident from table 2 that the d agw in the study area nearly doubled during the study period 3 2 hydrological modelling 3 2 1 the variable infiltration capacity vic model the vic model is a macro scale spatially distributed hydrological model developed at the university of washington liang et al 1994 1996 as discussed earlier it has been widely used by the researchers for hydrological studies in many river basins around the globe behera et al 2019 bowling et al 2000 garg et al 2013 2016 2017 2019 hamman et al 2018 nikam et al 2015 2018 wood et al 1997 2011 using topographic soil land cover vegetation data along with meteorological forcing vic solves the water balance or both water and energy balance together for every active grid in the study area further vic can deal with complicated hydrological processes using limited observed meteorological precipitation temperature wind speed data behera et al 2019 cherkauer et al 2003 nikam et al 2015 the governing equations for estimating the infiltration evapotranspiration runoff and baseflow used by the vic model liang et al 1994 1996 are summarised below the infiltration i is estimated using the following equations 17 i i m 1 1 a 1 b i 18 i m 1 b i Œ∏ s z in the above equations i m is maximum infiltration capacity of the soil mm a is fraction of area for which the infiltration capacity is less than i b i is infiltration shape parameter Œ∏ s is soil porosity and z is soil depth m all these variables are for the top thin soil layer the evapotranspiration is estimated according to the penman monteith equation as 19 e n 1 n c n e c n e t n c n 1 e 1 where e is evapotranspiration e 1 is evaporation from soil layer e t n is transpiration e c n is evaporation from canopy layer mm c n is vegetation fractional coverage for the nth tile c n 1 is bare soil fraction and n 1 n 1 c n 1 the vic model is based on the variable infiltration curve zhao et al 1980 to accommodate the spatial heterogeneity of runoff the total runoff q can be expressed similar to the total evapotranspiration as 20 q n 1 n 1 c n q d n q b n where q d n and q b n are the direct runoff and baseflow in mm for each grid in the vic setup the study area is horizontally divided into square grids of suitable size the soil column in each grid is then divided into layers with a minimum of two layers mostly preferred to any number of discrete layers depending upon the availability of observed data of soil strata the baseflow from each model grid is derived as the function of soil moisture in the lowest soil layer using arno nonlinear formula franchini and pacciani 1991 as 21 q b d s d m w s Œ∏ s Œ∏ i 0 Œ∏ i w s Œ∏ s d s d m w s Œ∏ s Œ∏ i d m d s d m w s Œ∏ i w s Œ∏ s Œ∏ s w s Œ∏ s 2 Œ∏ i w s Œ∏ s where d m is the maximum subsurface flow mm d d s is fraction of d m w s is fraction of maximum soil moisture Œ∏ s soil porosity and Œ∏ i is volumetric soil moisture content of ith soil layer in present case i 3 the baseflow recession curve is linear below a threshold w s Œ∏ s and nonlinear above the threshold the first derivative at the transition from the linear to nonlinear drainage is continuous it is evident from equation 21 that the baseflow from the bottom most soil layer is the contribution of excess water of the soil layers due to gravity to the sub surface system i e groundwater since vic model considers only productive top layer of soil in the hydrological simulation the baseflow of the bottom most soil layer can t be directly considered as contribution to groundwater i e groundwater recharge hence in the present study the baseflow of the bottom most soil layer is considered as the potential groundwater recharge to assess the relationship between actual groundwater recharge due to rainfall in the study area for further details

fluxes the methodology adopted for vic model setup and estimating hydrological fluxes is shown in fig 5 vic requires four essential input files viz soil parameter file vegetation parameter file vegetation library meteorological forcing files in addition to a global parameter file readers may refer garg et al 2017 and nikam et al 2018 for detailed procedure of generating the input parameter files global parameter file and running vic in the windows environment with linux emulator a brief description with particular reference to this study is provided here generation of grid in the present study grids of 0 003 0 003 resolution are generated for the extent 23 66 23 912 n and 90 31 90 52 e using fishnet tool available in arcgis software out of 5880 grids generated for the geographical bound of the study area 3068 grids falling within the study area are marked as active run grids for simulation in vic attributes such as run grid grid number average elevation average slope average annual rainfall and soil texture of the dominant soil in the grid are added subsequently to the grid file soil parameters file vic 3l is implemented in the current study considering 3 soil layers z1 z2 z3 of 0 300 300 700 and 700 1500 mm depth the soil parameters file describes the characteristics of each soil layer for each grid cell it defines grid cell number its active status run or not geo location latitude longitude the texture of majority soil type in the grid depth of each soil layer and other hydrological parameters the primary data used to prepare this input is taken from the fao harmonized world soil database v 1 2 table 1 vegetation parameters and vegetation library the vegetation parameter file explicitly represents sub grid heterogeneity in land cover classes by defining the vegetative composition of each grid cell along with their fractional coverage and root depth the vegetation library file on the other hand describes hydrologically important characteristics of different land cover types and their temporal variability by taking phenological changes into account such as leaf area index lai albedo canopy resistance and relative fraction of roots in each of the soil layers liang et al 1996 the lulc map of year 2015 is used to generate the vegetation parameter file of the study area the vegetation library and other associated parameters of vegetation parameter file are taken from garg et al 2017 and nikam et al 2018 meteorological forcing files these files are prepared for the 09 observation stations in and around the study area the daily data for the years 2001 2015 are arranged in the columnar format as daily maximum temperature tmax in c daily minimum temperature tmin in c and rainfall in mm the long term annual average rainfall and mean temperature for each grid are calculated using observed data and appended in the grid file the meteorological forcing files for each active run grid are generated by ingesting the updated grid file and meteorological forcing files of observations stations in the user friendly vic tool developed by gupta 2012 global parameter file this is the control file of the vic model which contains information about the number of soil layers nodes time step start and end year month day hour of simulation start and end year month day hour of meteorological forcing location of the input and output files and mode of run water balance or water energy balance the global parameter file and other input parameter files are generated using the vic tool the vic model is run at a daily time step for the years 2001 2015 in water balance mode to solve the complete water balance for each grid in the study area total 3068 flux files containing all the components of hydrological water balance i e precipitation runoff evaporation transpiration soil moisture in each layer and baseflow are generated after model run the information at daily time step from flux files is aggregated at monthly seasonal and annual time step and spatial maps of different hydrological fluxes precipitation runoff evapotranspiration and baseflow are generated using the code developed in interactive data language idl the annual baseflow maps are considered as potential groundwater recharge due to rainfall which are in turn used to analyse the relationship between actual gec based groundwater recharge due to rainfall and model derived potential groundwater recharge in the study area 3 3 relationship between actual groundwater recharge and vic based baseflow an attempt is made in the present study to investigate the relationship between baseflow i e potential groundwater recharge due to rainfall derived from the spatially distributed surface hydrological model vic with actual groundwater recharge due to rainfall r r estimated using groundwater balance based gec methodology for establishing the relation vic based annual baseflow and gec based annual r r are estimated for the entire study area for the 2010 2015 period taking lulc map of 2015 as a reference for the land surface parameters to maintain consistency only these 6 years are used since in the present study due to the non availability of spatial lulc maps for all the years 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of input data 4 1 1 spatio temporal change in land use land cover and impervious surface area the lulc maps for the years 2000 2010 and 2015 fig 2 b d obtained from sob were prepared using high resolution remote sensing data the analysis of these maps indicated that in the year 2000 34 of the study area was covered under built up class while 42 was occupied by water bodies and wetland by the year 2010 and 2015 the extent of built up land increased to 49 and 57 respectively at the same time the area under water bodies and wetland shrunk to 18 and 12 in 2010 and 2015 respectively such changes in land cover have significant bearing on the groundwater recharge hence the change in impervious area i e built up land with time is estimated using lst derived from remote sensing data landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli and tirs as described in section 3 1 1 the lst thresholds for mapping the built up land are derived using lst and lulc maps of 2010 and 2015 it is observed that 1 19 standard deviation stddev from the median lst of built up pixels derived using the settlement mask of reference years could map the actual built up land with good accuracy as validated with lulc map of year 2000 using this approach the built up land and also its fraction in each zone of dhaka are estimated for all the years the highest rate of urbanisation 7 10 per year is observed in the northern and north eastern zones e g zone 9 uttara zone 10 pallabi and zone 8 gulshan the primary reason for this rapid growth of built up land in these zones appears to be the availability of open land barren vegetated land wetland the analysis of lulc maps indicate that wetlands in these three zones have shrunk by 75 from 2000 to 2015 further though the percent increase in urbanisation is higher in these three zones the highest fraction of settlement area is present in motijheel zone 1 based on the fraction of built up land the isf values are estimated for each zone and for each year of the study period table 3 it is clear from table 3 that the isf values in each zone have decreased with time these derived isf values were used in the rifm for estimation of seasonal and annual groundwater recharge due to rainfall 4 1 2 trend in groundwater levels the monthly groundwater level data from 58 observation wells were collected from dwasa for the study period 2001 2015 the average monthly groundwater levels in each zone are estimated using these data fig 6 which clearly show that the groundwater levels declined significantly in all the zones of dhaka the rate of groundwater decline is estimated table 4 from monthly groundwater level data using the 1 least squares approach and 2 non parametric mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 with sen s slope method sen 1968 krishan et al 2018 the rate of decline in groundwater level varies between 2 and 3 m year on an average during 2001 2015 in all the zones of dhaka the trend is statistically significant at 99 9 confidence level the absolute decline in groundwater level from 2001 to 2015 is observed to be in the range of 30 44 m in both the pre and post monsoon seasons the highest decline occurred in zone 4 mirpur 44 m during 2001 2015 followed by zone 1 motijheel 42 m and zone 3 dhanmondi 40 m the steepest rate of groundwater level decline 3 3 2 m year also occurred in these three zones during both the pre and post monsoon seasons the groundwater level in the central zone of dhaka zone 1 reached 86 m bgl by 2015 with annual rate of decline being 3 1 m year these results are in agreement with the results published by akther et al 2009 in the dhaka area the rainfall recharge mainly happens in the upper aquifer however seasonal variations sinusoidal or cyclic behaviour in the water table are not observed except in zone 4 mirpur this is mainly because the annual groundwater draft is significantly higher than the annual recharge 4 2 groundwater resource assessment using groundwater balance approach 4 2 1 rainfall recharge the monsoon rainfall recharge to groundwater mr r in all the zones of dhaka are estimated using rifm and wtfm as per the methodology and inputs described in section 3 1 1 the percent difference pd equation 12 in the mr r estimates from both the methods is calculated for all the zones and for each year of the study period high pd beyond 20 is observed in almost all the zones during all the years of analysis the wtfm estimates are much higher than rifm estimates in 131 cases out of 150 cases the reason for high positive pd is that rifm takes into account the recharge only from rainfall in the season whereas wtfm solves the groundwater balance equation taking into account the recharge from all the sources in the dhaka area leakage from rivers pluvial drainage and lateral recharge are the main source of groundwater recharge hoque et al 2014 khan et al 2016 islam et al 2017 while estimating the mr r in the present case equation 11 lateral groundwater recharge including the recharge from river leakage particularly from rivers lying at the boundary of the study area and recharge from pluvial drainage are ignored due to non availability of such data at zone level the discounting of contributions from lateral and unaccounted sources in the wtfm has resulted in higher values of mr r due to the out of bound values of pd in almost 146 cases 131 with greater than 20 and 15 with less than 20 the final mr r in each zone is dominantly estimated by adjusting the rifm based mr r as per the gec norms discussed in section 3 1 1 table 5 provides the final mr r estimates in the study area the average zonal mr r varies from 2 3 to 6 3 million m3 the total average mr r in dhaka is estimated as 34 7 million m3 which works out to 8 3 of monsoon rainfall the highest mr r is found to occur in zone 9 uttara followed by zone 8 gulshan owing to their large size and comparatively less impervious area zone 2 lalbagh has the lowest mr r due to higher proportion of impervious area in the zone during the study period the lowest values of mr r in different zones are observed in the year 2012 which is due to 30 deficit rainfall during this year on the contrary highest values of mr r are observed in the year 2007 which received 43 excess rainfall with respect to long term average rainfall the non monsoon rainfall recharge nmr r estimated for each zone of dhaka is given in table 6 the average zonal nmr r varies from 0 65 million m3 in zone 2 lalbagh to 1 77 million m3 in zone 9 uttara the total average nmr r in dhaka is estimated as 10 3 million m3 therefore average annual monsoon non monsoon rainfall recharge r r for the entire study area during the study period is estimated as 44 9 million m3 i e 146 mm per year per unit area which is equivalent to 7 6 of average annual rainfall 4 2 2 recharge from other sources the average annual recharge from surface water bodies and wetlands r sw in different zones of dhaka is estimated to vary from 1 19 to 5 54 million m3 during 2001 2015 with the highest contribution coming from zone 9 uttara followed by zone 10 pallabi the gradual reduction in r sw is observed with time the r sw reduced from 2 20 to 9 79 million m3 in 2001 to 0 54 2 71 million m3 in 2015 due to the reduction of water bodies and wetlands in the study area bhuiyan and bhuiyan 1997 as also discussed in section 4 1 1 the 15 year average annual r sw for the entire dhaka is estimated as 35 62 million m3 which is almost equal to rainfall recharge during monsoon season mr r the annual recharge from return flow of groundwater draft r rfd in different zones is estimated to vary from 8 76 to 30 71 million m3 in 2001 and 16 68 55 38 million m3 in 2015 respectively the 15 year average annual r rfd contribution for the entire study area is estimated as 225 78 million m3 while in 2015 it is estimated as 307 1 million m3 the average annual r rfd is around five times of the average annual rainfall recharge r r in the present study the return flow factor is taken as 30 of the total groundwater draft as discussed in section 3 1 2 the uncertainty in groundwater draft is likely to induce uncertainty in the groundwater recharge solving equation 13 the annual contribution from lateral and unaccounted recharge r lua is estimated in all the zones table 7 it can be seen from table 7 that the zonal and total contribution of r lua is in general many times higher than r r further it also evident that r lua has increased significantly with time in all the zones as discussed earlier in section 4 2 1 the pd between mr r estimated using wtfm and rifm was found to be very high the reason for this can be explained from the values of r lua in case of wtfm mr r is estimated using seasonal groundwater balance method however in the present case the contribution of lateral recharge was ignored at a hydrological unit scale the mr r estimates of wtfm dominates the results in most of the cases as the assumption of insignificant lateral recharge holds good in the present case the assessment units are the administrative zones of dhaka which do not follow the hydrological boundaries further the alluvial aquifer system generally cut across the surface hydrological boundaries hence the assumption of insignificant lateral recharge fails here this emphasises that in such cases i e sedimentary aquifers non hydrologic assessment units and urban landscapes the groundwater assessment done without complete groundwater balance may not yield correct results it also implies that if the rainfall recharge estimation is made using rifm closure of the groundwater balance equation must be done for accurate assessment of groundwater recharge in the area 4 2 3 total annual groundwater recharge the contributions from different sources to groundwater recharge across the study period are shown in fig 7 the total annual groundwater recharge r tgw of each zone and total for dhaka is estimated by adding the annual contribution of all the sources r r r sw r rfd r lua the annual zonal and total dhaka recharge estimates from 2001 to 2015 are shown in table 8 the zonal annual recharge in the study period varies from 10 4 to 172 7 million m3 the highest annual groundwater recharge is found to be in zone 6 tejgaon followed by zone 7 sutrapur and zone 9 uttara the average annual groundwater recharge in the study area dhaka is estimated as 635 35 million m3 2065 mm year per unit area a clear increasing trend in r tgw can be seen from table 8 and fig 7 in contrast to the reducing trend observed in mr r r r and r sw this indicates that the annual groundwater recharge process in the dhaka is dominated by the other components r rfd and r lua to understand the relative importance of all the recharge processes in the dhaka area the fractional contribution from each source of recharge to r tgw is estimated these are 3 3 12 6 from rainfall 2 13 6 from the surface water bodies and wetlands 34 7 36 6 from the return flow of domestic and other water uses and 39 7 59 5 from the lateral flow and unaccounted recharge sources at the scale of the study area the rainfall recharge accounts for only 7 1 equivalent to 7 6 of annual rainfall and the remaining part comes from other sources the highest contribution comes from the lateral and unaccounted recharge 51 8 followed by recharge from return flow of urban groundwater draft 35 5 and surface water bodies and wetlands 5 6 4 2 4 groundwater availability and stage of development the total annual recharge r tgw estimated using groundwater balance approach is compared with the annual groundwater draft d agw in the study area fig 8 the difference in d agw and r tgw fig 8 indicates the overexploitation of groundwater in dhaka which has resulted in decline of the groundwater level the annual groundwater deficit estimated using equation 15 is provided in table 9 it shows that the groundwater deficit has increased with time which is due to the combined effect of increased groundwater abstraction and reduced recharge due to increasing impervious surface area as a result of urbanisation for checking the results the excess groundwater withdrawal in each year in the study area was converted into decline in groundwater level by dividing the excess groundwater withdrawal with specific s y and total area of the study from 2001 to 2015 and compared with the observed values both the estimated and observed rates of decline in groundwater level are found to be in agreement with each other thereby validating the recharge estimates the zone wise stage of groundwater development s gwd during the study period is estimated table 10 using the utilisable annual groundwater recharge and the annual draft equation 16 the s gwd values are in the range of 116 9 319 5 table 10 in all the zones an environmentally unsustainable scenario the highest s gwd is observed in zone 8 gulshan the s gwd values and continuous declining trend in groundwater level in both the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons suggest that the dhaka falls in over exploited category as discussed earlier the rate of decline of groundwater level is increasing with time and the present rate of groundwater abstraction is not sustainable from the increasing trend of urbanization it is anticipated that more groundwater would be abstracted to meet the water demand of city dwellers this would result in further decline in groundwater levels and worsening of the prevailing situation it is recommended that the authorities should explore the possibility of artificial recharge in the water table and decrease the dependency on groundwater by tapping alternative sources of water the continuous monitoring of the groundwater levels and abstraction status along with frequent groundwater assessment using different techniques are also recommended for planning strategies towards sustainable water management 4 3 estimation of rainfall recharge using hydrological modelling following the methodology described in section 3 2 monthly and annual raster maps of rainfall evapotranspiration runoff and baseflow from 2001 to 2015 were generated using the daily hydrological fluxes obtained from vic model simulation table 11 fig 9 it is important to note that the lulc map of 2015 was used as input to the vic model for the entire study period due to unavailability of temporal maps of the total annual precipitation the average contribution to evapotranspiration surface runoff and baseflow is estimated as 56 1 25 9 and 17 2 respectively as discussed in section 3 3 an attempt is made to establish a relationship between actual annual groundwater recharge due to rainfall r r gec estimates and potential rainfall recharge baseflow estimated using vic since the lulc of the study area has changed substantially during the study period 2001 2015 the analysis of relationship between r r and annual baseflow is done only for the latest condition of the study area i e lulc of 2015 as discussed in section 3 3 initially the annual zonal r r is regressed with annual zonal baseflow estimates for this the baseflow is plotted against corresponding r r values for all the ten zones for six years 2010 2015 however this analysis did not yield any statistically significant result in a hydrological unit watershed basin dominated with natural landscapes a relationship is generally expected between r r and baseflow the absence of statistically significant relationship in the present study could possibly be attributed to the fact that the dominant factors governing the surface hydrology and groundwater recharge in the present case are anthropogenic in nature it also implies that while vic hydrological model can be used to simulate hydrological behaviour in natural landscapes it might not be effective in modelling urban hydrology such as of the study area it is observed that at the aggregate scale of the study area dhaka about 20 8 5 1 of annual rainfall during 2010 2015 contributes to the baseflow the contribution of annual rainfall during 2010 2015 20 8 is observed to be higher than that of during 2001 2015 17 2 mainly due to four deficit rainfall years in this duration according to gec methodology it is estimated that about 6 3 1 1 of annual rainfall contributes to groundwater recharge during 2010 2015 this translates into the following relation between annual rr and annual baseflow 22 annual r r 0 313 annual baseflow the major advantage of this empirical relation is that the vic model can be run for different climatic and land cover conditions of dhaka and the modelled baseflow can be quickly converted to estimate the rainfall recharge to groundwater further if the future water demand is known the change in water table can be predicted equation 22 therefore finds applicability in quick assessment of the impact of climate and policy change on groundwater resources the usage of yearly lulc maps as input to the vic model is likely to improve the results the developed empirical relation for dhaka however may not be applicable to other areas the researchers may also explore developing such relationship in other physiographic climatic and environment setting preferably in natural landscapes 5 conclusions the present study focussed on the groundwater resource assessment and understanding the different groundwater recharge processes in dhaka bangladesh one of the most rapidly urbanising cities in the world two approaches have been used 1 groundwater balance approach and 2 distributed hydrological modelling the first approach is used for estimating the annual groundwater recharge including contributions from different sources i e from rainfall return flow of groundwater draft surface water bodies and lateral and unaccounted recharge and stage of groundwater development gec methodology and norms are used in this process the second approach is used to assess the potential groundwater recharge from rainfall in the form of baseflow an output of the vic model and then the relation between potential vic based and actual gec based rainfall recharge to groundwater is analysed further the groundwater resource assessment has been carried out in a semi distributed manner by dividing the study area in 10 water supply zones of dhaka for a period of 15 years 2001 2015 spatial and temporal information derived primarily from remote sensing data helped in providing the improved inputs in both the approaches the major conclusions and recommendations drawn from this study are following 1 the average annual groundwater recharge in the study area dhaka is estimated as 635 35 million m3 2065 mm year per unit area detailed groundwater balance analysis helped understanding the recharge processes occurring in the dhaka aquifers out of the total annual recharge the rainfall recharge accounts for only 7 1 equivalent to 7 6 of annual rainfall and the remaining part comes from other sources the highest contribution comes from the lateral and unaccounted recharge 51 8 followed by recharge from return flow of urban groundwater draft 35 5 and surface water bodies and wetlands 5 6 2 the assumption of negligible contribution of lateral and unaccounted recharge in urban landscape underlain by alluvial aquifers and with non hydrologic unit boundaries may lead to high uncertainty in estimated annual recharge as shown in the present case therefore we strongly recommended that the lateral flow component must not be ignored in such conditions and all the components in the groundwater balance equation should be addressed as far as possible 3 the stage of groundwater development is found to vary from 117 to 320 in the study period thereby indicating that all the zones of dhaka are overexploited the consistently higher annual groundwater draft in comparison with the annual recharge has led to the average rate of decline in groundwater level from 2 to 3 2 m year during 2001 2015 with the motijheel dhanmondi and mirpur zones experiencing average decline of 3 m year 4 the hydrological fluxes simulated using the vic model during 2001 2015 indicated that nearly 17 2 of the annual rainfall contributes towards baseflow further it is estimated that 31 of baseflow contributes to groundwater recharge at the aggregate level the established relation between vic based baseflow and actual groundwater recharge from rainfall will help the researchers and water resource managers analyse the impact of the changed state of meteorological inputs and land cover on groundwater recharge for futuristic planning especially in the context of climate change and rapid urbanisation around dhaka 5 as large scale urbanisation is taking place around dhaka such study may be extended to its surrounding areas the results call for an immediate need to explore the possibility of artificial recharge of the dhaka aquifers and decrease the dependency on groundwater by tapping alternative sources of water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
