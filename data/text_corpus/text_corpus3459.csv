17295,there is an increasing demand to monitor the human exposure to phthalates and a few studies have used phthalate metabolites in wastewater to estimate exposure to these chemicals in the population however it is suspected that the stability of phthalates and phthalate metabolites during sewer transport can influence the final estimates in this study we used laboratory sewer reactors to evaluate the in sewer transformation of phthalates and their metabolites and deconjugation of phthalate metabolites we found concentrations of parent phthalates decreased quickly over time while the concentrations of phthalate metabolites increased significantly for most compounds indicating that parent phthalate compounds are partly transformed into their metabolites in the sewer our assessment of the deconjugation of glucuronide conjugated phthalate metabolites found that this process did not significantly affect the concentrations of phthalate metabolites in the wastewater with the relative difference ranging from 16 to 7 between enzymatically treated samples and control group additionally our results showed that phthalate metabolites could be subject to rapid degradation during the incubation process our findings suggested that the level of phthalate metabolites in sewage could be strongly influenced by the in sewer transformation of the parent phthalates and of themselves and could not be assumed as uniquely the results of urinary excretion after human exposure to parent phthalates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phthalate diesters phthalate monoesters biofilm glucuronide conjugate transformation 1 introduction wastewater based epidemiology wbe or the systematic analysis of biomarkers in sewage to estimate consumption or exposure of chemicals has provided an alternative complementary approach to monitoring population exposure to a range of chemicals lorenzo and picó 2019 wbe has been widely used to estimate illicit drug consumption gonzález mariño et al 2020b thomas et al 2012 tscharke et al 2019 but it may also provide consumption exposure information of other chemicals gracia lor et al 2017 including biomarkers that are linked to health status choi et al 2018 phthalates a class of man made plasticiser chemicals with widespread use in industrial and consumer products are the target of many human exposure studies giovanoulis et al 2018 wang et al 2019 due to concerns about their reproductive developmental and endocrine disrupting effects hauser et al 2005 heudorf et al 2007 song et al 2020 human exposure to phthalates occurs via various routes including air dust soil water and food langer et al 2014 peijnenburg and struijs 2006 tran and kannan 2015 once absorbed into the human body phthalates can rapidly be transformed into their associated metabolites which are excreted via urination and eventually enter the sewer system indeed a range of phthalate metabolites have been frequently detected in previous wbe studies du et al 2018 gao and wen 2016 gonzález mariño et al 2020a gonzález mariño et al 2017 previous studies on phthalate metabolites in wastewater reported some knowledge gaps two studies have compared the loads of phthalate metabolites in wastewater with the estimated excretion through urine and reported that the load of phthalate metabolites measured in wastewater were significantly higher than the load contributed by the population urine gonzález mariño et al 2017 tang et al 2020 indicating the influence of other factors to the load of phthalate metabolites in wastewater rather than the contribution from human urine tang et al 2020 have suggested that parent phthalates could be hydrolysed in the sewers to form the monoester metabolites which have been demonstrated by the preliminary experiments of gonzález mariño et al 2017 thus the sources of phthalate monoesters in the wastewater include both the urinary excretion as monoester and the transformation from phthalate diester in the wastewater consequently the human exposure to phthalate could be overestimated using wbe measuring phthalate monoesters while there are some wastewater treatment studies looking into the degradation of phthalates in wastewater there is no study that investigates the degradation of parent phthalates in the sewer system which could generate phthalate monoesters and contribute to the total level of phthalate monoesters in the sewers additionally the phthalate metabolites excreted in urine partly in the form of glucuronide conjugated monoesters silva et al 2003 could be deconjugated during sewer transport gao et al 2017 gao et al 2018 due to the presence of microbial enzymes i e arylsulfatase and β glucuronidase vergine et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 therefore it is of interest to determine the extent of deconjugation of phthalate metabolites in the sewer conditions to assess their impact of deconjugation on the concentrations of free phthalate monoesters and therefore on the applicability of wbe on the estimation of human exposure to phthalates to date studies on potential transformation among phthalates phthalate monoester metabolites and conjugated monoesters as well as deconjugation process under sewer condition are lacking which hinders the full interpretation of phthalates phthalate metabolites data in wbe studies the aims of this study hence were to investigate 1 the fate of phthalates and their metabolites in the sewers using laboratory scale sewer reactors 2 the extent of deconjugation of the phthalate monoesters in wastewater samples and 3 evaluate the effects of the transformation between phthalates and their metabolites as well as the deconjugation on the level of phthalate metabolites in the sewer understanding the contribution of different sources to the eventual concentrations of phthalates metabolites in wastewater will help determine whether they can be used as biomarkers to estimate

their metabolites in realistic sewer conditions we utilised laboratory scale sewer reactors that have been shown to mimic typical sewer conditions in previous studies choi et al 2020 thai et al 2014b these consisted of a rising main reactor rmr a gravity sewer reactor gsr a sediment reactor sr and a control reactor cr rmr gsr and cr were made of perspextm with a volume of 0 75 l 149 mm id 80 mm biofilm carriers with diameter of 1 cm were clustered on four stainless steel rods inside the reactor to provide additional surfaces for biofilm growth figure s1a rmr was operated under anaerobic condition gs was only partially filled with real wastewater allowing a gas phase cr was used during the batch tests only containing the bulk wastewater without the growth of biofilm in addition rmr and gsr had been cultivated with sewer biofilm using domestic wastewater several months before the experiment rmr and gsr were fed with freshly collected sewage through a peristaltic pump masterflex 7520 47 every 6 hours delivering one reactor volume 0 75 l of sewage into each reactor to ensure homogeneous distribution in reactors gentle mixing was provided with magnetic stirrers at 250 rpm heidolph mr3000 the total volume of sr was 3 2 l 210 mm id 140 mm figure s1b and there was a sediment part at the bottom and the reactor received continuous feeding with 40 rpm mixing speed under the routine operational mode wastewater effluent flowed through outlet 1 to the drain leaving 0 5 l of gas volume in the headspace more details about the reactors can be found in the supporting information text 1 2 3 batch tests for the transformation of phthalate metabolites in sewer reactors batch tests in triplicate were conducted to investigate the degradation of the biomarkers under different sewer conditions created by different sewer reactors before each batch test newly collected wastewater was warmed to room temperature and then spiked with a freshly collected within 1 hour prior to the spike pool of human urine 10 v v to increase the detection frequencies of phthalate metabolites with limited sample volume 8 ml the volume of urine spike was calculated to ensure the ph and ammonia concentration were within the tolerable range for the biota of the sewer biofilm and based on previous data on the level of phthalate metabolites in urine and wastewater in southeast queensland tang et al 2020 the scod and volatile fatty acid vfa in the urine spiked sewage was 832 3 mg l and 82 6 mgcod l respectively the reactors were drained prior to the feeding of urine spiked wastewater after rapid mixing an initial sample was collected t 0 from each reactor the urine spiked wastewater was then fed to each reactor and the initial samples were collected t 0 wastewater samples were subsequently taken at different time intervals i e 0 5 1 2 3 5 7 and 9 hours after the spiking after collection samples were filtered and frozen immediately at 20 c until analysis biological activities in rmr gsr and sr were monitored via measuring the dissolved sulfur species and methane see supporting information text 2 2 4 testing the potential deconjugation of glucuronide monoester phthalate in wastewater phthalate glucuronide metabolites were potentially present in the wastewater samples after the spike of fresh urine silva et al 2003 therefore to assess the impact of their deconjugation to the total concentration of phthalate metabolite in wastewater samples we incubated a mixture of wastewater and fresh urine 10 v v and sampled at different time intervals after stirring for 30 min samples were spiked with 100 µl of β glucuronidase 140 units mg and transferred into a temperature controlled room at 37 c six ml was taken from each sample immediately and considered as the initial sample t 0 additional samples 6 ml were subsequently taken at 0 5 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 h intervals samples were filtered and extracted immediately after they were removed from the temperature control room the initial concentration of each analyte t 0 was set as 100 and the impact of deconjugation was observed by the relative change of total free phthalate metabolites over time 2 5 analysis of phthalates and their metabolites in wastewater method of extraction for phthalates in wastewater samples was adopted from gonzalez marino et al 2017 in general approximately 8 ml of acidified sample ph 2 0 was filtered through φ47 mm glass microfiber filters and nitrocelluose membrane filters the filtered sample 3 ml was spiked with 40 μl internal standards 25 250 μg l next they were solid phase extracted spe on supelco select hlb cartridges previously rinsed with 5 ml of meoh and 5 ml of mq water at ph 2 0 for the comparison of β glucuronidase treatment 5 ml of the filtered samples were spiked with 40 μl internal standards and 25 µl β glucuronidase solution 10 in 1 m ammonium acetate sorbents were dried under nitrogen for 30 min and analytes eluted with 5 ml of meoh eluates were concentrated down to near dryness under nitrogen 99 999 and diluted to a final volume of 0 5 ml meoh for their liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms analysis treatment of samples from the deconjugation experiment was similar to the procedure mentioned above after the incubation with β glucuronidase at 37 c for a given time samples were spiked with internal standards and extracted immediately with hlb cartridges the extracts were then concentrated and analysed by lc ms ms 2 6 instrumental analysis liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms was performed using a shimadzu nexera ii uhplc system shimadzu corp kyoto japan coupled to a sciex 6500 qtrap with an electrospray ionisation source operating in scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode for phthalates the separation was achieved using a 2 6 micron 50 2 0 mm phenomenex kinetek biphenyl column phenomenex torrance ca operated at 45 c the flow conditions were set as follows flow rate of 0 32 ml min with a linear gradient starting at 45 b for 0 5 minutes ramped to 98 b in 6 5 minutes with a slope setting of 1 held at 98 for 3 minutes followed by equilibration at 45 b for 4 5 minutes a 1 methanol in hplc grade water b 95 methanol both containing 0 1 acetic acid a 50 4 6 mm 5 micron evo c18 column phenomenex torrance ca was inserted between the pumps and autosampler to trap mobile phase contaminants the mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion multiple reaction monitoring mode using nitrogen as the collision gas with a dwell time of 18 milliseconds per mrm giving a scan time of 0 6 seconds at least two identification ions were selected from the precursor ions of each of the analytes and optimised for signal intensity in the tandem spectrometry these identification ions were used in the mrm mode for high specificity and sensitivity the product ion with higher signal intensity was selected for the quantitative analysis for each of the ten phthalates the ion spray voltage was 5 kv apparatus settings for detection are listed in table s2 for the monoester metabolites a kinetex f5 column was used for chromatographic separation mobile phases were a 1 meoh 99 milli q water 0 1 acetic acid b 95 meoh 5 milli q water 0 1 acetic acid the flow conditions were set as follows flow rate of 0 3 ml min with a linear gradient starting at 5 b ramped to 100 b in 14 5 min then held at 100 for 2 5 minutes followed by equilibration at 5 b for 4 min more details on the mrm information can be found in a previous publication heffernan et al 2016 2 7 quality analysis quality control procedural blanks n 3 were prepared with milli q water and were extracted together with all the wastewater samples in each batch spiked qc samples were prepared by spiking analytes into milliq water at a low level 5 ppb and high level 20 ppb and analysed in each batch the recoveries for all internal standards ranged from 76 to 115 blank subtractions were conducted for analytes that were detected in procedural blanks limits of quantification loqs were determined as the mean concentrations of procedural blanks plus ten times their standard deviation for analytes not detected in blanks loqs were defined as the lowest concentration that produced a peak signal ten times higher than the background noise from the chromatograms 2 8 data processing statistical analysis was carried out using spss 24 0 chicago usa software package for windows data were log10 transformed prior to statistical analysis and the distribution was approximately normal after the transformation bivariate correlations pearson correlation coefficients were used to investigate the correlations between chemicals in samples with and without β glucuronidase treatment significance was set at p 0 05 concentrations of analytes lower than loq were assumed to be loq 2 for statistical analysis the concentrations of phthalate metabolites measured during different collection time were normalised to the percentage relative to the initial concentrations that measured at t 0 the apparent transformation rate r from phthalates to their specific metabolites were calculated as equation 1 1 r δ c m m w p δ c p m w m 100 where cp is the decrease of phthalate concentration ng ml between samples collected at t 0 and t 9 h cm is the increase of phthalate metabolite concentration ng ml between samples collected at t 0 and t 9 h and mwp and mwm are the molecular weights of phthalates and their phthalate respectively 3 results 3 1 bioactivity in the sewers biological activity tests indicated strong activities in sewer reactors with biofilm or sediment system the strongest activities of sulfate reducing bacteria occurred as indicated by the sulfide production rates in rmr 6 1 mgs l h and sr 6 1 mgs l h in comparison the sulfide production rate in gsr was 1 4 mgs l h likely as a result of the presence of oxygen leading to sulfide oxidation as reported earlier thai et al 2014a and the possible transfer of h2s from wastewater to air the highest methane production appeared in rmr 25 6 mgcod l h due to gas liquid transfer and or the exposure to oxygen lower methane production rates were less measured for gsr 2 6 mgcod l h and sr 2 5 mgcod l h no activities were detected in the cr due to the lack of biofilm which is consistent with previous experiments thai et al 2014b 3 2 transformation of phthalate and their metabolites in sewer reactors in the samples collected from the laboratory scale sewer reactors six phthalates and eight corresponding monoester metabolites were frequently detected 50 no significant correlations were observed between the concentrations of phthalates and gas generated in the reactors possibly due to the quick hydrolysis of phthalates in wastewater the average concentrations of the phthalates and their metabolites measured in the reactors at different time intervals are shown in table 1 in addition transformation profile of individual parent and their corresponding metabolites defined as the percentage relative to the initial concentrations that measured at t 0 are presented in the following sections 3 2 1 dep and dmp and their metabolites mep and mmp the average concentrations of dep across all the reactors decreased by 66 after 9 hours from 130 58 ng ml t 0 h to 52 14 ng ml t 9 h while the concentrations of its metabolites mep were relatively stable with the average concentration from 4 4 0 59 ng ml t 0 h to 4 2 0 88 ng ml t 9 h table 1 and fig 1 similarly the concentrations of dmp decreased by 51 from 130 53 ng ml to 42 14 ng ml and the concentrations of mmp the major metabolite of dmp increased in most reactors from 0 82 0 24 ng ml to 1 3 0 92 ng ml noting that both phthalates and their metabolites at the initial time t 0 might be from the spiked urine and the fed wastewater but the concentrations of phthalates and their metabolites in the spiked urine were not analysed 3 2 2 dnbp dibp bbzp and their metabolites mbp mibp and mbzp similar to the scenario described above concentrations of the parent phthalates dnbp dibp and bbzp decreased relatively quickly in all the reactors fig 2 in contrast to concentrations of their parent compounds concentrations of monoester phthalates i e mbp mibp and mbzp increased during the 9 hour experiment indicating that some portion of the parent compounds were partially hydrolysed to the monoester metabolites in terms of the absolute concentrations average concentrations of dnbp dibp and bbzp decreased from 170 ng ml to 33 ng ml from 130 ng ml to 67 ng ml and from 170 ng ml to 71 ng ml respectively after 9 hours while the average concentrations of their specific metabolites increased from 1 2 ng ml to 1 9 ng ml mbp from 2 6 ng ml to 4 6 ng ml mibp and from 0 11 ng ml to 0 17 ng ml mbzp respectively the estimated apparent transformation rates from parent to monoester metabolite were 0 6 4 and 0 07 for dbp dibp and bbzp respectively 3 2 3 dehp and its metabolites the concentration of dehp decreased in all the sewer reactors with an average decrease from 100 to 44 fig 3 the three metabolites of dehp i e mehhp meohp and mehp were frequently detected with their concentrations increased in all reactors the average concentrations of dehp decreased from 170 ng ml t 0 to 80 ng ml t 9 h across all the different sewer reactors meanwhile after 9 hours the concentrations of its metabolites i e mehhp meohp and mehp increased by 0 46 0 20 and 4 2 ng ml in the sewers respectively resulting in apparent transformation rates of 0 7 0 3 and 7 respectively 3 3 phthalate metabolites in samples with and without treatment of β glucuronidase the samples obtained from the sewer reactors were split into two aliquots where one was incubated with β glucuronidase prior to the extraction and the other one was extracted directly without enzymatic treatment to test the level of glucuronidation of those metabolites in the samples silva et al 2003 among the total of 14 phthalate metabolites analysed eight were frequently 50 detected they are the same as the phthalate metabolites presented above indicating the dominance of those phthalates in wastewater mep was the predominant analyte with median concentrations of 4 2 and 3 2 ng ml in samples with and without enzymatic treatment respectively this result was consistent with that found in urine and wastewater samples collected from southeast queensland where mep had the highest concentrations in both pooled urine 130 ng ml and wastewater 1 9 ng ml tang et al 2020 the calculated differences in the measured concentrations of eight phthalate metabolites between samples with and without enzymatic treatment are shown in fig 4 the calculated differences between concentrations of analytes measured in samples with and without enzymatic treatment by means ranged from 16 to 7 negative differences mean that concentrations of mibp mehhp mecpp mehp mep and mmp were lower in samples with enzymatic treatment than without treatment the differences between concentrations of analytes in enzyme treated and non treated samples were small and mostly within the range of analytical variability an explanation for these small differences is that due to the lower level of glucuronidation the enzyme treatment had no impact on increasing the concentrations of free monoester metabolites while the treatment itself 30 min at warm temperature could lead to the hydrolysis of the metabolites hence their lower concentrations than the non treatment samples 3 4 deconjugation experiments to further investigate the level of glucuronidation of phthalate metabolites we conducted a separate experiment by incubating the mixture of fresh urine samples and wastewater with enzyme and sampled at different time intervals fig 5 a previous study found that β glucuronidase is the best candidate for the deconjugation of phthalate metabolites i e converting phthalate monoester conjugate to free phthalate monoester other groups of enzymes for example sulfatase helix pomatia h 1 are capable of converting parent phthalate diesters to phthalate monoesters therefore to minimise the contribution from potential phthalate diester contaminants we used β glucuronidase that is glucuronidase only no sulfatase in this study concentrations of mbp mibp and mehp were very stable over the incubation time suggesting a low level of glucuronidation on the other hand mcpp mehhp mecpp meohp and mbzp concentrations increased in the first 2 8 hours of incubation and were stable after that these suggest a possible effect of deconjugation as the de conjugated chemicals were transformed into free chemicals with β glucuronidase by contrast the concentration of mep and mmp decreased after the enzymatic treatment and were relatively stable after 2 hours this was consistent with the stability of phthalate metabolites in wastewaters gonzález mariño et al 2017 4 discussion 4 1 in sewer stability of phthalates and their metabolites we observed rapid decreases in concentrations of all the target parent phthalates in all sewer reactors including the cr i e without biofilm and expectedly increases were observed for most corresponding monoester metabolites except for mep whose concentrations were relatively stable in the reactors the transformation of the parent phthalates to their specific metabolites in the sewer might be the reason for the increases of the metabolites the fast degradation of the parent phthalates was consistent with the findings of other studies where the removal efficiencies of phthalates were 90 in both real wwtps roslev et al 2007 and laboratory scale wastewater treatment reactors ahmadi et al 2015 the apparent transformation rates from phthalates to their metabolites in the sewers ranged from 0 mep to 7 mehp it should be noted that the apparent transformation rate is a combined effect from the transformation degradation of the parent phthalates and the transformation degradation of their metabolites in the sewers for instance the concentration of dep dropped from 130 ng ml to 52 ng ml but the concentration of mep the most unstable metabolites did not increase in the sewer because mep was possibly further transformed into other chemicals the fact that the level of phthalates decreased quickly and similarly in all reactors indicated that hydrolysis of phthalates can occur easily even without the catalysis of sewer biofilms in contrast to the case of many other chemicals e g cocaine or creatinine where degradation was facilitated by biofilm biota thai et al 2014a thai et al 2014b 4 2 effects of deconjugation process on concentrations of phthalate metabolites the results of our deconjugation experiment showed that concentrations of mbp mibp and mehp were very stable over time probably due to the combination of deconjugation and degradation of these monoesters in the wastewater on the other hand mcpp mehhp mecpp meohp and mbzp concentrations increased in the first 2 8 hours of incubation and were stable afterwards these results indicated a possible effect of deconjugation as glucuronide chemicals were hydrolysed to release free monoester phthalates with β glucuronidase silva et al 2003 the concentration of mep and mmp decreased significantly during the first 2 hours and were relatively stable afterwards this was possibly caused by the instability of those phthalate metabolites as mep and mmp were the most unstable phthalate metabolites with their concentrations dropped 35 and 23 respectively compared to the initial concentrations after 48 hours at room temperature in wastewater samples gonzález mariño et al 2017 it is important to note that the mixture of urine and wastewater was prepared freshly and was only stirred for approximately 10 min before β glucuronidase treatment in the real wastewater samples glucuronide conjugated chemicals had been in contact with microorganisms with glucuronidase enzymes e g faecal bacteria d ascenzo et al 2003 and been hydrolysed completely by those enzymes before they reached the inlet of the wwtps i e after 4 hours in fig 1 in short enzymatic treatment is not required for the analysis of phthalate metabolites in wastewater samples in addition we observed the decreases in concentration of several phthalate metabolites after the β glucuronidase treatment including mibp mehhp mecpp mehp mep and mmp one explanation is the likely degradation during the incubation as β glucuronidase treated samples were kept at 37 c for 1 5 hours while non enzyme treated samples were extracted immediately in this study we observed the greatest reductions for mep and mmp which were possibly due to their greater degradation at 37 c in agreement with a previous laboratory test gonzález mariño et al 2017 the other phthalate metabolites were fairly stable at room temperature gonzález mariño et al 2017 and the differences in their concentrations after enzymatic treatment were all in the range of 15 indicating the β glucuronidase treatment did not significantly affect the concentrations of these phthalate metabolites in the wastewater samples our results hence suggest that β glucuronidase treatment is not necessary for the analysis of total phthalate metabolites in wastewater 4 3 implications for the wbe applications wbe can provide useful information on human exposure to chemicals if the biomarkers unique to human excretion are available gracia lor et al 2017 our study has provided evidence that phthalate metabolites in wastewater may not be unique to human excretion but may also originate from the transformation degradation of the parent phthalates present in wastewater during sewer transport eventually human exposure to phthalates would be overestimated by wbe we observed the formation increase of most phthalate metabolites in the sewers but at the same time they can undergo degradation process in the sewer system and or wastewater especially for mmp and mep the degradation of mmp and mep would be compensated for by their formations in the wastewater by the transformation from their parent chemicals dmp and dep considered of the high concentrations of dmp and dep more than 10 times higher than mmp and mep leading to relatively stable concentrations in the sewers in the real wastewater samples the levels of dmp and dep 1 9 7 7 ng ml were generally higher than the levels of their metabolites 0 1 2 3 ng ml though they were not studied simultaneously du et al 2018 gao and wen 2016 gonzález mariño et al 2020a gonzález mariño et al 2017 tang et al 2020 indicating that the transformation from phthalates could be an important source of the phthalate monoesters in the wastewaters it needed to be noted that the degradation process had led to wide variations on the concentrations of mmp and mep in the sewers and the conditions of the sewers i e enzymes temperature ph etc would also have impacts on their degradation in summary concentrations of phthalate metabolites in the influent wastewater are now known to be affected by the contribution from human excretion of phthalate metabolites calafat and mckee 2006 the formation in sewers from parent phthalates and their in sewer degradation this combined effect will lead to high uncertainty and consequently uncertain estimation of human exposure to phthalates using the wbe approach the formation of phthalate metabolites during sewer transport observed in this study could help explain the differences between the levels found in urine and wastewater samples reported by tang et al 2020 and gonzález mariño et al 2017 in the newest wbe study on phthalate exposure gonzález mariño et al 2020a have excluded mmp as a biomarker for the exposure of dmp due to the suspicion that there was contribution from other sources than human urine our findings supported this exclusion and also suggested that the use of other phthalate metabolites as biomarkers of phthalate exposures should be carefully evaluated it is critical because parent phthalates and their monoester metabolites can transform degrade in any sewer condition even in wastewater only as observed in this study 4 4 limitations the experiment was conducted in sewers using laboratory scale sewer reactors because of the co existence of parent phthalates and monoester phthalates in the wastewater the degradation of the parents and the formation of the metabolites from parents were happening at the same time in this study we could not differentiate those processes and could not investigate the transformation of each phthalate in sewers with the absence of its metabolites and vice versa we used semi quantification method for the analysis of phthalate diesters parent phthalates in wastewater samples where carbon labelled phthalate metabolites were used as surrogate standards considering the consistently high recoveries of carbon labelled phthalate metabolites 76 115 as well as the relative concentrations used for the transformation of the phthalate diesters this semi quantification method used in this study has limited effects on our results and conclusions 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the stability of common parent phthalates and their metabolites in wastewater under different sewer conditions our results indicated that most phthalate metabolites in wastewater samples are in the free forms not the conjugated forms on the other hand the deconjugation process that was conducted at 37 c will accelerate the degradation of phthalate metabolites thus enzymatic treatment is not necessary for the analysis of total phthalate metabolites in wastewater most importantly our experiments demonstrated significant decreases in concentrations of parent phthalates in the sewers accompanied by increases in concentrations of most phthalate metabolites including mibp mnbp mbzp mehhp mehp and meohp the concentrations of mep and mmp were relatively stable due to the combined effect of their degradation and the transformation from their parent chemicals dmp and dep in the sewers these findings suggested that phthalate metabolites in sewage could be strongly influenced by the in sewer transformation of the parent phthalates and the stability of the metabolites and thus could not be assumed as the unique biomarkers of human exposure to the parent phthalates in the population by the wbe approach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17295,there is an increasing demand to monitor the human exposure to phthalates and a few studies have used phthalate metabolites in wastewater to estimate exposure to these chemicals in the population however it is suspected that the stability of phthalates and phthalate metabolites during sewer transport can influence the final estimates in this study we used laboratory sewer reactors to evaluate the in sewer transformation of phthalates and their metabolites and deconjugation of phthalate metabolites we found concentrations of parent phthalates decreased quickly over time while the concentrations of phthalate metabolites increased significantly for most compounds indicating that parent phthalate compounds are partly transformed into their metabolites in the sewer our assessment of the deconjugation of glucuronide conjugated phthalate metabolites found that this process did not significantly affect the concentrations of phthalate metabolites in the wastewater with the relative difference ranging from 16 to 7 between enzymatically treated samples and control group additionally our results showed that phthalate metabolites could be subject to rapid degradation

have been demonstrated by the preliminary experiments of gonzález mariño et al 2017 thus the sources of phthalate monoesters in the wastewater include both the urinary excretion as monoester and the transformation from phthalate diester in the wastewater consequently the human exposure to phthalate could be overestimated using wbe measuring phthalate monoesters while there are some wastewater treatment studies looking into the degradation of phthalates in wastewater there is no study that investigates the degradation of parent phthalates in the sewer system which could generate phthalate monoesters and contribute to the total level of phthalate monoesters in the sewers additionally the phthalate metabolites excreted in urine partly in the form of glucuronide conjugated monoesters silva et al 2003 could be deconjugated during sewer transport gao et al 2017 gao et al 2018 due to the presence of microbial enzymes i e arylsulfatase and β glucuronidase vergine et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 therefore it is of interest to determine the extent of deconjugation of phthalate metabolites in the sewer conditions to assess their impact of deconjugation on the concentrations of free phthalate monoesters and therefore on the applicability of wbe on the estimation of human exposure to phthalates to date studies on potential transformation among phthalates phthalate monoester metabolites and conjugated monoesters as well as deconjugation process under sewer condition are lacking which hinders the full interpretation of phthalates phthalate metabolites data in wbe studies the aims of this study hence were to investigate 1 the fate of phthalates and their metabolites in the sewers using laboratory scale sewer reactors 2 the extent of deconjugation of the phthalate monoesters in wastewater samples and 3 evaluate the effects of the transformation between phthalates and their metabolites as well as the deconjugation on the level of phthalate metabolites in the sewer understanding the contribution of different sources to the eventual concentrations of phthalates metabolites in wastewater will help determine whether they can be used as biomarkers to estimate population exposure to phthalates by wbe approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents native and isotope labelled standards were purchased from cambridge isotope laboratories inc

their metabolites in realistic sewer conditions we utilised laboratory scale sewer reactors that have been shown to mimic typical sewer conditions in previous studies choi et al 2020 thai et al 2014b these consisted of a rising main reactor rmr a gravity sewer reactor gsr a sediment reactor sr and a control reactor cr rmr gsr and cr were made of perspextm with a volume of 0 75 l 149 mm id 80 mm biofilm carriers with diameter of 1 cm were clustered on four stainless steel rods inside the reactor to provide additional surfaces for biofilm growth figure s1a rmr was operated under anaerobic condition gs was only partially filled with real wastewater allowing a gas phase cr was used during the batch tests only containing the bulk wastewater without the growth of biofilm in addition rmr and gsr had been cultivated with sewer biofilm using domestic wastewater several months before the experiment rmr and gsr were fed with freshly collected sewage through a peristaltic pump masterflex 7520 47 every 6 hours delivering one reactor volume 0 75 l of sewage into each reactor to ensure homogeneous distribution in reactors gentle mixing was provided with magnetic stirrers at 250 rpm heidolph mr3000 the total volume of sr was 3 2 l 210 mm id 140 mm figure s1b and there was a sediment part at the bottom and the reactor received continuous feeding with 40 rpm mixing speed under the routine operational mode wastewater effluent flowed through outlet 1 to the drain leaving 0 5 l of gas volume in the headspace more details about the reactors can be found in the supporting information text 1 2 3 batch tests for the transformation of phthalate metabolites in sewer reactors batch tests in triplicate were conducted to investigate the degradation of the biomarkers under different sewer conditions created by different sewer reactors before each batch test newly collected wastewater was warmed to room temperature and then spiked with a freshly collected within 1 hour prior to the spike pool of human urine 10 v v to increase the detection frequencies of phthalate metabolites with limited sample volume 8 ml the volume of urine spike was calculated to ensure the ph and ammonia concentration were within the tolerable range for the biota of the sewer biofilm and based on previous data on the level of phthalate metabolites in urine and wastewater in southeast queensland tang et al 2020 the scod and volatile fatty acid vfa in the urine spiked sewage was 832 3 mg l and 82 6 mgcod l respectively the reactors were drained prior to the feeding of urine spiked wastewater after rapid mixing an initial sample was collected t 0 from each reactor the urine spiked wastewater was then fed to each reactor and the initial samples were collected t 0 wastewater samples were subsequently taken at different time intervals i e 0 5 1 2 3 5 7 and 9 hours after the spiking after collection samples were filtered and frozen immediately at 20 c until analysis biological activities in rmr gsr and sr were monitored via measuring the dissolved sulfur species and methane see supporting information text 2 2 4 testing the potential deconjugation of glucuronide monoester phthalate in wastewater phthalate glucuronide metabolites were potentially present in the wastewater samples after the spike of fresh urine silva et al 2003 therefore to assess the impact of their deconjugation to the total concentration of phthalate metabolite in wastewater samples we incubated a mixture of wastewater and fresh urine 10 v v and sampled at different time intervals after stirring for 30 min samples were spiked with 100 µl of β glucuronidase 140 units mg and transferred into a temperature controlled room at 37 c six ml was taken from each sample immediately and considered as the initial sample t 0 additional samples 6 ml were subsequently taken at 0 5 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 h intervals samples were filtered and extracted immediately after they were removed from the temperature control room the initial concentration of each analyte t 0 was set as 100 and the impact of deconjugation was observed by the relative change of total free phthalate metabolites over time 2 5 analysis of phthalates and their metabolites in wastewater method of extraction for phthalates in wastewater samples was adopted from gonzalez marino et al 2017 in general approximately 8 ml of acidified sample ph 2 0 was filtered through φ47 mm glass microfiber filters and nitrocelluose membrane filters the filtered sample 3 ml was spiked with 40 μl internal standards 25 250 μg l next they were solid phase extracted spe on supelco select hlb cartridges previously rinsed with 5 ml of meoh and 5 ml of mq water at ph 2 0 for the comparison of β glucuronidase treatment 5 ml of the filtered samples were spiked with 40 μl internal standards and 25 µl β glucuronidase solution 10 in 1 m ammonium acetate sorbents were dried under nitrogen for 30 min and analytes eluted with 5 ml of meoh eluates were concentrated down to near dryness under nitrogen 99 999 and diluted to a final volume of 0 5 ml meoh for their liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms analysis treatment of samples from the deconjugation experiment was similar to the procedure mentioned above after the incubation with β glucuronidase at 37 c for a given time samples were spiked with internal standards and extracted immediately with hlb cartridges the extracts were then concentrated and analysed by lc ms ms 2 6 instrumental analysis liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms was performed using a shimadzu nexera ii uhplc system shimadzu corp kyoto japan coupled to a sciex 6500 qtrap with an electrospray ionisation source operating in scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode for phthalates the separation was achieved using a 2 6 micron 50 2 0 mm phenomenex kinetek biphenyl column phenomenex torrance ca operated at 45 c the flow conditions were set as follows flow rate of 0 32 ml min with a linear gradient starting at 45 b for 0 5 minutes ramped to 98 b in 6 5 minutes with a slope setting of 1 held at 98 for 3 minutes followed by equilibration at 45 b for 4 5 minutes a 1 methanol in hplc grade water b 95 methanol both containing 0 1 acetic acid a 50 4 6 mm 5 micron evo c18 column phenomenex torrance ca was inserted between the pumps and autosampler to trap mobile phase contaminants the mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion multiple reaction monitoring mode using nitrogen as the collision gas with a dwell time of 18 milliseconds per mrm giving a scan time of 0 6 seconds at least two identification ions were selected from the precursor ions of each of the analytes and optimised for signal intensity in the tandem spectrometry these identification ions were used in the mrm mode for high specificity and sensitivity the product ion with higher signal intensity was selected for the quantitative analysis for each of the ten phthalates the ion spray voltage was 5 kv apparatus settings for detection are listed in table s2 for the monoester metabolites a kinetex f5 column was used for chromatographic separation mobile phases were a 1 meoh 99 milli q water 0 1 acetic acid b 95 meoh 5 milli q water 0 1 acetic acid the flow conditions were set as follows flow rate of 0 3 ml min with a linear gradient starting at 5 b ramped to 100 b in 14 5 min then held at 100 for 2 5 minutes followed by equilibration at 5 b for 4 min more details on the mrm information can be found in a previous publication heffernan et al 2016 2 7 quality analysis quality control procedural blanks n 3 were prepared with milli q water and were extracted together with all the wastewater samples in each batch spiked qc samples were prepared by spiking analytes into milliq water at a low level 5 ppb and high level 20 ppb and analysed in each batch the recoveries for all internal standards ranged from 76 to 115 blank subtractions were conducted for analytes that were detected in procedural blanks limits of quantification loqs were determined as the mean concentrations of procedural blanks plus ten times their standard deviation for analytes not detected in blanks loqs were defined as the lowest concentration that produced a peak signal ten times higher than the background noise from the chromatograms 2 8 data processing statistical analysis was carried out using spss 24 0 chicago usa software package for windows data were log10 transformed prior to statistical analysis and the distribution was approximately normal after the transformation bivariate correlations pearson correlation coefficients were used to investigate the correlations between chemicals in samples with and without β glucuronidase treatment significance was set at p 0 05 concentrations of analytes lower than loq were assumed to be loq 2 for statistical analysis the concentrations of phthalate metabolites measured during different collection time were normalised to the percentage relative to the initial concentrations that measured at t 0 the apparent transformation rate r from phthalates to their specific metabolites were calculated as equation 1 1 r δ c m m w p δ c p m w m 100 where cp is the decrease of phthalate concentration ng ml between samples collected at t 0 and t 9 h cm is the increase of phthalate metabolite concentration ng ml between samples collected at t 0 and t 9 h and mwp and mwm are the molecular weights of phthalates and their phthalate respectively 3 results 3 1 bioactivity in the sewers biological activity tests indicated strong activities in sewer reactors with biofilm or sediment system the strongest activities of sulfate reducing bacteria occurred as indicated by the sulfide production rates in rmr 6 1 mgs l h and sr 6 1 mgs l h in comparison the sulfide production rate in gsr was 1 4 mgs l h likely as a result of the presence of oxygen leading to sulfide oxidation as reported earlier thai et al 2014a and the possible transfer of h2s from wastewater to air the highest methane production appeared in rmr 25 6 mgcod l h due to gas liquid transfer and or the exposure to oxygen lower methane production rates were less measured for gsr 2 6 mgcod l h and sr 2 5 mgcod l h no activities were detected in the cr due to the lack of biofilm which is consistent with previous experiments thai et al 2014b 3 2 transformation of phthalate and their metabolites in sewer reactors in the samples collected from the laboratory scale sewer reactors six phthalates and eight corresponding monoester metabolites were frequently detected 50 no significant correlations were observed between the concentrations of phthalates and gas generated in the reactors possibly due to the quick hydrolysis of phthalates in wastewater the average concentrations of the phthalates and their metabolites measured in the reactors at different time intervals are shown in table 1 in addition transformation profile of individual parent and their corresponding metabolites defined as the percentage relative to the initial concentrations that measured at t 0 are presented in the following sections 3 2 1 dep and dmp and their metabolites mep and mmp the average concentrations of dep across all the reactors decreased by 66 after 9 hours from 130 58 ng ml t 0 h to 52 14 ng ml t 9 h while the concentrations of its metabolites mep were relatively stable with the average concentration from 4 4 0 59 ng ml t 0 h to 4 2 0 88 ng ml t 9 h table 1 and fig 1 similarly the concentrations of dmp decreased by 51 from 130 53 ng ml to 42 14 ng ml and the concentrations of mmp the major metabolite of dmp increased in most reactors from 0 82 0 24 ng ml to 1 3 0 92 ng ml noting that both phthalates and their metabolites at the initial time t 0 might be from the spiked urine and the fed wastewater but the concentrations of phthalates and their metabolites in the spiked urine were not analysed 3 2 2 dnbp dibp bbzp and their metabolites mbp mibp and mbzp similar to the scenario described above concentrations of the parent phthalates dnbp dibp and bbzp decreased relatively quickly in all the reactors fig 2 in contrast to concentrations of their parent compounds concentrations of monoester phthalates i e mbp mibp and mbzp increased during the 9 hour experiment indicating that some portion of the parent compounds were partially hydrolysed to the monoester metabolites in terms of the absolute concentrations average concentrations of dnbp dibp and bbzp decreased from 170 ng ml to 33 ng ml from 130 ng ml to 67 ng ml and from 170 ng ml to 71 ng ml respectively after 9 hours while the average concentrations of their specific metabolites increased from 1 2 ng ml to 1 9 ng ml mbp from 2 6 ng ml to 4 6 ng ml mibp and from 0 11 ng ml to 0 17 ng ml mbzp respectively the estimated apparent transformation rates from parent to monoester metabolite were 0 6 4 and 0 07 for dbp dibp and bbzp respectively 3 2 3 dehp and its metabolites the concentration of dehp decreased in all the sewer reactors with an average decrease from 100 to 44 fig 3 the three metabolites of dehp i e mehhp meohp and mehp were frequently detected with their concentrations increased in all reactors the average concentrations of dehp decreased from 170 ng ml t 0 to 80 ng ml t 9 h across all the different sewer reactors meanwhile after 9 hours the concentrations of its metabolites i e mehhp meohp and mehp increased by 0 46 0 20 and 4 2 ng ml in the sewers respectively resulting in apparent transformation rates of 0 7 0 3 and 7 respectively 3 3 phthalate metabolites in samples with and without treatment of β glucuronidase the samples obtained from the sewer reactors were split into two aliquots where one was incubated with β glucuronidase prior to the extraction and the other one was extracted directly without enzymatic treatment to test the level of glucuronidation of those metabolites in the samples silva et al 2003 among the total of 14 phthalate metabolites analysed eight were frequently 50 detected they are the same as the phthalate metabolites presented above indicating the dominance of those phthalates in wastewater mep was the predominant analyte with median concentrations of 4 2 and 3 2 ng ml in samples with and without enzymatic treatment respectively this result was consistent with that found in urine and wastewater samples collected from southeast queensland where mep had the highest concentrations in both pooled urine 130 ng ml and wastewater 1 9 ng ml tang et al 2020 the calculated differences in the measured concentrations of eight phthalate metabolites between samples with and without enzymatic treatment are shown in fig 4 the calculated differences between concentrations of analytes measured in samples with and without enzymatic treatment by means ranged from 16 to 7 negative differences mean that concentrations of mibp mehhp mecpp mehp mep and mmp were lower in samples with enzymatic treatment than without treatment the differences between concentrations of analytes in enzyme treated and non treated samples were small and mostly within the range of analytical variability an explanation for these small differences is that due to the lower level of glucuronidation the enzyme treatment had no impact on increasing the concentrations of free monoester metabolites while the treatment itself 30 min at warm temperature could lead to the hydrolysis of the metabolites hence their lower concentrations than the non treatment samples 3 4 deconjugation experiments to further investigate the level of glucuronidation of phthalate metabolites we conducted a separate experiment by incubating the mixture of fresh urine samples and wastewater with enzyme and sampled at different time intervals fig 5 a previous study found that β glucuronidase is the best candidate for the deconjugation of phthalate metabolites i e converting phthalate monoester conjugate to free phthalate monoester other groups of enzymes for example sulfatase helix pomatia h 1 are capable of converting parent phthalate diesters to phthalate monoesters therefore to minimise the contribution from potential phthalate diester contaminants we used β glucuronidase that is glucuronidase only no sulfatase in this study concentrations of mbp mibp and mehp were very stable over the incubation time suggesting a low level of glucuronidation on the other hand mcpp mehhp mecpp meohp and mbzp concentrations increased in the first 2 8 hours of incubation and were stable after that these suggest a possible effect of deconjugation as the de conjugated chemicals were transformed into free chemicals with β glucuronidase by contrast the concentration of mep and mmp decreased after the enzymatic treatment and were relatively stable after 2 hours this was consistent with the stability of phthalate metabolites in wastewaters gonzález mariño et al 2017 4 discussion 4 1 in sewer stability of phthalates and their metabolites we observed rapid decreases in concentrations of all the target parent phthalates in all sewer reactors including the cr i e without biofilm and expectedly increases were observed for most corresponding monoester metabolites except for mep whose concentrations were relatively stable in the reactors the transformation of the parent phthalates to their specific metabolites in the sewer might be the reason for the increases of the metabolites the fast degradation of the parent phthalates was consistent with the findings of other studies where the removal efficiencies of phthalates were 90 in both real wwtps roslev et al 2007 and laboratory scale wastewater treatment reactors ahmadi et al 2015 the apparent transformation rates from phthalates to their metabolites in the sewers ranged from 0 mep to 7 mehp it should be noted that the apparent transformation rate is a combined effect from the transformation degradation of the parent phthalates and the transformation degradation of their metabolites in the sewers for instance the concentration of dep dropped from 130 ng ml to 52 ng ml but the concentration of mep the most unstable metabolites did not increase in the sewer because mep was possibly further transformed into other chemicals the fact that the level of phthalates decreased quickly and similarly in all reactors indicated that hydrolysis of phthalates can occur easily even without the catalysis of sewer biofilms in contrast to the case of many other chemicals e g cocaine or creatinine where degradation was facilitated by biofilm biota thai et al 2014a thai et al 2014b 4 2 effects of deconjugation process on concentrations of phthalate metabolites the results of our deconjugation experiment showed that concentrations of mbp mibp and mehp were very stable over time probably due to the combination of deconjugation and degradation of these monoesters in the wastewater on the other hand mcpp mehhp mecpp meohp and mbzp concentrations increased in the first 2 8 hours of incubation and were stable afterwards these results indicated a possible effect of deconjugation as glucuronide chemicals were hydrolysed to release free monoester phthalates with β glucuronidase silva et al 2003 the concentration of mep and mmp decreased significantly during the first 2 hours and were relatively stable afterwards this was possibly caused by the instability of those phthalate metabolites as mep and mmp were the most unstable phthalate metabolites with their concentrations dropped 35 and 23 respectively compared to the initial concentrations after 48 hours at room temperature in wastewater samples gonzález mariño et al 2017 it is important to note that the mixture of urine and wastewater was prepared freshly and was only stirred for approximately 10 min before β glucuronidase treatment in the real wastewater samples glucuronide conjugated chemicals had been in contact with microorganisms with glucuronidase enzymes e g faecal bacteria d ascenzo et al 2003 and been hydrolysed completely by those enzymes before they reached the inlet of the wwtps i e after 4 hours in fig 1 in short enzymatic treatment is not required for the analysis of phthalate metabolites in wastewater samples in addition we observed the decreases in concentration of several phthalate metabolites after the β glucuronidase treatment including mibp mehhp mecpp mehp mep and mmp one explanation is the likely degradation during the incubation as β glucuronidase treated samples were kept at 37 c for 1 5 hours while non enzyme treated samples were extracted immediately in this study we observed the greatest reductions for mep and mmp which were possibly due to their greater degradation at 37 c in agreement with a previous laboratory test gonzález mariño et al 2017 the other phthalate metabolites were fairly stable at room temperature gonzález mariño et al 2017 and the differences in their concentrations after enzymatic treatment were all in the range of 15 indicating the β glucuronidase treatment did not significantly affect the concentrations of these phthalate metabolites in the wastewater samples our results hence suggest that β glucuronidase treatment is not necessary for the analysis of total phthalate metabolites in wastewater 4 3 implications for the wbe applications wbe can provide useful information on human exposure to chemicals if the biomarkers unique to human excretion are available gracia lor et al 2017 our study has provided evidence that phthalate metabolites in wastewater may not be unique to human excretion but may also originate from the transformation degradation of the parent phthalates present in wastewater during sewer transport eventually human exposure to phthalates would be overestimated by wbe we observed the formation increase of most phthalate metabolites in the sewers but at the same time they can undergo degradation process in the sewer system and or wastewater especially for mmp and mep the degradation of mmp and mep would be compensated for by their formations in the wastewater by the transformation from their parent chemicals dmp and dep considered of the high concentrations of dmp and dep more than 10 times higher than mmp and mep leading to relatively stable concentrations in the sewers in the real wastewater samples the levels of dmp and dep 1 9 7 7 ng ml were generally higher than the levels of their metabolites 0 1 2 3 ng ml though they were not studied simultaneously du et al 2018 gao and wen 2016 gonzález mariño et al 2020a gonzález mariño et al 2017 tang et al 2020 indicating that the transformation from phthalates could be an important source of the phthalate monoesters in the wastewaters it needed to be noted that the degradation process had led to wide variations on the concentrations of mmp and mep in the sewers and the conditions of the sewers i e enzymes temperature ph etc would also have impacts on their degradation in summary concentrations of phthalate metabolites in the influent wastewater are now known to be affected by the contribution from human excretion of phthalate metabolites calafat and mckee 2006 the formation in sewers from parent phthalates and their in sewer degradation this combined effect will lead to high uncertainty and consequently uncertain estimation of human exposure to phthalates using the wbe approach the formation of phthalate metabolites during sewer transport observed in this study could help explain the differences between the levels found in urine and wastewater samples reported by tang et al 2020 and gonzález mariño et al 2017 in the newest wbe study on phthalate exposure gonzález mariño et al 2020a have excluded mmp as a biomarker for the exposure of dmp due to the suspicion that there was contribution from other sources than human urine our findings supported this exclusion and also suggested that the use of other phthalate metabolites as biomarkers of phthalate exposures should be carefully evaluated it is critical because parent phthalates and their monoester metabolites can transform degrade in any sewer condition even in wastewater only as observed in this study 4 4 limitations the experiment was conducted in sewers using laboratory scale sewer reactors because of the co existence of parent phthalates and monoester phthalates in the wastewater the degradation of the parents and the formation of the metabolites from parents were happening at the same time in this study we could not differentiate those processes and could not investigate the transformation of each phthalate in sewers with the absence of its metabolites and vice versa we used semi quantification method for the analysis of phthalate diesters parent phthalates in wastewater samples where carbon labelled phthalate metabolites were used as surrogate standards considering the consistently high recoveries of carbon labelled phthalate metabolites 76 115 as well as the relative concentrations used for the transformation of the phthalate diesters this semi quantification method used in this study has limited effects on our results and conclusions 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the stability of common parent phthalates and their metabolites in wastewater under different sewer conditions our results indicated that most phthalate metabolites in wastewater samples are in the free forms not the conjugated forms on the other hand the deconjugation process that was conducted at 37 c will accelerate the degradation of phthalate metabolites thus enzymatic treatment is not necessary for the analysis of total phthalate metabolites in wastewater most importantly our experiments demonstrated significant decreases in concentrations of parent phthalates in the sewers accompanied by increases in concentrations of most phthalate metabolites including mibp mnbp mbzp mehhp mehp and meohp the concentrations of mep and mmp were relatively stable due to the combined effect of their degradation and the transformation from their parent chemicals dmp and dep in the sewers these findings suggested that phthalate metabolites in sewage could be strongly influenced by the in sewer transformation of the parent phthalates and the stability of the metabolites and thus could not be assumed as the unique biomarkers of human exposure to the parent phthalates in the population by the wbe approach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17296,synthetic water soluble polymeric materials are widely employed in e g cleaning detergents personal care products paints or textiles accordingly these compounds reach sewage treatment plants and may enter receiving waters and the aquatic environment characteristically these molecules show a polydisperse molecular weight distribution comprising multiple repeating units i e a homologous series hs their analysis in environmentally relevant samples has received some attention over the last two decades however the majority of previous studies focused on surfactants and a molecular weight range 1000 da to capture a wider range on the mass versus polarity plane and extend towards less polar contaminants a workflow was established using three different ionization strategies namely conventional electrospray ionization atmospheric pressure photoionization and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization the data evaluation consisted of suspect screening of ca 1200 suspect entries and a non target screening of hs with pre defined accurate mass differences using ca 400 molecular formulas of repeating units of hs as input and repeating retention time shifts as hs indicator to study the fate of these water soluble polymeric substances in the wastewater treatment process the different stages i e after primary and secondary clarifier and after ozonation followed by sand filtration were sampled at a swiss wastewater treatment plant remaining with two different ionization interfaces esi and appi in both polarities a non targeted screening approach led to a total number of 146 hs each with a minimum number of 4 members with a molecular mass of up to 1200 detected in the final effluent of the 146 hs ca 15 could be associated with suspect hits and approximately 25 with transformation products of suspects tentative characterization or probable chemical structure could be assigned to almost half of the findings in positive ionization mode various sugar derivatives with differing side chains for negative mode structures with sulfonic acids could be characterized the number of detected hs decreased significantly over the three treatment stages for hs detectable also in the biological and oxidative treatment stages a change in hs distribution towards to lower mass range was often observed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polymeric substances wastewater non targeted analysis homologous series characterization 1 introduction recently the analysis of polymers has been in the limelight of environmental research however the focus is often on their solid state namely in terms of micro and nanoplastics often neglecting thereby the pressing topic of water soluble polymeric substances arp and knutsen 2020 the use of synthetic water soluble polymeric substances in textile industry paints coatings as well as consumer products such as cleaning detergents personal care products as well as pharmaceuticals is widespread the functionality of these diverse substances ranges from e g lowering the surface tension as it is the case for surfactants to serving as filling substance in pharmaceuticals or to be applied as dispersing agent in pesticides consequently their prevalent application is also reflected in the production volumes of educts employed in polymer syntheses reaching up to millions of tons per year notably information on synthetic polymers is hardly available since only their educts are registered under reach european chemicals agency 2017 accordingly these substances reach municipal wastewater and depending on the elimination during wastewater treatment may enter receiving waters and the aquatic environment by definition polymeric substances comprise multiple repetition of units typically derived from molecules of low relative molecular mass mcnaught and wilkinson 1997 due to the way of synthesis polymerization reactions are rarely complete and hence these molecules characteristically show a polydisperse molecular weight distribution comprising a multiplicity of repeating units ru i e a homologous series hs the term polymeric essentially describes either part or the whole molecule that consists of these multiple repetitions of these low molecular mass parts mcnaught and wilkinson 1997 as a matter of fact synthetic polymeric substances show high complexity in their chemical structure crotty et al 2016 one polymeric substance can comprise different numbers and types of chains of ru hence there are potentially many constitutional isomers present for one molecular formula of a hs member here fragmentation spectra acquired by ms ms instrumentation can aid in identifying the structure however the degree of freedom especially in branched chained polymeric substance is particularly high and therefore the exact chemical structure is often hardly accessible lara martin et al 2011 schymanski et al 2014b typically in order to understand the fate of anthropogenic contaminants in aquatic environments high performance liquid chromatography hplc coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry hrms is employed this front end separation is essential when dealing with low concentration in complex matrices zwiener and frimmel 2004 as a pre requisite of ms detection compounds of interest need to be present in their ionized form the most commonly applied ionization interface is electrospray ionization esi here medium polar to polar molecules in a vast molecular weight range can be ionized however if the analytes of interest are potentially extending to a low polarity range different ionization interfaces such as atmospheric pressure chemical ionization apci or atmospheric pressure photoionization appi have been used as alternatives reemtsma 2001 chiaia hernandez et al 2013 the latter two ionization sources are typically limited in terms of molecular weight to roughly 2000 3000 da since above either in source fragmentation is drastically increasing or ion formation is not effective gruendling et al 2010 terrier et al 2011 employing these ionization interfaces for the analysis of polymeric substance was discussed in detail by e g terrier et al 2011 andrea and alessandro 2003 reemtsma 2001 notably analytical methods focusing on pure polymer standards wesdemiotis 2017 are not fully transferable to the analysis of these substances in environmental samples that are characterized by low concentrations and very complex matrices as for data evaluation unknown hs can be detected using different approaches e g most prominently kendrick mass defect plots kendrick 1963 fouquet 2019 or van krevelen diagrams kim et al 2003 notably here either generating unique molecular formula for the compounds of interest is required or they are restricted to a small pre defined set of rus more importantly front end separation is not considered in the approaches mentioned above the recently published envihomolog algorithm loos and singer 2017 however does include this orthogonal information on chromatographic behavior moreover envihomolog does allow both to screen for any unknown repetitive m z differences between picked peaks as well as using pre defined molecular formulas as ru input however the envihomolog algorithm has so far not been combined with other non targeted componentization steps in lc ms signal processing namely any homologous analyte may form several hs over its different ion species and isotopologues which would remain redundant for later data interpretation but are also highly indicative for any grouping procedure similarly envihomolog does so far neither account for gapped series nor the combinatorial problems associated with close eluting and isobaric structural isomers of homologous analytes notably the term isobaric refers typically to ions of the same nominal masses in this very context the authors extended this term also to masses of the same accurate mass over the last decades numerous studies have investigated surfactants in the aquatic environment and have shown that modern surface active compounds are extensively removed but also transformed during the wastewater treatment stages brunner et al 1988 schröder et al 1999 lara martin et al 2011 faria et al 2019 here prominent examples of surfactants are alcohol ethoxylates aeo linear alkylbenzene sulfonates las and nonylphenol ethoxylates npeo in aqueous as well as solid environmental matrices these surfactants readily degrade and lead to the following well known degradation products sulfophenyl carboxylic acids spc nonylphenol ethoxy carboxylates npec and polyethylene glycols peg lara martin et al 2011 cowan ellsberry compiled comprehensively most relevant environmental data regarding surfactants over the last decades including risk assessment cowan ellsberry et al 2014 recently risk assessment of surfactants was debated by freeling et al 2019 dyer et al 2020 in a recent review of hupperstberg et al the authors argued that if environmental concentrations of water soluble polymeric substances reach a sufficiently high enough level these contaminants can act the same way as in their initial field of application e g enhancing solubility of non polar substances huppertsberg et al 2020 additonally as lately pointed out by arp and knutsen there is a lack in understanding the environmental behavior of water soluble polymers also in terms of mobility as well as persistence arp and knutsen 2020 qualitative and quantitative information on water soluble polymeric synthetic substances is still rather scarce and the vast majority of previous studies focused on surfactants and a molecular weight range 1000 da huppertsberg et al 2020 the aim of the present work was to investigate what lays outside of the known range of surfactants and potential transformation products to unravel hs in complex wastewater samples different ionization strategies were tested to expand the mass polarity plane towards the medium polar compounds in addition to comprehensive suspect screening a non targeted screening workflow with a homologue based componentization was established 2 materials and methods the complete data acquisition processing and mining optimized for the characterization of homologous series in wastewater is shown in fig 1 2 1 sampling and sample preparation polymeric substances were studied in flow proportional composite samples 24 h that were collected at different stages of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in switzerland namely after the primary clarifier grit sand and oil trap the secondary clarifier conventional activated sludge system with nitrification denitrification and a biological phosphorus elimination step and after ozonation followed by a sand filter as post treatment step one sample of each stage was collected by the plant operator in april 2019 filled into 0 5 l annealed glass bottles and immediately subjected to sample preparation to prevent sample alterations and contamination sample preparation was as limited as possible plastic material was avoided whenever possible and glass ware was either annealed or thoroughly cleaned using analytical grade methanol lc ms grade optima fisher scientific switzerland and nanopure water prior use two different strategies were pursued using either a simple centrifugation step to eliminate particles or pre concentration using vacuum assisted evaporation pre concentration factor of 10 for both sample preparation strategies five replicates were prepared alongside with the same number of replicates for blank samples to reduce changes of the prepared samples over time hplc hrms ms analysis was started as quickly as possible for quality control in terms of mass accuracy a composite sample spiked with a mixture of five isotopically labeled substances was prepared and analyzed every fifteenth injection table s1e additionally two peg standards with an average molecular weight of 600 and 2000 da sigma aldrich switzerland respectively were spiked to one aliquot of each sample type final concentration of 2 5 μg ml 1 spiking was performed on the centrifugated samples and each spiked sample was injected and analyzed three times 2 2 analysis via liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry for analysis reversed phase liquid chromatography rplc using a thermofisher scientific ultimate hplc equipped with a pal autosampler was coupled to a q exactive hrms thermofisher scientific san jose ca in data dependent acquisition mode topn n 5 mass resolution m z 200 ms1 140k and ms2 17 5k chromatographic separation was performed using a waters xbridge c18 column 2 1 50 mm 3 5 μm 130 å pore size equipped with a pre column waters xbridge beh c18 2 1 5 mm 3 5 μm ionization was realized by optimizing different interfaces namely esi apci and appi in terms of temperature gas flows and dopant addition to this end a sample collected after the wwtp s primary clarifier was employed to guarantee the presence of analytes of interest and to mimic an analytical worst case scenario in terms of matrix complexity due to their abundance over a wide molecular mass range and presence in the sample peg and polypropylene glycol ppg were applied as model hs in an m z range of up to 3000 data on optimization is shown in the si figure s1 s4 depending on the ionization source mobile phases for gradient elution were adjusted accordingly and are shown together with ion source and ms parameters in table s1a c in the si 2 3 data evaluation and data mining as depicted in fig 1 data was evaluated combining suspect screening and non target analysis workflow in envimass v4 2beta further data processing and mining steps were performed with dedicated r packages within rstudio r core team 2016 2 3 1 suspect screening to generate a suspect screening list different sources were combined further extended norman suspect list network et al 2020 garcía et al 2019 and known peg derivatives differing in end groups the suspect list that was used as an input in envimass can be found in the si table s4 in detail a primary clarifier sample was taken as basis for characterization here exact masses of the respective hs family were extracted and chromatographic parameters smooth rt change over the hs family s mass range and chromatographic peak shape were checked the term hs family is introduced here since some polymeric substances have different chains ru structural positions to grow from e g alcohol ethoxylates cnaeox and these are therefore summarized to one family ms2 spectra were checked for library matches and diagnostic fragment ions and losses suspect hits would be generally assigned to stage c or even d if they suffice the requirements shown in fig 1 and explained in detail in 2 3 3 to be reported a minimum number of four members per hs was necessary and suspects needed to be present in all technical replicates notably suspect matches are also indicated in the results of the envihomolog algorithm in envimass and were checked within this software accordingly 2 3 2 non target hs detection employed settings for peak picking blank peak subtraction and homologous series detection can be found in table s2 in the si since envimass allows rus as input parameter literature research was conducted on commercially available polymeric substances schymanski et al 2014b gago ferrero et al 2015 garcía et al 2019 and rus ellis and smith 2008 444 unique rus were compiled of which 400 had a mass of 400 da and were consequently used as input see table s3 in the si notably not all of them are to be expected in the wastewater samples envimass v4 2beta includes advances on the embedded non targeted hs extraction tool envihomolog loos and singer 2017 a more detailed description on the advances can be found in the supplementary information for non target hs detection results on components i e grouped picked peaks monoisotopic m z isotopologues and respective ion species hs as well as peaks within hs were exported from envimass and further processed with rstudio r core team 2016 hs containing components comprising only one ion single ion events for each member were excluded from further analysis focus was laid on the hs remaining after the secondary clarifier or after the ozonation and sand filtration step these were visually controlled by plotting extracted ion chromatograms eic using the r package msnbase gatto and lilley 2012 and checked manually and case wise for redundancies due to different adducts or charge states for that purpose and also to screen for transformation reaction products the r package tpprioritizr tpprioritizr n d was employed table s5 in the si shows the list of screened mass differences ms2 spectra and ms1 isotopologues were consequently extracted using the r package rmassbank stravs et al 2013 and written to ms file for characterization using sirius csi fingerid version 4 0 1 dührkop et al 2019 here for molecular formula annotation the following settings were used if the ion species was known the entry was set accordingly otherwise it was set to unknown m or m though prevalent ion species e g m na in case of appi were prioritized in the hit list of molecular formulas a 5 ppm mass accuracy window was set for in silico structure elucidation pubchem was used as input database if molecular formulas could be assigned but no hit in pubchem was found molecular formulas were searched within scifinder using the information on the ru as input 2 3 3 characterization of hs the last step of the workflow comprises the characterization of the hs due to the vast structural complexity of polymeric substances an unequivocal structural identification will be hard to achieve with merely rplc hrms ms gruendling et al 2010 crotty et al 2016 this holds especially true for branched chain polymeric substances then again there is the advantage of having multiple members that need to suffice specific requirements and thereby contributing to the confidence of identification hence the concept of communicating the level of confidence of identifications as suggested by schymanski et al schymanski et al 2014a was adapted to the characterization of hs here the authors define the lowest level a as a hs of interest analogue level 5 with a minimum of 4 hs members with a defined accurate m z difference within a 3 ppm window and a rt variability between adjacent members of 5 s it is also to be checked if the hs members are of the same ion species in the next step b for at least 2 members or 50 of the detected hs a molecular formula is assigned analogue level 4 as a next stage c ms2 fragment information is included for tentatively characterizing the hs analogue to level 3 here diagnostic fragment ions are indicative as described by e g thurman et al for pegs thurman et al 2017 in silico fragmentation prediction is applied here the final stage d includes also library matches analogue to level 2 and or reference standards analogue to level 1 3 results and discussion suspect screening and non target hs detection were performed in parallel see fig 1 since centrifugated samples resulted in a significantly lower number of hs detections e g for samples after ozonation 10 2 hs compared to 96 10 hs for pre concentrated samples in case of esi ionization approach focus was put on the pre concentrated samples table 1 gives a summary on the suspect matches and the number of non targeted hs detected via envimass and its algorithm envihomolog importantly for the latter findings the number of hs listed in table 1 correspond to hs findings after the implemented hs filter advancement and ensuring a minimum number of ions per hs members 3 1 method optimization and quality assurance the variation in detected hs depicted in table1 as well as in the following figures is referring to sample preparation replicates n 5 and can be explained by differences in signal intensity and consequently peak picking this holds especially true for signals of low intensity to generally gauge the repeatability of signal intensity variation in chromatographic peak height of peg was evaluated for the analytical worst case scenario the primary clarifier here an average rsd of the signal of the respective most abundant ion species of 12 19 and 12 for pre concentrated primary clarifier samples using apci appi and esi respectively was assessed data shown in si table s6 peg int repeatability besides also rt stability was assessed by means of peg 05eo up to peg 24eo excellent rt stability throughout the different sample matrices was observed for all ionization sources 2 only for appi variation up to around 5 was observed for the earlier eluting compounds i e 1 5 min most probably due to addition of isopropanol to the mobile phase as appi modifier data shown in si table s7 peg rtstability importantly the different sample types are characterized by their different matrix loads leading to effects on chromatographic separation and ionization that are compound dependent for target quantification considering this matrix effect is essential however in non targeted analysis and suspect screening where compound specific information is lacking such considerations become challenging since the aim of this work is focusing on the characterization and not the quantitation of polymeric substances no matrix factor was added and only inter sample type changes in intensities of above one orders of magnitude and a signal to blank factor 3 were considered as actual changes during the wastewater treatment process it is noteworthy that ru are depicted as m z and hence are dependent on the charge state of the respective hs e g c2h4o can be found as 44 02 for singly charged and 22 01 for doubly charged hs besides rus can be also described as multiple of each other e g ch2 and c2h4 units another factor contributing to the overall complexity of hs analysis is the redundancy arising from the dependence of molecular weight and ion species especially in esi one hs may change its members ionization behavior i e charge state over increasing mass the diminished overlap of co eluting peaks over these different hs makes their grouping difficult despite the additional hs filtering steps which were implemented here in order to reduce this complexity further filtering steps were implemented into envihomolog approach generally the chromatographic separation and difference in masses aid in indicating on what type of monomeric unit was employed for synthesizing the polymeric substance however the head groups are often significantly more difficult to be characterized especially if depletion or transformation reactions have taken place and where it is hardly possible to track the parent polymeric substance evidently the number of detected hs is depending on the employed ionization source and the polarity as shown in table 1 by far the highest number of hs is clearly detected using esi in positive mode here it has to be pointed out that during esi multiple charges can be transferred to the analytes and additionally various ion species are possible this holds especially true for positive ionization mode the differences in charge states and ion species for the different ionization interfaces is shown for the model polymeric substance peg in figure s5 and figure s6 in the si they clearly show that one hs can be present in different ionization species as well as carrying different number of charges up to z 8 detected notably the occurrence of multiple ion species is generally matrix dependent however no significant difference was observed for the model polymeric substance for the three different sample types data not shown data processing might represent another contributing factor many non targeted analysis algorithms are intended for the analysis of ions with low charge states z 2 and the grouping of isotopologues and adducts to one component might be hampered for ions showing higher charge states consequently esi might be more prone to redundancies and false positive findings in detected hs compared to the other two ionization interfaces in the following the results on suspect hits and the non target hs detection approach will be discussed in more detail 3 2 suspect screening results on suspect screening can be found in table s8 showing the name and abbreviation ru and molecular structure of the respective hs family level of confidence and in which ionization mode it was found hits in the suspect list were checked for ms2 availability and ms2 matches corresponding to a level of confidence of at least 3 schymanski et al 2014a and a characterization stage of c according to fig 1 for certain hs family members ms2 library spectra were available at massbank massbank of north america horai et al 2010 and allowed for a level of confidence of 2 stage d as it is shown in table s8 in total 21 different hs families were found 6 unique hs families were found for apci and 9 for appi esi clearly shows the highest number on hits and all detected suspect hs families were amenable to this ionization interface either in positive or negative mode however this finding might be biased due to the sources of the suspect list since esi is definitely the most prominently used ionization interface for lc based separations as expected the primary clarifier clearly represents the sample with the highest number of detectable hs and all suspects listed in table s8 were found in the primary clarifier peg eon peg monomethyl ether peg mme eon peg dimethyl ether peg dme eon peg monobutyl ether peg mb eon ppg pon tetramethylbutyl phenol ethoxylated tmbp eon cn aeox octylphenol ethoxylates opeon coconut diethanolamide cn dea nonylphenol polyethoxylates npeon glycol ether sulfate ges n nonylphenol ethoxylates sulfate npeon so4 alkyl sulfate cn as secondary alkane sulfonate cn sas alkyl ethoxy sulfates cn aexs dialkyl tetralinsulfonates cn dats linear alkylbenzene sulfonate cn las sulfophenyl carboxylic acids spa cn sulfophenyl alkyl dicarboxylated spa ndc sulfotetralin alkyl carboxylated sta nc within the suspect list hits the following hs families were still detected in the secondary clarifier cn aeox npeon peg eon peg dme eon ppg spa cn spa ndc sta nc finally the following suspect hits persisted partially treatment and found in the final effluent i e after ozonation and sand filter ges n npeon peg eon peg dme eon peg mme eon ppg spa cn spa ndc sta nc in fact the hs length of the peg present in the wastewater samples was surprising since typically the mass range studied in environmental samples has an upper limit of 1000 m z here with appi up to roughly 3540 da corresponding to 80 ethoxy units in the primary clarifier and down to roughly 1380 da in the final effluent were observed this can be seen in fig 2 showing the fate of this widely used water soluble polymeric substance during the three steps of the wastewater treatment process similar observation for wwtp effluent samples were reported recently by freeling et al 2019 showing peg with up to 40 ethoxy units 3 3 non target hs detection over the different stages of the sampled swiss wwtp a significant decrease in number of detected hs was observed using the non target hs detection approach this observation is in agreement with findings in literature for target surfactants brunner et al 1988 schröder et al 1999 traverso soto et al 2016 freeling et al 2019 and is shown in fig 3 for hs detectable in positive ionization mode and in figure s7 for hs detectable in negative ionization mode respectively inspecting m z vs rt distribution of detected hs as can be seen in fig 3 and figure s7 for negative mode the chosen m z range of 200 3000 proved reasonable especially for apci and appi since mainly singly or doubly charged ions were observed in case of esi charge states of the model hs peg of up to 8 were detected hence reducing the upper bounds of observed m z values it is worth mentioning that in environmental samples typically singly charged ions in a mass range of 50 1000 m z are in the focal point of analysis hence depending on the sample matrix hs of higher masses would be missed 3 4 characterization of hs as described in fig 1 after hs detection suspect and non target screening findings were checked manually for potential redundancies ion species mis classifications etc besides hits were limited to a charge state z 2 and ms2 availability of at least 2 hs members or 50 of the members was set as a pre requisite for tentative and probable structure elucidation respectively eics of hs of interest were generated for all three stages of the wwtp and were checked visually for changes in distribution over the course of the treatment often the hs were present in all sample types but differing in the distribution of the hs members in the blank sample hardly any hs could be observed the main focus of the present study was laid on the fate of water soluble polymeric substances and discharge in receiving water bodies hence characterization of detected hs was performed in samples taken after the second and third stage of the wwtp the second stage was included in the fate study since globally ozonation does not represent a commonly performed stage in wwtp since apci did not show any significant benefit neither in the number of detected hs using the non targeted screening approach nor the suspect screening table 1 this dataset was not further investigated results of the detected and filtered hs using the two different ionization interfaces esi and appi and present in the two final wwtp stages can be found in table s10 s13 including information on hss presence depending on the sample type and comments on changes in distributions a summary of the findings occurring rus minimum and maximum detected m z length and characterization classification is shown in the si table s9 due to the described filtering measures the number of hs to be characterized decreased namely to 10 hs for appi 5 for appi as well as 91 for esi and 40 in case of esi this results in a total of 774 members being grouped to 146 hs suspect and non target analysis envihomolog are in good agreement as can be seen in table 1 and in table s10 13 out of the 146 filtered hs 20 hs were assigned to suspect hs and 36 had matches regarding accurate mass of potential transformation products of suspects notably also naturally occurring hs were expected to be present but were not included in the suspect list e g fatty acids being detectable using esi in the following the findings are discussed and to showcase challenges associated with the characterization of hs six examples are shown in more detail in fig 4 in case of appi the m z of detected and filtered hs was ranging between roughly 390 up to 1320 m z and hs were eluting between 2 to 22 minutes for esi the lowest observed m z for the filtered hs was around 210 whereas the highest m z value was around 820 the rt space was similar to appi generally positive ionization lead to the detection of hs containing a higher number of members up to 19 for appi and 15 for esi whereas the maximum length in negative mode was only 6 members note that sodium adducts being prevalent in appi give generally ms2 spectra with lower information content compared to other adducts such as protonated species or ammonium adducts this definitely affects the success of structural characterizations of the appi mode in appi the number of hs in the secondary clarifier decreased significantly to 2 hs for positive mode and 2 for negative mode in case of positive mode one of the detected polymeric substance comprises 19 members from roughly 525 to 1320 da and was characterized as peg by comparing ms2 library spectra in massbank and a peg 600 and peg 2000 spiked sample for the other hs no ms2 was triggered due to low intensity sum of log10 intensities 5 7 checking for potential transformation reactions of the suspect list indicated an oxidation step from methyl to carboxylic acid of either the m k of opeo18 21 or the m na of peg dme eo18 21 since no other ion species were grouped to these compounds and both ion species are reasonable for appi this hs exemplifies the lowest stage a of characterization of hs as described in fig 1 in case of ozonation 8 hs remained after the filtering step for appi and 3 in case of appi again peg was characterized in appi however with a shift in mass distribution namely from 400 to 1190 da compared to 525 1320 da in the secondary clarifier this observation can be explained by degradation and sorption processes and is in agreement with findings in literature traverso soto et al 2016 fig 2 shows this change in hs distribution for all three stages of wwtp for a mass range of 250 up to 5000 da using appi as ionization interface besides another peg derivative namely peg mme was characterized stage d this hs can either be formed kawai 2005 during the stages of wwtp or was already present in the primary influent or both both polymeric substances are used among others as excipient in pharmaceuticals basis of skin creams or dispersant in toothpastes additionally two other potential transformation products of peg derivatives were tentatively characterized stage c four hs neither had matches in the suspect list nor could be explained by the common transformation reactions however assigning molecular formulae was possible aiming at tentatively characterizing the structure of the hs fig 4a gives an example of the structural variety of branched chain pegs besides it can be seen how the distribution of the polymeric substance is changing over the course of the wwtp in case of appi peg ges were characterized stage d fig 4b shows an example of a stage b characterization according to known transformation reactions and the exact masses two different peg derivatives were suggested however the ms2 spectrum was not indicative of either of the two also after the described filtering steps using esi lead to a significantly higher outcome in hs detection namely 41 hs for the secondary clarifier in positive mode and 27 for negative polarity and 50 and 13 hs after ozonation respectively as for the secondary clarifier the majority around 75 32 hs for positive and 55 15 hs for negative mode were characterized as unknowns however for each polarity 9 unknown hs allowed for a characterization stage c molecular formula generation of detected hs in negative mode revealed pre dominantly sulphur see exemplarily fig 4c and d as well as phosphorus containing molecules interestingly fig 4d shows an example where the m z difference would suggest an ethoxy group as ru however no polymeric substances in databases comprising two sulfur atoms and ethoxy as rus fit to the respective masses in positive mode suggested molecules often centered around sugar derivatives with alkyl residues see exemplarily fig 4e the latter polymeric substances are also known to be used as surfactants in personal care products plat and linhardt 2001 generally aeos and pegs are removed with high efficiency in wwtp by sorption and degradation traverso soto et al 2016 in case of aerobic degradation of aeos pathways involve the cleavage of the ether bond between the alkyl and ethoxy chain resulting in the formation of fatty acids and pegs marcomini et al 2000 being consistent with findings in literature traverso soto et al 2016 bernhard et al 2008 in positive mode for both biological treatment secondary clarifier as well as ozonation some detected hs could be potentially explained by known transformation reactions of suspects here dealkylation dehydration as well as carboxylation reaction of different peg derivatives it was possible to assign molecular formulas however again the majority of the ms2 spectra were not conclusive enough to reveal the head group and certainly not the exact molecular structure this is in agreement with findings of schymanski et al showing very few clean ms ms spectra in positive mode schymanski et al 2014b regarding the negative mode sulphur containing suspect polymeric substance were potentially transformed via de hydration hydroxylation decarboxylation de hydrogenation an example for the lowest stage of characterization i e a is depicted in fig 4f as shown the chromatographic behavior i e non baseline separated hs only detected after ozonation suggests a constitutional isomer and transformation processes as described in lara martin et al 2011 for ethoxymers of npecs in pore water samples even when using a mass spectrometer with excellent mass accuracy and stability the molecular formula assignment was not unequivocal and neither the isotopologue pattern nor the ms2 spectra allowed for a reduction in number of candidates notably for the latter fragmentation spectra showed only very few ions and hence were not conclusive 4 conclusion there are clearly many other hs present in wastewater apart from the known surfactants which could not yet be explained by common transformation reactions using a non targeted screening approach in total 146 hs were detected of which 56 ca 39 could be associated with suspect matches or transformation products of suspects due to high degree of freedom in terms of molecular structure their characterization was only partly successful since ms2 spectra do not fully resolve these constitutional isomers tentative characterization or probable chemical structure could be assigned to almost half of the findings clearly esi shows the highest number of detected hs however high number of charge states and adducts in esi complicate data deconvolution and hence complicate characterization of hs appi shows overall good ionization efficiency easier interpretable mass spectra compared to esi though ms2 interpretation suffers due to preference of na adduct formation a combination of the two different ionization approaches namely appi and esi seems to be promising to expand the mass to polarity plane expanding the mass range towards a higher m z value proved to be reasonable especially if studying hs occurring in the primary clarifier is of interest in esi higher molecular masses come along with higher charge states common identification workflows in non targeted analysis approaches rely on in silico ms2 fragmentation spectra interpretation e g metfrag ruttkies et al 2016 or csi fingerid sirius dührkop et al 2019 since these platforms are restricted to singly charged ions the characterization of hs with multiple charged members is hampered and hence would require a different approach the results demonstrate

17296,synthetic water soluble polymeric materials are widely employed in e g cleaning detergents personal care products paints or textiles accordingly these compounds reach sewage treatment plants and may enter receiving waters and the aquatic environment characteristically these molecules show a polydisperse molecular weight distribution comprising multiple repeating units i e a homologous series hs their analysis in environmentally relevant samples has received some attention over the last two decades however the majority of previous studies focused on surfactants and a molecular weight range 1000 da to capture a wider range on the mass versus polarity plane and extend towards less polar contaminants a workflow was established using three different ionization strategies namely conventional electrospray ionization atmospheric pressure photoionization and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization the data evaluation consisted of suspect screening of ca 1200 suspect entries and a non target screening of hs with pre defined accurate mass differences using ca 400 molecular formulas of repeating units of hs as input and repeating retention time shifts as hs indicator to study the fate of these water soluble polymeric substances in the wastewater treatment process the different stages i e after primary and secondary clarifier and after ozonation followed by sand filtration were sampled at a swiss wastewater treatment plant remaining with two different ionization interfaces esi and appi in both polarities a non targeted screening approach led to a total number of 146 hs each with a minimum number of 4 members with a molecular mass of up to 1200 detected in the final effluent of the 146 hs ca 15 could be associated with suspect hits and approximately 25 with transformation products of suspects tentative characterization or probable chemical structure could be assigned to almost half of the findings in positive ionization mode various sugar derivatives with differing side chains for negative mode structures with sulfonic acids could be characterized the number of detected hs decreased significantly over the three treatment stages for hs detectable also in the biological and oxidative treatment stages a change in hs distribution towards to lower mass range was often observed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polymeric substances wastewater non targeted analysis homologous series characterization 1 introduction recently the analysis of polymers has been in the limelight of environmental research however the focus is often on their solid state namely in terms of micro and nanoplastics often neglecting thereby the pressing topic of water soluble polymeric substances arp and knutsen 2020 the use of synthetic water soluble polymeric substances in textile industry paints coatings as well as consumer products such as cleaning detergents personal care products as well as pharmaceuticals is widespread the functionality of these diverse substances ranges from e g lowering the surface tension as it is the case for surfactants to serving as filling substance in pharmaceuticals or to be applied as dispersing agent in pesticides consequently their prevalent application is also reflected in the production volumes of educts employed in polymer syntheses reaching up to millions of tons per year notably information on synthetic polymers is hardly available since only their educts are registered under reach european chemicals agency 2017 accordingly these substances reach municipal wastewater and depending on the elimination during wastewater treatment may enter receiving waters and the aquatic environment by definition polymeric substances comprise multiple repetition of units typically derived from molecules of low relative molecular mass mcnaught and wilkinson 1997 due to the way of synthesis polymerization reactions are rarely complete and hence these molecules characteristically show a polydisperse molecular weight distribution comprising a multiplicity of repeating units ru i e a homologous series hs the term polymeric essentially describes either part or the whole molecule that consists of these multiple repetitions of these low molecular mass parts mcnaught and wilkinson 1997 as a matter of fact synthetic polymeric substances show high complexity in their chemical structure crotty et al 2016 one polymeric substance can comprise different numbers and types of chains of ru hence there are potentially many constitutional isomers present for one molecular formula of a hs member here fragmentation spectra acquired by ms ms instrumentation can aid in identifying the structure however the degree of freedom especially in branched chained polymeric substance is particularly high and therefore the exact chemical structure is often hardly accessible lara martin et al 2011 schymanski et al 2014b typically in order to understand the fate of anthropogenic contaminants in aquatic environments high performance liquid chromatography hplc coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry hrms is employed this front end separation is essential when dealing with low concentration in complex matrices zwiener and frimmel 2004 as a pre requisite of ms detection compounds of interest need to be present in their ionized form the most commonly applied ionization interface is electrospray ionization esi here medium polar to polar molecules in a vast molecular weight range can be ionized however if the analytes of interest are potentially extending to a low polarity range different ionization interfaces such as atmospheric pressure chemical ionization apci or atmospheric pressure photoionization appi have been used as alternatives reemtsma 2001 chiaia hernandez et al 2013 the latter two ionization sources are typically limited in terms of molecular weight to roughly 2000 3000 da since above either in source fragmentation is drastically increasing or ion formation is not effective gruendling et al 2010 terrier et al 2011 employing these ionization interfaces for the analysis of polymeric substance was discussed in detail by e g terrier et al 2011 andrea and alessandro 2003 reemtsma 2001 notably analytical methods focusing on pure polymer standards wesdemiotis 2017 are not fully transferable to the analysis of these substances in environmental samples that are characterized by low concentrations and very complex matrices as for data evaluation unknown hs can be detected using different approaches e g most prominently kendrick mass defect plots kendrick 1963 fouquet 2019 or van krevelen diagrams kim et al 2003 notably here either generating unique molecular formula for the compounds of interest is required or they are restricted to a small pre defined set of rus more importantly front end separation is not considered in the approaches mentioned above the recently published envihomolog algorithm loos and singer 2017 however does include this orthogonal information on chromatographic behavior moreover envihomolog does allow both to screen for any unknown repetitive m z differences between picked peaks as well as using pre defined molecular formulas as ru input however the envihomolog algorithm has so far not been combined with other non targeted componentization steps in lc ms signal processing namely any homologous analyte may form several hs over its different ion species and isotopologues which would remain redundant for later data interpretation but are also highly indicative for any grouping procedure similarly envihomolog does so far neither account for gapped series nor the combinatorial problems associated with close eluting and isobaric structural isomers of homologous analytes notably the term isobaric refers typically to ions of the same nominal masses in this very context the authors extended this term also to masses of the same accurate mass over the last decades numerous studies have investigated surfactants in the aquatic environment and have shown that modern surface active compounds are extensively removed but also transformed during the wastewater treatment stages brunner et al 1988 schröder et al 1999 lara martin et al 2011 faria et al 2019 here prominent examples of surfactants are alcohol ethoxylates aeo linear alkylbenzene sulfonates las and nonylphenol ethoxylates npeo in aqueous as well as solid environmental matrices these surfactants readily degrade and lead to the following well known degradation products sulfophenyl carboxylic acids spc nonylphenol ethoxy carboxylates npec and polyethylene glycols peg lara martin et al 2011 cowan ellsberry compiled comprehensively most relevant environmental data regarding surfactants over the last decades including risk assessment cowan ellsberry et al 2014 recently risk assessment of surfactants was debated by freeling et al 2019 dyer et al 2020 in a recent review of hupperstberg et al the authors argued that if environmental concentrations of water soluble polymeric substances reach a sufficiently high enough level these contaminants can act the same way as in their initial field of application e g enhancing solubility of non polar substances huppertsberg et al 2020 additonally as lately pointed out by arp and knutsen there is a lack in understanding the environmental behavior of water soluble polymers also in terms of mobility as well as persistence arp and knutsen 2020 qualitative and quantitative information on water soluble polymeric synthetic substances is still rather scarce and the vast majority of previous studies focused on surfactants and a molecular weight range 1000 da huppertsberg et al 2020 the aim of the present work was to investigate what lays outside of the known range of surfactants and potential transformation products to unravel hs in complex wastewater samples different ionization strategies were tested to expand the mass polarity plane towards the medium polar compounds in addition to comprehensive suspect screening a non targeted screening workflow with a homologue based componentization was established 2 materials and methods the complete data acquisition processing and mining optimized for the characterization of homologous series in wastewater is shown in fig 1 2 1 sampling and sample preparation polymeric substances were studied in flow proportional composite samples 24 h that were collected at different stages of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in switzerland namely after the primary clarifier grit sand and oil trap the secondary clarifier conventional activated sludge system with nitrification denitrification and a biological phosphorus elimination step and after ozonation followed by a sand filter as post treatment step one sample of each stage was collected by the plant operator in april 2019 filled into 0 5 l annealed glass bottles and immediately subjected to sample preparation to prevent sample alterations and contamination sample preparation was as limited as possible plastic material was avoided whenever possible and glass ware was either annealed or thoroughly cleaned using analytical grade methanol lc ms grade optima fisher scientific switzerland and nanopure water prior use two different strategies were pursued using either a simple centrifugation step to eliminate particles or pre concentration using vacuum assisted evaporation pre concentration factor of 10 for both sample preparation strategies five replicates were prepared alongside with the same number of replicates for blank samples to reduce changes of the prepared samples over time hplc hrms ms analysis was started as quickly as possible for quality control in terms of mass accuracy a composite sample spiked with a mixture of five isotopically labeled substances was prepared and analyzed every fifteenth injection table s1e additionally two peg standards with an average molecular weight of 600 and 2000 da sigma aldrich switzerland respectively were spiked to one aliquot of each sample type final concentration of 2 5 μg ml 1 spiking was performed on the centrifugated samples and each spiked sample was injected and analyzed three times 2 2 analysis via liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry for analysis reversed phase liquid chromatography rplc using a thermofisher scientific ultimate hplc equipped with a pal autosampler was coupled to a q exactive hrms thermofisher scientific san jose ca in data dependent acquisition mode topn n 5 mass resolution m z 200 ms1 140k and ms2 17 5k chromatographic separation was performed using a waters xbridge c18 column 2 1 50 mm 3 5 μm 130 å pore size equipped with a pre column waters xbridge beh c18 2 1 5 mm 3 5 μm ionization was realized by optimizing different interfaces namely esi apci and appi in terms of temperature gas flows and dopant addition to this end a sample collected after the wwtp s primary clarifier was employed to guarantee the presence of analytes of interest and to mimic an analytical worst case scenario in terms of matrix complexity due to their abundance over a wide molecular mass range and presence in the sample peg and polypropylene glycol ppg were applied as model hs in an m z range of up to 3000 data on optimization is shown in the si figure s1 s4 depending on the ionization source mobile phases for gradient elution were adjusted accordingly and are shown together with ion source and ms parameters in table s1a c in the si 2 3 data evaluation and data mining as depicted in fig 1 data was evaluated combining suspect screening and non target analysis workflow in envimass v4 2beta further data processing and mining steps were performed with dedicated r packages within rstudio r core team 2016 2 3 1 suspect screening to generate a suspect screening list different sources were combined further extended norman suspect list network et al 2020 garcía et al 2019 and known peg derivatives differing in end groups the suspect list that was used as an input in envimass can be found in the si table s4 in detail a primary clarifier sample was taken as basis for characterization here exact masses of the respective hs family were extracted and chromatographic parameters smooth rt change over the hs family s mass range and chromatographic peak shape were checked the term hs family is introduced here since some polymeric substances have different chains ru structural positions to grow from e g alcohol ethoxylates cnaeox and these are therefore summarized to one family ms2 spectra were checked for library matches and diagnostic fragment ions and losses suspect hits would be generally assigned to stage c or even d if they suffice the requirements shown in fig 1 and explained in detail in 2 3 3 to be reported a minimum number of four members per hs was necessary and suspects needed to be present in all technical replicates notably suspect matches are also indicated in the results of the envihomolog algorithm in envimass and were checked within this software accordingly 2 3 2 non target hs detection employed settings for peak picking blank peak subtraction and homologous series detection can be found in table s2 in the si since envimass allows rus as input parameter literature research was conducted on commercially available polymeric substances schymanski et al 2014b gago ferrero et al 2015 garcía et al 2019 and rus ellis and smith 2008 444 unique rus were compiled of which 400 had a mass of 400 da and were consequently used as input see table s3 in the si notably not all of them are to be expected in the wastewater samples envimass v4 2beta includes advances on the embedded non targeted hs extraction tool envihomolog loos and singer 2017 a more detailed description on the advances can be found in the supplementary information for non target hs detection results on components i e grouped picked peaks monoisotopic m z isotopologues and respective ion species hs as well as peaks within hs were exported from envimass and further processed with rstudio r core team 2016 hs containing components comprising only one ion single ion events for each member were excluded from further analysis focus was laid on the hs remaining after the secondary clarifier or after the ozonation and sand filtration step these were visually controlled by plotting extracted ion chromatograms eic using the r package msnbase gatto and lilley 2012 and checked manually and case wise for redundancies due to different adducts or charge states for that purpose and also to screen for transformation reaction products the r package tpprioritizr tpprioritizr n d was employed table s5 in the si shows the list of screened mass differences ms2 spectra and ms1 isotopologues were consequently extracted using the r package rmassbank stravs et al 2013 and written to ms file for characterization using sirius csi fingerid version 4 0 1 dührkop et al 2019 here for molecular formula annotation the following settings were used if the ion species was known the entry was set accordingly otherwise it was set to unknown m or m though prevalent ion species e g m na in case of appi were prioritized in the hit list of molecular formulas a 5 ppm mass accuracy window was set for in silico structure elucidation pubchem was used as input database if molecular formulas could be assigned but no hit in pubchem was found molecular formulas were searched within scifinder using the information on the ru as input 2 3 3 characterization of hs the last step of the workflow comprises the characterization of the hs due to the vast structural complexity of polymeric substances an unequivocal structural identification will be hard to achieve with merely rplc hrms ms gruendling et al 2010 crotty et al 2016 this holds especially true for branched chain polymeric substances then again there is the advantage of having multiple members that need to suffice specific requirements and thereby contributing to the confidence of identification hence the concept of communicating the level of confidence of identifications as suggested by schymanski et al schymanski et al 2014a was adapted to the characterization of hs here the authors define the lowest level a as a hs of interest analogue level 5 with a minimum of 4 hs members with a defined accurate m z difference within a 3 ppm window and a rt variability between adjacent members of 5 s it is also to be checked if the hs members are of the same ion species in the next step b for at least 2 members or 50 of the detected hs a molecular formula is assigned analogue level 4 as a next stage c ms2 fragment information is included for tentatively characterizing the hs analogue to level 3 here diagnostic fragment ions are indicative as described by e g thurman et al for pegs thurman et al 2017 in silico fragmentation prediction is applied here the final stage d includes also library matches analogue to level 2 and or reference standards analogue to level 1 3 results and discussion suspect screening and non target hs detection were performed in parallel see fig 1 since centrifugated samples resulted in a significantly lower number of hs detections e g for samples after ozonation 10 2 hs compared to 96 10 hs for pre concentrated samples in case of esi ionization approach focus was put on the pre concentrated samples table 1 gives a summary on the suspect matches and the number of non targeted hs detected via envimass and its algorithm envihomolog importantly for the latter findings the number of hs listed in table 1 correspond to hs findings after the implemented hs filter advancement and ensuring a minimum number of ions per hs members 3 1 method optimization and quality assurance the variation in detected hs depicted in table1 as well as in the following figures is referring to sample preparation replicates n 5 and can be explained by differences in signal intensity and consequently peak picking this holds especially true for signals of low intensity to generally gauge the repeatability of signal intensity variation in chromatographic peak height of peg was evaluated for the analytical worst case scenario the primary clarifier here an average rsd of the signal of the respective most abundant ion species of 12 19 and 12 for pre concentrated primary clarifier samples using apci appi and esi respectively was assessed data shown in si table s6 peg int repeatability besides also rt stability was assessed by means of peg 05eo up to peg 24eo excellent rt stability throughout the different sample matrices was observed for all ionization sources 2 only for appi variation up to around 5 was observed for the earlier eluting compounds i e 1 5 min most probably due to addition of isopropanol to the mobile phase as appi modifier data shown in si table s7 peg rtstability importantly the different sample types are characterized by their different matrix loads leading to effects on chromatographic separation and ionization that are compound dependent for target quantification considering this matrix effect is essential however in non targeted analysis and suspect screening where compound specific information is lacking such considerations become challenging since the aim of this work is focusing on the characterization and not the quantitation of polymeric substances no matrix factor was added and only inter sample type changes in intensities of above one orders of magnitude and a signal to blank factor 3 were considered as actual changes during the wastewater treatment process it is noteworthy that ru are depicted as m z and hence are dependent on the charge state of the respective hs e g c2h4o can be found as 44 02 for singly charged and 22 01 for doubly charged hs besides rus can be also described as multiple of each other e g ch2 and c2h4 units another factor contributing to the overall complexity of hs analysis is the redundancy arising from the dependence of molecular weight and ion species especially in esi one hs may change its members ionization behavior i e charge state over increasing mass the diminished overlap of co eluting peaks over these different hs makes their grouping difficult despite the additional hs filtering steps which were implemented here in order to reduce this complexity further filtering steps were implemented into envihomolog approach generally the chromatographic separation and difference in masses aid in indicating on what type of monomeric unit was employed for synthesizing the polymeric substance however the head groups are often significantly more difficult to be characterized especially if depletion or transformation reactions have taken place and where it is hardly possible to track the parent polymeric substance evidently the number of detected hs is depending on the employed ionization source and the polarity as shown in table 1 by far the highest number of hs is clearly detected using esi in positive mode here it has to be pointed out that during esi multiple charges can be transferred to the analytes and additionally various ion species are possible this holds especially true for positive ionization mode the differences in charge states and ion species for the different ionization interfaces is shown for the model polymeric substance peg in figure s5 and figure s6 in the si they clearly show that one hs can be present in different ionization species as well as carrying different number of charges up to z 8 detected notably the occurrence of multiple ion species is generally matrix dependent however no significant difference was observed for the model polymeric substance for the three different sample types data not shown data processing might represent another contributing factor many non targeted analysis algorithms are intended for the analysis of ions with low charge states z 2 and the grouping of isotopologues and adducts to one component might be hampered for ions showing higher charge states consequently esi might be more prone to redundancies and false positive findings in detected hs compared to the other two ionization interfaces in the following the results on suspect hits and the non target hs detection approach will be discussed in more detail 3 2 suspect screening results on suspect screening can be found in table s8 showing the name and abbreviation ru and molecular structure of the respective hs family level of confidence and in which ionization mode it was found hits in the suspect list were checked for ms2 availability and ms2 matches corresponding to a level of confidence of at least 3 schymanski et al 2014a and a characterization stage of c according to fig 1 for certain hs family members ms2 library spectra were available at massbank massbank of north america horai et al 2010 and allowed for a level of confidence of 2 stage d as it is shown in table s8 in total 21 different hs families were found 6 unique hs families were found for apci and 9 for appi esi clearly shows the highest number on hits and all detected suspect hs families were amenable to this ionization interface either in positive or negative mode however this finding might be biased due to the sources of the suspect list since esi is definitely the most prominently used ionization interface for lc based separations as expected the primary clarifier clearly represents the sample with the highest number of detectable hs and all suspects listed in table s8 were found in the primary clarifier peg eon peg monomethyl ether peg mme eon peg dimethyl ether peg dme eon peg monobutyl ether peg mb eon ppg pon tetramethylbutyl phenol ethoxylated tmbp eon cn aeox octylphenol ethoxylates opeon coconut diethanolamide cn dea nonylphenol polyethoxylates npeon glycol ether sulfate ges n nonylphenol ethoxylates sulfate npeon so4 alkyl sulfate cn as secondary alkane sulfonate cn sas alkyl ethoxy sulfates cn aexs dialkyl tetralinsulfonates cn dats linear alkylbenzene sulfonate cn las sulfophenyl carboxylic acids spa cn sulfophenyl alkyl dicarboxylated spa ndc sulfotetralin alkyl carboxylated sta nc within the suspect list hits the following hs families were still detected in the secondary clarifier cn aeox npeon peg eon peg dme eon ppg spa cn spa ndc sta nc finally the following suspect hits persisted partially treatment and found in the final effluent i e after ozonation and sand filter ges n npeon peg eon peg dme eon peg mme eon ppg spa cn spa ndc sta nc in fact the hs length of the peg present in the wastewater samples was surprising since typically the mass range studied in environmental samples has an upper limit of 1000 m z here with appi up to roughly 3540 da corresponding to 80 ethoxy units in the primary clarifier and down to roughly 1380 da in the final effluent were observed this can be seen in fig 2 showing the fate of this widely used water soluble polymeric substance during the three steps of the wastewater treatment process similar observation for wwtp effluent samples were reported recently by freeling et al 2019 showing peg with up to 40 ethoxy units 3 3 non target hs detection over the different stages of the sampled swiss wwtp a significant decrease in number of detected hs was observed using the non target hs detection approach this observation is in agreement with findings in literature for target surfactants brunner et al 1988 schröder et al 1999 traverso soto et al 2016 freeling et al 2019 and is shown in fig 3 for hs detectable in positive ionization mode and in figure s7 for hs detectable in negative ionization mode respectively inspecting m z vs rt distribution of detected hs as can be seen in fig 3 and figure s7 for negative mode the chosen m z range of 200 3000 proved reasonable especially for apci and appi since mainly singly or doubly charged ions were observed in case of esi charge states of the model hs peg of up to 8 were detected hence reducing the upper bounds of observed m z values it is worth mentioning that in environmental samples typically singly charged ions in a mass range of 50 1000 m z are in the focal point of analysis hence depending on the sample matrix hs of higher masses would be missed 3 4 characterization of hs as described in fig 1 after hs detection suspect and non target screening findings were checked manually for potential redundancies ion species mis classifications etc besides hits were limited to a charge state z 2 and ms2 availability of at least 2 hs members or 50 of the members was set as a pre requisite for tentative and probable structure elucidation respectively eics of hs of interest were generated for all three stages of the wwtp and were checked visually for changes in distribution over the course of the treatment often the hs were present in all sample types but differing in the distribution of the hs members in the blank sample hardly any hs could be observed the main focus of the present study was laid on the fate of water soluble polymeric substances and discharge in receiving water bodies hence characterization of detected hs was performed in samples taken after the second and third stage of the wwtp the second stage was included in the fate study since globally ozonation does not represent a commonly performed stage in wwtp since apci did not show any significant benefit neither in the number of detected hs using the non targeted screening approach nor the suspect screening table 1 this dataset was not further investigated results of the detected and filtered hs using the two different ionization interfaces esi and appi and present in the two final wwtp stages can be found in table s10 s13 including information on hss presence depending on the sample type and comments on changes in distributions a summary of the findings occurring rus minimum and maximum detected m z length and characterization classification is shown in the si table s9 due to the described filtering measures the number of hs to be characterized decreased namely to 10 hs for appi 5 for appi as well as 91 for esi and 40 in case of esi this results in a total of 774 members being grouped to 146 hs suspect and non target analysis envihomolog are in good agreement as can be seen in table 1 and in table s10 13 out of the 146 filtered hs 20 hs were assigned to suspect hs and 36 had matches regarding accurate mass of potential transformation products of suspects notably also naturally occurring hs were expected to be present but were not included in the suspect list e g fatty acids being detectable using esi in the following the findings are discussed and to showcase challenges associated with the characterization of hs six examples are shown in more detail in fig 4 in case of appi the m z of detected and filtered hs was ranging between roughly 390 up to 1320 m z and hs were eluting between 2 to 22 minutes for esi the lowest observed m z for the filtered hs was around 210 whereas the highest m z value was around 820 the rt space was similar to appi generally positive ionization lead to the detection of hs containing a higher number of members up to 19 for appi and 15 for esi whereas the maximum length in negative mode was only 6 members note that sodium adducts being prevalent in appi give generally ms2 spectra with lower information content compared to other adducts such as protonated species or ammonium adducts this definitely affects the success of structural characterizations of the appi mode in appi the number of hs in the secondary clarifier decreased significantly to 2 hs for positive mode and 2 for negative mode in case of positive mode one of the detected polymeric substance comprises 19 members from roughly 525 to 1320 da and was characterized as peg by comparing ms2 library spectra in massbank and a peg 600 and peg 2000 spiked sample for the other hs no ms2 was triggered due to low intensity sum of log10 intensities 5 7 checking for potential transformation reactions of the suspect list indicated an oxidation step from methyl to carboxylic acid of either the m k of opeo18 21 or the m na of peg dme eo18 21 since no other ion species were grouped to these compounds and both ion species are reasonable for appi this hs exemplifies the lowest stage a of characterization of hs as described in fig 1 in case of ozonation 8 hs remained after the filtering step for appi and 3 in case of appi again peg was characterized in appi however with a shift in mass distribution namely from 400 to 1190 da compared to 525 1320 da in the secondary clarifier this observation can be explained by degradation and sorption processes and is in agreement with findings in literature traverso soto et al 2016 fig 2 shows this change in hs distribution for all three stages of wwtp for a mass range of 250 up to 5000 da using appi as ionization interface besides another peg derivative namely peg mme was characterized stage d this hs can either be formed kawai 2005 during the stages of wwtp or was already present in the primary influent or both both polymeric substances are used among others as excipient in pharmaceuticals basis of skin creams or dispersant in toothpastes additionally two other potential transformation products of peg derivatives were tentatively characterized stage c four hs neither had matches in the suspect list nor could be explained by the common transformation reactions however assigning molecular formulae was possible aiming at tentatively characterizing the structure of the hs fig 4a gives an example of the structural variety of branched chain pegs besides it can be seen how the distribution of the polymeric substance is changing over the course of the wwtp in case of appi peg ges were characterized stage d fig 4b shows an example of a stage b characterization according to known transformation reactions and the exact masses two different peg derivatives were suggested however the ms2 spectrum was not indicative of either of the two also after the described filtering steps using esi lead to a significantly higher outcome in hs detection namely 41 hs for the secondary clarifier in positive mode and 27 for negative polarity and 50 and 13 hs after ozonation respectively as for the secondary clarifier the majority around 75 32 hs for positive and 55 15 hs for negative mode were characterized as unknowns however for each polarity 9 unknown hs allowed for a characterization stage c molecular formula generation of detected hs in negative mode revealed pre dominantly sulphur see exemplarily fig 4c and d as well as phosphorus containing molecules interestingly fig 4d shows an example where the m z difference would suggest an ethoxy group as ru however no polymeric substances in databases comprising two sulfur atoms and ethoxy as rus fit to the respective masses in positive mode suggested molecules often centered around sugar derivatives with alkyl residues see exemplarily fig 4e the latter polymeric substances are also known to be used as surfactants in personal care products plat and linhardt 2001 generally aeos and pegs are removed with high efficiency in wwtp by sorption and degradation traverso soto et al 2016 in case of aerobic degradation of aeos pathways involve the cleavage of the ether bond between the alkyl and ethoxy chain resulting in the formation of fatty acids and pegs marcomini et al 2000 being consistent with findings in literature traverso soto et al 2016 bernhard et al 2008 in positive mode for both biological treatment secondary clarifier as well as ozonation some detected hs could be potentially explained by known transformation reactions of suspects here dealkylation dehydration as well as carboxylation reaction of different peg derivatives it was possible to assign molecular formulas however again the majority of the ms2 spectra were not conclusive enough to reveal the head group and certainly not the exact molecular structure this is in agreement with findings of schymanski et al showing very few clean ms ms spectra in positive mode schymanski et al 2014b regarding the negative mode sulphur containing suspect polymeric substance were potentially transformed via de hydration hydroxylation decarboxylation de hydrogenation an example for the lowest stage of characterization i e a is depicted in fig 4f as shown the chromatographic behavior i e non baseline separated hs only detected after ozonation suggests a constitutional isomer and transformation processes as described in lara martin et al 2011 for ethoxymers of npecs in pore water samples even when using a mass spectrometer with excellent mass accuracy and stability the molecular formula assignment was not unequivocal and neither the isotopologue pattern nor the ms2 spectra allowed for a reduction in number of candidates notably for the latter fragmentation spectra showed only very few ions and hence were not conclusive 4 conclusion there are clearly many other hs present in wastewater apart from the known surfactants which could not yet be explained by common transformation reactions using a non targeted screening approach in total 146 hs were detected of which 56 ca 39 could be associated with suspect matches or transformation products of suspects due to high degree of freedom in terms of molecular structure their characterization was only partly successful since ms2 spectra do not fully resolve these constitutional isomers tentative characterization or probable chemical structure could be assigned to almost half of the findings clearly esi shows the highest number of detected hs however high number of charge states and adducts in esi complicate data deconvolution and hence complicate characterization of hs appi shows overall good ionization efficiency easier interpretable mass spectra compared to esi though ms2 interpretation suffers due to preference of na adduct formation a combination of the two different ionization approaches namely appi and esi seems to be promising to expand the mass to polarity plane expanding the mass range towards a higher m z value proved to be reasonable especially if studying hs occurring in the primary clarifier is of interest in esi higher molecular masses come along with higher charge states common identification workflows in non targeted analysis approaches rely on in silico ms2 fragmentation spectra interpretation e g metfrag ruttkies et al 2016 or csi fingerid sirius dührkop et al 2019 since these platforms are restricted to singly charged ions the characterization of hs with multiple charged members is hampered and hence would require a different approach the results demonstrate

17297,anaerobic digestion of organic waste and wastewater represents an attractive sustainable bio technology to produce methane as an alternative to fossil energy in response to improvement of methane production via enhancing methanogenesis current strategies of the addition of external biological non biological materials have to confront either the loss of materials high cost and or possible destruction of the microbial community here we report the first case of using immobilized fungi aspergillus sydowii 8l 9 f02 to optimize the microbial community achieving remarkable improvement of the methane production in both batch test 1 5 times and continuous flow operation 1 13 1 31 times the crucial role of fungi is associated with the stimulation of enrichment of methanosaeta and methanobacterium for methanogenesis from 28 2 to 67 4 as well as the improved activity of enzyme f420 moreover fungi also increase the content of extracellular polymeric substances facilitating the formation of bio aggregates this work provides a new pathway to enhance methanogenesis during anaerobic digestion of wastewater by using fungi as bio enhancer toc graphic image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion wastewater fungi immobilization methanogenesis 1 introduction in response to the current energy crisis bio production of small molecules including hydrogen methane methanol and volatile fatty acids from organic compound precursors represents a potential alternative to fossil energy patel et al 2016 wainaina et al 2019 wang et al 2018a among them the anaerobic generation of methane has been evidenced to be applicable and cost effective even at industrial scale li et al 2015 with respect to the precursor the use of various types of wastewater possesses the advantages of large quantity broad spectrum of sources and environmental sustainability there are three major stages for the anaerobic production of methane i e hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis li and yu 2011 the maximum conversion of 1 g cod chemical oxygen demand from wastewater could generate 0 25 g ch4 theoretically which is however much higher than the experimental results mainly because of the low efficiency in the third stage sun et al 2020 consequently improvement of the conversion efficiency especially that of the third stage is of great importance from both fundamental and application perspectives major strategies for the improvement of the conversion efficiency of the third stage include enhancement of electron transfer and enrichment of the methanogens for examples the addition of carbon materials such as active carbon and graphene and metal oxides such as iron oxides and manganese oxides has been widely utilized to facilitate the direct interspecies electron transfer diet resulting in a significant improvement of methane production lovley 2017 sieber et al 2012 although the facilitation of diet via addition of external species is a popular choice it should be addressed that the additives especially with sizes on the scale of nanometers might experience mass loss through effluent during continuous operation which gradually weakens the reinforcement effects ambuchi et al 2017 in contrast the approach of enrichment of the methanogens has the merit of long term stability which is however less reported because it is rather difficult to manipulate the composition of the microbial community allison and martiny 2008 peces et al 2018 a few studies have adopted the manual introduction of lab cultured microbial strain into the system exhibiting significant enhancement of the conversion efficiency of methane fotidis et al 2014 kalle et al 1985 lalov et al 2001 yang et al 2019 nevertheless these attempts still suffer from high cost and possible destruction of the local microbial community that could lead to systematic failure de roy et al 2014 fotidis et al 2017 in consequence how to optimize the composition of the microbial community with enrichment of desired methanogens should be of particular scientific interest fungi are ubiquitous in natural environment and wastewater that are highly resistant to harsh conditions such as fluctuating pollutant loads low ph high salinity low nutrient concentrations assress et al 2019 maza márquez et al 2016 more importantly fungi could generate a variety of enzymes that are needed during the anaerobic digestion process harms et al 2011 hyde et al 2019 jeyakumar et al 2013 zhang et al 1999 these virtues render fungi great potential in the application of pollutant removal in complicated scenarios gros et al 2014 owhonka and janet olufunmilayo 2020 for the bio production of methane fungi have also been demonstrated to be effective in enhancing the efficiency of anaerobic digestion of crude fibrous portion of corn stover rice straw mustafa et al 2016 shi et al 2019 waste activated sludge ma et al 2017 mannan et al 2005 organic wastes hom diaz et al 2016a and microalgae hom diaz et al 2016b interestingly these attempts were focused on static solid systems or pretreatment technology the investigation of the effect of fungi during wastewater treatment especially in continuous flow operation is however challenged by the easy loss of fungi and thus has rarely been reported in this work for the anaerobic wastewater treatment in both batch and continuous flow operation we propose the immobilization strategy of fungus and evaluate their influence on the bio production of methane aspergillus sydowii 8l 9 f02 was chosen as the test stain since aspergillus is one of the most studied mold groups and widely applied in industrial use or enzymes production mojsov 2016 the presence of fungi demonstrates exceptional improvement of methane production via a higher utilization of co2 moreover the effects of other factors including the variation of granular sludge properties the activity of different enzymes and the alternation of functional microbial community were also investigated we believe this study will help to better understand the synergetic interaction of fungi and anaerobic granular sludge during organic wastewater treatment further it will provide fundamental guidance to construct fungi mediated bioprocess for highly efficient production of ch4 simultaneously 2 materials and methods 2 1

added to make the final concentrations of 15 20 g l 1 respectively mycelia as inoculum for the preparation of bead were collected from cultures by gauze filtration followed by centrifugation 12000 g 10 min and sterilization to make a fungus suspension 6 0 9 0 g wet weight inoculum was suspended in the 100 ml sterilized deionized water 2 2 preparation of aspergillus sydowii entrapping beads aebs modified dripping method was used to prepare aebs kim et al 2013 specifically a homogeneous mixture made of the above fungus suspension 3 4 w v sodium alginate solution and 6 9 w v polyvinyl alcohol pva was slowly added into the saturated solution of cacl2 boric acid to form beads with an average size of 3 mm to enhance their stability aebs were kept in the cacl2 boric acid for 2 h followed by immersing in 1 5 w v glutaraldehyde solution for 20 min afterwards aebs were rinsed with deionized water three times and stored in clean bench before use a parallel blank sample of beads without the addition of fungus suspension was prepared following the same procedures and is referred to as vacant beads 2 3 experimental set up and sludge inoculation three lab scale expanded granular sludge bed

up using 20 serum bottles 500ml for batch tests each conducted in five parallel experiments the four groups are b0 with only sludge inoculated b1 with sludge and 15 v vacant beads v seed sludge vacant beads b2 with sludge and 15 v aebs v seed sludge aebs b3 with the same amount of aebs as in b2 but without sludge the volume of the sludge inoculated in each bottle was about 150 ml which was obtained after starvation treatment as described above the initial cod concentrations were all 5000 mg l 1 and the other composition of synthetic wastewater was the same as above described in continuous mode all bottles were purged with he gas to remove the dissolved oxygen for 5 min and sealed immediately using a butyl rubber plug the bottles were placed in a shaking chamber at 32 1 c and 120 rpm for the reaction gas bags 500ml were used to collect biogas produced 2 6 morphology observation of aebs and anaerobic granular sludge scanning electron microscopy was used to determine the surface morphology features of aebs and granular sludge and that inside fungi aebs were dried with a vacuum dryer at 40 c for 48 h anaerobic granular sludge was fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c overnight and thoroughly washed twice with the 0 1 m phosphate buffer solution ph 7 0 followed by dehydration in a series of ethanol solutions 30 90 for 15 min each and 100 for 20 min twice afterwards ethanol was

enzymatic release of tyrosine specific relative enzyme activity is expressed as enzymatic activity per gram of vss u g vss 1 coenzyme f420 determination was conducted according to heine dobbernack et al 1988 together with the determination of acetate kinase activity described in text s2 in si cellulase acetyl coa carboxylase ac coa and β glucosidase activities were tested using detection kits cl assay kit lacc assay kit and β glucuronidase assay kit jiancheng nanjing china and the operation and testing methods were in accordance with the instructions 2 9 7 analysis of microbial community 16s rdna of sludge samples collected from r0 r1 and r2 at day 0 day 45 and day 90 were extracted with mobio powersoilr dna isolation kit 12888 according to the manufacturer s instructions standard curves were constructed using a purified dna template that was amplified by conventional sequencing polymerase chain reaction pcr using the corresponding primers negative controls using water and positive controls using the corresponding cells were included for each assay the v3 and v4 region for pcr amplicon libraries were constructed by the illumina miseq platform pe300 ca usa the primers for pcr were as follows 515f gtgccagcmgccgcgg 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat for archaea and bacteria 2 10 statistical analyses independent sample t test was performed by ibm spss spss 19 0 and significant differences were indicated as follows p 0 05 p 0 001 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological observation and mechanical stability of aebs optical image in fig 1 a shows that the aebs are spherical with uniform size of ca 3 0 mm and slightly swell up on day 90 due to the sludge wrapping fig 1 a the sem images in fig 1 b and fig s1 a in si show the rugged and porous surface of both aeb and vacant bead with no observable difference in surface morphology at the beginning of the experiment however different kinds of microorganism gathered on the surfaces of aebs and vacant beads after 90 day operation fig 1 b and fig s1 a in si besides a lot of aspergillus sydowii 8l 9 f02 fungi are observed inside the aebs both at the beginning or the end of the long term operation fig 1 c c d and d but not observed inside vacant bead fig s1 b and b in si moreover one could not observe other fungi or bacteria inside aebs these results suggest that the immobilization strategy generated aebs with high density of aspergillus sydowii 8l 9 f02 fungi inside without being contaminated by other species the mechanical strength of aebs was determined to be 442 21 g before use at the end day 10 of the batch test negligible change was observed 439 16 g in continuous flow operation it declined to 331 19 g on day 90 by ca 25 only the mechanical strength of aebs after 90 days operation was much higher than other beads using alginate only zhang et al 2020 obviously the use of pva for the preparation of aebs is crucial for their excellent mechanical property lee et al 2016b probably because the pva mitigates the adverse effects due to the chelation of ca2 by po4 3 moreno garrido 2008 3 2 effects of aebs on methanogenesis in batch experiments fig 2 a shows the cumulative methane yield in static batch experiments showing the order of the amount of generated methane following b2 b0 b1 b3 0 the dashed lines represent the data fitting to modified gompertz equation eq 1 with the fitting parameters including maximum methane yield potential p methane production rate rm and lag phase time λ summarized in table s2 in si the fact that b3 of pure aebs does not generate methane suggest that aspergillus sydowii 8l 9 f02 fungi are not able to metabolize cod to produce methane in the absence of sludge b1 produces slightly less methane with longer lag phase time than b0 probably because of the moderate deterioration of the structure of the sludge due to the addition of vacant beads zhang et al 2020 interestingly one could see a significant ca 1 5 fold improvement of the methane production in b2 compared to b0 note that the extent of such improvement due to the addition of fungi is large enough to be comparable to those 1 8 0 3 fold using diet strategy ren et al 2019 one might also notice that the value of λ is slightly increased in b2 implying that longer period is needed for the adaption of the sludge the composition of carbon compounds including the generated biogas in 10 days in the four systems is illustrated in fig 2 b and summarized in table s3 in si b0 produces 29 6 ch4 41 8 co2 and 9 02 biomass intermediates using b0 as comparison b1 produces slightly less ch4 23 8 p 0 001 and more co2 45 7 p 0 05 while b2 generates more ch4 39 3 p 0 001 and less co2 35 9 p 0 05 besides b3 does not produce methane but generates a small amount of co2 5 09 p 0 001 which might promote co2 reduction methanogens it was also informative to see that the fraction of biomass intermediates in b2 increases to 12 0 possibly promoting microbial aggregation or granulation in comparison to b0 furthermore the ch4 production yield followed the order of b2 b0 b1 while that of co2 was the opposite fig s2 in si based on these results it is supposed that the addition of fungi might promote the conversion of co2 to ch4 in hydrotrophic methanogenesis pathway or strengthen the aceticlastic methanogenesis pathway both of which would enhance the overall methane production show and lee 2017 the composition of the eps from b0 b1 and b2 were also analyzed and are presented in fig s3 in si as observed the concentrations of eps components protein pn and polysaccharide ps in b2 are higher than that in b0 the exceptional higher pn concentration 5 times implies a significant enrichment of microbial extracellular enzymes in b2 meanwhile the higher pn content might also contribute to the increase of the microbial extracellular activity and the promotion of the microbial aggregation basuvaraj et al 2015 3 3 effects of aebs on methanogenesis in continuous flow operation the investigation of the effects of aebs on methanogenesis was also carried out in continuous flow with r0 r1 and r2 operated for 90days under the same conditions the performance of egsb reactors was evaluated from the following four perspectives including removal of cod variation of vfa production of ch4 and composition of biogas results are shown in fig 3 3 3 1 removal of cod fig 3 a shows the removal efficiency of cod in the three systems in the initial adaption period day 0 10 the removal of cod is difficult to quantify as the variation of parallel experiments is large at day 10 the removal efficiency of cod in all three reactors stabilizes between 80 86 as the step increase of olr from 2 0 to 5 0 kg m 3 d 1 day 11 62 the evolution profiles of cod removal of the three systems were almost identical well above 80 while the cod removal in r0 and r1 were always slightly lower ca 3 than that of r2 further increase of olr to 10 0 kg m 3 d 1 day 63 66 resulted in a sudden reduction of the cod removal to 54 6 for r0 and 55 8 for r1 but only a slight decrease to 81 3 for r2 in the last period of day 67 90 the olr was reduced to 7 1 kg m 3 d 1 for all the reactors r0 and r1 experienced recovery of cod removal back to ca 88 over three weeks while r2 only took one week for the recovery to above 90 all the above results highlighted the robust performance of r2 in response to the increase of olr probably attributing to the high tolerance of fungi to organic substances 3 3 2 variation of vfas fig 3 b shows the concentrations of three typical vfas i e formate acetate and propionate which were determined every ten days during the 90 days operation acetate was the major product in all three systems meanwhile the total vfas concentration followed the order of r1 r0 r2 which is consistent with the order for the cod removal in fig 3 a a sudden increase of the vfas by ca 1 8 2 1 fold was observed in all three systems when the olr was increased to 5 0 kg m 3 d 1 on day 37 causing a slight reduction of cod removal rate fig 3 a the later gradual decline of vfas in day 63 66 was observed in all three reactors presumably because of the gradual adaption of the microorganisms to the increase of olr the fact that r2 exhibited the lowest vfas concentration suggest that the addition of aebs enhances the conversion of vfas to co2 or ch4 note that the concentrations of vfas in all three systems are generally lower than that could inhibit syntrophic microbes wang et al 2019a 3 3 3 production of methane and the composition of biogas the production of methane and the corresponding composition of the generated biogas are illustrated in fig 3 c and 3 d fig 3 c shows that r2 needs 8 days to reach the same level of methane production as r0 confirming that the addition of aebs increases the lag phase time as shown in section 3 2 later throughout the whole period the increase of olr effectively improved the methane production in all three systems meanwhile the methane production of r2 was always higher than that of r0 and close to that of r1 compared to r0 r2 produced 14 7 more methane in the period of day 11 57 and 20 3 more methane in the period of day 60 89 such improvement is similar to those using diet strategies lee et al 2016a liu et al 2020a tian et al 2017 apparently the addition of aebs enhanced the production of methane which is especially effective when the olr is increased fig 3 d shows that in the generated biogas the average fraction of methane during day 11 90 in r2 was 70 9 higher than that in r0 63 6 and r1 60 7 meanwhile the average fraction of co2 in r2 is 24 4 lower than that in r0 31 9 and r1 34 9 the improvement of the ch4 production rate might be associated to the change of granular properties of anaerobic sludge and or the enrichment of aceticlastic methanogenst in the presence of aebs rotaru et al 2014 as further verified in section 3 4 and 3 6 3 4 effects of aebs on eps as a start to evaluate the effects of aebs on eps the size of particles of the sludge in three continuous systems was examined results in fig s4 in si show that the size increased gradually as the anaerobic digestion proceeded in all three systems with the order of the increment of size following r2 r0 r1 r1 exhibited the least increase of particle size probably because the addition of vacant beads did not facilitate bio aggregates but rather might collide with granular sludge under shear force in water kim et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 although the collision effects might also be present in r2 with the added aebs the aebs was supposed to greatly accelerate the formation of bio aggregates resulting in a significant increase of the particle size these change of particle size in sludge should imply the change of eps composition fig 4 shows the composition of eps represented by five regions of the fluorescence spectra of s eps and b eps in r0 and r2 five region division is detailed in table s4 in si as referred to the literature wang et al 2019b as seen in fig 4 fluorescence response of four major components i e tyrosine like substance tryptophan like proteins humic acid like substances soluble microbial byproduct like substances all increased as anaerobic digestion proceeded especially in b eps for all signals the intensity in r2 was always stronger than that in r0 during the whole reaction day 45 and 90 of particular interest is the signal in the region of 289 294 378 383 nm which could be ascribed to the signal of aromatic amino acid e g tryptophan associated to protein like substances chen et al 2003 reached the maximum at day 90 in r2 while remained almost unchanged in r0 these results suggest that the addition of aebs stimulated the synthesis and secretion of all these substances further the relationship between the increase of these substances in eps and the improvement of methane production was concerned on one side eps contains extracellular enzymes that are required by bacteria to digest high molecular weight compounds the increase of eps favored the enhanced retention accumulation and stabilization of associated ecto enzymes for substrate degradation cadoret et al 2002 on the other side the increase of eps content and the larger particle size are beneficial to the enrichment of strict anaerobic microorganism such as methanogens katayama and kamagata 2017 3 5 the response of enzyme activities in the presence of aebs to evaluate the response of enzyme activities in r0 r1 and r2 we examined six enzymes i e protease cellulase acetate kinase f420 ac coa and beta glucosidase β glucosidase which are key enzymes for hydrolysis acetate production and methane generation dolfing and mulder 1985 feng et al 2014 their activities are represented by specific relative activity as described in fig 5 in the beginning of the anaerobic digestion day 0 the activity of protease was not detected in all three systems as the digestion proceeded the activity of protease increased slightly to 0 03 0 04 u g vss 1 on day 45 and remained almost constant thereafter the activity of cellulase kept at a low level throughout the digestion in all three systems probably because of the lack of cellulose substrate with respect to acetate kinase and β glucosidase their activities in three systems experienced an increase first because of the increase of olr and then a slight decrease probably due to the accumulation of vfas for ac coa its activity was hardly detected in r0 and r1 but experienced a constant increase to a high level in r2 previous study has confirmed that ac coa could be linked to methanogenesis by some biologic router lieber et al 2014 which could contribute to the production of methane the response of f420 exhibited the highest activity in all three systems and f420 in r2 demonstrated higher activity than that in r0 and r1 the activity of coenzyme f420 has been reported to be well connected to the potential methanogenic activity delafontaine et al 1979 3 6 response of microbial community to the addition of aebs it is then naturally necessary to investigate the composition alteration of genera that is enriched in each system at the end of the operation using illumina masiq high throughput sequencing the alpha diversity indexes are shown in table s5 in si including chao coverage shannon and simpson index which reflected community richness coverage and diversity respectively these results indicate that the additional of aebs significantly decreased the richness and diversity of the microbial community but strengthened the stabilization of abundant microbes in r2 fig 6 shows the top ten predominant compositions of microbes on genus level on day 90 one could not observe significant difference of coupons between r0 and r1 for the main compositions with the main genera as methanosaeta smithella norank c anaerolineae norank p aegiribacteria norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 and methanobacterium the high abundance of smithella 17 3 in r0 and 19 3 in r1 might be caused by propionate acclimation derived inoculation sludge liu et al 1999 the integrated anaerobic digestion processes of r0 and r1 are proposed to proceed in cooperation of these genera norank c anaerolineae belongs to fermentative bacteria and utilizes sugars and proteinaceous compounds yamada and sekiguchi 2018 orank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 and norank p aegiribacteria play significant roles in hydrolytic acidification to provide nutrients for methanogens liu et al 2017 si et al 2016 and methanosaeta and methanobacterium are involved in synthesis of methane with respect to r2 with the addition of aebs the composition of microbial community on genus level experienced an obvious shift compared to r0 the abundance of methanosaeta of r2 reached 48 3 which was 2 2 fold of that in r0 methanosaeta are classical methanogens accounting for over 90 of the 16s rrna sequences recovered from methanogens smith and ingram smith 2007 methanosaeta are able to convert acetate to methane morita et al 2011 recent studies have shown that methanosaeta are also capable for direct interspecies electron transfer rotaru et al 2014 under the conditions that the cells are in direct contact with cooperators through bioelectrical connections in this study methanosaeta are involved in the anaerobic digestion process and could accept electrons from co2 to form methane resulting in a lower co2 and higher methane in r2 than in r0 and r1 section 3 3 3 the abundance of methanobacterium in r2 was 19 1 much higher than the 6 6 in r0 and 13 8 r1 methanobacterium are hydrogenotrophic methanogens and its enrichment in r2 suggested that the addition of aebs promoted the production of methane via the reaction of h2 and co2 the abundance of caldisericum in r2 was 14 7 but almost un detectable in r0 and r1 we postulate that the caldisericum as dominant exoelectrogens should be the signal genus for the stimulation of fungi which could favor the production of formate and acetate probst et al 2017 and moreover possessed genes that potentially code for type iv conductive pilin like filaments similar to those in geobacter for electron transfer liu et al 2020b lovley 2011 caldisericum also possesses the ability to transfer electrons across the cell membrane to an extracellular electron acceptor mori et al 2009 we thus suspect that caldisericum play a crucial role in electron transfer during anaerobic digestion in the r2 system while the addition of fungi promotes the enrichment of caldisericum thus a different pathway was proposed for the production of methane in r2 blvii28 wastewater sludge group 5 8 participated in the removal of cod wang et al 2020 caldisericum were responsible for the formation of formate and acetate and electron transfer methanobacterium was involved in the formation of methane via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis whereas methanosaeta favored the production of methane via aceticlastic methanogenesis or direct interspecies electron transfer 3 7 discussion on the fungi based enhancement mechanisms and perspectives our results clearly demonstrate that fungi make great contribution to the enhancement of methane production in the anaerobic digestion of wastewater a key technique used in this study is the immobilization of fungi inside aebs facilitating the secretion of eps and the aggregation of granular sludge in consequence this system generates significantly more ecto enzymes that result in higher removal of cod and conversion of vfas the presence of fungi also largely stimulates the enrichment of methanogens methanosaeta and methanobacterium which even become dominant genera of all the microorganisms to favor a remarkable improvement of the methane production we have to address that the current study is a tentative yet preliminary exploration of the effects of fungi on the methane production in anaerobic digestion of wastewater further study is still required on but not limited to the following aspects 1 the unclear intracellular transcription pathway particularly based on proteomic 2 the long term effect of fungi inoculated beads in complex water matrix particularly in real wastewater 3 further optimization of fungi types for enhanced ch4 production 4 conclusions in this study we proposed a strategy to optimize the microbial community via the addition of fungi aspergillus sydowii 8l 9 f02 for improvement of methane production in anaerobic digestion of wastewater the fungi were immobilized inside millimeter sized porous beads composed by sodium alginate and pva to facilitate long term operation in both batch and continuous modes as observed fungi stimulated the change to the composition of microbial community bringing in the enrichment of methanosaeta and methanobacterium for methanogenesis and simultaneous improvement of the activity of enzyme f420 meanwhile the presence of fungi also increased the content of eps to facilitate the formation of bio aggregates such changes make significant difference to the third stage of the anaerobic digestion i e methanogenesis to achieving high production efficiency of ch4 this study might shed new light on how to improve the microbial community via the addition of fungi for water treatment as well as purposes declaration of

17297,anaerobic digestion of organic waste and wastewater represents an attractive sustainable bio technology to produce methane as an alternative to fossil energy in response to improvement of methane production via enhancing methanogenesis current strategies of the addition of external biological non biological materials have to confront either the loss of materials high cost and or possible destruction of the microbial community here we report the first case of using immobilized fungi aspergillus sydowii 8l 9 f02 to optimize the microbial community achieving remarkable improvement of the methane production in both batch test 1 5 times and continuous flow operation 1 13 1 31 times the crucial role of fungi is associated with the stimulation of enrichment of methanosaeta and methanobacterium for methanogenesis from 28 2 to 67 4 as well as the improved activity of enzyme f420 moreover fungi also increase the content of extracellular polymeric substances facilitating the formation of bio aggregates this work provides a new pathway to enhance methanogenesis during anaerobic digestion of wastewater by using fungi as bio enhancer toc graphic image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion wastewater fungi immobilization methanogenesis 1 introduction in response to the current energy crisis bio production of small molecules including hydrogen methane methanol and volatile fatty acids from organic compound precursors represents a potential alternative to fossil energy patel et al 2016 wainaina et al 2019 wang et al 2018a among them the anaerobic generation of methane has been evidenced to be applicable and cost effective even at industrial scale li et al 2015 with respect to the precursor the use of various types of wastewater possesses the advantages of large quantity broad spectrum of sources and environmental sustainability there are three major stages for the anaerobic production of methane i e hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis li and yu 2011 the maximum conversion of 1 g cod chemical oxygen demand from wastewater could generate 0 25 g ch4 theoretically which is however much higher than the experimental results mainly because of the low efficiency in the third stage sun et al 2020 consequently improvement of the conversion efficiency especially that of the third stage is of great importance from both fundamental and application perspectives major strategies for the improvement of the conversion efficiency of the third stage include enhancement of electron transfer and enrichment of the methanogens for examples the addition of carbon materials such as active carbon and graphene and metal oxides such as iron oxides and manganese oxides has been widely utilized to facilitate the direct interspecies electron transfer diet resulting in a significant improvement of methane production lovley 2017 sieber et al 2012 although the facilitation of diet via addition of external species is a popular choice it should be addressed that the additives especially with sizes on the scale of nanometers might experience mass loss through effluent during continuous operation which gradually weakens the reinforcement effects ambuchi et al 2017 in contrast the approach of enrichment of the methanogens has the merit of long term stability which is however less reported because it is rather difficult to manipulate the composition of the microbial community allison and martiny 2008 peces et al 2018 a few studies have adopted the manual introduction of lab cultured microbial strain into the system exhibiting significant enhancement of the conversion efficiency of methane fotidis et al 2014 kalle et al 1985 lalov et al 2001 yang et al 2019 nevertheless these attempts still suffer from high cost and possible destruction of the local microbial community that could lead to systematic failure de roy et al 2014 fotidis et al 2017 in consequence how to optimize the composition of the microbial community with enrichment of desired methanogens should be of particular scientific interest fungi are ubiquitous in natural environment and wastewater that are highly resistant to harsh conditions such as fluctuating pollutant loads low ph high salinity low nutrient concentrations assress et al 2019 maza márquez et al 2016 more importantly fungi could generate a variety of enzymes that are needed during the anaerobic digestion process harms et al 2011 hyde et al 2019 jeyakumar et al 2013 zhang et al 1999 these virtues render fungi great potential in the application of pollutant removal in complicated scenarios gros et al 2014 owhonka and janet olufunmilayo 2020 for the bio production of methane fungi have also been demonstrated to be effective in enhancing the efficiency of anaerobic digestion of crude fibrous portion of corn stover rice straw mustafa et al 2016 shi et al 2019 waste activated sludge ma et al 2017 mannan et al 2005 organic wastes hom diaz et al 2016a and microalgae hom diaz et al 2016b interestingly these attempts were focused on static solid systems or pretreatment technology the investigation of the effect of fungi during wastewater treatment especially in continuous flow operation is however challenged by the easy loss of fungi and thus has rarely been reported in this work for the anaerobic wastewater treatment in both batch and continuous flow operation we propose the immobilization strategy of fungus and evaluate their influence on the bio production of methane aspergillus sydowii 8l 9 f02 was chosen as the test stain since aspergillus is one of the most studied mold groups and widely applied in industrial use or enzymes production mojsov 2016 the presence of fungi demonstrates exceptional improvement of methane production via a higher utilization of co2 moreover the effects of other factors including the variation of granular sludge properties the activity of different enzymes and the alternation of functional microbial community were also investigated we believe this study will help to better understand the synergetic interaction of fungi and anaerobic granular sludge during organic wastewater treatment further it will provide fundamental guidance to construct fungi mediated bioprocess for highly efficient production of ch4 simultaneously 2 materials and methods 2 1 fungus strain and culture conditions the fungus strain used in this study was aspergillus sydowii 8l 9 f02 accession no am883158 1 five 1 0 1 0 0 3 cm3 agar plugs were taken from the periphery of fungal colonies on potato dextrose agar medium pdam plates and then placed in a 500 ml conical flask containing 250 ml pdm pdam without agar the cultivation proceeded in a shaking chamber at 30 c and 150 rpm for 5 7 days the preparation of pdam followed 200 g potato dextrose agar was cut into small pieces and boiled with water for 30 min then filtrated and sterilized glucose and agar were then added to make the final concentrations of 15 20 g l 1 respectively mycelia as inoculum for the preparation of bead were collected from cultures by gauze filtration followed by centrifugation 12000 g 10 min and sterilization to make a fungus suspension 6 0 9 0 g wet weight inoculum was suspended in the 100 ml sterilized deionized water 2 2 preparation of aspergillus sydowii entrapping beads aebs modified dripping method was used to prepare aebs kim et al 2013 specifically a homogeneous mixture made of the above fungus suspension 3 4 w v sodium alginate solution and 6 9 w v polyvinyl alcohol pva was slowly added into the saturated solution of cacl2 boric acid to form beads with an average size of 3 mm to enhance their stability aebs were kept in the cacl2 boric acid for 2 h followed by immersing in 1 5 w v glutaraldehyde solution for 20 min afterwards aebs were rinsed with deionized water three times and stored in clean bench before use a parallel blank sample of beads without the addition of fungus suspension was prepared following the same procedures and is referred to as vacant beads 2 3 experimental set up and sludge inoculation three lab scale expanded granular sludge bed

up using 20 serum bottles 500ml for batch tests each conducted in five parallel experiments the four groups are b0 with only sludge inoculated b1 with sludge and 15 v vacant beads v seed sludge vacant beads b2 with sludge and 15 v aebs v seed sludge aebs b3 with the same amount of aebs as in b2 but without sludge the volume of the sludge inoculated in each bottle was about 150 ml which was obtained after starvation treatment as described above the initial cod concentrations were all 5000 mg l 1 and the other composition of synthetic wastewater was the same as above described in continuous mode all bottles were purged with he gas to remove the dissolved oxygen for 5 min and sealed immediately using a butyl rubber plug the bottles were placed in a shaking chamber at 32 1 c and 120 rpm for the reaction gas bags 500ml were used to collect biogas produced 2 6 morphology observation of aebs and anaerobic granular sludge scanning electron microscopy was used to determine the surface morphology features of aebs and granular sludge and that inside fungi aebs were dried with a vacuum dryer at 40 c for 48 h anaerobic granular sludge was fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c overnight and thoroughly washed twice with the 0 1 m phosphate buffer solution ph 7 0 followed by dehydration in a series of ethanol solutions 30 90 for 15 min each and 100 for 20 min twice afterwards ethanol was gradually substituted by iso amyl acetate with the volume ratio of 1 1 and 1 2 for 30 min and 15 min respectively and the granular sludge was stored in iso amyl acetate 100 overnight the granular sludge was dried with critical point drying quorum k850 uk both the aebs and granular sludge were gold coated and analyzed using an environmental scanning electron microscope fei quanta 250 feg usa at

heater oven and the detector were 80 80 and 200 c respectively 2 9 5 eem fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence measurements were conducted using a luminescence spectrometry f 7000 fl spectrophotometer hitachi japan in this study emission scans were performed from 250 to 550 nm at 5 nm increments with excitation wavelengths from 200 to 450 nm at 5 nm intervals the detector was set

nm emission cutoff filter was used in scanning to eliminate second order raleigh light scattering 2 9 6 the relative activity assays of enzyme protease activities were quantified based on the enzymatic release of tyrosine specific relative enzyme activity is expressed as enzymatic activity per gram of vss u g vss 1 coenzyme f420 determination was conducted according to heine dobbernack et al 1988 together with the determination of acetate kinase activity described in text s2 in si cellulase acetyl coa carboxylase ac coa and β glucosidase activities were tested using detection kits cl assay kit lacc assay kit and β glucuronidase assay kit jiancheng nanjing china and the operation and testing methods were in accordance with the instructions 2 9 7 analysis of microbial community 16s rdna of sludge samples collected from r0 r1 and r2 at day 0 day 45 and day 90 were extracted with mobio powersoilr dna isolation kit 12888 according to the manufacturer s instructions standard curves were constructed using a purified dna template that was amplified by conventional sequencing polymerase chain reaction pcr using the corresponding primers negative controls using water and positive controls using the corresponding cells were included for each assay the v3 and v4 region for pcr amplicon libraries were constructed by the illumina miseq platform pe300 ca usa the primers for pcr were as follows 515f gtgccagcmgccgcgg 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat for archaea and bacteria 2 10 statistical analyses independent sample t test was performed by ibm spss spss 19 0 and significant differences were indicated as follows p 0 05 p 0 001 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological observation and mechanical stability of aebs optical image in fig 1 a shows that the aebs are spherical with uniform size of ca 3 0 mm and slightly swell up on day 90 due to the sludge wrapping fig 1 a the sem images in fig 1 b and fig s1 a in si show the rugged and porous surface of both aeb and vacant bead with no observable difference in surface morphology at the beginning of the experiment however different kinds of microorganism gathered on the surfaces of aebs and vacant beads after 90 day operation fig 1 b and fig s1 a in si besides a lot of aspergillus sydowii 8l 9 f02 fungi are observed inside the aebs both at the beginning or the end of the long term operation fig 1 c c d and d but not observed inside vacant bead fig s1 b and b in si moreover one could not observe other fungi or bacteria inside aebs these results suggest that the immobilization strategy generated aebs with high density of aspergillus sydowii 8l 9 f02 fungi inside without being contaminated by other species the mechanical strength of aebs was determined to be 442 21 g before use at the end day 10 of the batch test negligible change was observed 439 16 g in continuous flow operation it declined to 331 19 g on day 90 by ca 25 only the mechanical strength of aebs after 90 days operation was much higher than other beads using alginate only zhang et al 2020 obviously the use of pva for the preparation of aebs is crucial for their excellent mechanical property lee et al 2016b probably because the pva mitigates the adverse effects due to the chelation of ca2 by po4 3 moreno garrido 2008 3 2 effects of aebs on methanogenesis in batch experiments fig 2 a shows the cumulative methane yield in static batch experiments showing the order of the amount of generated methane following b2 b0 b1 b3 0 the dashed lines represent the data fitting to modified gompertz equation eq 1 with the fitting parameters including maximum methane yield potential p methane production rate rm and lag phase time λ summarized in table s2 in si the fact that b3 of pure aebs does not generate methane suggest that aspergillus sydowii 8l 9 f02 fungi are not able to metabolize cod to produce methane in the absence of sludge b1 produces slightly less methane with longer lag phase time than b0 probably because of the moderate deterioration of the structure of the sludge due to the addition of vacant beads zhang et al 2020 interestingly one could see a significant ca 1 5 fold improvement of the methane production in b2 compared to b0 note that the extent of such improvement due to the addition of fungi is large enough to be comparable to those 1 8 0 3 fold using diet strategy ren et al 2019 one might also notice that the value of λ is slightly increased in b2 implying that longer period is needed for the adaption of the sludge the composition of carbon compounds including the generated biogas in 10 days in the four systems is illustrated in fig 2 b and summarized in table s3 in si b0 produces 29 6 ch4 41 8 co2 and 9 02 biomass intermediates using b0 as comparison b1 produces slightly less ch4 23 8 p 0 001 and more co2 45 7 p 0 05 while b2 generates more ch4 39 3 p 0 001 and less co2 35 9 p 0 05 besides b3 does not produce methane but generates a small amount of co2 5 09 p 0 001 which might promote co2 reduction methanogens it was also informative to see that the fraction of biomass intermediates in b2 increases to 12 0 possibly promoting microbial aggregation or granulation in comparison to b0 furthermore the ch4 production yield followed the order of b2 b0 b1 while that of co2 was the opposite fig s2 in si based on these results it is supposed that the addition of fungi might promote the conversion of co2 to ch4 in hydrotrophic methanogenesis pathway or strengthen the aceticlastic methanogenesis pathway both of which would enhance the overall methane production show and lee 2017 the composition of the eps from b0 b1 and b2 were also analyzed and are presented in fig s3 in si as observed the concentrations of eps components protein pn and polysaccharide ps in b2 are higher than that in b0 the exceptional higher pn concentration 5 times implies a significant enrichment of microbial extracellular enzymes in b2 meanwhile the higher pn content might also contribute to the increase of the microbial extracellular activity and the promotion of the microbial aggregation basuvaraj et al 2015 3 3 effects of aebs on methanogenesis in continuous flow operation the investigation of the effects of aebs on methanogenesis was also carried out in continuous flow with r0 r1 and r2 operated for 90days under the same conditions the performance of egsb reactors was evaluated from the following four perspectives including removal of cod variation of vfa production of ch4 and composition of biogas results are shown in fig 3 3 3 1 removal of cod fig 3 a shows the removal efficiency of cod in the three systems in the initial adaption period day 0 10 the removal of cod is difficult to quantify as the variation of parallel experiments is large at day 10 the removal efficiency of cod in all three reactors stabilizes between 80 86 as the step increase of olr from 2 0 to 5 0 kg m 3 d 1 day 11 62 the evolution profiles of cod removal of the three systems were almost identical well above 80 while the cod removal in r0 and r1 were always slightly lower ca 3 than that of r2 further increase of olr to 10 0 kg m 3 d 1 day 63 66 resulted in a sudden reduction of the cod removal to 54 6 for r0 and 55 8 for r1 but only a slight decrease to 81 3 for r2 in the last period of day 67 90 the olr was reduced to 7 1 kg m 3 d 1 for all the reactors r0 and r1 experienced recovery of cod removal back to ca 88 over three weeks while r2 only took one week for the recovery to above 90 all the above results highlighted the robust performance of r2 in response to the increase of olr probably attributing to the high tolerance of fungi to organic substances 3 3 2 variation of vfas fig 3 b shows the concentrations of three typical vfas i e formate acetate and propionate which were determined every ten days during the 90 days operation acetate was the major product in all three systems meanwhile the total vfas concentration followed the order of r1 r0 r2 which is consistent with the order for the cod removal in fig 3 a a sudden increase of the vfas by ca 1 8 2 1 fold was observed in all three systems when the olr was increased to 5 0 kg m 3 d 1 on day 37 causing a slight reduction of cod removal rate fig 3 a the later gradual decline of vfas in day 63 66 was observed in all three reactors presumably because of the gradual adaption of the microorganisms to the increase of olr the fact that r2 exhibited the lowest vfas concentration suggest that the addition of aebs enhances the conversion of vfas to co2 or ch4 note that the concentrations of vfas in all three systems are generally lower than that could inhibit syntrophic microbes wang et al 2019a 3 3 3 production of methane and the composition of biogas the production of methane and the corresponding composition of the generated biogas are illustrated in fig 3 c and 3 d fig 3 c shows that r2 needs 8 days to reach the same level of methane production as r0 confirming that the addition of aebs increases the lag phase time as shown in section 3 2 later throughout the whole period the increase of olr effectively improved the methane production in all three systems meanwhile the methane production of r2 was always higher than that of r0 and close to that of r1 compared to r0 r2 produced 14 7 more methane in the period of day 11 57 and 20 3 more methane in the period of day 60 89 such improvement is similar to those using diet strategies lee et al 2016a liu et al 2020a tian et al 2017 apparently the addition of aebs enhanced the production of methane which is especially effective when the olr is increased fig 3 d shows that in the generated biogas the average fraction of methane during day 11 90 in r2 was 70 9 higher than that in r0 63 6 and r1 60 7 meanwhile the average fraction of co2 in r2 is 24 4 lower than that in r0 31 9 and r1 34 9 the improvement of the ch4 production rate might be associated to the change of granular properties of anaerobic sludge and or the enrichment of aceticlastic methanogenst in the presence of aebs rotaru et al 2014 as further verified in section 3 4 and 3 6 3 4 effects of aebs on eps as a start to evaluate the effects of aebs on eps the size of particles of the sludge in three continuous systems was examined results in fig s4 in si show that the size increased gradually as the anaerobic digestion proceeded in all three systems with the order of the increment of size following r2 r0 r1 r1 exhibited the least increase of particle size probably because the addition of vacant beads did not facilitate bio aggregates but rather might collide with granular sludge under shear force in water kim et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 although the collision effects might also be present in r2 with the added aebs the aebs was supposed to greatly accelerate the formation of bio aggregates resulting in a significant increase of the particle size these change of particle size in sludge should imply the change of eps composition fig 4 shows the composition of eps represented by five regions of the fluorescence spectra of s eps and b eps in r0 and r2 five region division is detailed in table s4 in si as referred to the literature wang et al 2019b as seen in fig 4 fluorescence response of four major components i e tyrosine like substance tryptophan like proteins humic acid like substances soluble microbial byproduct like substances all increased as anaerobic digestion proceeded especially in b eps for all signals the intensity in r2 was always stronger than that in r0 during the whole reaction day 45 and 90 of particular interest is the signal in the region of 289 294 378 383 nm which could be ascribed to the signal of aromatic amino acid e g tryptophan associated to protein like substances chen et al 2003 reached the maximum at day 90 in r2 while remained almost unchanged in r0 these results suggest that the addition of aebs stimulated the synthesis and secretion of all these substances further the relationship between the increase of these substances in eps and the improvement of methane production was concerned on one side eps contains extracellular enzymes that are required by bacteria to digest high molecular weight compounds the increase of eps favored the enhanced retention accumulation and stabilization of associated ecto enzymes for substrate degradation cadoret et al 2002 on the other side the increase of eps content and the larger particle size are beneficial to the enrichment of strict anaerobic microorganism such as methanogens katayama and kamagata 2017 3 5 the response of enzyme activities in the presence of aebs to evaluate the response of enzyme activities in r0 r1 and r2 we examined six enzymes i e protease cellulase acetate kinase f420 ac coa and beta glucosidase β glucosidase which are key enzymes for hydrolysis acetate production and methane generation dolfing and mulder 1985 feng et al 2014 their activities are represented by specific relative activity as described in fig 5 in the beginning of the anaerobic digestion day 0 the activity of protease was not detected in all three systems as the digestion proceeded the activity of protease increased slightly to 0 03 0 04 u g vss 1 on day 45 and remained almost constant thereafter the activity of cellulase kept at a low level throughout the digestion in all three systems probably because of the lack of cellulose substrate with respect to acetate kinase and β glucosidase their activities in three systems experienced an increase first because of the increase of olr and then a slight decrease probably due to the accumulation of vfas for ac coa its activity was hardly detected in r0 and r1 but experienced a constant increase to a high level in r2 previous study has confirmed that ac coa could be linked to methanogenesis by some biologic router lieber et al 2014 which could contribute to the production of methane the response of f420 exhibited the highest activity in all three systems and f420 in r2 demonstrated higher activity than that in r0 and r1 the activity of coenzyme f420 has been reported to be well connected to the potential methanogenic activity delafontaine et al 1979 3 6 response of microbial community to the addition of aebs it is then naturally necessary to investigate the composition alteration of genera that is enriched in each system at the end of the operation using illumina masiq high throughput sequencing the alpha diversity indexes are shown in table s5 in si including chao coverage shannon and simpson index which reflected community richness coverage and diversity respectively these results indicate that the additional of aebs significantly decreased the richness and diversity of the microbial community but strengthened the stabilization of abundant microbes in r2 fig 6 shows the top ten predominant compositions of microbes on genus level on day 90 one could not observe significant difference of coupons between r0 and r1 for the main compositions with the main genera as methanosaeta smithella norank c anaerolineae norank p aegiribacteria norank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 and methanobacterium the high abundance of smithella 17 3 in r0 and 19 3 in r1 might be caused by propionate acclimation derived inoculation sludge liu et al 1999 the integrated anaerobic digestion processes of r0 and r1 are proposed to proceed in cooperation of these genera norank c anaerolineae belongs to fermentative bacteria and utilizes sugars and proteinaceous compounds yamada and sekiguchi 2018 orank f bacteroidetes vadinha17 and norank p aegiribacteria play significant roles in hydrolytic acidification to provide nutrients for methanogens liu et al 2017 si et al 2016 and methanosaeta and methanobacterium are involved in synthesis of methane with respect to r2 with the addition of aebs the composition of microbial community on genus level experienced an obvious shift compared to r0 the abundance of methanosaeta of r2 reached 48 3 which was 2 2 fold of that in r0 methanosaeta are classical methanogens accounting for over 90 of the 16s rrna sequences recovered from methanogens smith and ingram smith 2007 methanosaeta are able to convert acetate to methane morita et al 2011 recent studies have shown that methanosaeta are also capable for direct interspecies electron transfer rotaru et al 2014 under the conditions that the cells are in direct contact with cooperators through bioelectrical connections in this study methanosaeta are involved in the anaerobic digestion process and could accept electrons from co2 to form methane resulting in a lower co2 and higher methane in r2 than in r0 and r1 section 3 3 3 the abundance of methanobacterium in r2 was 19 1 much higher than the 6 6 in r0 and 13 8 r1 methanobacterium are hydrogenotrophic methanogens and its enrichment in r2 suggested that the addition of aebs promoted the production of methane via the reaction of h2 and co2 the abundance of caldisericum in r2 was 14 7 but almost un detectable in r0 and r1 we postulate that the caldisericum as dominant exoelectrogens should be the signal genus for the stimulation of fungi which could favor the production of formate and acetate probst et al 2017 and moreover possessed genes that potentially code for type iv conductive pilin like filaments similar to those in geobacter for electron transfer liu et al 2020b lovley 2011 caldisericum also possesses the ability to transfer electrons across the cell membrane to an extracellular electron acceptor mori et al 2009 we thus suspect that caldisericum play a crucial role in electron transfer during anaerobic digestion in the r2 system while the addition of fungi promotes the enrichment of caldisericum thus a different pathway was proposed for the production of methane in r2 blvii28 wastewater sludge group 5 8 participated in the removal of cod wang et al 2020 caldisericum were responsible for the formation of formate and acetate and electron transfer methanobacterium was involved in the formation of methane via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis whereas methanosaeta favored the production of methane via aceticlastic methanogenesis or direct interspecies electron transfer 3 7 discussion on the fungi based enhancement mechanisms and perspectives our results clearly demonstrate that fungi make great contribution to the enhancement of methane production in the anaerobic digestion of wastewater a key technique used in this study is the immobilization of fungi inside aebs facilitating the secretion of eps and the aggregation of granular sludge in consequence this system generates significantly more ecto enzymes that result in higher removal of cod and conversion of vfas the presence of fungi also largely stimulates the enrichment of methanogens methanosaeta and methanobacterium which even become dominant genera of all the microorganisms to favor a remarkable improvement of the methane production we have to address that the current study is a tentative yet preliminary exploration of the effects of fungi on the methane production in anaerobic digestion of wastewater further study is still required on but not limited to the following aspects 1 the unclear intracellular transcription pathway particularly based on proteomic 2 the long term effect of fungi inoculated beads in complex water matrix particularly in real wastewater 3 further optimization of fungi types for enhanced ch4 production 4 conclusions in this study we proposed a strategy to optimize the microbial community via the addition of fungi aspergillus sydowii 8l 9 f02 for improvement of methane production in anaerobic digestion of wastewater the fungi were immobilized inside millimeter sized porous beads composed by sodium alginate and pva to facilitate long term operation in both batch and continuous modes as observed fungi stimulated the change to the composition of microbial community bringing in the enrichment of methanosaeta and methanobacterium for methanogenesis and simultaneous improvement of the activity of enzyme f420 meanwhile the presence of fungi also increased the content of eps to facilitate the formation of bio aggregates such changes make significant difference to the third stage of the anaerobic digestion i e methanogenesis to achieving high production efficiency of ch4 this study might shed new light on how to improve the microbial community via the addition of fungi for water treatment as well as purposes declaration of

17298,reusing produced water pw as the subsequent hydraulic fracturing fluid is currently the most economical and dominant practice in the shale oil and gas industry however high ca2 present in pw needs to be removed prior to reuse to minimize the potential for well clogging and formation damage in this study the microbially induced calcite precipitation micp as an emerging biomineralization technique mediated by ureolytic bacteria was employed to remove ca2 and toxic contaminants from hypersaline pw for the first time batch and continuous studies demonstrated the feasibility of micp for ca2 removal from hypersaline pw under low urea and nutrient conditions throughout the continuous biofiltration operation with biochar as the media high removal efficiencies of ca2 96 organic contaminants 100 and heavy metals 100 for as cd mn and ni 92 2 for ba 94 2 for sr were achieved when pw co treated with synthetic domestic wastewater sdw under the condition of pw sdw 1 1 urea 4 g l metagenomic sequencing analysis showed that a stable ureolytic bacterial consortium containing sporosarcina and arthrobacter at the genus level was constructed in the continuous biofiltration system under hypersaline conditions which may play a crucial role during the biomineralization process moreover the combination of the micp and ammonium recovery could significantly reduce the acute toxicity of pw towards vibrio fischeri by 72 this research provides a novel insight into the biomineralization of ca2 and heavy metals from hypersaline pw through the micp technique considering the low cost and excellent treatment performance the proposed process has the potential to be used for both hydraulic fracturing reuse and desalination pretreatment on a large scale graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords produced water micp ureolytic bacteria biomineralization heavy metals calcium 1 introduction the success in shale oil and gas extraction has significant economic impacts for the united states still there is an increasing public concern about the large quantities of produced water pw generated during the hydraulic fracturing process and oil and gas production kondash and vengosh 2015 scanlon et al 2020 pw is generated continuously throughout the life of the well and contains high levels of total dissolved solids tds up to 400 g l organic compounds suspended solids heavy metals and naturally occurring radioactive materials shaffer et al 2013 thiel 2014 wang et al 2019 thus the management of pw has become one of the most challenging issues for the shale oil and gas industry reuse of pw for hydraulic fracturing operations seems to be the best option since it can simultaneously reduce the water footprint of hydraulic fracturing and address environmental and geological issues related to the deep well injection the main water constituents receiving concerns for the reuse of pw are the agents causing scaling plugging and fouling acharya et al 2011 it should be noted that various divalent cations e g ca2 mg2 ba2 sr2 can form stable scale deposits e g caco3 mgco3 caso4 in the wellbore when reusing pw for hydraulic fracturing operations thereby limiting the efficiency of friction reducers accelerating corrosion rate in the reservoir and even blocking pipelines and wells chang et al 2019b which pose a significant threat to safe shale oil and gas production among those divalent cations ca2 is generally present at the highest concentration in pw up to 43 g l shih et al 2015 therefore the removal of ca2 is in urgent need to minimize the potential for formation damage and well clogging when reusing pw for hydraulic fracturing meanwhile ca2 removal is also crucial as a pretreatment for desalination processes if the beneficial reuse extends outside the energy sector to date various physical and chemical methods such as chemical precipitation hu et al 2020b adsorption chang et al 2017 coagulation electrocoagulation shang et al 2019 and membrane separation chang et al 2019b have been successfully used for ca2 removal from different wastewaters however these conventional methods have several drawbacks including relatively high treatment cost and energy consumption the use of corrosive chemicals and a further increase of pw salinity for instance previous studies hu et al 2020b wu et al 2018 employed a chemical pretreatment method to remove ca2 from landfill leachate and produced water by large amounts of na2co3 resulting in high treatment cost and a further increase of soluble salts in contrast biological treatments for ca2 removal such as biomineralization or bioremediation have received increased attention due to their low cost limited use of chemical additives high removal efficiency of targeted pollutants and potential for large scale applications arias et al 2019 arias et al 2017 arias et al 2020 hammes et al 2003 microbially induced calcite precipitation micp as an emerging biomineralization technique mediated by ureolytic bacteria has been extensively studied on environmental and geotechnical applications including soil remediation soil improvement co2 sequestration and concrete crack remediation restoration chen and achal 2019 krajewska 2018 zhu et al 2016 the biomineralization process via micp occurs through a ureolytic pathway conducted by necessary urease present in ureolytic bacteria during the biomineralization process nh4 and co3 2 are generated through the hydrolysis of urea via the urease secreted by ureolytic bacteria after which co3 2 can further precipitate with ca2 to form caco3 crystals on the cell surface of ureolytic bacteria krajewska 2018 yin et al 2020 thus the biomineralization process via micp may be considered a promising biotechnique for ca2 removal from pw in addition the micp has been widely regarded as an effective in situ remediation technique for the immobilization of heavy metals in contaminated soils chen and achal 2019 duarte nass et al 2020 thus the biomineralization process via micp may also potentially immobilize heavy metal ions in hypersaline pw to date research applying the micp technique for wastewater treatment is very limited one of the first successful applications was conducted by hammes et al 2003 who investigated the feasibility of urease based micp for ca2 removal from calcium rich industrial wastewater initial ca2 concentration of 489 39 mg l and found that more than 90 ca2 could be removed during the biomineralization process via micp arias et al demonstrated the feasibility of ca2 removal from seawater through the biomineralization process arias et al 2017 arias et al 2020 however pw usually has an extremely high salinity up to 10 times higher than seawater shaffer et al 2013 thiel 2014 which may cause complex challenges for the biomineralization process therefore the feasibility of ca2 and heavy metals removal from hypersaline pw via micp should be investigated due to the unique characteristics of pw in this paper a ureolytic bacterial consortium acclimated from activated sludge was employed to biomineralize ca2 and heavy metals from hypersaline pw through the micp technique for the first time first batch experiments were conducted to investigate the feasibility of the biomineralization process via micp for ca2 removal in pw then a continuous biofiltration system was developed to study the effect of initial urea and nutrient concentrations on the long term treatment performance in hypersaline pw to further reduce the capital cost the co treatment of hypersaline pw and domestic wastewater in the continuous biofiltration system was proposed subsequently domestic wastewater can not only provide carbon and energy source for ureolytic bacteria instead of extra nutrient addition but also lower the possible adverse effect of high salt stress on the biomineralization process performance during the biomineralization process the fates of organic contaminants heavy metals and microbial community structures in the biofiltration system and pw were also studied owing to high ammonium concentration in the effluent from the continuous biofiltration system a diffused aeration stripping and scrubbing system was used to remove and recover ammonium from the effluent 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the raw pw samples used in this study were collected from a deep well disposal site in the permian basin jal new mexico which had ph 7 35 and total dissolved solids tds concentration of 129 3 g l the major components of pw included sodium 44 200 mg l chloride 65 800 mg l calcium 4779 4 mg l magnesium 763 9 mg l and ammonium 598 6 mg l the details on the main characteristics of raw pw samples were described in our previous study hu et al 2020b the wastewater activated sludge used as the inoculum of micp processes was collected from a domestic wastewater treatment plant located in el paso texas and stored at 4 c prior to use the biochar utilized for the continuous biofiltration system was produced by wood chips and obtained from wakefield agricultural carbon llc which had the ash content of 4 8 surface area of 369 1 m2 g and pore volume of 0 094 cm3 g lin et al 2017 rodriguez et al 2020 2 2 batch experiments 2 2 1 effect of pw salinity on biomineralization process to investigate the feasibility of micp for ca2 and mg2 removal from pw with different salinity the raw produced water was also diluted by four and two times to prepare the solution with low salinity 25 and 50 pw to enrich halotolerant ureolytic bacteria 2 ml activated sludge was used as inoculum and mixed with 150 ml of 25 50 and raw pw in 250 ml flasks respectively urea 20 g l and nutrient broth 3 g l were added to all flasks to induce the biomineralization process in pw zhu et al 2016 control experiments without urea were also performed all experiments were carried out for 10 days in a shaker at room temperature 20 c and a speed of 200 rpm during the biomineralization process the ph ammonium calcium and magnesium concentrations were continuously monitored at an interval of 24 h 2 2 2 effect of urea and nutrient on biomineralization process to study the effect of urea and nutrient concentrations on the performance of the biomineralization process via micp three batch experimental settings were designed at different salinity levels of pw 25 50 and raw pw for the first batch the effect of urea concentrations 2 5 5 and 10 g l and nutrient broth concentrations 1 and 2 g l were studied in 25 pw for the second batch with 50 pw the nutrient broth concentrations were the same as the first batch except the urea concentrations were different 5 10 and 20 g l for the last batch different urea 10 20 and 40 g l and 2 g l nutrient broth was dissolved in raw pw to evaluate the performance of the biomineralization process the higher urea concentrations were used in raw pw to ensure the adequate supply of co3 2 for calcite precipitation the remaining experimental procedures were conducted as previously mentioned in section 2 2 1 2 3 continuous biofiltration system development and operation 2 3 1 continuous biofiltration system set up a continuous biofiltration system fig s1 was set up to investigate the performance of the biomineralization process via micp in hypersaline pw due to its importance for industrial applications the biofilter was established in a cylindrical glass column with an internal diameter of 2 5 cm and a height of 20 cm biochar was used as filter media with 15 cm bed depth because of its unique surface chemistry properties and high specific surface area ahmad et al 2014 which is ideal for biofilm development and accumulation to enrich the halotolerant ureolytic bacteria 5 ml activated sludge was used as inoculum and mixed with biochar media pw containing urea and nutrient broth was used as feed water during the operation all columns were operated in a continuous mode at room temperature 20 c with the empty bed contact time of 180 min flow velocity of 0 41 ml min similar to batch experiments three experimental settings were designed at different pw salinity levels to assess the effect of initial urea and nutrient concentrations on the performance of the continuous biofiltration system via micp which included i 25 pw with urea 0 5 2 5 g l and nutrient broth 0 1 0 25 g l ii 50 pw with urea 2 5 5 g l and nutrient broth 0 1 0 25 g l and iii raw pw with urea 8 10 g l and nutrient broth 0 5 1 g l for the continuous biofiltration operation the effluent was collected every 12 hours to measure ph ammonium calcium magnesium and heavy metal concentrations 2 3 2 co treatment with domestic wastewater the micp technique is still considered expensive for large scale applications due to the high cost nutrient medium and freshwater consumption in the dilution process therefore co treatment of pw and domestic wastewater in the continuous biofiltration system was performed to evaluate the biomineralization performance mixing pw with domestic wastewater can not only provide a carbon source for ureolytic bacteria but also lower the possible adverse effect of high salt stress on the biomineralization process the synthetic domestic wastewater sdw used in this study contained per liter di water 1078 mg naac 3h2o 500 mg l cod 200 mg nh4cl 50 mg l nh4 n 16 mg nah2po4 4 mg l po4 3 p 74 mg mgcl2 6h2o 10 mg cacl2 and 1 ml trace elements as described previously liu et al 2013 to achieve the maximal mixing ratio of pw and sdw a series of experiments with different ratio pw sdw 1 3 with urea 2 g l pw sdw 1 1 with urea 4 g l and pw sdw 3 1 with urea 6 g l was conducted to assess the treatment performance similarly the higher urea concentrations were used for pw with high pw sdw ratio to ensure the adequate supply of co3 2 for calcite precipitation the mixed water was used as an influent for the continuous biofiltration system and all columns were operated continuously as described in section 2 3 1 2 4 microbial community analysis the raw pw treated pw and biochar from the top and bottom of the biofilters samples were taken at the end of the experiment for the microbial community analysis genomic dna gdna was extracted from raw and treated pw samples using dneasy powerwater kit qiagen germany according to the manufacturer s protocol while gdna was extracted from biochar samples using dneasy powersoil kit qiagen germany the next generation sequencing library preparations and illumina miseq sequencing were conducted at a commercial lab genewiz inc south plainfield nj to investigate the microbial community structure the sequencing library was prepared using a metavx 16s rdna library preparation kit the samples were sequenced using a 2 250 paired end pe configuration bioinformatics analysis was performed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime2 http qiime2 org pipeline according to previously described methods wang et al 2019 sequences were grouped into operational taxonomic units otus using the clustering program vsearch v1 9 6 against the silva 119 database pre clustered at 97 sequence identity for the analysis of the microbial community taxonomic compositions 2 5 ammonium stripping and recovery ammonium generated in the biomineralization process could be an additional source of environmental contaminants meanwhile ammonium also plays a crucial role in fertilizer production and ammonium recovery could lead to better resource management to solve this problem an aerated stripping scrubbing system was employed to remove and recover ammonium from the effluent of the continuous biofiltration system as presented in fig s2 the effluent produced in section 2 3 2 was used as feed for the ammonium stripping and scrubbing system first the ph of pw initial ph around 8 2 was adjusted to 9 5 using 0 5m naoh which can facilitate the conversion of ammonium ions nh4 to the gaseous ammonia unionized ammonia nh3 jamaludin et al 2018 for the stripping unit 500 ml pw was placed in a 1 l working volume conical flask the airflow rate was set at 1 72 l min for 330 min to achieve an air to liquid ratio of nearly 1133 recommended previously jamaludin et al 2018 the liquid was stirred at 150 rpm to ensure the even distribution of air bubbles in pw the stripped nh3 was subsequently passed into a scrubbing unit for ammonium recovery in the scrubbing unit unionized ammonia was absorbed to form ammonium sulfate nh4 2so4 a valuable fertilizer in agriculture by using 1m h2so4 pw samples were taken from the stripping unit every 30 min to measure ammonium and ph while acid samples were taken from the scrubbing unit at the end of the experiments to the determine ammonium recovery rate 2 6 water quality analysis the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 were quantified by the titration method with edta following hach method 10253 and 8213 respectively the ammonium concentration of all samples was measured using the hach ammonia tntplus vial test kit hach method 10205 heavy metals and trace elements as ba cd fe mn ni zn sr were detected by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometer icp oes perkinelmer waltham ma the fluorescence excitation emission matrix f eem spectra were obtained using a spectrofluorometer aqualog uv 800 c horiba jobinyvon inc edison nj to characterize the fraction of organic contaminants in raw and treated pw samples five times dilution the acute toxicity of pw samples towards a marine luminescent bacterium vibrio fischeri was measured by a microtox model 500 analyzer azur environmental de according to the 81 9 screening test protocol as described previously hu et al 2020b 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch studies on biomineralization process in pw 3 1 1 evaluation of ca2 and mg2 biomineralization in pw with different salinity through micp fig 1 illustrates the variations of ca2 and mg2 removal efficiencies nh3 n concentrations and ph in pw with varying salinity levels 25 50 and raw pw during the bioassay it was observed that the ca2 removal efficiency in 25 and 50 pw rapidly increased until reaching the plateau around 96 and 78 respectively fig 1a meanwhile the nh3 n concentration in 25 and 50 pw significantly increased to 2140 mg l and 2695 mg l respectively fig 1c the high ca2 removal efficiencies in 25 and 50 pw with urea can be ascribed to urea hydrolysis by ureolytic bacteria which released co3 2 into the solution and then reacted with ca2 to generate caco3 precipitates hammes et al 2003 these results have also indicated that halotolerant ureolytic bacteria were enriched successfully in the hypersaline environment as shown in fig 1d the ph of 25 pw with urea progressively increased from 7 4 to around 9 0 until the reaction equilibrium state was reached which was positively correlated with the nh3 n concentration fig 1c the biomineralization process via micp in pw could be described by eqs 1 5 krajewska 2018 first ureolytic bacteria used urea to produce carbonic acid and ammonia urea hydrolysis eq 1 then ammonia turned into ammonium eq 2 releasing oh and leading to an increase in the micro environmental ph that was why a directly proportional relationship was observed between nh3 n concentration and ph in pw with urea fig 1c 1d hydroxide ions induced the formation of carbonate ions eqs 3 4 which further precipitate with ca2 present in pw to generate calcium carbonate crystals eq 5 1 co n h 2 2 2 h 2 o urease h 2 c o 3 2 n h 3 2 2 n h 3 2 h 2 o 2 nh 4 2 o h 3 h 2 c o 3 hco 3 h 4 hco 3 h 2 o h co 3 2 2 h 2 o 5 c a 2 co 3 2 cac o 3 on the other hand the relatively low mg2 removal efficiency around 32 and 22 in 25 pw and 50 pw respectively was achieved even though the urea supply was sufficient fig 1b which was consistent with the findings of arias et al 2017 who found that rhodococcus erythropolis could precipitate 95 ca2 decreased from 400 to 18 mg l and 8 mg2 decreased from 1258 to 1130 mg l from seawater when supplemented with 20 g l urea one possible reason is that the increase in the micro environmental ph favors the bonding of co3 2 to ca2 over mg2 krajewska 2018 in addition ca2 has a greater ionic selectivity than mg2 since ca2 is adsorbed more favorably than mg2 on the negatively charged cell surface of ureolytic bacteria silva castro et al 2013 however in this study ca2 concentration 4779 4 mg l in raw pw is much higher than mg2 concentration 763 9 mg l thus ca2 removal from pw seems more crucial than mg2 removal in order to minimize the scale formation for both hydraulic fracturing reuse and the subsequent desalination high ca2 removal efficiencies were obtained in 25 pw 96 and 50 pw 78 indicating that urease activity was at a relatively high level in both 25 and 50 pw arias et al 2017 these results are supported by the findings recorded previously arias et al 2019 arias et al 2020 which demonstrated the feasibility of applying the micp technique for biomineralization of ca2 and mg2 from seawater tds around 35g l by ureolytic bacteria arias et al 2017 reported that 95 ca2 and 8 mg2 in seawater could be precipitated by rhodococcus erythropolis halotolerant ureolytic bacteria isolated from atacama salar in contrast the ca2 removal efficiency was less than 13 in raw pw even though the supply of urea and nutrient was sufficient fig 1a the low ca2 removal may be attributed to the extreme salinity tds 129 3 g l in raw pw this result was supported by a previous study frankenberger jr and bingham 1982 which found that the urease activity was significantly negatively correlated with salinity in the soil kim and lee 2019 investigated the effect of salinity on the growth of bacteria strains during the micp process they found that the growth inhibition rates for l sphaericus and b megaterium could reach up to 20 24 when tds concentration was 50 g l high salinity impacts microbial biomass adversely via two primary mechanisms including osmotic effect and specific ion effect he et al 2017a yan et al 2015 in the current study sodium 44 2 g l and chloride 65 8 g l were the main contributors to the high salinity of raw pw which could reduce urease activity during the biomineralization process mainly because the osmotic stress results in drying and lysis of ureolytic bacterial cells these results were also consistent with the previous study al rashidi and al jabri 1990 which investigated the effect of different added salts on urease activity and found that the inhibition degree was decreased in the following order nacl cacl2 na2so4 however although the micp technique has shown great potential for ca2 removal in seawater arias et al 2017 arias et al 2020 the salinity of raw pw was approximately four times higher than that of seawater this could explain why low ca2 removal efficiency was obtained even though the supply of urea and nutrient was sufficient in raw pw in summary the high salinity of raw pw had an adverse effect on the biomineralization process whereas relatively high ca2 removal efficiencies were achieved in 25 and 50 pw 3 1 2 effect of urea and nutrient on biomineralization process urea concentration has been considered a crucial parameter affecting urease activity during the biomineralization process via micp hammes et al 2003 however high urea concentration used in micp will result in not only higher operation costs but also more generated ammonium which is one of the major environmental pollutants in the aquatic system ye et al 2018 thus it is essential to determine the minimum urea concentration while maximizing ca2 removal in hypersaline pw moreover the use of high nutrient concentration for ureolytic bacterial growth is another key factor contributing to operational costs omoregie et al 2019 for those reasons batch experiments were performed to determine the minimum urea and nutrient broth concentrations for adequate ca2 removal in pw under three different salinity levels 25 50 and raw pw fig 2 a and 2b show the variations of residual ca2 and nh3 n concentrations with different urea and nutrient broth nb conditions over 10 days of the 25 pw biomineralization process it is obvious that the residual ca2 concentration in 25 pw decreased markedly when the urea dosage increased from 2 5 g l to 5 g l fig 2a suggesting the urease activity could be improved with increasing urea addition during the biomineralization process however a further increase in the urea dosage only slightly induced the ca2 removal when the nutrient broth was 2 g l the ca2 removal efficiency was more than 80 when urea was greater than 5 g l over 10 days of the biomineralization process in 25 pw these results were consistent with the findings of li et al 2014 who found that the maximum urea degradation could be achieved when the urea concentration was in the range of 4 8 5 6 g l in addition fig 2a also shows that ca2 removal was enhanced with increasing nutrient broth concentration it was reported that cell walls of ureolytic bacteria possessed negatively charged functional groups and served as crystal nucleation sites to attract and bind calcium ions during the biomineralization process via micp krajewska 2018 thus higher nutrient concentration could promote the growth of ureolytic bacteria and increase the availability of crystal nucleation sites thereby facilitating the deposition and accumulation of ca2 ions for the precipitation as presented in fig 2c and 2d the variations of residual ca2 and nh3 n concentrations in 50 pw were similar to those in 25 pw the relatively high removal efficiency of ca2 59 8 78 2 was achieved when urea was greater than 10 g l moreover as mentioned above to minimize ammonium generation 10 g l urea 2 g l nutrient broth was determined as the optimal condition for the biomineralization process in 50 pw achieving an average ca2 removal of around 70 in contrast there were almost no changes in residual ca2 and nh3 n concentrations fig 2e and 2f and ph fig s3 in raw pw throughout the whole period of testing even though the supply of urea and nutrient was sufficient suggesting that urea hydrolysis by ureolytic bacteria did not occur in raw pw due to high salinity duarte nass et al 2020 3 2 continuous biofiltration system studies 3 2 1 effect of urea and nutrient on biomineralization process for 25 pw the operation of the continuous biofiltration system lasted for 35 days which is divided into seven phases phase i vii with varying urea 0 5 2 5 g l and nutrient broth nb 0 1 0 25 g l fig 3 a shows the influent and effluent ca2 and nh3 n concentrations in various operation phases the change of urea concentration did not significantly impact ca2 removal in the first two operation phases in phase i 2 5 g l urea 0 25 g l nb and ii 2 g l urea 0 25 g l nb the residual ca2 in the effluent was less than 70 mg l resulting in ca2 removal efficiency of 96 1 1 5 and 94 7 0 4 respectively correspondingly high nh3 n concentration in the effluent was observed in phase i 1250 mg l and ii 1050 mg l similar to current results high ca2 removal 100 was achieved in a fluidized bed bioreactor when immobilized beads of the halotolerant ureolytic strain bacillus subtilis ln8b were filled to treat seawater arias et al 2020 however the initial ca2 concentration in 25 pw 1195 mg l was much higher than that in seawater 415 mg l whereas the initial urea concentration in this study 2 g l was significantly less than that in previous studies 20 30 g l arias et al 2017 arias et al 2020 indicating that comparable ca2 removal efficiency could be achieved in pw under lower urea conditions when the urea concentration further decreased in phase iii v the residual ca2 in the effluent increased from 182 13 mg l in phase iii to 758 10 mg l in phase v however the effluent quality recovered after urea increased to 2 g l and nb decreased to 0 2 g l in phase vi while comparable ca2 removal efficiencies were obtained in the range of 93 7 95 5 when nb further decreased to 0 1 g l in phase vii the residual ca2 in the effluent increased and stabilized at 262 7 mg l suggesting that low nutrient concentration may slightly affect the growth of ureolytic bacteria omoregie et al 2019 as shown in fig 3b similar observations have been obtained in 50 pw throughout the continuous biofiltration system operation the residual ca2 in the effluent was maintained at a very low level in phase i ii which was in the range of 25 66 mg l from phase iii v the decreased urea addition from 3 5 to 2 5 g l resulted in an increase in effluent ca2 concentration from 302 17 mg l phase iii to 926 50 mg l phase v the residual ca2 in the effluent then decreased to around 50 mg l after urea increased to 4 g l and nb decreased to 0 2 g l in phase vi resulting in ca2 removal efficiency of 98 3 0 5 which was similar to the values observed in phase i and ii however the effluent ca2 concentration increased to 423 28 mg l when nb concentration further decreased to 0 1 g l in phase vii thus phase vi demonstrated the best performance to maximize ca2 removal and minimize ammonium generation in the continuous biofiltration system complete hydrolysis of 1 mol urea generates 1 mol carbonate ions duarte nass et al 2020 thus around 90 of urea hydrolyzed theoretically according to the ca2 removal in phase vi revealing that the urease activity still maintained at a high level under hypersaline condition tds 64 7 g l in 50 pw yang et al 2020 throughout the operation in raw pw the effluent ca2 concentration drastically increased at an early stage then stabilized at a relatively high level 2900 mg l at the later steady state due to the acclimation of ureolytic bacterial consortium to the high saline environment fig 3c however the extreme high salinity in raw pw tds 129 3 g l still impacted urease activities adversely and resulted in the overall lower ca2 removal during the biomineralization process on the other hand the ca2 removal in raw pw around 47 was much higher than that in batch studies 13 revealing the better treatment performance in the continuous biofiltration system it was reported that the porous biochar was ideal for biofilm development due to its hive structure and rough surface and characteristic adsorption property ahmad et al 2014 which can facilitate the retention and growth of ureolytic bacteria during the biomineralization process thus after a short term and efficient acclimation process a functional ureolytic bacterial consortium with more robust environmental adaptability may be established in the biofilter which could explain why the continuous biofiltration system resulted in better treatment performance than batch studies under lower urea and nutrient conditions 3 2 2 performance of co treatment with domestic wastewater to further reduce the cost for substrate urea and nutrient and pw dilution pw was co treated with synthetic domestic wastewater sdw to evaluate the treatment performance in the continuous biofiltration system fig 4 shows the influent and effluent ca2 and nh3 n concentrations in various operational phases with different mixing ratios of pw and sdw pw sdw 1 3 3 1 it was found that the residual ca2 in the effluent was maintained at a very low level 116 mg l in phase i pw sdw 3 1 and ii pw sdw 1 1 indicating a relatively stable and effective ca2 removal 94 through the treatment of the continuous biofiltration system however when the mixing ratio of two wastewaters further increased to 3 1 in phase iii the residual ca2 increased and gradually stabilized at around 1850 mg l resulting in lower ca2 removal efficiency of approximately 48 which was supported by the results obtained in section 3 2 1 as discussed previously salinity is an important influencing factor in controlling the treatment performance of the micp process the tds concentration increased from 64 7 g l to 97 1 g l when the mixing ratio of pw and sdw increased from 1 1 to 3 1 high salinity may inhibit the growth of ureolytic bacteria and lower the urease activity yang et al 2020 which could explain why a lower ca2 removal efficiency was achieved even though the urea supply was sufficient in phase iii thus pw sdw 1 1 has been determined as the maximal mixing ratio of two wastewaters in the continuous biofiltration system based on the high ca2 removal efficiency 96 in phase ii additionally human or animal urine may be used as an effective alternative to industrial urea for the micp process due to its high urea concentration karak and bhattacharyya 2011 however to prevent malodor and maximize the recovery of urea from fresh urine fresh urine has to be stabilized to prevent enzymatic urea hydrolysis prior to reusing it as the urea source for the micp process randall et al 2016 developed a novel approach for stabilizing fresh urine by adding calcium hydroxide which could effectively inhibit enzymatic urea hydrolysis and prevent urea loss in fresh urine thus future research using human or animal urine as a urea source is needed to reduce the treatment cost and energy consumption for the biomineralization process moreover backwashing is required for the continuous biofiltration system to mitigate clogging caused by precipitates and extend the lifetime of the biofilter column once the pores of the top layer are clogged the top layer of biochar needs to be scraped off cleaned and replaced 3 2 3 fate of organic contaminants and heavy metals during biomineralization to characterize and understand the fate of organic contaminants throughout the treatment of the continuous biofiltration system three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix f eem analysis was performed in the influent and effluent when pw was co treated with synthetic domestic wastewater pw sdw 1 1 urea 4 g l the f eem spectroscopy has been widely used as a semi quantitative examination technique for the dissolved organic matter dom presented in pw riley et al 2016 stoll et al 2015 wang et al 2019 which can provide relatively comprehensive information on most organics from complex mixtures in real time as shown in fig 5 the fluorescence peaks decreased remarkably throughout the treatment of the continuous biofiltration system two distinct peaks were observed in the influent fig 5a 1 a considerable peak with maximum fluorescence intensity at ex em 240nm 375nm zone ii and 2 a relatively weaker peak with maximum fluorescence intensity at ex em 280nm 350nm zone iv those two peaks correspond to aromatic proteins and microbial byproducts e g tyrosine substances respectively which have been identified as the primary fluorescent substances in the flowback and produced water previously freedman et al 2017 riley et al 2016 the f eem spectra from the effluent fig 5b indicate that all peaks were significantly reduced following the treatment of the continuous biofiltration system suggesting almost 100 removal of organic contaminants due to the adsorption and biodegradation freedman et al 2017 heavy metals are highly toxic and can limit reuse applications of treated pw including hydraulic fracturing irrigation aquifer storage and livestock watering he et al 2017b hu et al 2020a pan et al 2019a pan et al 2019b thus changes in heavy metal concentrations were examined throughout the treatment of the continuous biofiltration system pw sdw 1 1 urea 4 g l as presented in table 1 it was found that the continuous biofiltration system could reduce heavy metal concentrations considerably in this study the concentrations of as cd mn and ni in the influent were 0 546 0 006 0 2314 and 0 021 mg l respectively however these concentrations decreased to less than the method detection limit mdl in the effluent suggesting approximately 100 removal of those heavy metals moreover given the presence of barium ba in pw poses both environmental and operational problems to the oil and gas industries the ba concentration was also measured during biomineralization ba decreased from 0 537 mg l to 0 042 mg l throughout the treatment resulting in 92 2 removal these results were supported by several reported studies chen and achal 2019 duarte nass et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 which demonstrated that the micp process was an effective technique for the removal of heavy metals e g cu as ni cd pb from contaminated waters and soils during the biomineralization process heavy metal ions could merge into caco3 crystals by replacing ca2 inthe lattice or entering into the adjacent structure thereby transforming heavy metals from mobile species into stable minerals chen and achal 2019 zhu et al 2016 additionally the removal of strontium sr was investigated in this study previous studies found that sr was commonly existed in the flowback and produced water with a wide range of 16 4153 mg l thiel 2014 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 sr is a member of the alkaline earth metal family e g mg ca ba which can also cause scaling issues in possible reuse applications for pw zhang et al 2019 in addition its radioactive form 90sr is highly toxic achal et al 2012b thus there is also an urgent need for sr removal to prevent its possible long term adverse effects the concentration of sr was 342 0 mg l in raw pw which was much higher than other metal ions a high sr removal efficiency of 94 2 was achieved throughout the treatment this result was supported by the previous studies achal et al 2012b zhang et al 2019 which demonstrated that dissolved sr was easily precipitated in the form of strontianite srco3 in alkaline condition containing much co3 2 ions to further clarify the removal mechanism of heavy metals the biofiltration experiments without urea was conducted when pw was co treated with sdw as shown in table s1 there was almost no difference in heavy metal concentrations between the influent and effluent when treating pw without urea in the continuous biofiltration system however high removal efficiencies of heavy metals 100 for as cd mn and ni 92 2 for ba 94 2 for sr were achieved when treating pw with 4 g l urea suggesting that high heavy metal removal was mainly due to the urea hydrolysis during the biomineralization process carbonate ions produced from the urea hydrolysis process could react with heavy metal ions in pw and then formed carbonate precipitates 3 2 4 microbial community analysis fig 6 presents the taxonomic compositions phylum and genus levels of bacterial communities in raw pw treated pw effluent from phase ii in section 3 2 2 pw sdw 1 1 urea 4 g l and biofilter top and bottom samples at the phylum level fig 6a proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla in raw pw with the relative abundances of 58 8 and 14 2 respectively which were also generally detected as the abundant bacterial phyla in other flowback and produced waters chang et al 2019a huang et al 2020 wang et al 2019 proteobacteria remained the most dominant bacterial phylum in treated pw 61 7 and biofilter 45 2 and 47 9 for top and bottom respectively samples nevertheless the proportion of firmicutes significantly increased to 34 3 in pw after the treatment of the continuous biofiltration system the phylum firmicutes are generally associated with fermentative and anaerobic bacteria which have been proven to have the capability of degrading the petroleum hydrocarbons in pw wuchter et al 2013 moreover the abundance of actinobacteria in biofilter 9 9 15 3 was much higher than that in raw pw 1 2 this result was supported by the previous studies chen and achal 2019 chen and achal 2020 which found that the phylum actinobacteria played an essential role in urease production during the biomineralization process the microbial community structure in activated sludge was also analyzed fig s4 at the phylum level fig s4a bacteroidetes and wwe1 were the most abundant phyla in raw activated sludge with the relative abundances of 31 3 and 17 7 respectively at the genus level fig s4b w5 t78 and fervidobacterium were the most abundant genera in raw activated sludge with the relative abundances of 17 7 7 9 and 6 9 respectively which were quite different from those in raw pw treated pw and biofilter samples fig 6b lists the most abundant genera in raw pw treated pw and biofilter samples the most abundant genus of all samples was marinobacter 13 4 20 9 which has been widely detected in petroleum contaminated environments and regarded as an active polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs degrader in saline environments wang et al 2020 it was found that the genus idiomarina increased remarkably in the biofilter samples 5 7 9 2 compared to the raw pw 1 9 which was consistent with the previous study akyon et al 2015 idiomarina is comprised of halophiles which have been generally isolated from various marine saline environments e g hypersaline solar saltern choi and cho 2005 reported studies akyon et al 2015 hou et al 2004 have demonstrated that certain species of idiomarina could facilitate biofilm formation under hypersaline conditions through producing large amounts of extracellular polymeric substances thereby providing salinity protection for the biofilm surprisingly the proportions of sporosarcina 6 3 10 4 and arthrobacter 2 7 8 5 increased significantly in treated pw and biofilter while those genera were not observed in raw pw both have been demonstrated to play essential roles in the biomineralization process via micp previously chen and achal 2019 chen and achal 2020 yin et al 2020 the genus sporosarcina belongs to the phylum firmicutes and has been regarded as the most dominant genus in the ureolytic bacterial consortium duarte nass et al 2020 yin et al 2020 to date several species especially sporosarcina pasteurii of sporosarcina have been widely used in calcite precipitation for various purposes e g contaminated water and soil remediation soil stabilization and strengthening concrete crack remediation due to the high urease producing ability for instance jiang et al 2019 used ureolytic bacterium sporosarcina pasteurii for immobilizing pb in the aqueous solution and obtained high pb removal efficiencies 95 100 when the initial pb concentration was between 30 mm and 50 mm sporosarcina pasteurii has also been utilized to produce the bio cement and manufacture the bio brick successfully lambert and randall 2019 achal et al 2012a isolated sporosarcina ginsengisoli from as contaminated soil and demonstrated that sporosarcina ginsengisoli was a good candidate for the bioremediation of as in contaminated soils in addition several species of arthrobacter such as arthrobacter oxydans and arthrobacter creatinolyticus have been proven to be effective for the immobilization of heavy metals via the micp technique chen and achal 2019 chen and achal 2020 therefore our microbial community analysis results confirmed that a stable ureolytic bacterial consortium containing sporosarcina and arthrobacter at the genus level was constructed in the continuous biofiltration system under hypersaline conditions in addition to further confirm the potential adverse effect of high salinity on the treatment performance of the continuous biofiltration system bio community in the biofilter was evaluated under different salinity conditions fig s5 presents the taxonomic compositions phylum and genus levels of bacterial communities in biofilter top and bottom samples under different salinity conditions when pw co treated with synthetic domestic wastewater sdw as shown in fig s5b the proportion of sporosarcina significantly decreased from 6 3 9 0 to 1 3 2 7 in the biofilter when the mixing ratio of pw and sdw increased from 1 1 to 3 1 tds increased from 65 g l to 97 g l which was consistent with the results of calcium removal efficiency therefore these results further confirmed that the high salinity of pw reduced the abundance of ureolytic bacteria thereby adversely impacting the performance of the continuous biofiltration system 3 3 ammonium stripping and recovery fig s6 shows the variations of nh3 n concentration and ph in pw over 330 min in the stripping unit it was observed that the nh3 n concentration decreased significantly from 2069 to 205 mg l within the first 180 min while the ph steadily reduced from 9 5 to 8 1 on average the maximum nh3 n removal of 98 residual nh3 n 11 mg l in pw was achieved at the end of the test these results are consistent with the findings of tian et al 2019 who found that around 80 ammonium could be extracted from real source separated urine within the former 180 min and another 10 ammonium removal was achieved during the remaining 180 min for this study approximately 90 of nh3 n could be recovered as ammonium sulfate at the end of the acid scrubbing test which was slightly lower than the nh3 n removal efficiency of 98 indicating an 8 loss of ammonia to the atmosphere which was similar to jamaludin et al 2018 however higher ammonium recovery could be achieved with excellent mass transfer surface area in the scrubbing unit for the full scale design pradhan et al 2019 3 4 acute toxicity analysis microtox 81 9 screening test was employed to determine the acute toxicity of raw and treated pw towards vibrio fischeri prior to the test all pw samples were diluted to maintain a typical seawater salinity tds 35 g l since vibrio fischeri is a natural inhabitant of seawater as illustrated in fig 7 the bioluminescence inhibition level increased from 77 2 to 85 3 after biofiltration pw sdw 1 1 urea 4 g l indicating that the acute toxicity of biofilter effluent was slightly higher than that of influent enhanced toxicity might be attributed to the high ammonium concentration 2069 mg l in the effluent due to urea hydrolysis during the biomineralization process which was supported by the findings of yu et al 2014 who found that the acute toxicity towards vibrio fischeri was significantlyand positively correlated with ammonium concentration in pharmaceutical wastewaters as expected the bioluminescence inhibition level significantly decreased from 85 3 to 21 6 when ammonium stripping was applied to the effluent from the continuous biofiltration system resulting in a 72 toxicity reduction towards vibrio fischeri which further confirmed that ammonium was a major contributor to the acute toxicity in pw to identify the main components responsible for the acute toxicity in pw the acute toxicity of pw after ammonium stripping residual nh3 n 11 mg l and abiotic biochar filtration for organic removal residual toc 5 mg l were also measured it was found that both could lead to a decrease in the acute toxicity of pw towards vibrio fischeri suggesting that both ammonium and organic contaminants were responsible for the acute toxicity in pw although microtox assay using vibrio fischeri has been widely used as a sensitive method for the acute toxicity monitoring in pw hu et al 2020b future research in combination with analysis of chronic toxicity and developmental toxicity towards various organisms are needed to provide comprehensive information for the risk assessment of pw reuse applications 3 5 economic considerations a preliminary economic estimation for the biomineralization process was performed when pw co treated with sdw pw sdw 1 1 urea 4 g l to simplify the calculation the capital investment labor and maintenance costs were not considered in this assessment as shown in table s2 the total cost for the biomineralization process was 1 86 m3 pw based on urea and energy consumptions activated sludge and domestic wastewater were considered free this expense was 31 3 lower than our previous study 2 75 m3 pw when using na2co3 for ca2 removal in pw hu et al 2020b after the treatment of the biofiltration system 1 m3 of treated pw contains 2 07 kg nh3 n approximately 90 of which could be harvested as a valuable fertilizer nh4 2so4 using 7 24 kg h2so4 98 the economic assessment based on a theoretical calculation showed that the harvesting of nh3 n from 1 m3 treated pw can make a profit of 0 80 through the ammonium stripping and scrubbing system table s2 furthermore it is worth mentioning that the biofilter effluent may be further treated and reused for several possible applications such as hydraulic fracturing irrigation and rangeland restoration which lead to additional benefits therefore considering both treatment performances and environmental benefits the proposed technique could be an economically feasible process for hypersaline pw treatment however a feasibility study for a pilot scale or full scale treatment plant is required to support this statement since several other costs e g investment labor transportation maintenance interest need to be considered for the large scale application in the future 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated the feasibility of micp for the removal of ca2 and heavy metals from hypersaline pw under low urea and nutrient conditions it indicates that the biomineralization process via micp is an economically promising biotechnique for hypersaline pw treatment to simultaneously reduce the capital cost and diminish the potential adverse effect of high salinity the co treatment of pw and synthetic domestic wastewater sdw was suggested as the best option for the continuous biofiltration system operation high removal efficiencies of ca2 96 organic contaminants 100 and heavy metals 100 for as cd mn and ni 92 2 for ba 94 2 for sr were achieved at pw sdw 1 1 urea 4 g l the microbial community analysis revealed that a stable ureolytic bacterial consortium with stronger environmental adaptability was successfully constructed in the biofilter under hypersaline conditions which contained sporosarcina 6 3 9 and arthrobacter 6 1 8 5 at the genus level additionally toxic ammonium present in the effluent from the continuous biofiltration system could be recovered as a valuable fertilizer nh4 2so4 through the aerated stripping scrubbing system while significantly reducing the acute toxicity of pw towards vibrio fischeri by 72 therefore this study presents an effective and eco sustainable strategy for the biomineralization of ca2 and heavy metals from hypersaline pw which

17298,reusing produced water pw as the subsequent hydraulic fracturing fluid is currently the most economical and dominant practice in the shale oil and gas industry however high ca2 present in pw needs to be removed prior to reuse to minimize the potential for well clogging and formation damage in this study the microbially induced calcite precipitation micp as an emerging biomineralization technique mediated by ureolytic bacteria was employed to remove ca2 and toxic contaminants from hypersaline pw for the first time batch and continuous studies demonstrated the feasibility of micp for ca2 removal from hypersaline pw under low urea and nutrient conditions throughout the continuous biofiltration operation with biochar as the media high removal efficiencies of ca2 96 organic contaminants 100 and heavy metals 100 for as cd mn and ni 92 2 for ba 94 2 for sr were achieved when pw co treated with synthetic domestic wastewater sdw under the condition of pw sdw 1 1 urea 4 g l metagenomic sequencing analysis showed that a stable ureolytic bacterial consortium containing sporosarcina and arthrobacter at the genus level was constructed in the continuous biofiltration system under hypersaline conditions which may play a crucial role during the biomineralization process moreover the combination of the micp and ammonium recovery could significantly reduce the acute toxicity of pw towards vibrio fischeri by 72 this research provides a novel insight into the biomineralization of ca2 and heavy metals from hypersaline pw through the micp technique considering the low cost and excellent treatment performance the proposed process has the potential to be used for both hydraulic fracturing reuse and desalination pretreatment on a large scale graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords produced water micp ureolytic bacteria biomineralization heavy metals calcium 1 introduction the success in shale oil and gas extraction has significant economic impacts for the united states still there is an increasing public concern about the large quantities of produced water pw generated during the hydraulic fracturing process and oil and gas production kondash and vengosh 2015 scanlon et al 2020 pw is generated continuously throughout the life of the well and contains high levels of total dissolved solids tds up to 400 g l organic compounds suspended solids heavy metals and naturally occurring radioactive materials shaffer et al 2013 thiel 2014 wang et al 2019 thus the management of pw has become one of the most challenging issues for the shale oil and gas industry reuse of pw for hydraulic fracturing operations seems to be the best option since it can simultaneously reduce the water footprint of hydraulic fracturing and address environmental and geological issues related to the deep well injection the main water constituents receiving concerns for the reuse of pw are the agents causing scaling plugging and fouling acharya et al 2011 it should be noted that various divalent cations e g ca2 mg2 ba2 sr2 can form stable scale deposits e g caco3 mgco3 caso4 in the wellbore when reusing pw for hydraulic fracturing operations thereby limiting the efficiency of friction reducers accelerating corrosion rate in the reservoir and even blocking pipelines and wells chang et al 2019b which pose a significant threat to safe shale oil and gas production among those divalent cations ca2 is generally present at the highest concentration in pw up to 43 g l shih et al 2015 therefore the removal of ca2 is in urgent need to minimize the potential for formation damage and well clogging when reusing pw for hydraulic fracturing meanwhile ca2 removal is also crucial as a pretreatment for desalination processes if the beneficial reuse extends outside the energy sector to date various physical and chemical methods such as chemical precipitation hu et al 2020b adsorption chang et al 2017 coagulation electrocoagulation shang et al 2019 and membrane separation chang et al 2019b have been successfully used for ca2 removal from different wastewaters however these conventional methods have several drawbacks including relatively high treatment cost and energy consumption the use of corrosive chemicals and a further increase of pw salinity for instance previous studies hu et al 2020b wu et al 2018 employed a chemical pretreatment method to remove ca2 from landfill leachate and produced water by large amounts of na2co3 resulting in high treatment cost and a further increase of soluble salts in contrast biological treatments for ca2 removal such as biomineralization or bioremediation have received increased attention due to their low cost limited use of chemical additives high removal efficiency of targeted pollutants and potential for large scale applications arias et al 2019 arias et al 2017 arias et al 2020 hammes et al 2003 microbially induced calcite precipitation micp as an emerging biomineralization technique mediated by ureolytic bacteria has been extensively studied on environmental and geotechnical applications including soil remediation soil improvement co2 sequestration and concrete crack remediation restoration chen and achal 2019 krajewska 2018 zhu et al 2016 the biomineralization process via micp occurs through a ureolytic pathway conducted by necessary urease present in ureolytic bacteria during the biomineralization process nh4 and co3 2 are generated through the hydrolysis of urea via the urease secreted by ureolytic bacteria after which co3 2 can further precipitate with ca2 to form caco3 crystals on the cell surface of ureolytic bacteria krajewska 2018 yin et al 2020 thus the biomineralization process via micp may be considered a promising biotechnique for ca2 removal from pw in addition the micp has been widely regarded as an effective in situ remediation technique for the immobilization of heavy metals in contaminated soils chen and achal 2019 duarte nass et al 2020 thus the biomineralization process via micp may also potentially immobilize heavy metal ions in hypersaline pw to date research applying the micp technique for wastewater treatment is very limited one of the first successful applications was conducted by hammes et al 2003 who investigated the feasibility of urease based micp for ca2 removal from calcium rich industrial wastewater initial ca2 concentration of 489 39 mg l and found that more than 90 ca2 could be removed during the biomineralization process via micp arias et al demonstrated the feasibility of ca2 removal from seawater through the biomineralization process arias et al 2017 arias et al 2020 however pw usually has an extremely high salinity up to 10 times higher than seawater shaffer et al 2013 thiel 2014 which may cause complex challenges for the biomineralization process therefore the feasibility of ca2 and heavy metals removal from hypersaline pw via micp should be investigated due to the unique characteristics of pw in this paper a ureolytic bacterial consortium acclimated from activated sludge was employed to biomineralize ca2 and heavy metals from hypersaline pw through the micp technique for the first time first batch experiments were conducted to investigate the feasibility of the biomineralization process via micp for ca2 removal in pw then a continuous biofiltration system was developed to study the effect of initial urea and nutrient concentrations on the long term treatment performance in hypersaline pw to further reduce the capital cost the co treatment of hypersaline pw and domestic wastewater in the continuous biofiltration system was proposed subsequently domestic wastewater can not only provide carbon and energy source for ureolytic bacteria instead of extra nutrient addition but also lower the possible adverse effect of high salt stress on the biomineralization process performance during the biomineralization process the fates of organic contaminants heavy metals and microbial community structures in the biofiltration system and pw were also studied owing to high ammonium concentration in the effluent from the continuous biofiltration system a diffused aeration stripping and scrubbing system was used to remove and recover ammonium from the effluent 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the raw pw samples used in this study were collected from a deep well disposal site in the permian basin jal new mexico which had ph 7 35 and total dissolved solids tds concentration of 129 3 g l the major components of pw included sodium 44 200 mg l chloride 65 800 mg l calcium 4779 4 mg l magnesium 763 9 mg l and ammonium 598 6 mg l the details on the main characteristics of raw pw samples were described in our previous study hu et al 2020b the wastewater activated sludge used as the inoculum of micp processes was collected from a domestic wastewater treatment plant located in el paso texas and stored at 4 c prior to use the biochar utilized for the continuous biofiltration system was produced by wood chips and obtained from wakefield agricultural carbon llc which had the ash content of 4 8 surface area of 369 1 m2 g and pore volume of 0 094 cm3 g lin et al 2017 rodriguez et al 2020 2 2 batch experiments 2 2 1 effect of pw salinity on biomineralization process to investigate the feasibility of micp for ca2 and mg2 removal from pw with different salinity the raw produced water was also diluted by four and two times to prepare the solution with low salinity 25 and 50 pw to enrich halotolerant ureolytic bacteria 2 ml activated sludge was used as inoculum and mixed with 150 ml of 25 50 and raw pw in 250 ml flasks respectively urea 20 g l and nutrient broth 3 g l were added to all flasks to induce the biomineralization process in pw zhu et al 2016 control experiments without urea were also performed all experiments were carried out for 10 days in a shaker at room temperature 20 c and a speed of 200 rpm during the biomineralization process the ph ammonium calcium and magnesium concentrations were continuously monitored at an interval of 24 h 2 2 2 effect of urea and nutrient on biomineralization process to study the effect of urea and nutrient concentrations on the performance of the biomineralization process via micp three batch experimental settings were designed at different salinity levels of pw 25 50 and raw pw for the first batch the effect of urea concentrations 2 5 5 and 10 g l and nutrient broth concentrations 1 and 2 g l were studied in 25 pw for the second batch with 50 pw the nutrient broth concentrations were the same as the first batch except the urea concentrations were different 5 10 and 20 g l for the last batch different urea 10 20 and 40 g l and 2 g l nutrient broth was dissolved in raw pw to evaluate the performance of the biomineralization process the higher urea concentrations were used in raw pw to ensure the adequate supply of co3 2 for calcite precipitation the remaining experimental procedures were conducted as previously mentioned in section 2 2 1 2 3 continuous biofiltration system development and operation 2 3 1 continuous biofiltration system set up a continuous biofiltration system fig s1 was set up to investigate the performance of the biomineralization process via micp in hypersaline pw due to its importance for industrial applications the biofilter was established in a cylindrical glass column with an internal diameter of 2 5 cm and a height of 20 cm biochar was used as filter media with 15 cm bed depth because of its unique surface chemistry properties and high specific surface area ahmad et al 2014 which is ideal for biofilm development and accumulation to enrich the halotolerant ureolytic bacteria 5 ml activated sludge was used as inoculum and mixed with biochar media pw containing urea and nutrient broth was used as feed water during the operation all columns were operated in a continuous mode at room temperature 20 c with the empty bed contact time of 180 min flow velocity of 0 41 ml min similar to batch experiments three experimental settings were designed at different pw salinity levels to assess the effect of initial urea and nutrient concentrations on the performance of the continuous biofiltration system via micp which included i 25 pw with urea 0 5 2 5 g l and nutrient broth 0 1 0 25 g l ii 50 pw with urea 2 5 5 g l and nutrient broth 0 1 0 25 g l and iii raw pw with urea 8 10 g l and nutrient broth 0 5 1 g l for the continuous biofiltration operation the effluent was collected every 12 hours to measure ph ammonium calcium magnesium and heavy metal concentrations 2 3 2 co treatment with domestic wastewater the micp technique is still considered expensive for large scale applications due to the high cost nutrient medium and freshwater consumption in the dilution process therefore co treatment of pw and domestic wastewater in the continuous biofiltration system was performed to evaluate the biomineralization performance mixing pw with domestic wastewater can not only provide a carbon source for ureolytic bacteria but also lower the possible adverse effect of high salt stress on the biomineralization process the synthetic domestic wastewater sdw used in this study contained per liter di water 1078 mg naac 3h2o 500 mg l cod 200 mg nh4cl 50 mg l nh4 n 16 mg nah2po4 4 mg l po4 3 p 74 mg mgcl2 6h2o 10 mg cacl2 and 1 ml trace elements as described previously liu et al 2013 to achieve the maximal mixing ratio of pw and sdw a series of experiments with different ratio pw sdw 1 3 with urea 2 g l pw sdw 1 1 with urea 4 g l and pw sdw 3 1 with urea 6 g l was conducted to assess the treatment performance similarly the higher urea concentrations were used for pw with high pw sdw ratio to ensure the adequate supply of co3 2 for calcite precipitation the mixed water was used as an influent for the continuous biofiltration system and all columns were operated continuously as described in section 2 3 1 2 4 microbial community analysis the raw pw treated pw and biochar from the top and bottom of the biofilters samples were taken at the end of the experiment for the microbial community analysis genomic dna gdna was extracted from raw and treated pw samples using dneasy powerwater kit qiagen germany according to the manufacturer s protocol while gdna was extracted from biochar samples using dneasy powersoil kit qiagen germany the next generation sequencing library preparations and illumina miseq sequencing were conducted at a commercial lab genewiz inc south plainfield nj to investigate the microbial community structure the sequencing library was prepared using a metavx 16s rdna library preparation kit the samples were sequenced using a 2 250 paired end pe configuration bioinformatics analysis was performed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime2 http qiime2 org pipeline according to previously described methods wang et al 2019 sequences were grouped into operational taxonomic units otus using the clustering program vsearch v1 9 6 against the silva 119 database pre clustered at 97 sequence identity for the analysis of the microbial community taxonomic compositions 2 5 ammonium stripping and recovery ammonium generated in the biomineralization process could be an additional source of environmental contaminants meanwhile ammonium also plays a crucial role in fertilizer production and ammonium recovery could lead to better resource management to solve this problem an aerated stripping scrubbing system was employed to remove and recover ammonium from the effluent of the continuous biofiltration system as presented in fig s2 the effluent produced in section 2 3 2 was used as feed for the ammonium stripping and scrubbing system first the ph of pw initial ph around 8 2 was adjusted to 9 5 using 0 5m naoh which can facilitate the conversion of ammonium ions nh4 to the gaseous ammonia unionized ammonia nh3 jamaludin et al 2018 for the stripping unit 500 ml pw was placed in a 1 l working volume conical flask the airflow rate was set at 1 72 l min for 330 min to achieve an air to liquid ratio of nearly 1133 recommended previously jamaludin et al 2018 the liquid was stirred at 150 rpm to ensure the even distribution of air bubbles in pw the stripped nh3 was subsequently passed into a scrubbing unit for ammonium recovery in the scrubbing unit unionized ammonia was absorbed to form ammonium sulfate nh4 2so4 a valuable fertilizer in agriculture by using 1m h2so4 pw samples were taken from the stripping unit every 30 min to measure ammonium and ph while acid samples were taken from the scrubbing unit at the end of the experiments to the determine ammonium recovery rate 2 6 water quality analysis the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 were quantified by the titration method with edta following hach method 10253 and 8213 respectively the ammonium concentration of all samples was measured using the hach ammonia tntplus vial test kit hach method 10205 heavy metals and trace elements as ba cd fe mn ni zn sr were detected by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometer icp oes perkinelmer waltham ma the fluorescence excitation emission matrix f eem spectra were obtained using a spectrofluorometer aqualog uv 800 c horiba jobinyvon inc edison nj to characterize the fraction of organic contaminants in raw and treated pw samples five times dilution the acute toxicity of pw samples towards a marine luminescent bacterium vibrio fischeri was measured by a microtox model 500 analyzer azur environmental de according to the 81 9 screening test protocol as described previously hu et al 2020b 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch studies on biomineralization process in pw 3 1 1 evaluation of ca2 and mg2 biomineralization in pw with different salinity through micp fig 1 illustrates the variations of ca2 and mg2 removal efficiencies nh3 n concentrations and ph in pw with varying salinity levels 25 50 and raw pw during the bioassay it was observed that the ca2 removal efficiency in 25 and 50 pw rapidly increased until reaching the plateau around 96 and 78 respectively fig 1a meanwhile the nh3 n concentration in 25 and 50 pw significantly increased to 2140 mg l and 2695 mg l respectively fig 1c the high ca2 removal efficiencies in 25 and 50 pw with urea can be ascribed to urea hydrolysis by ureolytic bacteria which released co3 2 into the solution and then reacted with ca2 to generate caco3 precipitates hammes et al 2003 these results have also indicated that halotolerant ureolytic bacteria were enriched successfully in the hypersaline environment as shown in fig 1d the ph of 25 pw with urea progressively increased from 7 4 to around 9 0 until the reaction equilibrium state was reached which was positively correlated with the nh3 n concentration fig 1c the biomineralization process via micp in pw could be described by eqs 1 5 krajewska 2018 first ureolytic bacteria used urea to produce carbonic acid and ammonia urea hydrolysis eq 1 then ammonia turned into ammonium eq 2 releasing oh and leading to an increase in the micro environmental ph that was why a directly proportional relationship was observed between nh3 n concentration and ph in pw with urea fig 1c 1d hydroxide ions induced the formation of carbonate ions eqs 3 4 which further precipitate with ca2 present in pw to generate calcium carbonate crystals eq 5 1 co n h 2 2 2 h 2 o urease h 2 c o 3 2 n h 3 2 2 n h 3 2 h 2 o 2 nh 4 2 o h 3 h 2 c o 3 hco 3 h 4 hco 3 h 2 o h co 3 2 2 h 2 o 5 c a 2 co 3 2 cac o 3 on the other hand the relatively low mg2 removal efficiency around 32 and 22 in 25 pw and 50 pw respectively was achieved even though the urea supply was sufficient fig 1b which was consistent with the findings of arias et al 2017 who found that rhodococcus erythropolis could precipitate 95 ca2 decreased from 400 to 18 mg l and 8 mg2 decreased from 1258 to 1130 mg l from seawater when supplemented with 20 g l urea one possible reason is that the increase in the micro environmental ph favors the bonding of co3 2 to ca2 over mg2 krajewska 2018 in addition ca2 has a greater ionic selectivity than mg2 since ca2 is adsorbed more favorably than mg2 on the negatively charged cell surface of ureolytic bacteria silva castro et al 2013 however in this study ca2 concentration 4779 4 mg l in raw pw is much higher than mg2 concentration 763 9 mg l thus ca2 removal from pw seems more crucial than mg2 removal in order to minimize the scale formation for both hydraulic fracturing reuse and the subsequent desalination high ca2 removal efficiencies were obtained in 25 pw 96 and 50 pw 78 indicating that urease activity was at a relatively high level in both 25 and 50 pw arias et al 2017 these results are supported by the findings recorded previously arias et al 2019 arias et al 2020 which demonstrated the feasibility of applying the micp technique for biomineralization of ca2 and mg2 from seawater tds around 35g l by ureolytic bacteria arias et al 2017 reported that 95 ca2 and 8 mg2 in seawater could be precipitated by rhodococcus erythropolis halotolerant ureolytic bacteria isolated from atacama salar in contrast the ca2 removal efficiency was less than 13 in raw pw even though the supply of urea and nutrient was sufficient fig 1a the low ca2 removal may be attributed to the extreme salinity tds 129 3 g l in raw pw this result was supported by a previous study frankenberger jr and bingham 1982 which found that the urease activity was significantly negatively correlated with salinity in the soil kim and lee 2019 investigated the effect of salinity on the growth of bacteria strains during the micp process they found that the growth inhibition rates for l sphaericus and b megaterium could reach up to 20 24 when tds concentration was 50 g l high salinity impacts microbial biomass adversely via two primary mechanisms including osmotic effect and specific ion effect he et al 2017a yan et al 2015 in the current study sodium 44 2 g l and chloride 65 8 g l were the main contributors to the high salinity of raw pw which could reduce urease activity during the biomineralization process mainly because the osmotic stress results in drying and lysis of ureolytic bacterial cells these results were also consistent with the previous study al rashidi and al jabri 1990 which investigated the effect of different added salts on urease activity and found that the inhibition degree was decreased in the following order nacl cacl2 na2so4 however although the micp technique has shown great potential for ca2 removal in seawater arias et al 2017 arias et al 2020 the salinity of raw pw was approximately four times higher than that of seawater this could explain why low ca2 removal efficiency was obtained even though the supply of urea and nutrient was sufficient in raw pw in summary the high salinity of raw pw had an adverse effect on the biomineralization process whereas relatively high ca2 removal efficiencies were achieved in 25 and 50 pw 3 1 2 effect of urea and nutrient on biomineralization process urea concentration has been considered a crucial parameter affecting urease activity during the biomineralization process via micp hammes et al 2003 however high urea concentration used in micp will result in not only higher operation costs but also more generated ammonium which is one of the major environmental pollutants in the aquatic system ye et al 2018 thus it is essential to determine the minimum urea concentration while maximizing ca2 removal in hypersaline pw moreover the use of high nutrient concentration for ureolytic bacterial growth is another key factor contributing to operational costs omoregie et al 2019 for those reasons batch experiments were performed to determine the minimum urea and nutrient broth concentrations for adequate ca2 removal in pw under three different salinity levels 25 50 and raw pw fig 2 a and 2b show the variations of residual ca2 and nh3 n concentrations with different urea and nutrient broth nb conditions over 10 days of the 25 pw biomineralization process it is obvious that the residual ca2 concentration in 25 pw decreased markedly when the urea dosage increased from 2 5 g l to 5 g l fig 2a suggesting the urease activity could be improved with increasing urea addition during the biomineralization process however a further increase in the urea dosage only slightly induced the ca2 removal when the nutrient broth was 2 g l the ca2 removal efficiency was more than 80 when urea was greater than 5 g l over 10 days of the biomineralization process in 25 pw these results were consistent with the findings of li et al 2014 who found that the maximum urea degradation could be achieved when the urea concentration was in the range of 4 8 5 6 g l in addition fig 2a also shows that ca2 removal was enhanced with increasing nutrient broth concentration it was reported that cell walls of ureolytic bacteria possessed negatively charged functional groups and served as crystal nucleation sites to attract and bind calcium ions during the biomineralization process via micp krajewska 2018 thus higher nutrient concentration could promote the growth of ureolytic bacteria and increase the availability of crystal nucleation sites thereby facilitating the deposition and accumulation of ca2 ions for the precipitation as presented in fig 2c and 2d the variations of residual ca2 and nh3 n concentrations in 50 pw were similar to those in 25 pw the relatively high removal efficiency of ca2 59 8 78 2 was achieved when urea was greater than 10 g l moreover as mentioned above to minimize ammonium generation 10 g l urea 2 g l nutrient broth was determined as the optimal condition for the biomineralization process in 50 pw achieving an average ca2 removal of around 70 in contrast there were almost no changes in residual ca2 and nh3 n concentrations fig 2e and 2f and ph fig s3 in raw pw throughout the whole period of testing even though the supply of urea and nutrient was sufficient suggesting that urea hydrolysis by ureolytic bacteria did not occur in raw pw due to high salinity duarte nass et al 2020 3 2 continuous biofiltration system studies 3 2 1 effect of urea and nutrient on biomineralization process for 25 pw the operation of the continuous biofiltration system lasted for 35 days which is divided into seven phases phase i vii with varying urea 0 5 2 5 g l and nutrient broth nb 0 1 0 25 g l fig 3 a shows the influent and effluent ca2 and nh3 n concentrations in various operation phases the change of urea concentration did not significantly impact ca2 removal in the first two operation phases in phase i 2 5 g l urea 0 25 g l nb and ii 2 g l urea 0 25 g l nb the residual ca2 in the effluent was less than 70 mg l resulting in ca2 removal efficiency of 96 1 1 5 and 94 7 0 4 respectively correspondingly high nh3 n concentration in the effluent was observed in phase i 1250 mg l and ii 1050 mg l similar to current results high ca2 removal 100 was achieved in a fluidized bed bioreactor when immobilized beads of the halotolerant ureolytic strain bacillus subtilis ln8b were filled to treat seawater arias et al 2020 however the initial ca2 concentration in 25 pw 1195 mg l was much higher than that in seawater 415 mg l whereas the initial urea concentration in this study 2 g l was significantly less than that in previous studies 20 30 g l arias et al 2017 arias et al 2020 indicating that comparable ca2 removal efficiency could be achieved in pw under lower urea conditions when the urea concentration further decreased in phase iii v the residual ca2 in the effluent increased from 182 13 mg l in phase iii to 758 10 mg l in phase v however the effluent quality recovered after urea increased to 2 g l and nb decreased to 0 2 g l in phase vi while comparable ca2 removal efficiencies were obtained in the range of 93 7 95 5 when nb further decreased to 0 1 g l in phase vii the residual ca2 in the effluent increased and stabilized at 262 7 mg l suggesting that low nutrient concentration may slightly affect the growth of ureolytic bacteria omoregie et al 2019 as shown in fig 3b similar observations have been obtained in 50 pw throughout the continuous biofiltration system operation the residual ca2 in the effluent was maintained at a very low level in phase i ii which was in the range of 25 66 mg l from phase iii v the decreased urea addition from 3 5 to 2 5 g l resulted in an increase in effluent ca2 concentration from 302 17 mg l phase iii to 926 50 mg l phase v the residual ca2 in the effluent then decreased to around 50 mg l after urea increased to 4 g l and nb decreased to 0 2 g l in phase vi resulting in ca2 removal efficiency of 98 3 0 5 which was similar to the values observed in phase i and ii however the effluent ca2 concentration increased to 423 28 mg l when nb concentration further decreased to 0 1 g l in phase vii thus phase vi demonstrated the best performance to maximize ca2 removal and minimize ammonium generation in the continuous biofiltration system complete hydrolysis of 1 mol urea generates 1 mol carbonate ions duarte nass et al 2020 thus around 90 of urea hydrolyzed theoretically according to the ca2 removal in phase vi revealing that the urease activity still maintained at a high level under hypersaline condition tds 64 7 g l in 50 pw yang et al 2020 throughout the operation in raw pw the effluent ca2 concentration drastically increased at an early stage then stabilized at a relatively high level 2900 mg l at the later steady state due to the acclimation of ureolytic bacterial consortium to the high saline environment fig 3c however the extreme high salinity in raw pw tds 129 3 g l still impacted urease activities adversely and resulted in the overall lower ca2 removal during the biomineralization process on the other hand the ca2 removal in raw pw around 47 was much higher than that in batch studies 13 revealing the better treatment performance in the continuous biofiltration system it was reported that the porous biochar was ideal for biofilm development due to its hive structure and rough surface and characteristic adsorption property ahmad et al 2014 which can facilitate the retention and growth of ureolytic bacteria during the biomineralization process thus after a short term and efficient acclimation process a functional ureolytic bacterial consortium with more robust environmental adaptability may be established in the biofilter which could explain why the continuous biofiltration system resulted in better treatment performance than batch studies under lower urea and nutrient conditions 3 2 2 performance of co treatment with domestic wastewater to further reduce the cost for substrate urea and nutrient and pw dilution pw was co treated with synthetic domestic wastewater sdw to evaluate the treatment performance in the continuous biofiltration system fig 4 shows the influent and effluent ca2 and nh3 n concentrations in various operational phases with different mixing ratios of pw and sdw pw sdw 1 3 3 1 it was found that the residual ca2 in the effluent was maintained at a very low level 116 mg l in phase i pw sdw 3 1 and ii pw sdw 1 1 indicating a relatively stable and effective ca2 removal 94 through the treatment of the continuous biofiltration system however when the mixing ratio of two wastewaters further increased to 3 1 in phase iii the residual ca2 increased and gradually stabilized at around 1850 mg l resulting in lower ca2 removal efficiency of approximately 48 which was supported by the results obtained in section 3 2 1 as discussed previously salinity is an important influencing factor in controlling the treatment performance of the micp process the tds concentration increased from 64 7 g l to 97 1 g l when the mixing ratio of pw and sdw increased from 1 1 to 3 1 high salinity may inhibit the growth of ureolytic bacteria and lower the urease activity yang et al 2020 which could explain why a lower ca2 removal efficiency was achieved even though the urea supply was sufficient in phase iii thus pw sdw 1 1 has been determined as the maximal mixing ratio of two wastewaters in the continuous biofiltration system based on the high ca2 removal efficiency 96 in phase ii additionally human or animal urine may be used as an effective alternative to industrial urea for the micp process due to its high urea concentration karak and bhattacharyya 2011 however to prevent malodor and maximize the recovery of urea from fresh urine fresh urine has to be stabilized to prevent enzymatic urea hydrolysis prior to reusing it as the urea source for the micp process randall et al 2016 developed a novel approach for stabilizing fresh urine by adding calcium hydroxide which could effectively inhibit enzymatic urea hydrolysis and prevent urea loss in fresh urine thus future research using human or animal urine as a urea source is needed to reduce the treatment cost and energy consumption for the biomineralization process moreover backwashing is required for the continuous biofiltration system to mitigate clogging caused by precipitates and extend the lifetime of the biofilter column once the pores of the top layer are clogged the top layer of biochar needs to be scraped off cleaned and replaced 3 2 3 fate of organic contaminants and heavy metals during biomineralization to characterize and understand the fate of organic contaminants throughout the treatment of the continuous biofiltration system three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix f eem analysis was performed in the influent and effluent when pw was co treated with synthetic domestic wastewater pw sdw 1 1 urea 4 g l the f eem spectroscopy has been widely used as a semi quantitative examination technique for the dissolved organic matter dom presented in pw riley et al 2016 stoll et al 2015 wang et al 2019 which can provide relatively comprehensive information on most organics from complex mixtures in real time as shown in fig 5 the fluorescence peaks decreased remarkably throughout the treatment of the continuous biofiltration system two distinct peaks were observed in the influent fig 5a 1 a considerable peak with maximum fluorescence intensity at ex em 240nm 375nm zone ii and 2 a relatively weaker peak with maximum fluorescence intensity at ex em 280nm 350nm zone iv those two peaks correspond to aromatic proteins and microbial byproducts e g tyrosine substances respectively which have been identified as the primary fluorescent substances in the flowback and produced water previously freedman et al 2017 riley et al 2016 the f eem spectra from the effluent fig 5b indicate that all peaks were significantly reduced following the treatment of the continuous biofiltration system suggesting almost 100 removal of organic contaminants due to the adsorption and biodegradation freedman et al 2017 heavy metals are highly toxic and can limit reuse applications of treated pw including hydraulic fracturing irrigation aquifer storage and livestock watering he et al 2017b hu et al 2020a pan et al 2019a pan et al 2019b thus changes in heavy metal concentrations were examined throughout the treatment of the continuous biofiltration system pw sdw 1 1 urea 4 g l as presented in table 1 it was found that the continuous biofiltration system could reduce heavy metal concentrations considerably in this study the concentrations of as cd mn and ni in the influent were 0 546 0 006 0 2314 and 0 021 mg l respectively however these concentrations decreased to less than the method detection limit mdl in the effluent suggesting approximately 100 removal of those heavy metals moreover given the presence of barium ba in pw poses both environmental and operational problems to the oil and gas industries the ba concentration was also measured during biomineralization ba decreased from 0 537 mg l to 0 042 mg l throughout the treatment resulting in 92 2 removal these results were supported by several reported studies chen and achal 2019 duarte nass et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 which demonstrated that the micp process was an effective technique for the removal of heavy metals e g cu as ni cd pb from contaminated waters and soils during the biomineralization process heavy metal ions could merge into caco3 crystals by replacing ca2 inthe lattice or entering into the adjacent structure thereby transforming heavy metals from mobile species into stable minerals chen and achal 2019 zhu et al 2016 additionally the removal of strontium sr was investigated in this study previous studies found that sr was commonly existed in the flowback and produced water with a wide range of 16 4153 mg l thiel 2014 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 sr is a member of the alkaline earth metal family e g mg ca ba which can also cause scaling issues in possible reuse applications for pw zhang et al 2019 in addition its radioactive form 90sr is highly toxic achal et al 2012b thus there is also an urgent need for sr removal to prevent its possible long term adverse effects the concentration of sr was 342 0 mg l in raw pw which was much higher than other metal ions a high sr removal efficiency of 94 2 was achieved throughout the treatment this result was supported by the previous studies achal et al 2012b zhang et al 2019 which demonstrated that dissolved sr was easily precipitated in the form of strontianite srco3 in alkaline condition containing much co3 2 ions to further clarify the removal mechanism of heavy metals the biofiltration experiments without urea was conducted when pw was co treated with sdw as shown in table s1 there was almost no difference in heavy metal concentrations between the influent and effluent when treating pw without urea in the continuous biofiltration system however high removal efficiencies of heavy metals 100 for as cd mn and ni 92 2 for ba 94 2 for sr were achieved when treating pw with 4 g l urea suggesting that high heavy metal removal was mainly due to the urea hydrolysis during the biomineralization process carbonate ions produced from the urea hydrolysis process could react with heavy metal ions in pw and then formed carbonate precipitates 3 2 4 microbial community analysis fig 6 presents the taxonomic compositions phylum and genus levels of bacterial communities in raw pw treated pw effluent from phase ii in section 3 2 2 pw sdw 1 1 urea 4 g l and biofilter top and bottom samples at the phylum level fig 6a proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla in raw pw with the relative abundances of 58 8 and 14 2 respectively which were also generally detected as the abundant bacterial phyla in other flowback and produced waters chang et al 2019a huang et al 2020 wang et al 2019 proteobacteria remained the most dominant bacterial phylum in treated pw 61 7 and biofilter 45 2 and 47 9 for top and bottom respectively samples nevertheless the proportion of firmicutes significantly increased to 34 3 in pw after the treatment of the continuous biofiltration system the phylum firmicutes are generally associated with fermentative and anaerobic bacteria which have been proven to have the capability of degrading the petroleum hydrocarbons in pw wuchter et al 2013 moreover the abundance of actinobacteria in biofilter 9 9 15 3 was much higher than that in raw pw 1 2 this result was supported by the previous studies chen and achal 2019 chen and achal 2020 which found that the phylum actinobacteria played an essential role in urease production during the biomineralization process the microbial community structure in activated sludge was also analyzed fig s4 at the phylum level fig s4a bacteroidetes and wwe1 were the most abundant phyla in raw activated sludge with the relative abundances of 31 3 and 17 7 respectively at the genus level fig s4b w5 t78 and fervidobacterium were the most abundant genera in raw activated sludge with the relative abundances of 17 7 7 9 and 6 9 respectively which were quite different from those in raw pw treated pw and biofilter samples fig 6b lists the most abundant genera in raw pw treated pw and biofilter samples the most abundant genus of all samples was marinobacter 13 4 20 9 which has been widely detected in petroleum contaminated environments and regarded as an active polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs degrader in saline environments wang et al 2020 it was found that the genus idiomarina increased remarkably in the biofilter samples 5 7 9 2 compared to the raw pw 1 9 which was consistent with the previous study akyon et al 2015 idiomarina is comprised of halophiles which have been generally isolated from various marine saline environments e g hypersaline solar saltern choi and cho 2005 reported studies akyon et al 2015 hou et al 2004 have demonstrated that certain species of idiomarina could facilitate biofilm formation under hypersaline conditions through producing large amounts of extracellular polymeric substances thereby providing salinity protection for the biofilm surprisingly the proportions of sporosarcina 6 3 10 4 and arthrobacter 2 7 8 5 increased significantly in treated pw and biofilter while those genera were not observed in raw pw both have been demonstrated to play essential roles in the biomineralization process via micp previously chen and achal 2019 chen and achal 2020 yin et al 2020 the genus sporosarcina belongs to the phylum firmicutes and has been regarded as the most dominant genus in the ureolytic bacterial consortium duarte nass et al 2020 yin et al 2020 to date several species especially sporosarcina pasteurii of sporosarcina have been widely used in calcite precipitation for various purposes e g contaminated water and soil remediation soil stabilization and strengthening concrete crack remediation due to the high urease producing ability for instance jiang et al 2019 used ureolytic bacterium sporosarcina pasteurii for immobilizing pb in the aqueous solution and obtained high pb removal efficiencies 95 100 when the initial pb concentration was between 30 mm and 50 mm sporosarcina pasteurii has also been utilized to produce the bio cement and manufacture the bio brick successfully lambert and randall 2019 achal et al 2012a isolated sporosarcina ginsengisoli from as contaminated soil and demonstrated that sporosarcina ginsengisoli was a good candidate for the bioremediation of as in contaminated soils in addition several species of arthrobacter such as arthrobacter oxydans and arthrobacter creatinolyticus have been proven to be effective for the immobilization of heavy metals via the micp technique chen and achal 2019 chen and achal 2020 therefore our microbial community analysis results confirmed that a stable ureolytic bacterial consortium containing sporosarcina and arthrobacter at the genus level was constructed in the continuous biofiltration system under hypersaline conditions in addition to further confirm the potential adverse effect of high salinity on the treatment performance of the continuous biofiltration system bio community in the biofilter was evaluated under different salinity conditions fig s5 presents the taxonomic compositions phylum and genus levels of bacterial communities in biofilter top and bottom samples under different salinity conditions when pw co treated with synthetic domestic wastewater sdw as shown in fig s5b the proportion of sporosarcina significantly decreased from 6 3 9 0 to 1 3 2 7 in the biofilter when the mixing ratio of pw and sdw increased from 1 1 to 3 1 tds increased from 65 g l to 97 g l which was consistent with the results of calcium removal efficiency therefore these results further confirmed that the high salinity of pw reduced the abundance of ureolytic bacteria thereby adversely impacting the performance of the continuous biofiltration system 3 3 ammonium stripping and recovery fig s6 shows the variations of nh3 n concentration and ph in pw over 330 min in the stripping unit it was observed that the nh3 n concentration decreased significantly from 2069 to 205 mg l within the first 180 min while the ph steadily reduced from 9 5 to 8 1 on average the maximum nh3 n removal of 98 residual nh3 n 11 mg l in pw was achieved at the end of the test these results are consistent with the findings of tian et al 2019 who found that around 80 ammonium could be extracted from real source separated urine within the former 180 min and another 10 ammonium removal was achieved during the remaining 180 min for this study approximately 90 of nh3 n could be recovered as ammonium sulfate at the end of the acid scrubbing test which was slightly lower than the nh3 n removal efficiency of 98 indicating an 8 loss of ammonia to the atmosphere which was similar to jamaludin et al 2018 however higher ammonium recovery could be achieved with excellent mass transfer surface area in the scrubbing unit for the full scale design pradhan et al 2019 3 4 acute toxicity analysis microtox 81 9 screening test was employed to determine the acute toxicity of raw and treated pw towards vibrio fischeri prior to the test all pw samples were diluted to maintain a typical seawater salinity tds 35 g l since vibrio fischeri is a natural inhabitant of seawater as illustrated in fig 7 the bioluminescence inhibition level increased from 77 2 to 85 3 after biofiltration pw sdw 1 1 urea 4 g l indicating that the acute toxicity of biofilter effluent was slightly higher than that of influent enhanced toxicity might be attributed to the high ammonium concentration 2069 mg l in the effluent due to urea hydrolysis during the biomineralization process which was supported by the findings of yu et al 2014 who found that the acute toxicity towards vibrio fischeri was significantlyand positively correlated with ammonium concentration in pharmaceutical wastewaters as expected the bioluminescence inhibition level significantly decreased from 85 3 to 21 6 when ammonium stripping was applied to the effluent from the continuous biofiltration system resulting in a 72 toxicity reduction towards vibrio fischeri which further confirmed that ammonium was a major contributor to the acute toxicity in pw to identify the main components responsible for the acute toxicity in pw the acute toxicity of pw after ammonium stripping residual nh3 n 11 mg l and abiotic biochar filtration for organic removal residual toc 5 mg l were also measured it was found that both could lead to a decrease in the acute toxicity of pw towards vibrio fischeri suggesting that both ammonium and organic contaminants were responsible for the acute toxicity in pw although microtox assay using vibrio fischeri has been widely used as a sensitive method for the acute toxicity monitoring in pw hu et al 2020b future research in combination with analysis of chronic toxicity and developmental toxicity towards various organisms are needed to provide comprehensive information for the risk assessment of pw reuse applications 3 5 economic considerations a preliminary economic estimation for the biomineralization process was performed when pw co treated with sdw pw sdw 1 1 urea 4 g l to simplify the calculation the capital investment labor and maintenance costs were not considered in this assessment as shown in table s2 the total cost for the biomineralization process was 1 86 m3 pw based on urea and energy consumptions activated sludge and domestic wastewater were considered free this expense was 31 3 lower than our previous study 2 75 m3 pw when using na2co3 for ca2 removal in pw hu et al 2020b after the treatment of the biofiltration system 1 m3 of treated pw contains 2 07 kg nh3 n approximately 90 of which could be harvested as a valuable fertilizer nh4 2so4 using 7 24 kg h2so4 98 the economic assessment based on a theoretical calculation showed that the harvesting of nh3 n from 1 m3 treated pw can make a profit of 0 80 through the ammonium stripping and scrubbing system table s2 furthermore it is worth mentioning that the biofilter effluent may be further treated and reused for several possible applications such as hydraulic fracturing irrigation and rangeland restoration which lead to additional benefits therefore considering both treatment performances and environmental benefits the proposed technique could be an economically feasible process for hypersaline pw treatment however a feasibility study for a pilot scale or full scale treatment plant is required to support this statement since several other costs e g investment labor transportation maintenance interest need to be considered for the large scale application in the future 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated the feasibility of micp for the removal of ca2 and heavy metals from hypersaline pw under low urea and nutrient conditions it indicates that the biomineralization process via micp is an economically promising biotechnique for hypersaline pw treatment to simultaneously reduce the capital cost and diminish the potential adverse effect of high salinity the co treatment of pw and synthetic domestic wastewater sdw was suggested as the best option for the continuous biofiltration system operation high removal efficiencies of ca2 96 organic contaminants 100 and heavy metals 100 for as cd mn and ni 92 2 for ba 94 2 for sr were achieved at pw sdw 1 1 urea 4 g l the microbial community analysis revealed that a stable ureolytic bacterial consortium with stronger environmental adaptability was successfully constructed in the biofilter under hypersaline conditions which contained sporosarcina 6 3 9 and arthrobacter 6 1 8 5 at the genus level additionally toxic ammonium present in the effluent from the continuous biofiltration system could be recovered as a valuable fertilizer nh4 2so4 through the aerated stripping scrubbing system while significantly reducing the acute toxicity of pw towards vibrio fischeri by 72 therefore this study presents an effective and eco sustainable strategy for the biomineralization of ca2 and heavy metals from hypersaline pw which

eggenstein leopoldshafen karlsruhe germany corresponding author nitrate arsenic and fluoride are some of the most hazardous elements contaminating groundwater resources in this work the impact of operative flowrate electricpotential and water quality salinity contaminant feed concentration ph parameters on brackish water decontamination was investigated using a batch electrodialysis ed system electrodialysis at low electric potentials 5 v was more selective toward monovalent ions at higher potentials 15 v removal of all ions increased and selectivity approached one meaning removal of all ions changing the flowrate from 30 to 70 l h increased nitrate and fluoride removal slightly while arsenic v removal was maximum at 50 l h rising salinity delayed removal of ions with low ionic mobility and diffusivity i e fluoride arsenic v increased feed concentration of contaminants had no impact on removal values ph variations did not impact the nitrate fluoride and salinity removal yet arsenic v removal was greatly ph dependent this was explained in part by lower diffusivity and higher hydration number of bi and trivalent species of arsenic v at basic ph the results of this work showed the significance of ionic characteristics diffusivity ionic mobility hydration number in ed nitrate concentrations satisfied guideline threshold in all experiments with concentrations below 50 mg l lowest arsenic v concentration was 35 µg l at the highest electric potential 25 v using ionic characteristics makes separation of different ions possible providing new opportunities for ed in

desalination of brackish groundwater with the salinity of 1 to 10 g l usgs 2019 is an option in many regions where sufficient freshwater is not available as a water supply presence of specific contaminants in particular nitrate arsenic and fluoride in groundwater is a public health concern worldwide who 2017 various who reports and guidelines prioritize the study control and removal of nitrate arsenic and fluoride as these contaminants have severe health impacts on humans thompson et al 2007 who 2018 who guidelines for nitrate arsenic v and fluoride are 50 mg l 10 µg l and 1 5 mg l respectively who 2017 nitrate contamination in groundwater is a growing problem worldwide mainly due to the excessive use of artificial fertilizers in agricultural fields industrial municipal and dairy farm activities contribute to elevated nitrate levels in groundwater wakida and lerner 2005 xin et al 2019 nitrate causes health problems such as blue baby syndrome for children pal 1983 nitrate concentrations in groundwater vary from less than 1 mg l to few g l in extreme cases edmunds and gaye 1997 however common nitrate values in contaminated waters is in the range of 10 to 600 mg l reported in different locations such as china su et al 2017 india adimalla et al 2019 and spain lorite herrera et al 2009 arsenic exists in both organic and inorganic forms in water inorganic forms of arsenic are considered most dangerous these include arsenite as iii and arsenate as v while arsenite is dominant in reducing conditions arsenate is available in oxidizing conditions arsenite can be oxidized to arsenate by numerous oxidation reactions andreae 1978 low level yet chronic arsenic exposure is correlated with diseases such as diabetes melanosis keratosis and is categorized as a group a carcinogenic element who 2017 arsenic exposure at high levels can be fatal as iii or poisonous as v singh et al 2015 in most cases the source of arsenic is natural singh et al 2015 yet anthropogenic activities such as gold mining leads to groundwater arsenic contamination hamidian et al 2019 rossiter et al 2010 rising salinity of groundwater resources due to various reasons such as seawater intrusion enhance arsenic dissolution from soil sediments into solution morelli et al 2017 high arsenic concentrations in brackish groundwater have been reported for example in the range of 4 to 2500 µg l in iran hamidian et al 2019 2 to 473 µg l in highly populated areas of bangladesh chakraborti et al 2010 and 4 to 5300 µg l in argentina smedley et al 2002 where groundwater is a main source of water fluoridecontamination originates from dissolution of natural rocks mohapatra et al 2009 or by human activities mainly industrial wastewaters and use of phosphate fertilizers by releasing silicon fluoride ndiaye et al 2005 groundwater fluoride concentrations depend on the geology of the aquifer and its interaction with its environment keri et al 2011 concentrations as high as 1 g l have been reported in tanzania shen et al 2016 in the middle east and north africa regions where water is scarce fluoride concentrations in the range of 1 to 35 mg l are present in groundwater keri et al 2011 even though low level fluoride concentration 0 5 to 1 mg l is essential for bone and dental formation in humans especially for children excessive intake of it leads to some disorders such as skeletal and dental fluorosis pal 1983 who 2017 depending on the ph of water charge of ions in water varies fig 1 shows nitrate arsenic v and fluoride speciation in ph 2 to 12 the studied contaminants are charged in the neutral ph range and consequently can be removed effectively by ed ionic characteristics of the studied and relevant ions are presented in table 4 1 2 nitrate arsenic and fluoride removal processes numerous technologies have been developed to treat nitrate arsenic and fluoride contaminated waters table 1 compares removal performance of different stablished methods for contaminant removal while giving a short list of advantages and disadvantages of each method it is suggested that depending on the contaminant type and conditions of the environment there will be a preferred process to be considered electro membrane processes are considered alternative technologies to the state of the art methods of brackish water desalination which are the pressure driven membrane processes nf and ro ed has been reported to be far more efficient than other electro membrane processes i e membrane capacitive deionization for better scaling and fouling control smaller system size and subsequently lower capital cost patel et al 2020 ed is a well established technology for brackish water desalination and salt production it is shown that ed is robust against scaling problems strathmann 2010 and can be coupled with off grid renewable energy systems in remote places with lack of infrastructure karimi et al 2015 malek et al 2016 ortiz et al 2008 1 3 electrodialysis for brackish water treatment ed represented 6 of the brackish water desalination capacity worldwide in 2018 international desalination association 2019 process optimization bian et al 2019 doornbusch et al 2020 and adaption of ed to new applications continue to be challenges al amshawee et al 2020 pramanik et al 2020 recent developments enhance the energy efficiency of ed through for example using capacitive electrodes that add advantages such as system simplification and contaminant removal adsorption by electrodes to conventional ed campione et al 2020 vermaas et al 2013 comparing ed with ro showed that with the same product water quality and volume a pilot scale ed plant used nearly half the energy used by ro ed 0 3 kwh m3 ro 0 6 kwh m3 feed water 1875 µs cm 1 5 g l nacl while both systems used roughly the same amount of energy for water with higher salinity 1 kwh m3 feed water 3530 µs cm 2 7 g l nacl karimi et al 2015 at higher salinities the energy consumption of ed was more sensitive to feed salinity making it more energy intensive compared to ro qin et al 2019 1 4 operative parameters affecting electrodialysis in nitrate arsenic v and fluoride removal feed flowrate and electric potential over the membrane stack are control parameters in ed process increasing flowrate improved the conventional ed process performance by decreasing the thickness of boundary layer kim et al 2012 while the increase in the pumping cost for the increased flow rate wasreported to be negligible walker et al 2014a kim et al found the mean boundary layer thickness at the membrane surface decrease from 40 to 10 µm by an increase in the flowrate from 12 to 48 l h in a batch system kim et al 2011 increasing flowrate in the diluate cell decreased the process time significantly by mitigation of concentration polarization on membrane surface however flowrate variations in the concentrate side had no significant impact choi et al 2016 nitrate and arsenic v removal at low salinity 0 2 g l was not affected when flowrate decreased from 14 5 to 0 2 l min choi et al 2016 however nitrate removal increased from 78 to 86 within 10 minutes by raising flowrate from 100 to 180 l h in another study el midaoui et al 2002 karimi et al showed that increasing the flowrate from 20 to 50 l h led to a thinner boundary layer and increased chloride ion removal from 85 to more than 95 however the shortened solution residence time in the membrane stack at higher flowrates 50 l h caused the solution to discharge before chloride ions could be transferred to the concentrate side karimi et al 2018 similar observations were reported in a separate study investigating the removal of nitrate ions from groundwater zhang and chen 2016 increasing electric potential across the stack was reported to improve removal of nitrate and fluoride belkada et al 2018 el midaoui et al 2002 onorato et al showed that arsenic v removal was also increased with higher voltages from 21 to 41 with 12 and 18 v respectively however removal in this case was attributed to the deposition of arsenic v species on the membrane in a complex brackish water onorato et al 2017 mendoza et al suggested that electric potential had the highest contribution in arsenic v removal from a synthetic arsenic v solution neutral ph feed salinity 400 mg l nacl compared to feed concentration of arsenic and time of operation mendoza et al 2014 higher electric potentials led to faster removal of ions and therefore higher arsenic v removal however when the diffusion boundary layer a layer on the membrane surface where concentration polarization occurs was depleted of ions on the diluate side the resistance of the stack increased significantly strathmann 2004b walker et al 2014b this phenomenon limiting current significantly increased energy consumption after synthesis and characterization of a novel membrane kikhavani et al suggested that when selectivity removing a specific anion nitrate in this case was considered separation ratio the ratio of transferred nitrate over chloride improved at lower applied voltages kikhavani et al 2014 while electric potential and flowrate of ed can be used to control process parameters water quality characteristics in particular contaminant feed concentration salinity and ph can affect the removal mechanisms and process efficiency 1 5 water quality parameters affecting electrodialysis in nitrate arsenic v and fluoride removal salinity ph and feed contaminant concentration are the main water quality parameters that may influence the removal of the contaminants from brackish water by ed significant ph variations in natural water resources were reported e g from ph 3 7 to 8 9 in ghana rossiter et al 2010 these ph variations change the charge of dissolved inorganic contaminants such as arsenic and fluoride and principally impact ed process performance further kumar et al suggested that groundwater resources with alkaline ph typically have higher arsenic levels kumar et al 2020 therefore it is vital to understand the impact of ph variation that can be attributed to seasonal changes industrial and agricultural activities recharge etc on removal min and kim investigated desalination of brackish groundwater where seawater intrusion was significant concentrations in mg l 1288 107 273 118 and 201 for cl so4 2 na mg2 and ca2 respectively and showed that the desalination process was not impacted in the ph range of 3 to 9 implying that adjustment of ph was not needed for desalination purposes in ed min and kim 2013 this can be attributed to the fact that chloride speciation charge is not ph dependant therefore its removal was not affected in the studied ph range lower removal of nitrate at basic ph compared to acidic ph from industrial wastewater was reported belkada et al 2018 this lower removal 50 at ph 12 compared to 65 at ph 2 5 was attributed to the lower intrinsic crystal radii of hydroxide oh compared to nitrate 0 176 and 0 264 nm respectively where higher concentrations of oh i e ph 12 reduced nitrate removal this was further emphasised by comparison of the ionic characteristics from table 4 arsenic v deposition on the membrane at high ph has been reported onorato et al 2017 this was explained by the speciation behaviour of arsenic v species at high ph where arsenic v assumed a double pka 2 6 98 or triple charge pka 3 11 53 various studies reported a maximum for fluoride removal in the range of ph 6 to 7 arda et al 2009 belkada et al 2018 damtie et al 2019 in acidic ph the formation of hf pka 3 1 with no charge and consequently no removal and at basic ph the presence of competing hydroxide ions lowered fluoride removal by electrodialysis due to its higher diffusivity and mobility see table 4 salinity may change with precipitation seawater intrusion and climate change sea level rise and may affect contaminant removal in ed nitrate removal was reported very high by different studies in presence of nacl which was correlated to the high diffusivity and ionic mobility table 4 of nitrate and its competitiveness in removal with other present anions i e chloride bicarbonate fluoride el midaoui et al 2002 kikhavani et al 2014 kim and benjamin 2004 arsenic v removal by ed from brackish waters 3 6 g l nacl was reported as relatively low 25 to 40 onorato et al 2017 considering ionic characteristics of other abundant anions in brackish waters such as chloride table 4 an increase in their concentration will most likely result in decreased arsenic v removal very high fluoride removal up to 99 from brackish water was observed in various studies in the presence of other ions arda et al 2009 damtie et al 2019 kabay et al 2008 however kabay et al and bhadja et al showed that other anions with higher mobility and diffusivity i e chloride nitrate and hydroxide competed with fluoride and hindered its removal and hence increased the ed process time bhadja et al 2016 kabay et al 2008 the impact of rising salinity caused for example by seawater intrusion on the removal of contaminants has not been investigated to date it is anticipated that increasing concentration of competing ions table 4 in solution can hinder the removal of arsenic v and fluoride while nitrate removal is expected to be constant even in high salinities contaminant concentration varies from water to water and with time nitrate concentration in groundwater increased due to excessive use of fertilizers in many countries el midaoui et al 2002 belkada et al showed that nitrate removal decreased in higher feed concentrations while removal increased over time belkada et al 2018 this was attributed to the dependency of transported number of ions only on feed concentration at specific operating conditions thus higher initial concentrations needed longer treatment times bhadja et al showed that when initial arsenic v concentration was increased from 200 to 800 µg l feed salinity 0 5 g l nacl the time to reach the arsenic guideline value increased from 25 to 45 minutes the impact of increased arsenic concentration on removal in brackish water was not investigated in this study bhadja et al 2016 different initial fluoride concentrations were studied from 120 to 180 mg l in diluate 50 mg l in concentrate where the reported removal of fluoride ranged from 50 to 60 and was relatively constant belkada et al 2018 as these results contradict previous conclusions in nitrate removal in order to understand how removal is affected by fluoride feed concentration experiments with a higher concentration range are required the range of the contaminant concentrations in this study cover the concentrations from guideline values to the higher naturally occurring values see section 1 1 1 6 research questions in this work removal of nitrate arsenic v and fluoride from brackish water was investigated with a focus on the impact of operational ed parameters and water quality on removal the specific research questions are i can ed operational parameters flow rate 30 to 70 l h and electric potential 5 to 25 v enhance the removal of nitrate arsenic v and fluoride from brackish water ii is the removal robust with changing water quality parameters feed ph 2 to 12 salinity 0 to 10 g l nacl and contaminant feed concentration no3 50 to 1500 mg l as v 10 to 1000 µg l f 10 to 250 mg l iii

nitrate arsenic v and fluoride separately in each experiment constant concentrations of the contaminant were mixed with 5 g l nacl solution and the experiments were performed at different flowrates 30 to 70 l h and electric potentials 5 to 25 v detailed information of the experiments is shown in table si1 2 4 3 water quality experiments parameters ph salinity and contaminant concentration were examined for each anion to understand dominating removal mechanisms of nitrate arsenic v and fluoride from brackish water salinity 0 to 10 g l nacl initial contaminant concentration nitrate 50 to 1500 mg l arsenic v 50 to 1000 µg l fluoride 10 to 250 mg l and feed ph 2 to 12 of solutions were varying parameters investigated detailed information is shown in table si1 the ph of the diluate and concentrate was adjusted at the beginning of each experiment and was not controlled during the experiments ph variations are presented in fig si5b d and f extreme ph values changed during the course of the experiments towards more neutral values 2 to 4 12 to 10 2 5 water analysis nitrate and fluoride concentrations were determined with ion chromatography ic metrohm 850 professional ic switzerland due to the limited determination range of ic column metrohm asupp17 switzerland nitrate 1 to 50 mg l fluoride 0 1 to 10 mg l samples were diluted based on salinity removal data ec to salinity conversion factor 0 61 before introducing to ic nitrate and fluoride calibration curves are shown in fig si2 arsenic v concentration was analysed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent model j8403a 7900 icp ms japan with an internal argon dilution system making it possible for the introduction of high salinity samples with up to 25 total dissolved solids tds to mitigate spectral interference of arcl with same mass as arsenic m z 75 helium collision mode was used moreover separate calibrations were prepared to match the salinity of samples and the effect of water matrix on arsenic analysis was investigated in previous work boussouga et al 2021 for precise quantification an internal standard solution internal standard mix for icp ms systems 5188 6525 agilent was used to correct the variability between samples and calibrations germanium m z 75 was selected for signal correction as the closest element to arsenic arsenic calibration curves are shown in fig si3 2 6 data analysis to determine the lcd the isaacson sonin method was used isaacson and sonin 1976 the current density total current divided by active anion exchange membrane area was measured as a function of applied electric potential across the membrane stack initially the current increased linearly with increasing electric potential ohmic regime while after reaching lcd electric current increased only marginally with increasing electric potential non ohmic regime fig 3 illustrates the procedure of identifying the lcd in the ed system for different salinities and flowrates the theoretical formula for calculating the lcd is shown in eq 1 1 i lim f d i δ d t i m t i b c i b where i lim is the limiting current density a m2 δ d is the thickness of the diffusion boundary layer m f is faraday constant 96485 s a mol t i m and t i b are the ion transport numbers within the membrane and solution where m and b refer to the membrane surface and bulk solution respectively using eq 1 constants in tables 3 and 4 and the experimental results of lcd determination it was possible to determine the diffusion boundary layer thickness for different flowrates malek et al 2013 the ed system performance was quantified with salinity nitrate arsenic v and fluoride removal r s a l i n i t y n i t r a t e a r s e n i c o r f l u o r i d e salinity of the samples was calculated by converting conductivity ms cm to salinity g l by a factor of 0 61 it must be mentioned that electronic conductivity and salinity result from all present ions in the solutions removal is calculated by eq 2 2 r 1 c t c 0 100 where c t and c 0 are final and initial values for salinity g l nacl or contaminant concentration mg l for nitrate and fluoride or µg l for arsenic v respectively to calculate the specific energy consumption sec of the system kwh m3 at different salinities eq 3 was used 3 s e c u i d t v where u is the electric potential v i is the electric current a t is time hour and v is the volume of the treated water l by using eq 3 the energy consumption of the pumps was not considered the number of specific ions transported through the membranes in the time is compared to the supplied charge used in the membrane stack this ratio is called charge efficiency and is calculated by eq 4 lambert et al 2006 4 η i c 0 c t n v f i d t where η i is charge efficiency n is the number of cell pairs t is the time s and v is the total volume of diluate solution l the solute flux of salinity as nacl oh h nitrate arsenic v and fluoride was calculated using eq 5 5 j i v a d c d t where j i is solute flux mol m2s d t and a are time s and the total anion exchange membranes area 0 1 m2 respectively the selectivity values between contaminants and salinity was calculated using eq 6 sato et al 2002 6 s i j j i c j j j c i where s i j is the overall selectivity of membranes between component i and j and c is the concentration in the diluate side of the membranes if the activity of ions is assumed equal to their concentrations and all kinetic coupling between ions is neglected the theoretical ion flux through the ion exchange membrane can be written as eq 7 using the nernst planck equation which is derived from the stefan maxwell equation and the phenomenological description of mass transport strathmann 2004a 7 j i d i d c d x d i z i c i f r t d u d x v c i where d i is the fick s diffusion coefficient of the ion in reference to the water in the membrane m2 s which is related to the stefan maxwell diffusion and phenomenological coefficients z i is valance number of ion r is ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is absolute temperature k and v is the fluid velocity perpendicular to the membrane surface m s the first second and third sections of eq 7 represent diffusion migration and convection respectively as the pressure difference over the membranes is kept as small as possible the velocity of the fluid perpendicular to the membrane surface and subsequently the convention term in eq 7 can be neglected strathmann 2004a error propagation was used to assess the analysis error in the calculated parameters where uncertainties from different sources were accounted for si4 3 results and discussion 3 1 the current voltage curve for lcd determination to avoid working at over limiting current densities causing membrane damage and drastic ph variations it is vital to understand limiting current density for this specific ed system and the different solutions that are to be treated fig 3 shows the lcd determination for different salinities and flowrates the lcd was determined before conducting further experiments in fig 3a lcd was determined by intersecting tangents of linear portions of the corresponding i v curves increasing the salinity from zero to 10 g l nacl changed the lcd drastically however variations of flowrate in the system limitations between 30 to 70 l h did not impact lcd considerably yet small increases in lcd were observed fig 3b these results are in accordance with experimental results from nakayama et al nakayama et al 2017 in which it was suggested that lcd in membrane stacks with spacers was more sensitive to diluate concentration compared to flowrate of the solutions to avoid working at over limiting currents 15 v and 50 l h were chosen as the standard electric potential and flowrate in the following experiments 3 2 operational parameters electric potential increased electric potential leads to higher electrochemical potential over the membrane stack subsequently higher removal values are observed min and kim 2013 patel et al 2020 walker et al 2014b however the impact of electric potential depends on different ion characteristics i e hydrated radius charge ion mobility karimi and ghassemi 2015 removal of nitrate arsenic v fluoride and salinity at different electric potentials 5 to 25 v was investigated to understand the extent to which ion characteristics contribute fig 4 in fig 4a the removal followed the order of arsenic v fluoride salinity nitrate over the studied range of electric potential this was in accordance with the order of the ionic mobility and diffusivity table 4 of the ions in water higher ionic mobility of nitrate and chloride resulted in nearly complete removal at 15 v after 1 hour the higher electric potentials 15 v also led to higher removal of arsenic v this was in accordance with previous studies karimi and ghassemi 2016 kikhavani et al 2014 where it was suggested that the selectivity selective removal of a specific ion compared to others of ed process reduces as electric potential increases the electrodialysis selectivity between contaminants and salinity was calculated with eq 6 and presented in table 5 while nitrate selectivity decreased at higher electric potentials arsenic v and fluoride selectivity increased except at 10 v for fluoride the selectivity approached one as potential increased as seen in previous studies as the nacl concentration in the feed solutions were 5 g l in these experiments the time to achieve the desired electric current over the membrane stack 0 09 a was dependent only on the electric potential decreasing from 3 6 hours at 5 v to 1 1 hour at 25 v fig 4b concentration of contaminants in diluate over time is presented in fig si4 3 3 operational parameters flow rate increasing flowrate reduces the boundary layer thickness and residence time of the solution in the membrane stack influencing the removal of contaminants to better understand the removal mechanisms of nitrate arsenic v and fluoride experiments were conducted at different flow rates 30 to 70 l h salinity nitrate and fluoride removal improved slightly as the flowrate increased from 30 to 70 l h nitrate 95 6 to 99 0 and fluoride 80 4 to 87 9 fig 5 a the amount of available nitrate and fluoride ions for transport was the limiting factor in removal at higher flowrates with decrease of boundary layer thickness from 95 to 55 µm calculated using eq 1 and lcd values from fig 3b and a subsequent increase in available ions an increase in removal was observed this was in accordance with a previous study el midaoui et al 2002 however arsenic v removal was not limited only by the amount of available ions but also by its low diffusion in water which caused the solution to be discharged before arsenic v could be removed at high flowrates 50 l h due to the low solution residence time in the membrane stack fig 5a different ionic characteristics of nitrate fluoride and arsenic v see table 4 explain the different removal trends multivalent and less mobile arsenic v ion could not transfer to the concentrate side while highly mobile nitrate and fluoride ions could compensate for the shortened residence time of the solution in the membrane stack this optimal flowrate was observed previously in removal of chloride and nitrate anions in separate studies karimi et al 2018 zhang and chen 2016 at higher flowrates the process time decreased slightly as seen in fig 5b these results were in accordance with a previous study from kim et al that the electrodialysis process is hardly improved with flowrate increase in the ohmic regime kim et al 2011 concentration of anions in diluate over time is presented in fig si4 3 4 water quality parameters ph the charge of the arsenic v and fluoride species are dependent on the ph of the solution while nitrate charge does not change with ph fig 1 given that ionic charge and properties table 4 affect transport in ed the effect of feed ph 2 12 on removal of contaminants is investigated fig 6 while nitrate removal was not ph dependent arsenic v removal was significantly decreased by increasing ph 9 and fluoride removal decreased only slightly at high ph fig 6a arsenic v removal showed three stages with rising ph decreasing from 72 ph 2 to 12 ph 12 this was explained by the increased hydration and decreased ionic mobility and diffusivity of the arsenic v species at high ph fig 1 and table 4 ortega et al 2017 and higher selectivity of the membranes for monovalent ions the dominant arsenic v specie in acidic ph was the monovalent arsenic v with the highest diffusivity and lowest hydration number this made the migration through the anion exchange membrane harder for the ion as hydration energy increased and more energy was needed to strip arsenic v from its corresponding water molecules these observations were in accordance with a recent study epsztein et al 2019 suggesting that it was more favourable for ions with lower hydration energy to be absorbed to the surface of the ion exchange membrane as shown in fig 6b the higher concentration and subsequently higher molar flux of hydroxide ions in basic conditions ph 9 had a negative impact on arsenic v molar flux while nitrate and fluoride molar flux values were not affected contaminant concentrations and ph variations over time in the diluate are shown in fig si5 3 5 water quality parameters salinity the salinity of groundwater may vary with excessive exploitation rainfall and due to various other reasons such as seawater intrusion or rise in sea levels in consequence it was necessary to understand how salinity variations affected contaminant removal in ed rising salinity had little impact on nitrate removal as the ionic characteristics of nitrate ions were similar to chloride ions fig 7 a for arsenic v and fluoride where ionic mobility and diffusivity were lower compared to chloride removal was affected significantly reduction from 85 to 25 for arsenic v and 94 to 72 for fluoride the molar flux of arsenic v and fluoride decreased with increased salinity where salinity molar flux increased linearly as nacl concentration was increased fig 7b both observations could be explained by eq 7 considering that both diffusivity and concentration are main factors in transport of ions with higher nacl concentrations more chloride was available for transport arsenic v and fluoride removal was lowered due to the competition of abundant chloride ions contaminant concentration over time is shown in fig si6 using eq 3 the sec of the ed system for feed salinities of 1 2 5 5 and 10 g l nacl was 0 8 2 0 3 9 and 7 5 kwh m3 with salinity removals of 99 97 96 and 93 after 1 hour respectively the rising salinity increased the sec significantly fig 8 as more ions were available to be transported through the membranes karimi et al 2015 at the same time charge efficiency of the system for salinity removal decreased steadily from 93 6 at 1 g l to 84 5 at 10 g l the diminishing charge efficiency at higher salinities was attributed to i co ion transport and ii back diffusion of ions patel et al 2020 3 6 water quality parameters contaminant concentration to understand how feed concentration affects contaminant removal experiments in different concentration ranges were conducted fig 9 a shows removal at different feed concentrations normal concentrations are indicated in cyan colour feed concentration did not influence removal of the contaminants fig 9a removal of arsenic v was consistently lower than that of nitrate and fluoride higher feed concentrations resulted in an increase of molar flux higher feed concentrations of contaminants translated to increased concentration in the diluate thus longer operations or higher membrane surface area are required to achieve the guideline value salinity removal was constant in varying contaminant feed concentrations fig 9b considering that salinity comes from both the contaminants and nacl this indicated that the desalination process is independent of contaminants feed concentration as long as the salinity is not increased significantly by the contaminant nitrate showed high removal in all conditions and guideline values were achieved in all experiments contaminant concentration as a function of time is shown in fig si7 while higher electric potentials may be more costly removal and selectivity of arsenic v anions compared to salinity were increased further feed ph reduction could increase arsenic v removal from brackish waters by ed while increasing salinity will delay the removal of fluoride and arsenic v ions and increase the operation time some ions that tend to be removed well by nanofiltration nf e g fluoride and arsenic v cannot be removed by ed very well while removal of ions that permeate easily through nf membranes e g no3 is consistently high by ed the nitrate guideline was met in all experiments while arsenic v concentration was only able to reach the less stringent bangladesh guideline in absence of salinity 0 g l nacl and highest electric potential 25 v the fluoride guideline could not be met see supporting information section 5 4 conclusions this study investigated the application of a batch type ed system for immediate desalination and decontamination of synthetic brackish groundwater over a broad range of operational electric potential 5 25 v and flow rate 30 70 l h and water quality parameters ph 2 12 feed salinity 0 10 g l nacl and contaminant concentration no3 5 0 1500 mg l as v 10 1000 µg l f 10 250 mg l the removal of contaminants followed the order no3 salinity f as v the increasing electric potential 5 25 v led to higher arsenic v removal 3 83 while ed had selective nitrate removal at low electric potential 15 v nitrate and fluoride removal increased slightly with higher flow rate while arsenic v removal showed a weak maximum at 50 l h arsenic v removal was ph and subsequently speciation dependent with high removal 72 at ph 2 while removal of nitrate and fluoride was ph independent with increasing feed water salinity 0 10 g l nacl nitrate removal was not affected 94 however arsenic v and fluoride removal was reduced with rising salinity 85 25 for arsenic v and 94 72 for fluoride suggesting that rising salinity of groundwater will affect contaminant removal in ed higher feed concentrations led to higher final contaminant concentrations in the diluate this study showed that ionic characteristics of contaminants determine their removal by ed while operative higher electric potential and flow rate and feed water quality modifications acidic ph can improve contaminant removal nitrate was removed below who guidelines in all experiments highlighting the effectiveness of ed as a denitrification process supporting information si

eggenstein leopoldshafen karlsruhe germany corresponding author nitrate arsenic and fluoride are some of the most hazardous elements contaminating groundwater resources in this work the impact of operative flowrate electricpotential and water quality salinity contaminant feed concentration ph parameters on brackish water decontamination was investigated using a batch electrodialysis ed system electrodialysis at low electric potentials 5 v was more selective toward monovalent ions at higher potentials 15 v removal of all ions increased and selectivity approached one meaning removal of all ions changing the flowrate from 30 to 70 l h increased nitrate and fluoride removal slightly while arsenic v removal was maximum at 50 l h rising salinity delayed removal of ions with low ionic mobility and diffusivity i e fluoride arsenic v increased feed concentration of contaminants had no impact on removal values ph variations did not impact the nitrate fluoride and salinity removal yet arsenic v removal was greatly ph dependent this was explained in part by lower diffusivity and higher hydration number of bi and trivalent species of arsenic v at basic ph the results of this work showed the significance of ionic characteristics diffusivity ionic mobility hydration number in ed nitrate concentrations satisfied guideline threshold in all experiments with concentrations below 50

desalination of brackish groundwater with the salinity of 1 to 10 g l usgs 2019 is an option in many regions where sufficient freshwater is not available as a water supply presence of specific contaminants in particular nitrate arsenic and fluoride in groundwater is a public health concern worldwide who 2017 various who reports and guidelines prioritize the study control and removal of nitrate arsenic and fluoride as these contaminants have severe health impacts on humans thompson et al 2007 who 2018 who guidelines for nitrate arsenic v and fluoride are 50 mg l 10 µg l and 1 5 mg l respectively who 2017 nitrate contamination in groundwater is a growing problem worldwide mainly due to the excessive use of artificial fertilizers in agricultural fields industrial municipal and dairy farm activities contribute to elevated nitrate levels in groundwater wakida and lerner 2005 xin et al 2019 nitrate causes health problems such as blue baby syndrome for children pal 1983 nitrate concentrations in groundwater vary from less than 1 mg l to few g l in extreme cases edmunds and gaye 1997 however common nitrate values in contaminated waters is in the range of 10 to 600 mg l reported in different locations such as china su et al 2017 india adimalla et al 2019 and spain lorite herrera et al 2009 arsenic exists in both organic and inorganic forms in water inorganic forms of arsenic are considered most dangerous these include arsenite as iii and arsenate as v while arsenite is dominant in reducing conditions arsenate is available in oxidizing conditions arsenite can be oxidized to arsenate by numerous oxidation reactions andreae 1978 low level yet chronic arsenic exposure is correlated with diseases such as diabetes melanosis keratosis and is categorized as a group a carcinogenic element who 2017 arsenic exposure at high levels can be fatal as iii or poisonous as v singh et al 2015 in most cases the source of arsenic is natural singh et al 2015 yet anthropogenic activities such as gold mining leads to groundwater arsenic contamination hamidian et al 2019 rossiter et al 2010 rising salinity of groundwater resources due to various reasons such as seawater intrusion enhance arsenic dissolution from soil sediments into solution morelli et al 2017 high arsenic concentrations in brackish groundwater have been reported for example in the range of 4 to 2500 µg l in iran hamidian et al 2019 2 to 473 µg l in highly populated areas of bangladesh chakraborti et al 2010 and 4 to 5300 µg l in argentina smedley et al 2002 where groundwater is a main source of water fluoridecontamination originates from dissolution of natural rocks mohapatra et al 2009 or by human activities mainly industrial wastewaters and use of phosphate fertilizers by releasing silicon fluoride ndiaye et al 2005 groundwater fluoride concentrations depend on the geology of the aquifer and its interaction with its environment keri et al 2011 concentrations as high as 1 g l have been reported in tanzania shen et al 2016 in the middle east and north africa regions where water is scarce fluoride concentrations in the range of 1 to 35 mg l are present in groundwater keri et al 2011 even though low level fluoride concentration 0 5 to 1 mg l is essential for bone and dental formation in humans especially for children excessive intake of it leads to some disorders such as skeletal and dental fluorosis pal 1983 who 2017 depending on the ph of water charge of ions in water varies fig 1 shows nitrate arsenic v and fluoride speciation in ph 2 to 12 the studied contaminants are charged in the neutral ph range and consequently can be removed effectively by ed ionic characteristics of the studied and relevant ions are presented in table 4 1 2 nitrate arsenic and fluoride removal processes numerous technologies have been developed to treat nitrate arsenic and fluoride contaminated waters table 1 compares removal performance of different stablished methods for contaminant removal while giving a short list of advantages and disadvantages of each method it is suggested that depending on the contaminant type and conditions of the environment there will be a preferred process to be considered electro membrane processes are considered alternative technologies to the state of the art methods of brackish water desalination which are the pressure driven membrane processes nf and ro ed has been reported to be far more efficient than other electro membrane processes i e membrane capacitive deionization for better scaling and fouling control smaller system size and subsequently lower capital cost patel et al 2020 ed is a well established technology for brackish water desalination and salt production it is shown that ed is robust against scaling problems strathmann 2010 and can be coupled with off grid renewable energy systems in remote places with lack of infrastructure karimi et al 2015 malek et al 2016 ortiz et al 2008 1 3 electrodialysis for brackish water treatment ed represented 6 of the brackish water desalination capacity worldwide in 2018 international desalination association 2019 process optimization bian et al 2019 doornbusch et al 2020 and adaption of ed to new applications continue to be challenges al amshawee et al 2020 pramanik et al 2020 recent developments enhance the energy efficiency of ed through for example using capacitive electrodes that add advantages such as system simplification and contaminant removal adsorption by electrodes to conventional ed campione et al 2020 vermaas et al 2013 comparing ed with ro showed that with the same product water quality and volume a pilot scale ed plant used nearly half the energy used by ro ed 0 3 kwh m3 ro 0 6 kwh m3 feed water 1875 µs cm 1 5 g l nacl while both systems used roughly the same amount of energy for water with higher salinity 1 kwh m3 feed water 3530 µs cm 2 7 g l nacl karimi et al 2015 at higher salinities the energy consumption of ed was more sensitive to feed salinity making it more energy intensive compared to ro qin et al 2019 1 4 operative parameters affecting electrodialysis in nitrate arsenic v and fluoride removal feed flowrate and electric potential over the membrane stack are control parameters in ed process increasing flowrate improved the conventional ed process performance by decreasing the thickness of boundary layer kim et al 2012 while the increase in the pumping cost for the increased flow rate wasreported to be negligible walker et al 2014a kim et al found the mean boundary layer thickness at the membrane surface decrease from 40 to 10 µm by an increase in the flowrate from 12 to 48 l h in a batch system kim et al 2011 increasing flowrate in the diluate cell decreased the process time significantly by mitigation of concentration polarization on membrane surface however flowrate variations in the concentrate side had no significant impact choi et al 2016 nitrate and arsenic v removal at low salinity 0 2 g l was not affected when flowrate decreased from 14 5 to 0 2 l min choi et al 2016 however nitrate removal increased from 78 to 86 within 10 minutes by raising flowrate from 100 to 180 l h in another study el midaoui et al 2002 karimi et al showed that increasing the flowrate from 20 to 50 l h led to a thinner boundary layer and increased chloride ion removal from 85 to more than 95 however the shortened solution residence time in the membrane stack at higher flowrates 50 l h caused the solution to discharge before chloride ions could be transferred to the concentrate side karimi et al 2018 similar observations were reported in a separate study investigating the removal of nitrate ions from groundwater zhang and chen 2016 increasing electric potential across the stack was reported to improve removal of nitrate and fluoride belkada et al 2018 el midaoui et al 2002 onorato et al showed that arsenic v removal was also increased with higher voltages from 21 to 41 with 12 and 18 v respectively however removal in this case was attributed to the deposition of arsenic v species on the membrane in a complex brackish water onorato et al 2017 mendoza et al suggested that electric potential had the highest contribution in arsenic v removal from a synthetic arsenic v solution neutral ph feed salinity 400 mg l nacl compared to feed concentration of arsenic and time of operation mendoza et al 2014 higher electric potentials led to faster removal of ions and therefore higher arsenic v removal however when the diffusion boundary layer a layer on the membrane surface where concentration polarization occurs was depleted of ions on the diluate side the resistance of the stack increased significantly strathmann 2004b walker et al 2014b this phenomenon limiting current significantly increased energy consumption after synthesis and characterization of a novel membrane kikhavani et al suggested that when selectivity removing a specific anion nitrate in this case was considered separation ratio the ratio of transferred nitrate over chloride improved at lower applied voltages kikhavani et al 2014 while electric potential and flowrate of ed can be used to control process parameters water quality characteristics in particular contaminant feed concentration salinity and ph can affect the removal mechanisms and process efficiency 1 5 water quality parameters affecting electrodialysis in nitrate arsenic v and fluoride removal salinity ph and feed contaminant concentration are the main water quality parameters that may influence the removal of the contaminants from brackish water by ed significant ph variations in natural water resources were reported e g from ph 3 7 to 8 9 in ghana rossiter et al 2010 these ph variations change the charge of dissolved inorganic contaminants such as arsenic and fluoride and principally impact ed process performance further kumar et al suggested that groundwater resources with alkaline ph typically have higher arsenic levels kumar et al 2020 therefore it is vital to understand the impact of ph variation that can be attributed to seasonal changes industrial and agricultural activities recharge etc on removal min and kim investigated desalination of brackish groundwater where seawater intrusion was significant concentrations in mg l 1288 107 273 118 and 201 for cl so4 2 na mg2 and ca2 respectively and showed that the desalination process was not impacted in the ph range of 3 to 9 implying that adjustment of ph was not needed for desalination purposes in ed min and kim 2013 this can be attributed to the fact that chloride speciation charge is not ph dependant therefore its removal was not affected in the studied ph range lower removal of nitrate at basic ph compared to acidic ph from industrial wastewater was reported belkada et al 2018 this lower removal 50 at ph 12 compared to 65 at ph 2 5 was attributed to the lower intrinsic crystal radii of hydroxide oh compared to nitrate 0 176 and 0 264 nm respectively where higher concentrations of oh i e ph 12 reduced nitrate removal this was further emphasised by comparison of the ionic characteristics from table 4 arsenic v deposition on the membrane at high ph has been reported onorato et al 2017 this was explained by the speciation behaviour of arsenic v species at high ph where arsenic v assumed a double pka 2 6 98 or triple charge pka 3 11 53 various studies reported a maximum for fluoride removal in the range of ph 6 to 7 arda et al 2009 belkada et al 2018 damtie et al 2019 in acidic ph the formation of hf pka 3 1 with no charge and consequently no removal and at basic ph the presence of competing hydroxide ions lowered fluoride removal by electrodialysis due to its higher diffusivity and mobility see table 4 salinity may change with precipitation seawater intrusion and climate change sea level rise and may affect contaminant removal in ed nitrate removal was reported very high by different studies in presence of nacl which was correlated to the high diffusivity and ionic mobility table 4 of nitrate and its competitiveness in removal with other present anions i e chloride bicarbonate fluoride el midaoui et al 2002 kikhavani et al 2014 kim and benjamin 2004 arsenic v removal by ed from brackish waters 3 6 g l nacl was reported as relatively low 25 to 40 onorato et al 2017 considering ionic characteristics of other abundant anions in brackish waters such as chloride table 4 an increase in their concentration will most likely result in decreased arsenic v removal very high fluoride removal up to 99 from brackish water was observed in various studies in the presence of other ions arda et al 2009 damtie et al 2019 kabay et al 2008 however kabay et al and bhadja et al showed that other anions with higher mobility and diffusivity i e chloride nitrate and hydroxide competed with fluoride and hindered its removal and hence increased the ed process time bhadja et al 2016 kabay et al 2008 the impact of rising salinity caused for example by seawater intrusion on the removal of contaminants has not been investigated to date it is anticipated that increasing concentration of competing ions table 4 in solution can hinder the removal of arsenic v and fluoride while nitrate removal is expected to be constant even in high salinities contaminant concentration varies from water to water and with time nitrate concentration in groundwater increased due to excessive use of fertilizers in many countries el midaoui et al 2002 belkada et al showed that nitrate removal decreased in higher feed concentrations while removal increased over time belkada et al 2018 this was attributed to the dependency of transported number of ions only on feed concentration at specific operating conditions thus higher initial concentrations needed longer treatment times bhadja et al showed that when initial arsenic v concentration was increased from 200 to 800 µg l feed salinity 0 5 g l nacl the time to reach the arsenic guideline value increased from 25 to 45 minutes the impact of increased arsenic concentration on removal in brackish water was not investigated in this study bhadja et al 2016 different initial fluoride concentrations were studied from 120 to 180 mg l in diluate 50 mg l in concentrate where the reported removal of fluoride ranged from 50 to 60 and was relatively constant belkada et al 2018 as these results contradict previous conclusions in nitrate removal in order to understand how removal is affected by fluoride feed concentration experiments with a higher concentration range are required the range of the contaminant concentrations in this study cover the concentrations from guideline values to the higher naturally occurring values see section 1 1 1 6 research questions in this work removal of nitrate arsenic v and fluoride from brackish water was investigated with a focus on the impact of operational ed parameters and water quality on removal the specific research questions are i can ed operational parameters flow rate 30 to 70 l h and electric potential 5 to 25 v enhance the removal of nitrate arsenic v and fluoride from brackish water ii is the removal robust with changing water quality parameters feed ph 2 to 12 salinity 0 to 10 g l nacl and contaminant feed concentration no3 50 to 1500 mg l as v 10 to 1000 µg l f 10 to 250 mg l iii

spacers and titanium oxide electrodes were used deukum germany the membrane stack was assembled with 10 nm torque and not opened during the course of the experiments high transport number physical and chemical strength and low electric resistance compared to other commercial membranes were reasons for selecting amx cmx membranes xu 2005 membrane properties are summarized in table 2 2 3 chemicals and solution chemistry standard contaminant concentrations in experiments were chosen with values of 1 g l nitrate 250 µg l arsenic v and 100 mg l fluoride based on the maximum occurrence examples above and higher than average values mentioned in section 1 1 sodium chloride was added both as the conductivity and for low salinities as a background electrolyte to allow ph changes without ionic

samples and solutions were kept in plastic vials and bottles in a refrigerator at 4 c to avoid bacterial growth 2 4 ed experimental protocol after draining the milli q water from diluate and concentrate tanks the tanks were filled with the feed solutions 5 l pumps were switched on and flowrate control valves were set to the desired value when conductivity of the solution in the ed stack was the same as the tanks a few seconds after start up the dc power supply was switched on and connected to the ed stack samples 20 ml were collected every 20 minutes from the diluate and concentrate tanks the experiments were stopped when the electric current stabilized at 0 09 a and for cases without nacl the experiments were stopped after 60 minutes the temperature of the solutions was maintained at 22 1 c for all experiments 5 l of electrode rinse solution 10 g l na2so4 with the same flow rate as that of the experiment was used to avoid pressure differences between different compartments system cleaning after each experiment the concentrate and diluate tanks were drained and filled with deionized water ec 5 0 µs cm the ed stack was then flushed with milli q water until the conductivity of solutions inside the membrane stack reached 5 0 µs cm to ensure membrane stack performance stability over the entire period of running the experiments salinity rejection of the ed stack in similar operative parameters 15 v 50 l h and water quality 5 g l nacl 1 mm nahco3 ph 8 0 0 5 were compared for three experiments in the beginning middle and end of the project the results are shown in fig si1 2 4 1 limiting current density lcd experiments when electric current over the membrane stack exceeds the limiting current density lcd the diffusion boundary layer over the surface of the membrane is depleted of ions and a further increase in electric current will result in energy loss strathmann 2004b the lcd is controlled by the boundary layer thickness and the mass transfer of ions from the solution to the membrane nakayama et al 2017 the limiting current density was determined as a function of salinity 0 to 10 g l nacl and different flow rates 30 to 70 l h at a given flow rate the electric potential was raised from 1 to 60 v with 1 v steps in 1 minute intervals at ph 8 0 0 5 2 4 2 operative parameters experiments two different sets of experiments were performed for nitrate arsenic v and fluoride separately in each experiment constant concentrations of the contaminant were mixed with 5 g l nacl solution and the experiments were performed at different flowrates 30 to 70 l h and electric potentials 5 to 25 v detailed information of the experiments is shown in table si1 2 4 3 water quality experiments parameters ph salinity and contaminant concentration were examined for each anion to understand dominating removal mechanisms of nitrate arsenic v and fluoride from brackish water salinity 0 to 10 g l nacl initial contaminant concentration nitrate 50 to 1500 mg l arsenic v 50 to 1000 µg l fluoride 10 to 250 mg l and feed ph 2 to 12 of solutions were varying parameters investigated detailed information is shown in table si1 the ph of the diluate and

ms agilent model j8403a 7900 icp ms japan with an internal argon dilution system making it possible for the introduction of high salinity samples with up to 25 total dissolved solids tds to mitigate spectral interference of arcl with same mass as arsenic m z 75 helium collision mode was used moreover separate calibrations were prepared to match the salinity of samples and the effect of water matrix on arsenic analysis was investigated in previous work boussouga et al 2021 for precise quantification an internal standard solution internal standard mix for icp ms systems 5188 6525 agilent was used to correct the variability between samples and calibrations germanium m z 75 was selected for signal correction as the closest element to arsenic arsenic calibration curves are shown in fig si3 2 6 data analysis to determine the lcd the isaacson sonin method was used isaacson and sonin 1976 the current density total current divided by active anion exchange membrane area was measured as a function of applied electric potential across the membrane stack initially the current increased linearly with increasing electric potential ohmic regime while after reaching lcd electric current increased only marginally with increasing electric potential non ohmic regime fig 3 illustrates the procedure of identifying the lcd in the ed system for different salinities and flowrates the theoretical formula for calculating the lcd is shown in eq 1 1 i lim f d i δ d t i m t i b c i b where i lim is the limiting current density a m2 δ d is the thickness of the diffusion boundary layer m f is faraday constant 96485 s a mol t i m and t i b are the ion transport numbers within the membrane and solution where m and b refer to the membrane surface and bulk solution respectively using eq 1 constants in tables 3 and 4 and the experimental results of lcd determination it was possible to determine the diffusion boundary layer thickness for different flowrates malek et al 2013 the ed system performance was quantified with salinity nitrate arsenic v and fluoride removal r s a l i n i t y n i t r a t e a r s e n i c o r f l u o r i d e salinity of the samples was calculated by converting conductivity ms cm to salinity g l by a factor of 0 61 it must be mentioned that electronic conductivity and salinity result from all present ions in the solutions removal is calculated by eq 2 2 r 1 c t c 0 100 where c t and c 0 are final and initial values for salinity g l nacl or contaminant concentration mg l for nitrate and fluoride or µg l for arsenic v respectively to calculate the specific energy consumption sec of the system kwh m3 at different salinities eq 3 was used 3 s e c u i d t v where u is the electric potential v i is the electric current a t is time hour and v is the volume of the treated water l by using eq 3 the energy consumption of the pumps was not considered the number of specific ions transported through the membranes in the time is compared to the supplied charge used in the membrane stack this ratio is called charge efficiency and is calculated by eq 4 lambert et al 2006 4 η i c 0 c t n v f i d t where η i is charge efficiency n is the number of cell pairs t is the time s and v is the total volume of diluate solution l the solute flux of salinity as nacl oh h nitrate arsenic v and fluoride was calculated using eq 5 5 j i v a d c d t where j i is solute flux mol m2s d t and a are time s and the total anion exchange membranes area 0 1 m2 respectively the selectivity values between contaminants and salinity was calculated using eq 6 sato et al 2002 6 s i j j i c j j j c i where s i j is the overall selectivity of membranes between component i and j and c is the concentration in the diluate side of the membranes if the activity of ions is assumed equal to their concentrations and all kinetic coupling between ions is neglected the theoretical ion flux through the ion exchange membrane can be written as eq 7 using the nernst planck equation which is derived from the stefan maxwell equation and the phenomenological description of mass transport strathmann 2004a 7 j i d i d c d x d i z i c i f r t d u d x v c i where d i is the fick s diffusion coefficient of the ion in reference to the water in the membrane m2 s which is related to the stefan maxwell diffusion and phenomenological coefficients z i is valance number of ion r is ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is absolute temperature k and v is the fluid velocity perpendicular to the membrane surface m s the first second and third sections of eq 7 represent diffusion migration and convection respectively as the pressure difference over the membranes is kept as small as possible the velocity of the fluid perpendicular to the membrane surface and subsequently the convention term in eq 7 can be neglected strathmann 2004a error propagation was used to assess the analysis error in the calculated parameters where uncertainties from different sources were accounted for si4 3 results and discussion 3 1 the current voltage curve for lcd determination to avoid working at over limiting current densities causing membrane damage and drastic ph variations it is vital to understand limiting current density for this specific ed system and the different solutions that are to be treated fig 3 shows the lcd determination for different salinities and flowrates the lcd was determined before conducting further experiments in fig 3a lcd was determined by intersecting tangents of linear portions of the corresponding i v curves increasing the salinity from zero to 10 g l nacl changed the lcd drastically however variations of flowrate in the system limitations between 30 to 70 l h did not impact lcd considerably yet small increases in lcd were observed fig 3b these results are in accordance with experimental results from nakayama et al nakayama et al 2017 in which it was suggested that lcd in membrane stacks with spacers was more sensitive to diluate concentration compared to flowrate of the solutions to avoid working at over limiting currents 15 v and 50 l h were chosen as the standard electric potential and flowrate in the following experiments 3 2 operational parameters electric potential increased electric potential leads to higher electrochemical potential over the membrane stack subsequently higher removal values are observed min and kim 2013 patel et al 2020 walker et al 2014b however the impact of electric potential depends on different ion characteristics i e hydrated radius charge ion mobility karimi and ghassemi 2015 removal of nitrate arsenic v fluoride and salinity at different electric potentials 5 to 25 v was investigated to understand the extent to which ion characteristics contribute fig 4 in fig 4a the removal followed the order of arsenic v fluoride salinity nitrate over the studied range of electric potential this was in accordance with the order of the ionic mobility and diffusivity table 4 of the ions in water higher ionic mobility of nitrate and chloride resulted in nearly complete removal at 15 v after 1 hour the higher electric potentials 15 v also led to higher removal of arsenic v this was in accordance with previous studies karimi and ghassemi 2016 kikhavani et al 2014 where it was suggested that the selectivity selective removal of a specific ion compared to others of ed process reduces as electric potential increases the electrodialysis selectivity between contaminants and salinity was calculated with eq 6 and presented in table 5 while nitrate selectivity decreased at higher electric potentials arsenic v and fluoride selectivity increased except at 10 v for fluoride the selectivity approached one as potential increased as seen in previous studies as the nacl concentration in the feed solutions were 5 g l in these experiments the time to achieve the desired electric current over the membrane stack 0 09 a was dependent only on the electric potential decreasing from 3 6 hours at 5 v to 1 1 hour at 25 v fig 4b concentration of contaminants in diluate over time is presented in fig si4 3 3 operational parameters flow rate increasing flowrate reduces the boundary layer thickness and residence time of the solution in the membrane stack influencing the removal of contaminants to better understand the removal mechanisms of nitrate arsenic v and fluoride experiments were conducted at different flow rates 30 to 70 l h salinity nitrate and fluoride removal improved slightly as the flowrate increased from 30 to 70 l h nitrate 95 6 to 99 0 and fluoride 80 4 to 87 9 fig 5 a the amount of available nitrate and fluoride ions for transport was the limiting factor in removal at higher flowrates with decrease of boundary layer thickness from 95 to 55 µm calculated using eq 1 and lcd values from fig 3b and a subsequent increase in available ions an increase in removal was observed this was in accordance with a previous study el midaoui et al 2002 however arsenic v removal was not limited only by the amount of available ions but also by its low diffusion in water which caused the solution to be discharged before arsenic v could be removed at high flowrates 50 l h due to the low solution residence time in the membrane stack fig 5a different ionic characteristics of nitrate fluoride and arsenic v see table 4 explain the different removal trends multivalent and less mobile arsenic v ion could not transfer to the concentrate side while highly mobile nitrate and fluoride ions could compensate for the shortened residence time of the solution in the membrane stack this optimal flowrate was observed previously in removal of chloride and nitrate anions in separate studies karimi et al 2018 zhang and chen 2016 at higher flowrates the process time decreased slightly as seen in fig 5b these results were in accordance with a previous study from kim et al that the electrodialysis process is hardly improved with flowrate increase in the ohmic regime kim et al 2011 concentration of anions in diluate over time is presented in fig si4 3 4 water quality parameters ph the charge of the arsenic v and fluoride species are dependent on the ph of the solution while nitrate charge does not change with ph fig 1 given that ionic charge and properties table 4 affect transport in ed the effect of feed ph 2 12 on removal of contaminants is investigated fig 6 while nitrate removal was not ph dependent arsenic v removal was significantly decreased by increasing ph 9 and fluoride removal decreased only slightly at high ph fig 6a arsenic v removal showed three stages with rising ph decreasing from 72 ph 2 to 12 ph 12 this was explained by the increased hydration and decreased ionic mobility and diffusivity of the arsenic v species at high ph fig 1 and table 4 ortega et al 2017 and higher selectivity of the membranes for monovalent ions the dominant arsenic v specie in acidic ph was the monovalent arsenic v with the highest diffusivity and lowest hydration number this made the migration through the anion exchange membrane harder for the ion as hydration energy increased and more energy was needed to strip arsenic v from its corresponding water molecules these observations were in accordance with a recent study epsztein et al 2019 suggesting that it was more favourable for ions with lower hydration energy to be absorbed to the surface of the ion exchange membrane as shown in fig 6b the higher concentration and subsequently higher molar flux of hydroxide ions in basic conditions ph 9 had a negative impact on arsenic v molar flux while nitrate and fluoride molar flux values were not affected contaminant concentrations and ph variations over time in the diluate are shown in fig si5 3 5 water quality parameters salinity the salinity of groundwater may vary with excessive exploitation rainfall and due to various other reasons such as seawater intrusion or rise in sea levels in consequence it was necessary to understand how salinity variations affected contaminant removal in ed rising salinity had little impact on nitrate removal as the ionic characteristics of nitrate ions were similar to chloride ions fig 7 a for arsenic v and fluoride where ionic mobility and diffusivity were lower compared to chloride removal was affected significantly reduction from 85 to 25 for arsenic v and 94 to 72 for fluoride the molar flux of arsenic v and fluoride decreased with increased salinity where salinity molar flux increased linearly as nacl concentration was increased fig 7b both observations could be explained by eq 7 considering that both diffusivity and concentration are main factors in transport of ions with higher nacl concentrations more chloride was available for transport arsenic v and fluoride removal was lowered due to the competition of abundant chloride ions contaminant concentration over time is shown in fig si6 using eq 3 the sec of the ed system for feed salinities of 1 2 5 5 and 10 g l nacl was 0 8 2 0 3 9 and 7 5 kwh m3 with salinity removals of 99 97 96 and 93 after 1 hour respectively the rising salinity increased the sec significantly fig 8 as more ions were available to be transported through the membranes karimi et al 2015 at the same time charge efficiency of the system for salinity removal decreased steadily from 93 6 at 1 g l to 84 5 at 10 g l the diminishing charge efficiency at higher salinities was attributed to i co ion transport and ii back diffusion of ions patel et al 2020 3 6 water quality parameters contaminant concentration to understand how feed concentration affects contaminant removal experiments in different concentration ranges were conducted fig 9 a shows removal at different feed concentrations normal concentrations are indicated in cyan colour feed concentration did not influence removal of the contaminants fig 9a removal of arsenic v was consistently lower than that of nitrate and fluoride higher feed concentrations resulted in an increase of molar flux higher feed concentrations of contaminants translated to increased concentration in the diluate thus longer operations or higher membrane surface area are required to achieve the guideline value salinity removal was constant in varying contaminant feed concentrations fig 9b considering that salinity comes from both the contaminants and nacl this indicated that the desalination process is independent of contaminants feed concentration as long as the salinity is not increased significantly by the contaminant nitrate showed high removal in all conditions and guideline values were achieved in all experiments contaminant concentration as a function of time is shown in fig si7 while higher electric potentials may be more costly removal and selectivity of arsenic v anions compared to salinity were increased further feed ph reduction could increase arsenic v removal from brackish waters by ed while increasing salinity will delay the removal of fluoride and arsenic v ions and increase the operation time some ions that tend to be removed well by nanofiltration nf e g fluoride and arsenic v cannot be removed by ed very well while removal of ions that permeate easily through nf membranes e g no3 is consistently high by ed the nitrate guideline was met in all experiments while arsenic v concentration was only able to reach the less stringent bangladesh guideline in absence of salinity 0 g l nacl and highest electric potential 25 v the fluoride guideline could not be met see supporting information section 5 4 conclusions this study investigated the application of a batch type ed system for immediate desalination and decontamination of synthetic brackish groundwater over a broad range of operational electric potential 5 25 v and flow rate 30 70 l h and water quality parameters ph 2 12 feed salinity 0 10 g l nacl and contaminant concentration no3 5 0 1500 mg l as v 10 1000 µg l f 10 250 mg l the removal of contaminants followed the order no3 salinity f as v the increasing electric potential 5 25 v led to higher arsenic v removal 3 83 while ed had selective nitrate removal at low electric potential 15 v nitrate and fluoride removal increased slightly with higher flow rate while arsenic v removal showed a weak maximum at 50 l h arsenic v removal was ph and subsequently speciation dependent with high removal 72 at ph 2 while removal of nitrate and fluoride was ph independent with increasing feed water salinity 0 10 g l nacl nitrate removal was not affected 94 however arsenic v and fluoride removal was reduced with rising salinity 85 25 for arsenic v and 94 72 for fluoride suggesting that rising salinity of groundwater will affect contaminant removal in ed higher feed concentrations led to higher final contaminant concentrations in the diluate this study showed that ionic characteristics of contaminants determine their removal by ed while operative higher electric potential and flow rate and feed water quality modifications acidic ph can improve contaminant removal nitrate was removed below who guidelines in all experiments highlighting the effectiveness of ed as a denitrification process supporting information si
