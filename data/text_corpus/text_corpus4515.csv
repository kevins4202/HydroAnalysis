22575,an experiment is performed of the ultimate strength an inland catamaran subjected to a vertical bending moment and a finite element analysis of the scaled model is also conducted the inland vessels are designed with a shallow draught and a relatively small section modulus and moment of inertia of the hull cross section which makes the ultimate longitudinal strength much more critical in structural behaviour in severe weather conditions a large scale specimen is designed employing the scaling laws and the linear finite element static analysis during the experiment the load displacement and strain data overall and local structural collapse are recorded the experimental results are compared with the finite element simulations and a good agreement is achieved between the experimental and numerical results of the large scale specimen and prototype ship of the catamaran the established procedure for estimating the ultimate strength of the catamaran is proven to be accurate the improvement of the ship ultimate longitudinal strength is also presented keywords ultimate strength longitudinal bending catamaran shallow draught experiment finite element method 1 introduction catamarans are built with twin hulls connected by bridging structures having a wide deck space to carry containers the inland ships are designed with a limited draught due to the shallow water in the inland waterways the specific future inland ships require an appropriate design solution structural arrangements and strength assessments accounting for the shallow draught condition see fig 1 the catamaran hull structure is subjected to the usual vertical bending moment in hogging and sagging conditions and to the ship specific transverse bending moment due to the side load and twin hull torsional moment along with the ship lr 2016 ccs 2016 following the specifications of the china classification society rules ccs 2016 the structural design of new catamarans operating in the yangtze river with a length exceeding 60 m need to account for the specific operational conditions and requires specific treatment for the ship analysed here direct calculation approaches are used in defining the design load carrying capacity in this respect the ultimate limit state criteria based on the ultimate strength assessment may be employed to define an economical design solution while maintaining an adequate level of structural safety during the service life very few large scale experiments were conducted to assess the ultimate strength of ship hull structures in the last decades dow 1991 conducted a 1 3 scale model test to assess the ultimate bending moment of a typical warship hull structure in sagging condition considering the initial imperfections and residual stresses during the construction yao et al 2002 conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the ultimate strength of 1 10 scale ship hull girder specimens subjected to pure vertical bending the experiments revealed that the overall collapse of hull girders was caused by the buckling collapse of the deck plates and the local buckling of the upper side shell plates under sagging condition sun and guedes soares 2003 conducted large scale box girder specimen experiments to investigate the ultimate torsional strength of a hull girder with a large deck opening the hull girder collapsed nearby the abrupt section of the deck accompanied by buckling of the side shell plating shi and wang 2012 reported an experimental investigation of the ultimate longitudinal strength of a 1 20 scale container ship hull structure subjected to vertical hogging bending moment the scale model was designed employing the similarity of the section modulus and local buckling and a good agreement was achieved between the ultimate strength of the large scale specimen and the prototype ship however the large scale specimen was designed as a single hull structure which differs from the real ship designed as a double hull structure thus the derived scaling relationships were limited to relatively simple structures due to the difference in the structural configuration moreover the experimental results of the single hull structure specimen demonstrated the inability to simulate the overall collapse mode of the real double hull ship structure recently liu et al 2018 described an experimental test to examine the ultimate strength of a 1 8 scale small waterplane area twin hull swath prototype ship subjected to transverse loads the large scale specimen included all principal structural components of the real ship and close similarity in the structural behaviour was achieved between the large scale specimen and the prototype ship the twin hull structure collapsed during the incremental progressive transverse bending creating buckling and large plastic hinges most of the experimental studies on the ultimate strength published in the literature are relevant to the standard structural components in ship structures such as stiffened panels tanaka and endo 1988 ghavami and khedmati 2006 gordo and guedes soares 2008 xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b xu et al 2013 and box girders qi et al 2005 gordo and guedes soares 2009 saad eldeen et al 2011 generally the bulking strength of stiffened plates is strongly affected by the flexural stiffness of the stiffener and the ultimate strength and collapse of box girders subjected to vertical symmetrical bending moment are mainly caused by the buckling and yielding of structural elements in the compressive side of bending analysing the experimental results of large scale specimens allows to validate and calibrate the finite element fe simulations and to establish an fe model that can be further applied to the real scale ship structures some recent fe analyses of the ultimate strength of stiffened plates and box girders can be found in li et al 2017 2018a 2018b and yang et al 2018a 2018b 2019 in intact conditions and even with cracks wang et al 2015 shi et al 2019 in the numerical simulation of the ultimate strength of traditional commercial ships the simplified approaches as stipulated by international association of classification societies iacs are used including the incremental iterative and direct approaches hu et al 2001 ozguc et al 2006 paik et al 2006 2008 amlashi and moan 2009 hussein and guedes soares 2009 saad eldeen et al 2011 benson et al 2013 kim and paik 2017 nevertheless these approaches are limited to evaluate the ultimate longitudinal strength of mono hull ships subjected to a vertical symmetrical bending load the bending moment curvature relationship of a container ship in intact and damage conditions subjected to asymmetrical bending loading has been analysed by gordo and guedes soares 1997 makouei et al 2015 and tekgoz et al 2018 using different approaches to account for the neutral axis translations and rotations the ultimate strength analysis of catamarans is a complex task and the nonlinear finite element method coupled with the experiment is much more appropriate to be used for this purpose amlashi and moan 2008 garbatov et al 2015 mohammed et al 2016 liu et al 2018 swath ships have significantly smaller length deeper draught and greater breadth than equivalent conventional catamarans inducing much larger transverse bending moment it necessitates the investigation on ultimate transverse strength of swath ships liu et al 2018 returning to the study on conventional catamarans the present study is aimed to analyse the ship longitudinal strength since the twin hulls resemble skinnier versions of a conventional monohull it compares the structural characteristics of both types of vessels presenting specific design transformation from conventional catamarans to swath ships in this work the ultimate strength of a shallow draught inland 200 teu container catamaran subjected the sagging vertical bending is investigated the ship is characterised by its slender profile and because of that in the present analysis only the longitudinal strength will be examined the sagging condition is examined experimentally instead of the hogging condition since the compressive strength of the catamaran s single deck is much weaker than the one of the double bottom the ultimate strength of the catamaran under sagging and hogging bending moments are compared numerically the deck hull structure of the catamaran is subjected to a compressive load as a result of the vertical sagging bending moment which is similar to the loading cases of a mono hull ship but somehow different and the twin hull catamaran ship is expected to experience different collapse modes due to the bridge connecting the hulls the transverse strength is a critical factor affecting the design of bridging structures and its contribution to the longitudinal strength has to be paid attention an experiment is conducted here to examine the ultimate longitudinal strength and the collapse mode of a 1 8 scale inland catamaran specimen the large scale specimen is designed by employing the elementary scaling law and the linear static finite element fe analysis the experimentally obtained load displacement relationship ultimate strength and structural collapse modes are compared by the nonlinear finite element analyses using the validated fe model the ultimate longitudinal strength of the real prototype ship of the catamaran is estimated moreover the improvement of the ultimate ship strength is presented controlling the structural weight 2 design of the ship model 2 1 scaling law an elementary scaling approach is used to design the large scale specimen of a catamaran satisfying the similarity of structural geometry and subjected load concerning a prototype ship the scaling variables identified here are the bending moment m acting force f length l and plate thickness t for thin walled structures the scaling of the plate thickness differs from the scale factor of the length for example li et al 2014 the ship hull can be considered as a thin walled box beam with non constant cross sections and thus the beam theory may be adopted to derive the similarity relationships between the large scale specimen and the prototype ship and the stress scaling factor is expressed as 1 c σ c m c l 2 c t and c σ c f c l c t where c σ σ p s σ l s s c l l p s l l s s c t t p s t l s s c m m p s m l s s and c f f p s f l s s where σ is the resulting stress the subscripts p s and l s s represent the prototype ship and the large scale specimen respectively moreover the steel material properties i e young s modulus e 210 gpa and poisson s ratio v 0 3 are identical in the large scale specimen and the prototype ship the geometric scale of the cross section the sectional moment of inertia and the position of the neutral axis are defined as 2 i p s i l s s c l 3 c t and e p s e l s s c l where i p s and i l s s are the cross sectional moments of inertia of prototype ship and large scale specimen respectively e p s and e l s s are the height of the neutral axis of prototype ship and large scale specimen respectively when the ship hull represented by the large scale specimen or by the prototype ship is subjected to a vertical sagging bending moment the collapse of the ship hull girder will occur between two adjacent transverse frames being induced by the buckling collapse of panels subjected to a compressive load the progressive collapse of the ship hull structure is highly nonlinear and thus the similarity law of the structural buckling will be discussed later 2 2 specimen scantlings too small specimens lead to some difficulties in the manufacturing process and as a result of the weld induced distortions and residual stresses an unreasonable experimental result may occur so the intention here is to define the size of the specimen adequate to the capacity of the testing machine and to be sufficiently big to produce good experimental results the scantling of the large scale specimen is determined employing the scaling laws in eq 2 the most economical and feasible design solution for the large scale specimen is the length scale of 1 8 and the plate thickness scale of about 1 4 the principal dimensions of the large scale specimen and the prototype ship are shown in table 1 and their geometrical descriptors are presented in figs 2 and 3 both the prototype ship and the large scale specimen are built of mild steel the structural components of the large scale specimen are built of 2 5 and 3 0 mm plates l40 25 3 mm angle bar and φ10 mm round bar the stiffener spacing and scantlings of the hull structure of the prototype ship are relatively small and if the geometrical similarity is used to determine the size of the stiffeners in the large scale specimen the stiffeners will be too small and it will be challenging to control the weld induced distortions and residual stresses during the manufacturing process following the shipbuilding practice the stiffener spacing should be not less than 150 mm when plates of a thickness of 2 3 mm are welded thus three transverse frames of the prototype ship are merged into one frame in the large scale specimen i e the frame spacing of the prototype ship and large scale specimen are 0 6 and 0 225 m respectively see fig 3 the merged stiffeners are smeared into the attached plates so that the attached plate thickness is increased to 3 0 mm in the large scale specimen moreover the longitudinal stiffeners of the large scale specimen are positioned at the locations of prototype ship longitudinal girders omitting the prototype ship longitudinals some longitudinal stiffeners are smeared into the attached plates increasing the plate thickness in the large scale specimen the cross sectional areas of the longitudinal stiffeners are determined by scaling the sectional moment of the inertia and the height of the neutral axis eq 2 the longitudinal distribution of the vertical bending moment applied to the large scale specimen follows the distribution of the wave induced bending moments as defined by the classification society rules lr 2016 ccs 2016 where the constant maximum value is taken along the ship length between 0 4 l r and 0 65 l r rule length l r l pp to generate a four point bending load two acting forces and two reaction forces are considered the acting forces are subjected to the transverse bulkheads installed at fr 20 and 35 and two simple supports are mounted on the bow and stern of the large scale specimen where the reaction forces are estimated as can be seen in fig 4 to present the geometrical characteristics of the prototype ship and large scale specimen several selected sections are shown in figs 2 and 3 the prototype ship and large scale specimen have 167 and 55 frames along the length respectively the prototype ship s outer hulls main and wet decks longitudinal and transverse bulkheads longitudinal girders transverse web frames and pillars are scaled and built in the large scale specimen according to the scaling laws eq 2 the scaling factors of the height of the neutral axis and the sectional moment of inertia are 1 8 and 1 2 048 respectively the section properties of the already manufactured large scale specimen and prototype ship have the scaling estimates shown in table 2 the difference between the heights of the neutral axis and the sectional moments of inertia are less than 5 0 2 3 design validation of large scale specimen linear static analyses are firstly performed employing the msc nastran finite element solver to evaluate the structural behaviour of the prototype ship and large scale specimen concerning their similarity in the longitudinal elastic strength the entire structure of the prototype ship and the large scale specimen are modelled and a four point bending load is generated as can be seen in fig 4 the bow and stern are simply supported and the vertical bending moment is imposed by two concentrated forces subjected at about 0 40 l r and 0 67 l r i e fr 20 and 35 in the large scale specimen and fr 65 and 111 in the prototype ship the load location point of 0 67 l r differs slightly from the one defined by the rules at 0 65 l r since the loads have to be applied at the transverse bulkhead of the large scale specimen the four point bending load simulates well the ship structural behaviour subjected to a vertical sagging bending moment the applied acting force f 1 for the large scale specimen and the prototype ship is 42 3 and 1354 kn respectively satisfying the load scale of 1 32 and thus the stresses on the large scale specimen should keep consistent with the ones on the prototype ship eq 1 the finite element model of the prototype ship is generated by shell and beam elements but one of the large scale specimens is only modelled by shell elements due to the relatively large stiffeners of the structural components the fe model of the prototype ship consists of 29 371 nodes 33 052 shell elements and 21 444 beam elements and the one of test model consists of 20 293 nodes and 23 598 shell elements the finite element size of the prototype ship and the large scale specimen are about 600 and 75 mm respectively the von mises stress distributions of the large scale specimen and the prototype ship are shown in fig 5 the von mises stresses estimated at four key points of the midship as indicated in fig 5 are shown in table 3 the difference between the von mises stresses estimated for the large scale specimen and prototype ship is less than 5 0 the stress distribution is identical indicating that the large scale specimen can represent the structural behaviour of the prototype ship 3 experiment 3 1 experimental setup the ultimate longitudinal strength of the large scale specimen subjected to vertical sagging bending moments is evaluated the setup of a four point bending test is presented in fig 6 and the hydraulic cylinders and displacement transducers are indicated in fig 7 seven displacement transducers are installed below each mono hull bottom along the length to measure the vertical displacement of the large scale specimen the bow and stern of the large scale specimen are placed respectively on a φ50 mm round steel bar supported by a rigid structural base see fig 8 simulating a simply supported condition and the acting loads are applied by hydraulic cylinders at fr 20 and 35 0 40 l r and 0 67 l r the locations of the bow and stern supports are presented in fig 6b the top of the cylinders is supported by horizontal beams and the bottom of the cylinders imposes a uniform load on a plate with a thickness of 10 mm mounted above the transverse bulkhead see fig 7 the plate serves to distribute the load avoiding stress concentrations on the deck for the two acting load positions ten hydraulic cylinders are mounted the synchronisation of the hydraulic cylinders is achieved by controlling the pressure of the oil pumps the arms of the forces applied to fr 20 and 35 to generate a vertical bending moment are 4 840 and 4 075 m respectively the load applied on fr 35 is 1 19 times the one of fr 20 keeping a constant maximum bending moment between fr 20 and 35 the mechanical properties of the steel that is used to build the large scale specimen are defined by quasi static tensile tests see for example liu and guedes soares 2019 the tensile tests are performed using plate specimens of a 2 5 and 3 0 mm thickness following a standard tensile test procedure as described in gb t 228 1 2010 the tensile stress strain relationships are presented in fig 9 the materials of the large scale specimen are identified as mild steel with a yield stress of 255 mpa the strains developed during the test of the large scale specimen are measured by three directional strain gauges a number of strain gauges are mounted on the plate intersections around the midship cross section as shown in fig 10 additional strain gauges are mounted around several cross sections along the length of the large scale specimen the strain gauges are mainly mounted on the portside hull due to the symmetry of the load and geometry of the large scale specimen few strain gauges are also mounted on the starboard hull to verify the test data the weld induced initial imperfections regarding initial distortions and residual stresses were not measured before the experiment it was observed that the main deck was very flat without any visible local distortions the procedure of performing the four point bending moment experimental can be divided into two stages preloading and collapse stage stage 1 the experiment starts by imposing three cycles of loading to eliminate the welding induced residual stresses partially in the large scale specimen during the loading process the linear relationship between load and strain and the repeatability of test data is controlled in order to validate the loading device and data acquisition the maximum load produced per a hydraulic cylinder is about 1 0 t leading to an elastic strain less than the yield strain of tested large scale specimen stage 2 the loads are applied gradually up to the collapse is achieved the strains and displacements are recorded per 0 2 t before the loading is reaching 2 0 t for each hydraulic cylinder and then the data are recorded per 0 05 t until the collapse is achieved 3 2 experimental results 3 2 1 load displacement curve the experimentally applied load versus vertical displacement curve of the large scale specimen is presented in fig 11 a the resulting load is the total load applied by the ten hydraulic cylinders at fr 20 loading position and the resulting vertical displacement is the average of the measurements of two displacement transducers located below the mono hulls at fr 28 see d4 in fig 6 the maximum load carrying capacity of the large scale specimen is 22 7 t resulting in a vertical displacement of 89 2 mm at fr 28 the ultimate bending moment of the large scale specimen can withstand at the midship is 1077 knm 22 7 t 4 84 m 9 8 kn t the load displacement relationship in fig 11a shows an almost linear relationship until the loading force of 20 t after this point the curve shows a noticeable nonlinear relationship with a reduced slope due to the spread of plasticity and buckling in the bottom and deck structures respectively finally the curve reaches its maximum at 22 7 t which is the ultimate load carrying capacity of the large scale specimen as the structure cannot withstand more substantial external loading the bending moment curvature relationship of the large scale specimen is presented in fig 11b the curvature is estimated using the experimental data of the vertical displacements at d3 and d4 in fig 6 the sudden discharges of the load at the collapse stage are not evident when the moment curvature curve is observed the large scale specimen s vertical displacement as a function of the incrementally increased load along the length of the specimen is presented in fig 12 it is noticeable that the vertical displacement increases rapidly once the load reaches 20 t 3 2 2 collapse mode the overall collapse of the large scale specimen is presented in fig 13 the large scale specimen experienced a sudden noisy severe collapse with a great discharge of loads and large plastic displacements due to the formation of plastic hinges in the deck plating located between two adjacent web frames fr 27 and 28 amidships under axial compression it is reasonable that the collapse occurs between fr 27 and 28 which is explained by the fact the most extended hold is located between fr 20 and 35 the collapse mode shows a visible sinusoidal distortion between frames and the axial and rotational deformations are more intense on the deck and uppermost side panels the rest of the structure far from these two frames remained almost flat indicating that no or small plastic deformations occur due to the collapse load the formation of plastic hinges indicates that the axial stresses are close to the yield stress of the material the formation of initial plastic hinges is also associated with the local discharge of loading and then the internal load is redistributed and transferred to the nearest structural components promoting a simultaneous structural collapse the large scale specimen was cut amidships after the test which permits to see the presence of local buckling of the inner structures see fig 14 it can also be seen that the buckling occurs in the transverse frames mono hull inboard and outboard longitudinal stiffeners of the main deck and mono hull inboard the collapse of the stringers fig 14a is associated with the buckling of the main and wet deck some removals of the weld occur in the connection between stringers and wet deck but these weld failures should not be the principal reason for the structural collapse the mono hull inboard presents an uneven deformation due to the local buckling fig 14b tripping and bending occur in the longitudinal girders of the deck and mono hull outboard fig 14c and d 3 2 3 stress the stresses estimated as a function of the resulting force in the cross sections can describe the structural behaviour von mises stresses calculated based on the collected data from the three direction strain gauges mounted at the key points on the fr 22 cross section fig 10 are shown in fig 15 the analysed value takes the material yield stress 255 mpa when exceeding this magnitude the mono hull bottom and main deck are subjected to tension and compression respectively generally the stresses estimated at the key points show a good linear trend in the elastic range the higher stresses are mainly concentrated at the mono hull bottom see points 9 10 and 11 the main deck see points 1 3 and 5 and in the uppermost and lowermost part of mono hull outboard see points 6 and 8 the structure is firstly yielding at the mono hull bottom when the applied load reaches about 20 t at the same time the plate buckling stress decreases at points 1 2 and 4 and the stress increase sharply at point 3 and 5 in the main deck because of the occurrence of local buckling and the redistribution of the internal load however this phenomenon can also be observed in the load displacement relationship where a sharp change occurs at a load of about 20 t see fig 11 afterwards the main deck yields at 22 t and finally the structure of the large scale specimen collapses at the main deck due to the development of large plastic hinges the deck structure cannot withstand more load once it reaches the ultimate strength 4 nonlinear fe analysis of large scale specimen a nonlinear fe analysis of the large scale specimen is performed using the commercial software abaqus version 6 14 the entire large scale specimen is modelled like the one used in section 2 3 see fig 4 the riks arc length control algorithm is employed to solve the static nonlinear problem due to the high level of geometric and material nonlinearities the large displacements and the finite strains are also activated the finite element model is generated using s4r type shell elements this finite element is a 4 node quadrilateral stress displacement shell element with reduced integration and a large strain formulation dassault 2014 in order to analyse the local buckling at least 3 finite elements between longitudinals are generated thus the element size generated here is about 25 mm this mesh density is sufficient to capture the global and the local buckling of plates and stiffeners accurately the finite element model consists of 182 637 nodes and 212 383 shell elements the material properties of the mild steel are defined by an elastic perfectly plastic material model with a yield stress of 255 mpa young s modulus of 210 gpa and poisson s ratio of 0 3 as the initial geometrical imperfections and residual stresses are not measured in the experiment these effects are not considered in the finite element analysis it is assumed that the longitudinal transverse and vertical displacements are constrained at the nodes of the stern structure supported by the round steel bar and the transverse and vertical displacements are constrained at the nodes of the bow structure supported by the round steel bar see fig 4 concentrated loads are applied at the nodes where the hydraulic cylinders are placed fr 20 and 35 the applied force at fr 35 is 1 19 times the one at fr 20 von mises stress contour plots of the large scale specimen at the ultimate load level are shown in fig 16 the maximum stresses are mainly concentrated on the main deck and mono hull bottoms the structure collapses with an overall failure mode in the deck panels under axial compressive load the collapse mode is similar to the one of the typical response of a mono hull girder subjected to a vertical sagging bending moment which results in buckling of deck panels however some discrepancies are observed at the buckling deformation of the main deck which mainly consists of the local plate buckling around the strongly braced longitudinal structures it is mainly because the transverse catamaran structure has a small bending stiffness and the main deck is supported strongly by the inboard and outboard of the mono hulls along the longitudinal direction the experimentally and numerically estimated stresses at ultimate strength collected at the key points as defined in fig 10 are presented in table 4 in the fe analysis the stresses increase almost linearly with the progressive increase of the applied loads agreeing approximately with the experimental results some discrepancies are also noticed in the stresses at some key points of the main deck see points 2 and 4 in table 4 and fig 10 the experimental results show that the stresses of these two points decrease when the load approaches the ultimate load but this phenomenon is not captured by the fe analysis this may be attributed to the fact that the existence of some initial imperfections and residual stresses induce a non uniform axial force in the main deck of the large scale specimen changing the structural buckling mode which was not considered in the fe analysis the stresses of points 12 and 13 increase rapidly when the load is approaching the ultimate load in the experimental results which is also not captured in the fe analysis resulting in smaller stresses at ultimate strength the experimentally and numerically estimated vertical bending moment as a function of the vertical displacement and curvature of the large scale specimen are shown in fig 17 it is considered that the ultimate strength represents the maximum structural capacity that the deck structure can withstand the compressive load it can be seen that the numerically estimated vertical displacement and curvature are much smaller than the experimentally estimated ones and thus the slopes of the moment displacement and curvature curves show apparent differences of elastic stiffness see fig 17 one of the reasons for that is the existence of gaps between the specimen and the supports at the beginning of the experiment resulting in the specimen not being in full contact with the supports during the initial loading process a similar issue is also observed in the compressive test of stiffened panels see fig 12 in kim et al 2009 and fig 20 in xu and guedes soares 2013b the increase in the vertical displacement for the structural supports is restrained until the contact gaps at the structural supports are sufficiently closed the numerically estimated ultimate bending moment is 1149 knm at the vertical displacement of 62 1 mm and the curvature of 0 00083 rad m at the d4 location as can be seen in fig 6 a difference of 6 7 is found between the experimentally and numerically estimated ultimate loads the slightly overestimated ultimate load may be due to the fact that the initial imperfections and residual stresses induced by the welds are not considered in the fe simulation after the collapse the ultimate strength estimated by the fe analysis drops down quicker than the experimental result the post ultimate strength behaviour is that the buckled region spreads rapidly in the collapsed cross section especially over the deck 5 fe analysis of compartment model the simplifications in the fe model are not only to save computation time in further numerical analyses and cost of specimens and their testing but also to validate the numerical results with the experimental ones in the case of a large scale specimen subjected to a pure vertical bending moment 5 1 ultimate longitudinal strength of large scale specimen fe analysis of ship longitudinal strength of the midship cargo hold region is performed here the analysed cargo hold includes the large scale specimen segment between fr 20 and fr 35 0 40 l r to 0 67 l r see fig 3a constraints on the fe nodes of the midship cargo hold region end sections are imposed by surface based kinematic coupling with master nodes at the intersection of the centreline and the elastic neutral axis the translation and rotation of the end plane nodes are controlled by master nodes vertical bending moments are imposed gradually at both master nodes by a master node rotation on the vertical planes in the progressive collapse analysis of the compartment model the resulting bending moment as a function of the curvature in the middle of the midship cargo hold region is shown in fig 18 the estimated ultimate bending moment is about 1160 knm which is very close to the one estimated using the fe model of the entire large scale specimen which is 1149 knm it is demonstrated that the experimental loads simulate well the pure bending of the large scale specimen the analysis of the collapse mode of the midship cargo hold region fe model is presented in fig 19 the finite element analysis of the compartment model shows a very similar collapse mode in comparison with the entire fe model as shown in fig 16 the structural collapse results from the buckling of the deck panels closing to the outboard and inboard of the mono hulls 5 2 ultimate longitudinal strength of the prototype ship the objective of this study is to validate the fe results with experimental ones firstly and then using the validated fe model to analyse the ultimate strength of the prototype ship the midship cargo hold region fe model will be used to analyse the ultimate strength of the prototype ship here the elastic perfectly plastic material model with the yield stress of 235 mpa is defined the estimated vertical bending moment as a function of the curvature of the prototype ship subjected to bending in sagging and hogging are shown in fig 20 and their collapse modes are presented in fig 21 the ultimate strength of the prototype ship under a hogging moment is larger than the one under a sagging moment of about 23 1 the overall collapse of the prototype ship structure in the sagging condition is mainly caused by the axial buckling of the uppermost side plates and the cross section of the deck with the buckled longitudinal girders and the transverse frame structure this collapse of the individual structural components can also be seen in the large scale specimen once it was cut see fig 14a discrepancies in the buckling locations of the main deck are observed between the large scale specimen and prototype ship figs 19a and 21a because some stiffeners were smeared into an additional thickness of the main deck of the large scale specimen in the case of the hogging condition the mono hull bottom panels collapse under axial compression and the longitudinal girders fold at the ultimate strength the collapse mode is very similar to one of the two individual mono hulls subjected to a vertical hogging moment the ultimate loading of the large scale specimen and the prototype ship under sagging condition can be compared to understand the scaling effect of buckling and ultimate strength according to the scaling laws which is based on the linear elastic theory the scaling of bending moment between the prototype ship and its large scale specimen is 256 8 8 4 eq 1 here the resulting ultimate bending moment of the prototype ship and large scale specimens are 248 4 mnm and 1160 knm see figs 18 and 20 respectively and thus the scaling factor of 214 is found the difference of the scaling is mainly because the scaling of the plate thickness of the deck 10 mm 3 mm 3 3 is smaller than 4 0 leading to an increase in the buckling capacity of the large scale specimen another reason is that the material yield stress of the large scale specimen is larger than the one of the prototype ship based on all the experimental and numerical analyses some aspects relevant to the vertical bending and collapse behaviour of the catamaran hull are summarised the experimental and numerical analyses are in close agreement and are thus capable of estimating the ultimate strength of the catamaran it is found that the buckling of the catamaran cross deck structure leads to the flexural collapse of ship hulls 5 3 improvement of ultimate strength the ultimate longitudinal strength of the catamaran can be improved by increasing the plate thickness and or the reinforcement of longitudinal stiffeners and or selecting the higher strength steels for shipbuilding materials the reference catamaran subjected to sagging vertical bending moment presents the most severe load case it has been observed that the buckling occurs at the bridging structure and the uppermost side plates in section 5 2 as the bridging structure is transversely framed the cross deck structure can be strengthened using the longitudinal stiffeners here the first scheme is to add six longitudinal stiffeners on the cross deck see s1 s2 and s3 in fig 22 the ultimate strength can also be improved by increasing the buckling strength of the uppermost side plates and the longitudinal girders thus the second scheme is to add six longitudinal stiffeners on these locations see s4 s5 and s6 in fig 22 finally both reinforcements including s1 to s6 are considered in the third scheme it should be mentioned that the structural weight increases about 0 12 when adding a longitudinal stiffener l100 63 8 along the ship length as the ship will be built using mild steels the other solution is to select the mild steels with higher yield strength in shipbuilding the yield stress of mild steels is possible to reach about 300 mpa thus the material yield stress of 255 mpa 275 mpa and 295 mpa are selected to compare with the reference model with a minimum yield stress of 235 mpa the numerical results are presented in table 5 it is observed that the longitudinal stiffeners added at the relative weak locations can increase the ultimate strength of the catamaran for example the ultimate strength increases by about 14 when the structural weight increases by about 0 72 case 1 this case presents one of the best solutions based on the strength to weight ratio it illustrates that the transversely framed bridging structure gives relatively low ultimate longitudinal strength under a sagging moment on the other hand the ultimate strength of the catamaran increases with the material yield stress see table 5 6 conclusions finite element and experimental analyses of the ultimate longitudinal strength of the catamaran subjected to the vertical sagging bending moment have been performed in this study the ultimate bending moment analysed by numerical simulation is in good agreement with the experimental one the procedure provided for evaluating experimentally and numerically the ultimate strength of multi hull prototype ships has proven to be acceptable it is found that the buckling strength of the deck structure plays an essential role in the overall collapse of catamaran subjected to a vertical sagging bending moment the buckling deformation of the prototype ship is mainly concentrated on the cross deck structure presenting the weaker compressive strength location compared to the deck structure of the mono hulls the midship cargo hold region fe model has been used to analyse the ultimate longitudinal strength and the archived results are similar to the one of the entire prototype ship fe model the comparison of the ultimate strength of the large scale specimen and the prototype ship demonstrates the drawback of the scaling design based on the linear elastic theory it is concluded that a good solution in estimating the ultimate strength of the prototype ship is to use the finite element method validated by the experimental results one of the best design solutions for improving the ultimate longitudinal strength of the catamaran is to reinforce the longitudinal stiffeners at the cross deck structure or to use the mild steels with higher yield stress the catamaran is not always subjected to a symmetrical bending moment and thus further experiments need to be performed to assess the ship structural behaviour under asymmetrical bending loadings as

22575,an experiment is performed of the ultimate strength an inland catamaran subjected to a vertical bending moment and a finite element analysis of the scaled model is also conducted the inland vessels are designed with a shallow draught and a relatively small section modulus and moment of inertia of the hull cross section which makes the ultimate longitudinal strength much more critical in structural behaviour in severe weather conditions a large scale specimen is designed employing the scaling laws and the linear finite element static analysis during the experiment the load displacement and strain data overall and local structural collapse are recorded the experimental results are compared with the finite element simulations and a good agreement is achieved between the experimental and numerical results of the large scale specimen and prototype ship of the catamaran the established procedure for estimating the ultimate strength of the catamaran is proven to be accurate the improvement of the ship ultimate longitudinal strength is also presented keywords ultimate strength longitudinal bending catamaran shallow draught experiment finite element method 1 introduction catamarans are built with twin hulls connected by bridging structures having a wide deck space to carry containers the inland ships are designed with a limited draught due to the shallow water in the inland waterways the specific future inland ships require an appropriate design solution structural arrangements and strength assessments accounting for the shallow draught condition see fig 1 the catamaran hull structure is subjected to the usual vertical bending moment in hogging and sagging conditions and to the ship specific transverse bending moment due to the side load and twin hull torsional moment along with the ship lr 2016 ccs 2016 following the specifications of the china classification society rules ccs 2016 the structural design of new catamarans operating in the yangtze river with a length exceeding 60 m need to account for the specific operational conditions and requires specific treatment for the ship analysed here direct calculation approaches are used in defining the design load carrying capacity in this respect the ultimate limit state criteria based on the ultimate strength assessment may be employed to define an economical design solution while maintaining an adequate level of structural safety during the service life very few large scale experiments were conducted to assess the ultimate strength of ship hull structures in the last decades dow 1991 conducted a 1 3 scale model test to assess the ultimate bending moment of a typical warship hull structure in sagging condition considering the initial imperfections and residual stresses during the construction yao et al 2002 conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the ultimate strength of 1 10 scale ship hull girder specimens subjected to pure vertical bending the experiments revealed that the overall collapse of hull girders was caused by the buckling collapse of the deck plates and the local buckling of the upper side shell plates under sagging condition sun and guedes soares 2003 conducted large scale box girder specimen experiments to investigate the ultimate torsional strength of a hull girder with a large deck opening the hull girder collapsed nearby the abrupt section of the deck accompanied by buckling of the side shell plating shi and wang 2012 reported an experimental investigation of the ultimate longitudinal strength of a 1 20 scale container ship hull structure subjected to vertical hogging bending moment the scale model was designed employing the similarity of the section modulus and local buckling and a good agreement was achieved between the ultimate strength of the large scale specimen and the prototype ship however the large scale specimen was designed as a single hull structure which differs from the real ship designed as a double hull structure thus the derived scaling relationships were limited to relatively simple structures due to the difference in the structural configuration moreover the experimental results of the single hull structure specimen demonstrated the inability to simulate the overall collapse mode of the real double hull ship structure recently liu et al 2018 described an experimental test to examine the ultimate strength of a 1 8 scale small waterplane area twin hull swath prototype ship subjected to transverse loads the large scale specimen included all principal structural components of the real ship and close similarity in the structural behaviour was achieved between the large scale specimen and the prototype ship the twin hull structure collapsed during the incremental progressive transverse bending creating buckling and large plastic hinges most of the experimental studies on the ultimate strength published in the literature are relevant to the standard structural components in ship structures such as stiffened panels tanaka and endo 1988 ghavami and khedmati 2006 gordo and guedes soares 2008 xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b xu et al 2013 and box girders qi et al 2005 gordo and guedes soares 2009 saad eldeen et al 2011 generally the bulking strength of stiffened plates is strongly affected by the flexural stiffness of the stiffener and the ultimate strength and collapse of box girders subjected to vertical symmetrical bending moment are mainly caused by the buckling and yielding of structural elements in the compressive side of bending analysing the experimental results of large scale specimens allows to validate and calibrate the finite element fe simulations and to establish an fe model that can be further applied to the real scale ship structures some recent fe analyses of the ultimate strength of stiffened plates and box girders can be found in li et al 2017 2018a 2018b and yang et al 2018a 2018b 2019 in intact conditions and even with cracks wang et al 2015 shi et al 2019 in the numerical simulation of the ultimate strength of traditional commercial ships the simplified approaches as stipulated by international association of classification societies iacs are used including the incremental iterative and direct approaches hu et al 2001 ozguc et al 2006 paik et al 2006 2008 amlashi and moan 2009 hussein and guedes soares 2009 saad eldeen et al 2011 benson et al 2013 kim and paik 2017 nevertheless these approaches are limited to evaluate the ultimate longitudinal strength of mono hull ships subjected to a vertical symmetrical bending load the bending moment curvature relationship of a container ship in intact and damage conditions subjected to asymmetrical bending loading has been analysed by gordo and guedes soares 1997 makouei et al 2015 and tekgoz et al 2018 using different approaches to account for the neutral axis translations and rotations the ultimate strength analysis of catamarans is a complex task and the nonlinear finite element method coupled with the experiment is much more appropriate to be used for this purpose amlashi and moan 2008 garbatov et al 2015 mohammed et al 2016 liu et al 2018 swath ships have significantly smaller length deeper draught and greater breadth than equivalent conventional catamarans inducing much larger transverse bending moment it necessitates the investigation on ultimate transverse strength of swath ships liu et al 2018 returning to the study on conventional catamarans the present study is aimed to analyse the ship longitudinal strength since the twin hulls resemble skinnier versions of a conventional monohull it compares the structural characteristics of both types of vessels presenting specific design transformation from conventional catamarans to swath ships in this work the ultimate strength of a shallow draught inland 200 teu container catamaran subjected the sagging vertical bending is investigated the ship is characterised by its slender profile and because of that in the present analysis only the longitudinal strength will be examined the sagging condition is examined experimentally instead of the hogging condition since the compressive strength of the catamaran s single deck is much weaker than the one of the double bottom the ultimate strength of the catamaran under sagging and hogging bending moments are compared numerically the deck hull structure of the catamaran is subjected to a compressive load as a result of the vertical sagging bending moment which is similar to the loading cases of a mono hull ship but somehow different and the twin hull catamaran ship is expected to experience different collapse modes due to the bridge connecting the hulls the transverse strength is a critical factor affecting the design of bridging structures and its contribution to the longitudinal strength has to be paid attention an experiment is conducted here to examine the ultimate longitudinal strength and the collapse mode of a 1 8 scale inland catamaran specimen the large scale specimen is designed by employing the elementary scaling law and the linear static finite element fe analysis the experimentally obtained load displacement relationship ultimate strength and structural collapse modes are compared by the nonlinear finite element analyses using the validated fe model the ultimate longitudinal strength of the real prototype ship of the catamaran is estimated moreover the improvement of the ultimate ship strength is presented controlling the structural weight 2 design of the ship model 2 1 scaling law an elementary scaling approach is used to design the large scale specimen of a catamaran satisfying the similarity of structural geometry and subjected load concerning a prototype ship the scaling variables identified here are the bending moment m acting force f length l and plate thickness t for thin walled structures the scaling of the plate thickness differs from the scale factor of the length for example li et al 2014 the ship hull can be considered as a thin walled box beam with non constant cross sections and thus the beam theory may be adopted to derive the similarity relationships between the large scale specimen and the prototype ship and the stress scaling factor is expressed as 1 c σ c m c l 2 c t and c σ c f c l c t where c σ σ p s σ l s s c l l p s l l s s c t t p s t l s s c m m p s m l s s and c f f p s f l s s where σ is the resulting stress the subscripts p s and l s s represent the prototype ship and the large scale specimen respectively moreover the steel material properties i e young s modulus e 210 gpa and poisson s ratio v 0 3 are identical in the large scale specimen and the prototype ship the geometric scale of the cross section the sectional moment of inertia and the position of the neutral axis are defined as 2 i p s i l s s c l 3 c t and e p s e l s s c l where i p s and i l s s are the cross sectional moments of inertia of prototype ship and large scale specimen respectively e p s and e l s s are the height of the neutral axis of prototype ship and large scale specimen respectively when the ship hull represented by the large scale specimen or by the prototype ship is subjected to a vertical sagging bending moment the collapse of the ship hull girder will occur between two adjacent transverse frames being induced by the buckling collapse of panels subjected to a compressive load the progressive collapse of the ship hull structure is highly nonlinear and thus the similarity law of the structural buckling will be discussed later 2 2 specimen scantlings too small specimens lead to some difficulties in the manufacturing process and as a result of the weld induced distortions and residual stresses an unreasonable experimental result may occur so the intention here is to define the size of the specimen adequate to the capacity of the testing machine and to be sufficiently big to produce good experimental results the scantling of the large scale specimen is determined employing the scaling laws in eq 2 the most economical and feasible design solution for the large scale specimen is the length scale of 1 8 and the plate thickness scale of about 1 4 the principal dimensions of the large scale specimen and the prototype ship are shown in table 1 and their geometrical descriptors are presented in figs 2 and 3 both the prototype ship and the large scale specimen are built of mild steel the structural components of the large scale specimen are built of 2 5 and 3 0 mm plates l40 25 3 mm angle bar and φ10 mm round bar the stiffener spacing and scantlings of the hull structure of the prototype ship are relatively small and if the geometrical similarity is used to determine the size of the stiffeners in the large scale specimen the stiffeners will be too small and it will be challenging to control the weld induced distortions and residual stresses during the manufacturing process following the shipbuilding practice the stiffener spacing should be not less than 150 mm when plates of a thickness of 2 3 mm are welded thus three transverse frames of the prototype ship are merged into one frame in the large scale specimen i e the frame spacing of the prototype ship and large scale specimen are 0 6 and 0 225 m respectively see fig 3 the merged stiffeners are smeared into the attached plates so that the attached plate thickness is increased to 3 0 mm in the large scale specimen moreover the longitudinal stiffeners of the large scale specimen are positioned at the locations of prototype ship longitudinal girders omitting the prototype ship longitudinals some longitudinal stiffeners are smeared into the attached plates increasing the plate thickness in the large scale specimen the cross sectional areas of the longitudinal stiffeners are determined by scaling the sectional moment of the inertia and the height of the neutral axis eq 2 the longitudinal distribution of the vertical bending moment applied to the large scale specimen follows the distribution of the wave induced bending moments as defined by the classification society rules lr 2016 ccs 2016 where the constant maximum value is taken along the ship length between 0 4 l r and 0 65 l r rule length l r l pp to generate a four point bending load two acting forces and two reaction forces are considered the acting forces are subjected to the transverse bulkheads installed at fr 20 and 35 and two simple supports are mounted on the bow and stern of the large scale specimen where the reaction forces are estimated as can be seen in fig 4 to present the geometrical characteristics of the prototype ship and large scale specimen several selected sections are shown in figs 2 and 3 the prototype ship and large scale specimen have 167 and 55 frames along the length respectively the prototype ship s outer hulls main and wet decks longitudinal and transverse bulkheads longitudinal girders transverse web frames and pillars are scaled and built in the large scale specimen according to the scaling laws eq 2 the scaling factors of the height of the neutral axis and the sectional moment of inertia are 1 8 and 1 2 048 respectively the section properties of the already manufactured large scale specimen and prototype ship have the scaling estimates shown in table 2 the difference between the heights of the neutral axis and the sectional moments of inertia are less than 5 0 2 3 design validation of large scale specimen linear static analyses are firstly performed employing the msc nastran finite element solver to evaluate the structural behaviour of the prototype ship and large scale specimen concerning their similarity in the longitudinal elastic strength the entire structure of the prototype ship and the large scale specimen are modelled and a four point bending load is generated as can be seen in fig 4 the bow and stern are simply supported and the vertical bending moment is imposed by two concentrated forces subjected at about 0 40 l r and 0 67 l r i e fr 20 and 35 in the large scale specimen and fr 65 and 111 in the prototype ship the load location point of 0 67 l r differs slightly from the one defined by the rules at 0 65 l r since the loads have to be applied at the transverse bulkhead of the large scale specimen the four point bending load simulates well the ship structural behaviour subjected to a vertical sagging bending moment the applied acting force f 1 for the large scale specimen and the prototype ship is 42 3 and 1354 kn respectively satisfying the load scale of 1 32 and thus the stresses on the large scale specimen should keep consistent with the ones on the prototype ship eq 1 the finite element model of the prototype ship is generated by shell and beam elements but one of the large scale specimens is only modelled by shell elements due to the relatively large stiffeners of the structural components the fe model of the prototype ship consists of 29 371 nodes 33 052 shell elements and 21 444 beam elements and the one of test model consists of 20 293 nodes and 23 598 shell elements the finite element size of the prototype ship and the large scale specimen are about 600 and 75 mm respectively the von mises stress distributions of the large scale specimen and the prototype ship are shown in fig 5 the von mises stresses estimated at four key points of the midship as indicated in fig 5 are shown in table 3 the difference between the von mises stresses estimated for the large scale specimen and prototype ship is less than 5 0 the stress distribution is identical indicating that the large scale specimen can represent the structural behaviour of the prototype ship 3 experiment 3 1 experimental setup the ultimate longitudinal strength of the large scale specimen subjected to vertical sagging bending moments is evaluated the setup of a four point bending test is presented in fig 6 and the hydraulic cylinders and displacement transducers are indicated in fig 7 seven displacement transducers are installed below each mono hull bottom along the length to measure the vertical displacement of the large scale specimen the bow and stern of the large scale specimen are placed respectively on a φ50 mm round steel bar supported by a rigid structural base see fig 8 simulating a simply supported condition and the acting loads are applied by hydraulic cylinders at fr 20 and 35 0 40 l r and 0 67 l r the locations of the bow and stern supports are presented in fig 6b the top of the cylinders is supported by horizontal beams and the bottom of the cylinders imposes a uniform load on a plate with a thickness of 10 mm mounted above the transverse bulkhead see fig 7 the plate serves to distribute the load avoiding stress concentrations on the deck for the two acting load positions ten hydraulic cylinders are mounted the synchronisation of the hydraulic cylinders is achieved by controlling the pressure of the oil pumps the arms of the forces applied to fr 20 and 35 to generate a vertical bending moment are 4 840 and 4 075 m respectively the load applied on fr 35 is 1 19 times the one of fr 20 keeping a constant maximum bending moment between fr 20 and 35 the mechanical properties of the steel that is used to build the large scale specimen are defined by quasi static tensile tests see for example liu and guedes soares 2019 the tensile tests are performed using plate specimens of a 2 5 and 3 0 mm thickness following a standard tensile test procedure as described in gb t 228 1 2010 the tensile stress strain relationships are presented in fig 9 the materials of the large scale specimen are identified as mild steel with a yield stress of 255 mpa the strains developed during the test of the large scale specimen are measured by three directional strain gauges a number of strain gauges are mounted on the plate intersections around the midship cross section as shown in fig 10 additional strain gauges are mounted around several cross sections along the length of the large scale specimen the strain gauges are mainly mounted on the portside hull due to the symmetry of the load and geometry of the large scale specimen few strain gauges are also mounted on the starboard hull to verify the test data the weld induced initial imperfections regarding initial distortions and residual stresses were not measured before the experiment it was observed that the main deck was very flat without any visible local distortions the procedure of performing the four point bending moment experimental can be divided into two stages preloading and collapse stage stage 1 the experiment starts by imposing three cycles of loading to eliminate the welding induced residual stresses partially in the large scale specimen during the loading process the linear relationship between load and strain and the repeatability of test data is controlled in order to validate the loading device and data acquisition the maximum load produced per a hydraulic cylinder is about 1 0 t leading to an elastic strain less than the yield strain of tested large scale specimen stage 2 the loads are applied gradually up to the collapse is achieved the strains and displacements are recorded per 0 2 t before the loading is reaching 2 0 t for each hydraulic cylinder and then the data are recorded per 0 05 t until the collapse is achieved 3 2 experimental results 3 2 1 load displacement curve the experimentally applied load versus vertical displacement curve of the large scale specimen is presented in fig 11 a the resulting load is the total load applied by the ten hydraulic cylinders at fr 20 loading position and the resulting vertical displacement is the average of the measurements of two displacement transducers located below the mono hulls at fr 28 see d4 in fig 6 the maximum load carrying capacity of the large scale specimen is 22 7 t resulting in a vertical displacement of 89 2 mm at fr 28 the ultimate bending moment of the large scale specimen can withstand at the midship is 1077 knm 22 7 t 4 84 m 9 8 kn t the load displacement relationship in fig 11a shows an almost linear relationship until the loading force of 20 t after this point the curve shows a noticeable nonlinear relationship with a reduced slope due to the spread of plasticity and buckling in the bottom and deck structures respectively finally the curve reaches its maximum at 22 7 t which is the ultimate load carrying capacity of the large scale specimen as the structure cannot withstand more substantial external loading the bending moment curvature relationship of the large scale specimen is presented in fig 11b the curvature is estimated using the experimental data of the vertical displacements at d3 and d4 in fig 6 the sudden discharges of the load at the collapse stage are not evident when the moment curvature curve is observed the large scale specimen s vertical displacement as a function of the incrementally increased load along the length of the specimen is presented in fig 12 it is noticeable that the vertical displacement increases rapidly once the load reaches 20 t 3 2 2 collapse mode the overall collapse of the large scale specimen is presented in fig 13 the large scale specimen experienced a sudden noisy severe collapse with a great discharge of loads and large plastic displacements due to the formation of plastic hinges in the deck plating located between two adjacent web frames fr 27 and 28 amidships under axial compression it is reasonable that the collapse occurs between fr 27 and 28 which is explained by the fact the most extended hold is located between fr 20 and 35 the collapse mode shows a visible sinusoidal distortion between frames and the axial and rotational deformations are more intense on the deck and uppermost side panels the rest of the structure far from these two frames remained almost flat indicating that no or small plastic deformations occur due to the collapse load the formation of plastic hinges indicates that the axial stresses are close to the yield stress of the material the formation of initial plastic hinges is also associated with the local discharge of loading and then the internal load is redistributed and transferred to the nearest structural components promoting a simultaneous structural collapse the large scale specimen was cut amidships after the test which permits to see the presence of local buckling of the inner structures see fig 14 it can also be seen that the buckling occurs in the transverse frames mono hull inboard and outboard longitudinal stiffeners of the main deck and mono hull inboard the collapse of the stringers fig 14a is associated with the buckling of the main and wet deck some removals of the weld occur in the connection between stringers and wet deck but these weld failures should not be the principal reason for the structural collapse the mono hull inboard presents an uneven deformation due to the local buckling fig 14b tripping and bending occur in the longitudinal girders of the deck and mono hull outboard fig 14c and d 3 2 3 stress the stresses estimated as a function of the resulting force in the cross sections can describe the structural behaviour von mises stresses calculated based on the collected data from the three direction strain gauges mounted at the key points on the fr 22 cross section fig 10 are shown in fig 15 the analysed value takes the material yield stress 255 mpa when exceeding this magnitude the mono hull bottom and main deck are subjected to tension and compression respectively generally the stresses estimated at the key points show a good linear trend in the elastic range the higher stresses are mainly concentrated at the mono hull bottom see points 9 10 and 11 the main deck see points 1 3 and 5 and in the uppermost and lowermost part of mono hull outboard see points 6 and 8 the structure is firstly yielding at the mono hull bottom when the applied load reaches about 20 t at the same time the plate buckling stress decreases at points 1 2 and 4 and the stress increase sharply at point 3 and 5 in the main deck because of the occurrence of local buckling and the redistribution of the internal load however this phenomenon can also be observed in the load displacement relationship where a sharp change occurs at a load of about 20 t see fig 11 afterwards the main deck yields at 22 t and finally the structure of the large scale specimen collapses at the main deck due to the development of large plastic hinges the deck structure cannot withstand more load once it reaches the ultimate strength 4 nonlinear fe analysis of large scale specimen a nonlinear fe analysis of the large scale specimen is performed using the commercial software abaqus version 6 14 the entire large scale specimen is modelled like the one used in section 2 3 see fig 4 the riks arc length control algorithm is employed to solve the static nonlinear problem due to the high level of geometric and material nonlinearities the large displacements and the finite strains are also activated the finite element model is generated using s4r type shell elements this finite element is a 4 node quadrilateral stress displacement shell element with reduced integration and a large strain formulation dassault 2014 in order to analyse the local buckling at least 3 finite elements between longitudinals are generated thus the element size generated here is about 25 mm this mesh density is sufficient to capture the global and the local buckling of plates and stiffeners accurately the finite element model consists of 182 637 nodes and 212 383 shell elements the material properties of the mild steel are defined by an elastic perfectly plastic material model with a yield stress of 255 mpa young s modulus of 210 gpa and poisson s ratio of 0 3 as the initial geometrical imperfections and residual stresses are not measured in the experiment these effects are not considered in the finite element analysis it is assumed that the longitudinal transverse and vertical displacements are constrained at the nodes of the stern structure supported by the round steel bar and the transverse and vertical displacements are constrained at the nodes of the bow structure supported by the round steel bar see fig 4 concentrated loads are applied at the nodes where the hydraulic cylinders are placed fr 20 and 35 the applied force at fr 35 is 1 19 times the one at fr 20 von mises stress contour plots of the large scale specimen at the ultimate load level are shown in fig 16 the maximum stresses are mainly concentrated on the main deck and mono hull bottoms the structure collapses with an overall failure mode in the deck panels under axial compressive load the collapse mode is similar to the one of the typical response of a mono hull girder subjected to a vertical sagging bending moment which results in buckling of deck panels however some discrepancies are observed at the buckling deformation of the main deck which mainly consists of the local plate buckling around the strongly braced longitudinal structures it is mainly because the transverse catamaran structure has a small bending stiffness and the main deck is supported strongly by the inboard and outboard of the mono hulls along the longitudinal direction the experimentally and numerically estimated stresses at ultimate strength collected at the key points as defined in fig 10 are presented in table 4 in the fe analysis the stresses increase almost linearly with the progressive increase of the applied loads agreeing approximately with the experimental results some discrepancies are also noticed in the stresses at some key points of the main deck see points 2 and 4 in table 4 and fig 10 the experimental results show that the stresses of these two points decrease when the load approaches the ultimate load but this phenomenon is not captured by the fe analysis this may be attributed to the fact that the existence of some initial imperfections and residual stresses induce a non uniform axial force in the main deck of the large scale specimen changing the structural buckling mode which was not considered in the fe analysis the stresses of points 12 and 13 increase rapidly when the load is approaching the ultimate load in the experimental results which is also not captured in the fe analysis resulting in smaller stresses at ultimate strength the experimentally and numerically estimated vertical bending moment as a function of the vertical displacement and curvature of the large scale specimen are shown in fig 17 it is considered that the ultimate strength represents the maximum structural capacity that the deck structure can withstand the compressive load it can be seen that the numerically estimated vertical displacement and curvature are much smaller than the experimentally estimated ones and thus the slopes of the moment displacement and curvature curves show apparent differences of elastic stiffness see fig 17 one of the reasons for that is the existence of gaps between the specimen and the supports at the beginning of the experiment resulting in the specimen not being in full contact with the supports during the initial loading process a similar issue is also observed in the compressive test of stiffened panels see fig 12 in kim et al 2009 and fig 20 in xu and guedes soares 2013b the increase in the vertical displacement for the structural supports is restrained until the contact gaps at the structural supports are sufficiently closed the numerically estimated ultimate bending moment is 1149 knm at the vertical displacement of 62 1 mm and the curvature of 0 00083 rad m at the d4 location as can be seen in fig 6 a difference of 6 7 is found between the experimentally and numerically estimated ultimate loads the slightly overestimated ultimate load may be due to the fact that the initial imperfections and residual stresses induced by the welds are not considered in the fe simulation after the collapse the ultimate strength estimated by the fe analysis drops down quicker than the experimental result the post ultimate strength behaviour is that the buckled region spreads rapidly in the collapsed cross section especially over the deck 5 fe analysis of compartment model the simplifications in the fe model are not only to save computation time in further numerical analyses and cost of specimens and their testing but also to validate the numerical results with the experimental ones in the case of a large scale specimen subjected to a pure vertical bending moment 5 1 ultimate longitudinal strength of large scale specimen fe analysis of ship longitudinal strength of the midship cargo hold region is performed here the analysed cargo hold includes the large scale specimen segment between fr 20 and fr 35 0 40 l r to 0 67 l r see fig 3a constraints on the fe nodes of the midship cargo hold region end sections are imposed by surface based kinematic coupling with master nodes at the intersection of the centreline and the elastic neutral axis the translation and rotation of the end plane nodes are controlled by master nodes vertical bending moments are imposed gradually at both master nodes by a master node rotation on the vertical planes in the progressive collapse analysis of the compartment model the resulting bending moment as a function of the curvature in the middle of the midship cargo hold region is shown in fig 18 the estimated ultimate bending moment is about 1160 knm which is very close to the one estimated using the fe model of the entire large scale specimen which is 1149 knm it is demonstrated that the experimental loads simulate well the pure bending of the large scale specimen the analysis of the collapse mode of the midship cargo hold region fe model is presented in fig 19 the finite element analysis of the compartment model shows a very similar collapse mode in comparison with the entire fe model as shown in fig 16 the structural collapse results from the buckling of the deck panels closing to the outboard and inboard of the mono hulls 5 2 ultimate longitudinal strength of the prototype ship the objective of this study is to validate the fe results with experimental ones firstly and then using the validated fe model to analyse the ultimate strength of the prototype ship the midship cargo hold region fe model will be used to analyse the ultimate strength of the prototype ship here the elastic perfectly plastic material model with the yield stress of 235 mpa is defined the estimated vertical bending moment as a function of the curvature of the prototype ship subjected to bending in sagging and hogging are shown in fig 20 and their collapse modes are presented in fig 21 the ultimate strength of the prototype ship under a hogging moment is larger than the one under a sagging moment of about 23 1 the overall collapse of the prototype ship structure in the sagging condition is mainly caused by the axial buckling of the uppermost side plates and the cross section of the deck with the buckled longitudinal girders and the transverse frame structure this collapse of the individual structural components can also be seen in the large scale specimen once it was cut see fig 14a discrepancies in the buckling locations of the main deck are observed between the large scale specimen and prototype ship figs 19a and 21a because some stiffeners were smeared into an additional thickness of the main deck of the large scale specimen in the case of the hogging condition the mono hull bottom panels collapse under axial compression and the longitudinal girders fold at the ultimate strength the collapse mode is very similar to one of the two individual mono hulls subjected to a vertical hogging moment the ultimate loading of the large scale specimen and the prototype ship under sagging condition can be compared to understand the scaling effect of buckling and ultimate strength according to the scaling laws which is based on the linear elastic theory the scaling of bending moment between the prototype ship and its large scale specimen is 256 8 8 4 eq 1 here the resulting ultimate bending moment of the prototype ship and large scale specimens are 248 4 mnm and 1160 knm see figs 18 and 20 respectively and thus the scaling factor of 214 is found the difference of the scaling is mainly because the scaling of the plate thickness of the deck 10 mm 3 mm 3 3 is smaller than 4 0 leading to an increase in the buckling capacity of the large scale specimen another reason is that the material yield stress of the large scale specimen is larger than the one of the prototype ship based on all the experimental and numerical analyses some aspects relevant to the vertical bending and collapse behaviour of the catamaran hull are summarised the experimental and numerical analyses are in close agreement and are thus capable of estimating the ultimate strength of the catamaran it is found that the buckling of the catamaran cross deck structure leads to the flexural collapse of ship hulls 5 3 improvement of ultimate strength the ultimate longitudinal strength of the catamaran can be improved by increasing the plate thickness and or the reinforcement of longitudinal stiffeners and or selecting the higher strength steels for shipbuilding materials the reference catamaran subjected to sagging vertical bending moment presents the most severe load case it has been observed that the buckling occurs at the bridging structure and the uppermost side plates in section 5 2 as the bridging structure is transversely framed the cross deck structure can be strengthened using the longitudinal stiffeners here the first scheme is to add six longitudinal stiffeners on the cross deck see s1 s2 and s3 in fig 22 the ultimate strength can also be improved by increasing the buckling strength of the uppermost side plates and the longitudinal girders thus the second scheme is to add six longitudinal stiffeners on these locations see s4 s5 and s6 in fig 22 finally both reinforcements including s1 to s6 are considered in the third scheme it should be mentioned that the structural weight increases about 0 12 when adding a longitudinal stiffener l100 63 8 along the ship length as the ship will be built using mild steels the other solution is to select the mild steels with higher yield strength in shipbuilding the yield stress of mild steels is possible to reach about 300 mpa thus the material yield stress of 255 mpa 275 mpa and 295 mpa are selected to compare with the reference model with a minimum yield stress of 235 mpa the numerical results are presented in table 5 it is observed that the longitudinal stiffeners added at the relative weak locations can increase the ultimate strength of the catamaran for example the ultimate strength increases by about 14 when the structural weight increases by about 0 72 case 1 this case presents one of the best solutions based on the strength to weight ratio it illustrates that the transversely framed bridging structure gives relatively low ultimate longitudinal strength under a sagging moment on the other hand the ultimate strength of the catamaran increases with the material yield stress see table 5 6 conclusions finite element and experimental analyses of the ultimate longitudinal strength of the catamaran subjected to the vertical sagging bending moment have been performed in this study the ultimate bending moment analysed by numerical simulation is in good agreement with the experimental one the procedure provided for evaluating experimentally and numerically the ultimate strength of multi hull prototype ships has proven to be acceptable it is found that the buckling strength of the deck structure plays an essential role in the overall collapse of catamaran subjected to a vertical sagging bending moment the buckling deformation of the prototype ship is mainly concentrated on the cross deck structure presenting the weaker compressive strength location compared to the deck structure of the mono hulls the midship cargo hold region fe model has been used to analyse the ultimate longitudinal strength and the archived results are similar to the one of the entire prototype ship fe model the comparison of the ultimate strength of the large scale specimen and the prototype ship demonstrates the drawback of the scaling design based on the linear elastic theory it is concluded that a good solution in estimating the ultimate strength of the prototype ship is to use the finite element method validated by the experimental results one of the best design solutions for improving the ultimate longitudinal strength of the catamaran is to reinforce the longitudinal stiffeners at the cross deck structure or to use the mild steels with higher yield stress the catamaran is not always subjected to a symmetrical bending moment and thus further experiments need to be performed to assess the ship structural behaviour under asymmetrical bending loadings as

22576,thickness wastage due to corrosion is a typical consequence of steel plated structures that operate in a sea environment corrosion below a given threshold calls for the performance of rehabilitation actions in order to avoid local structural instabilities an innovative repair technique that is based on the application of composite stiffeners in ship plated structures is evaluated numerically and at a preliminry basis the stiffeners act as means for strengthening the plating against buckling the adequacy of the new repair design is evaluated with particular focus on a shear panel through numerical experimentation with regards to the required number of stiffeners their cross section their material and their length methods sourcing from design of experiments doe have been employed initially a full factorial analysis 2 k has been performed so as to identify the significant design variables in the following a procedure based on response surface methodology rsm and central composite design ccd has been developed for deducing the feasible design space with repair solutions that satisfy the imposed requirements in the practical range of the design variables the performed study has provided initial findings which show the effectiveness of the proposed method depending on the design criteria and requirements imposed by the engineer different design points may be found through the application of optimization techniques keywords repair buckling finite element analysis composite materials shear panel ship 1 introduction plated geometry configurations dominate the design of marine offshore and ship hull structures the family of steel grade structural materials remains the most favorable choice as it covers most of the involved erection operation and maintenance requirements and its performance has been tested for over a century however since the aforementioned structures operate in a hostile environment i e seawater material wastage due to corrosion is building up along with time in the flooded regions of a ship ballast tanks hull weather decks etc the chemical composition of the cargo might also be corrosive in nature and hence cause corrosion in the cargo hold area howarth d j zhang j 2011 four types of corrosion related material wastage are distinguished as per dnv gl 2013 i e general or uniform corrosion degradation is uniformly distributed on the surface of the metal pitting corrosion degradation is randomly distributed with local material reduction and grooving edge corrosion degradation close to welds of a stiffener and at the stiffener edge a recent review study on the modeling approaches used for assessing corroded steel plated structures is presented in wang et al 2014 this particular review study after examining most of the related literature body has concluded that general corrosion is the most investigated type when it comes to assessing the stiffened or unstiffened plate s or structure s residual strength general corrosion may be modeled either through uniformly reducing the plate thickness or through creating complex rough surfaces the latter introduces thickness unevenness and as such allows for capturing localized plastic hinges in non linear buckling analysis which in turn leads to more accurate residual strength predictions teixeira et al 2013 silva et al 2013 nevertheless a uniform thickness reduction is quite often applied for assessing the residual strength response wang et al 2014 in either case finite element modeling techniques have revealed that thickness reduction due to corrosion has a direct impact on the local and subsequently global structural integrity of the platings since a ship functions like a thin walled structure and buckling collapse is most of the times the leading failure mode paik et al 2003 mackay et al 2010 of its involved structural assemblies for this purpose it is a requirement set by the international maritime organization imo to the corresponding class associated with a particular ship to perform a programme of periodical surveys special annual intermediate where the ship s health is evaluated as far as the hull structure inspection is concerned this is achieved visually and through the performance of thickness measurements of the plating in this regard the international association of classification societies iacs has issued a series of manuals in order to provide guidelines dedicated for assisting the surveyors of iacs member societies and other interested parties involved in the survey iacs 2001 the guidelines point the attention of the surveyor over specific types of damages cracks excessive deformation corrosion etc that are anticipated to be found at specific locations over the hull the surveyor then has to assess an identified damage and consequently take the required remedial measures so as to rehabilitate for the part s integrity for example when it comes to the inspection of the cargo hold region of a bulk carrier and especially the hopper tank s transverse web excessive deformations caused by local plate buckling may be identified as shown in fig 1 resulting from high local shear stresses such inspected damage may result from insufficient initial design or thickness wastage due to corrosion as a remedial action the guideline suggests a repair strategy that involves welding of additional stiffeners so as to reinforce the shear panels and protect them against buckling failure modes a promising repair strategy that has recently attracted the attention of the research community e g zhao and zhang 2007 hashim et al 2011 karr et al 2016 karatzas et al 2015 and the classes bureau veritas 2015 dnv gl 2012 concerns strengthening through composite materials based on bonded patch repair techniques the idea behind composite patch repair is to bond a composite stack usually cfrp 1 1 cfrp carbon fiber reinforced polymer on top of the damaged area so as to rehabilitate for the thickness wastage the patch acts like a metallic doubler plate welded around damaged areas and is responsible to carry part of the load that the wasted thickness of the plate was originally designed to do so although the method has been approved for the repair of piping in the petrochemical industry though usually applied in the form of bandages and in high diameter pipes as patches iso 24817 2017 it is yet to be approved in ship structures for damage repair one major technical factor for this delay is the lack of knowledge on the long term performance combined saltwater and fatigue for the dissimilar adhesive joint anyfantis 2016 shenoi et al 2011 nevertheless imo imo 2017 is taking actions towards supporting the utilization of composite materials in the ship s hull structure which action supports the continuation of respective research in the field as already pinpointed by pedersen in pedersen 2015 the great competitive advantage offered by the composite repair technology in ship structures is related to the potentiality of the technique to be applied in situ without the need of dry docking and degassing for plate welding hot work in the case of carrying inflammable freight eg lngs fpsos etc an alternative composite repair solution is based on the application of composite stiffeners instead of patches to the damaged areas such a solution has been named strengthening by stiffening and is experimentally assessed under laboratory conditions for the repair of the web of girders found in civil engineering applications ulger and okeil 2017 okeil et al 2009 as the girder s web is designed to carry the vertical force and corresponding shear stresses the ship s transverse web structures such as the hopper tank transverse web are respectively designed to carry the shear loads acting from the effective hydrostatic pressure hence these areas may be regarded as an assembly of shear panels which develop a shear dominated stress field that tends to cause localized structural instabilities if not properly designed or due to thickness wastage the strengthening by stiffening method ulger and okeil 2017 okeil et al 2009 involves the placement of a composite stiffener in vertical directions with respect to the beam s longitudinal axis as with the steel webs used against lateral torsional buckling given the aforementioned benefits of composite repair in ship structures and motivated by introducing innovative repair alternatives that are beyond the current regulated repair practice this work provides a first theoretical assessment of the effectiveness of the strengthening by stiffening method when extrapolated to ship hull structures in this regard the main aim of the current study is to develop a method that allows for a preliminary design assessment of the innovative repair technique applied to shear panels ship s transverse web floor girder etc found in the vessel s hull the relatively large dimensions of the ship s shear panels compared to webs of girders require more advanced stiffener configurations for the repair to be adequate in this direction the problem is parametrized and the main design variables that control the repair design have been defined the repair is assessed on the basis of elastic buckling under pure shear and given the multimaterial nature of the problem parametric finite element analysis fea of the repair geometries have been performed instead of applying methods based on global optimization the design space has been explored through the employment of methods sourcing from design of experiments doe that are proven to be efficient in numerical experimentation and metamodeling local optimization the statistical nature of these methods has also allowed for understanding the problem particulars and acquiring knowledge on the innovative repair aiming at distinguishing among the significant insignificant and depended independent design variables a full factorial 2k has been firstly performed the outcome design variables have been considered for metamodeling under the response surface methodology rsm through a central composite design ccd such an approach has prescribed the local optimization procedure and has allowed for dimensioning the repair design in accordance to the imposed design requirements 2 problem set up 2 1 background adequate design of the repair solution for rehabilitating an identified damage is a task that requires structural assessment for proving the effectiveness of the repair the geometry of the damaged structure needs to be defined and its structural integrity needs to be evaluated over the design load cases set by the rules e g common structural rules for the case of bulk carriers and oil tankers due to the complexity of the ship hull this procedure may be performed through finite element analysis fea by evaluating the performance of a cargo hold or a three cargo hold model and then applying submodelling techniques to identify localized stress capacities should the localized strength calculations conclude that the damaged buckled area s requires reinforcement so as to fall within strength and service requirements then a repair has to be designed in the case of using composite stiffeners instead of metallic ones an inherent weakness of composite materials comes to surface i e composites have lower stiffness compared to steel therefore the additional stiffeners as denoted in fig 1 used for repair might require an alternative cross section and corresponding dimensions so as to achieve the high bending stiffness required for the repair to be effective and simultaneously achieve the composite metal bond strength requirement anyfantis 2014 in cases where large out of plane displacements have been identified the placement of a stiffener increases the panel s resistance against buckling by enhancing the low bending stiffness of plate elements the elastic buckling stress of a plate subjected to pure shear is given by e g hughes and paik 2010 1 τ cr κ s π 2 e i a 1 v 2 b 2 κ s π 2 e 12 1 v 2 t 2 b 2 where ks is the buckling shear coefficient e and ν are the isotropic elastic constants of the plate a and i are the cross sectional area and moment of inertia of the plate t and b are the thickness and breadth of the plate ks is independent of the plate s thickness and depends only the number of half waves and the plate s aspect ratio it is clear that the stress is proportional to the thickness squared and inverse proportional to the breadth squared a fraction reduction of the panel s thickness e g due to corrosion wastage leads at important reduction of the buckling strength capacity as depicted in fig 2 consider for example the case of having an intact panel of 10 mm thickness a 5 thickness reduction is just a thin layer of rust equal to 0 5 mm the existence of which leads to 15 reduction of the initial design elastic buckling strength a repair involving the installation of additional stiffeners apparently increases locally the bending stiffness ei if the stiffener is of medium rigidity then the buckling stress is increased inducing the first buckling mode as occurs with the unstiffened plate if the stiffener is of high rigidity then it acts as a line imposing boundary conditions and the plate buckles in a much higher buckling stress in accordance to the second buckling mode mode switch the latter behavior is beneficial compared to the former and this is why a repair needs to be adequately designed so as to utilize as much as possible the capabilities provided by the strengthening by stiffening approach 2 2 configurations assumptions and design variables when it comes to structures involving multimaterials in the present study fiber reinforced composites connected through an adhesive medium to steel the involved assembly configuration must satisfy the imposed design requirements strength and stiffness generally speaking within the structural analysis of a particular multimaterial geometry assessment for the strength related requirements involves the evaluation of the respective strength criterion for the steel e g first material yielding plastification for the composite e g anisotropic failure of composite plies failure progression and for the adhesive medium e g first material yielding energetic approach to fracture on the other hand stiffness related requirements impose a certain threshold in the deflections or and buckling in the case where load bearing assemblies are under development in the framework of this study where the repair design is performed against structural instability buckling phenomena stiffness requirements are the most dominant for dimensioning purposes and hence the configuration must be designed such that its rigidity is adequate to prevent buckling following the repair since buckling capacity is directly related to the bending stiffness of the structural element under examination then the design of the retrofit must at first hand satisfy the requirement of elastic buckling in this direction the unified rules with respect to strength urs that apply to all classed sea going ships of 65 m in length and above base the compressive and shear buckling strength analysis of plates on an elastic buckling foundation correction for inelastic buckling as per johnson s formula is considered this foundation underestimate s the overall plate capacity to a certain extent since the plate s ultimate strength which may for example be calculated through non linear fea is found to be at higher levels than the ones predicted by linear buckling analysis even with the introduction of realistic geometric and material imperfections in non linear fea the buckling strength is somewhat below the ultimate strength hughes and paik 2010 based on the aforementioned and considering in this study a general type of uniform corrosion thickness wastage over a plate a preliminary assessment of the proposed retrofit on a linear buckling analysis foundation is considered in this work a strength assessment of the repair beyond the elastic buckling analysis requires the development of non linear fe models that involve accurate materials models which are able to capture failure in the three material constituents steel composite and adhesive layer under the aforementioned assumptions and without loss of generality a rectangular panel a x b here a b 2 5 m subjected to pure shear stresses as shown in fig 3 is considered for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed method this particular case approximately applies to the geometry of the shear panel of fig 1 to the floor panels located at the hull s double bottom and other shear elements due to the out of flatness geometry of the panels buckles practical issues arise that are related to adhesive bonding process of the composite stiffeners the panel s curvature together with its large in plane dimensions turns the bonding of long stiffeners to be prohibiting as the composite stiffeners come in cured condition solid state these need to be deformed bent and bonded through an adhesive layer of uneven thickness situations that involve bad design practice or the shape of the curvature may be accurately measured and then custom molds and consequently custom stiffeners may be created a procedure though that is time and cost expensive and downplays the benefits of the repair method with regards to installation a practical design alternative is to bond shorter stiffeners of length l as in fig 3 that will not need to be bent and will be bonded with a more uniform bondline having a span of 2 5 m then the selected range for l is taken equal to 0 2 m 1 0 m the upper limit was taken somewhat lower than the half of the panel s breadth for practicality issues and the lower limit was selected having a ratio between length and cross section breadth equal to two given this approach the angle of the stiffeners θ may be varied around the pivot point c see fig 3 this allows for the introduction of an extra design variable for assessing the proposed repair method which may take values within the range of 0 90 two repair design configurations will be examined that involve the installation of two stiffeners configuration a and four stiffeners configuration b these two configurations were selected since the installation of additional stiffeners increases the imposed bending stiffness the variation of the bending stiffness ei of the stiffeners is achieved by controlling the scantlings of the cross section selecting whether bonding will take place on one or both sides and by defining the material of the stiffener there do exist manufacturing technologies that allow for the production of composite beams with ordinary or custom sections based on compression moulding of pre impregnated carbon fabrics cfrp or pultrusion of gfrp 2 2 gfrp glass fiber reinforced polymer the experimental work performed in ulger and okeil 2017 and okeil et al 2009 considers such gfrp pultruded beams with a section taken by cutting in two pieces an out of the self h beam hence creating a t section with the flange being bonded to the plate see fig 4 a the advantage offered by the t section is that the flange acts as a flat panel that allows for forming the adhesive bond overlap the scantlings selected for case a are 200 mm wide x 10 mm thick for the flange element and 100 mm deep x 10 mm thick for the web element based on this solution the beams bending stiffness ei is varied by adding webs 100 mm wide x 10 mm thick with 50 mm spacing to the section as shown in fig 4 b d further increase may be performed by adding as well a beam in the opposite side as per fig 4 b d by altering the material from gfrp to cfrp then one may achieve much higher bending stiffnesses given the selected cross sections and material table 1 lists and fig 5 depicts the bending stiffness spectrum defined in this work that is 45 13794 kn m2 the significance in terms of the level of influence of each design variable l θ ei to the repair effectiveness needs to be understood in the framework of the current study the repair effectiveness of each defined set of design variables is quantified through the calculation of the elastic buckling shear stress namely τrepaired as the focus is entirely placed on an eigenvalue problem it is explicitly assumed that the stiffeners are perfectly bonded and no kind of material softening behavior is present i e plasticity cracking etc 2 3 finite element modeling the shear buckling strength for a repair case is to be evaluated through an eigenvalue buckling analysis performed in a fea environment ansys commercial fe software ansys an indicative fe model is presented in fig 6 a the relatively thin panel b t 60 was modeled by quadratic shell elements shell281 from the ansys element library and the composite stiffeners were modeled at their corresponding locations through quadratic beam elements beam189 from the ansys element library fig 6b presents a mesh convergence study from which one may conclude that the problem has converged since the difference between the buckling loads obtained with increasing the element size differ less than 1 25 in the present study a constant element size for all cases is taken equal to 50 mm 50 mm the effective young modulus of the entire stiffener cross section has been used along with the respective second moment of inertia so as to model the bending stiffness ei per each case the lateral rigidity with respect to the parallel to the plate axis as shown in fig 4 is the stiffness parameter that has been found to be the most influencial on the shear buckling ulger and okeil 2017 therefore the elastic isotropic material model e gfrp 17 gpa and e cfrp 140 gpa v 0 3 within the beam analysis framework of the composite stiffeners is considered in this work the steel material was modeled as isotropic elastic with e 207 gpa and v 0 3 this simplified modeling approach complies well with the adopted assumptions and is considered adequate for a primary evaluation of the repair in order to apply a uniform shear stress field over the plate s domain one edge of the panel is clamped and the remaining three edges are kept free to deform though beam elements of infinite bending stiffness were attached this technique has allowed for the minimization of the bending effect since the shear panel is modeled as cantilever fig 7 presents the stress fields obtained from a linear perturbation analysis examining the normal bending shear and principal stresses it may be concluded that with quite good approximation the models represent a uniformly stressed shear panel bending stresses are zero at the largest area within the panel while these concentrate at the corners shear stresses are uniform over the panel apart from local concentrations at the corners and the principal stresses have mostly direction equal to 45 such perturbation stress field was used for solving the eigenvalue problem and yield the buckling elastic stress and corresponding modes for the case of an intact square shear panel the buckling modeshapes that correspond to the two first eigenvalues are presented at fig 8 the first modeshape is actually one buckle that is shaped around the main diagonal where the principal stress is positive tension the second modeshape contains two buckles with the same main diagonal having zero stress and appears in a force 15 higher the first buckling load this is a typical deformation pattern that may be found in plate buckling textbooks the idea behind examining the effectiveness of the stiffener to be installed at a specific angle around the pivot point c sources from the stress field direction where shear is actually regarded as tension and compression in diagonal directions see fig 7c 3 design of experiments 3 1 full factorial design having defined the problem under investigation methods sourcing from design of experiments doe montgomery 2006 nevshupa et al 2018 woods and lewis 2015 kleijnen 2015 morris 1991 daniel 1959 myers et al 2016 have been employed for interrogating the proposed repair and acquiring knowledge about its particulars a conventional parametric analysis over the design space would require the evaluation of each design variable separately a method known as one factor at a time ofat analysis in the language of experimental design this method though frequently used in numerical simulation models is inefficient in terms of the number of required observations and does not lead to information about the dependency between the involved design variables a full factorial analysis 2 k is a well designed method for examining the design space as it provides interaction estimates between the involved design variables montgomery 2006 the fe model is considered as the system under evaluation with the design variables acting as the input factors and the elastic buckling force f repaired 3 3 the buckling stress is calculated from τrepaired f repaired a where a bt acting as the system s response kleijnen 2015 morris 1991 in doe the factors take sequential letters from the alphabet therefore factors a b and c are used for the design variables length l orientation angle θ and bending stiffness of the stiffener ei a test matrix is designed that includes in standard sequence the observations numerical simulations and the corresponding values for the factors to be considered as listed in table 2 as it is a full factorial analysis and three factors have been defined then only 23 8 n 8 observations need to be performed for evaluating each configuration a and b the factorial points are placed only at the extreme limits of the variable range as schematically depicted in fig 9 and thus a linearized pattern is assumed in the region between the observations an ofat analysis has been performed prior to the full factorial analysis and has shown that the response does not acquire higher levels within the tested range when compared to the outer limits fig 10 presents a typical response obtained from an ofat analysis for the orientation angle where one may first conclude that the effect of the orientation angle is not higher than 4 to the buckling stress and therefor it is considered to be an insignificant factor this finding is aligned with the experimental and numerical observations reported in ulger and okeil 2017 and okeil et al 2009 for factor b orientation angle in addition the outermost responses may be taken at 0 and 90 representing the minimum and maximum effects respectively in coded form the lower limit is defined as 1 and the upper limit is defined as 1 for example standard observation no 1 corresponds to a simulation where a b c 1 the combination of the very lower limit of all factors in practice a fe simulation if performed with l 0 2 m θ 0 and ei 45 kn m2 given the defined test matrix then the respective simulations have been performed and the obtained fe responses are provided as well in table 2 the full factorial method is statistical in nature and the main idea behind is to evaluate the effect of each factor and involved interactions to the system s response through the calculation of the average responses by applying the following equation 2 e f f e c t response n response n given the size of the problem the number of upper limit values is equal to the size of lower limit values n n 4 there do exist three main effects a b c and four interaction effects ab ac bc and abc that have to be calculated each effect may be computed through eq 2 this test matrix gives an orthogonal array in terms that there is no correlation among the factors by observing column c one may see that when c is at the minus level factors a and b contain an equal number of pluses and minuses thus their effect cancels the same result occurs when c is at the plus level therefore the effect of c is not influenced by factors a or b the effect may be regarded as the distance formed between the center of gravity average value of the cloud of observations performed at the upper level 1 and the corresponding one at the lower level 1 calculating the main and interaction effects and sorting them in an ascending order as listed in table 3 and table 4 for configurations a and b respectively one may initially say that the higher the magnitude of an effect is then the higher is its influence to the response this is partly correct and it is the founding criterion of significance in an ofat analysis however following the statistics foundation of the current employed method the seven sorted effects are assigned a cumulative probability value and then plotted at a half normal plot daniel 1959 in fig 11 a and in fig 12 a the significant effects in a statistical sense are the ones that diverge from the blue straight line around which values corresponding to observation noise are accumulated and hence are considered as insignificant note that a half normal plot is used to examine whether a set of data follows a normal gaussian probability distribution therefore this common technique may well be used for distinguishing between significant and insignificant effects and is called the pencil test observing the half normal plots it may be concluded that for both configurations a and b the orientation angle has no effect at all factor b is insignificant statistical wise and only the length of the stiffeners l and their corresponding bending stiffness ei are in fact the design variables that have a significant effect to the buckling strength the interaction effect ac seems to be as well of significance denoting hence that the simultaneous variation of the length and stiffness is of importance with regards to the calculated insignificance of the orientation angle factor b intuitively one would expect that a 45 angle might work best as it is aligned with the tension compression zones developing in pure shear problems however this is for example the design culture in continuous fibers in frp composite materials which are optimally oriented in directions parallel to the angle of the in plane principal stresses so as to exploit at most the strength and stiffness offered along their longitudinal axis the pure shear stress field of the considered case is examined under the perspective of elastic buckling which as aforementioned it is the out of plane stiffness that requires to be engineered so as to increase the buckling loads it has been concluded that for the evaluated range of the design parameters and adopted configuartions adjustments that have a significant effect in the out of plane rigidity are not related to the angle but on the stiffener s material cross section and number of stiffeners the pareto chart montgomery 2006 has been also constructed as shown in figs 11b and 12b for both configurations these are bar graphs that offer a simple view of the relative size of the effects that are placed in a descending order compared to the half normal plots they serve as a graphic representation of the 80 20 principle that becomes manifest by the vital few bars at the left towering over the trivial many on the right the three pinpointed effects from the previous analysis i e a c and ac are distinguished in the pareto charts as significant effects while the remaining b ab bc and abc effects are denoted as being insignificant although the relative size of the bars may support the previous conclusions there do exist situations causing the effects to exhibit differing standard errors and this subsequently turns the absolute magnitude of an effect to not reflect its statistical significance considering that the experimental programme is a set of t tests observations performed so as to find evidence of a significant difference between population means t values may be used to measure the size of the difference relative to the variation in the sample data hence the pareto charts are plotted in terms of the t values of the effects which are computed through the following equation 3 t value i e f f e c t i m s residual 1 n 1 n where as before n n 4 and ms residual corresponds to the sum of the squares of the residual insignificant effects computed from an anova analysis and given by 4 m s residual s s residual d o f s s residual i 1 4 n 4 e f f e c t i 2 where the subscript i sequentially corresponds to the four insignificant effects b ab bc and abc magnitude dof corresponds to the degrees of freedom that is equal to four ms residual is calculated equal to 0 000179 and 0 000284 for configuration a and b respectively t values refers to the calculated difference expressed in units of standard error therefore the greater the magnitude of t the greater the evidence against the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference the closer t is to 0 the more likely there isn t a significant difference to assist with the recognition the two tailed t value for 0 05 probability and given the four degrees of freedom of the residuals a critical t value of 2 776 is obtained from statistical tables in addition bonferroni s conservative critical t value has been calculated considering the seven effects and df 4 based on the formula given below 5 t α 2 tail 0 05 k 7 d f 4 t 0 007 4 5 1 examining figs 11b and 12b it is verified that the three identified effects a c and ac exceed even the more conservative bonferroni limit thus providing a high level of confidence that is greater than 95 4 primary design assessment 4 1 design particulars it has been found that it is the length and bending stiffness of the composite stiffeners that control the adequacy of the proposed repair the angle hence may not be considered as a design variable additionally configuration b has turned out to increase the buckling force of the damaged plate at a higher extent when compared to configuration a see responses in table 2 given the above in order to perform a repair design with composite stiffeners of corroded shear panels the designer should not worry about the orientation angle and focus only on calculating the sufficient number of stiffeners and their respective length and bending stiffness the vertical arrangement θ 90 of the stiffeners shown in fig 13 will be the examined case with the design variable n corresponding to the number of added stiffener pairs n 1 yields two stiffeners n 2 yields four stiffeners etc 4 2 design assessment procedure a preliminary design assessment procedure is proposed in fig 14 that promises the efficient derivation of a design that meets the imposed rehabilitation requirements the algorithm is perfomed in the combinatory ansys matlab framework the problem is focused on a shear panel with dimensions a x b and intact thickness t intact that was initially designed to be able to withstand the local loads in a hypothetical scenario of a special hull survey the panel was measured to have suffered from uniform over the area thickness wastage due to corrosion the measured thickness was t corroded in order to remain practical preliminary assessment of a repair design integrity is to be performed on the basis of a minimum factor of safety fos imposed requirement the obtained fos is defined as the ratio between the intact shear stress τintact and the one obtained from the corroded panel following a repair τrepaired 6 f o s τ repaired τ intact hence the optimization problem is set around finding the number length and cross section of the composite stiffeners that satisfy the min sof requirement the method initiates with the definition of the intact geometry and t corroded along with the min sof limit defined by the designer given the intact geometry of the shear panel the τ intact may be initially calculated directly through fea or through some sort of metamodels from experimental and or numerical tests the derivation of an adequate repair design depends on the initial thickness t intact of the panel and the thickness wastage according to eq 1 as aforementioned the thicker the plate is the higher is the resistance projected by the plate against elastic shear buckling therefore more in number and stiffer in bending composite stiffeners might be required to rehabilitate for the thickness wastage the same applies for relatively thin panels that have high thickness wastage in accordance to fig 2 therefore in the proposed method the number of stiffeners is evaluated incrementally over the design space defined by the range of l and ei at this point the problem is approached through doe methods and in particular central composite design ccd and response surface methods rsm nevshupa et al 2018 and myers et al 2016 the full factorial experimental design method assumed that the response varies in a linear manner within the selected range rsms allow for the interrogation of the design space by fitting quadratic polynomials that act as optimization models that have the general form 7 y β ο j 1 k β j x j j 1 k β j j x j 2 i j 2 k β i j x i x j where x j corresponds to the k design variables involved in the problem and parameters β ο β j and β jj correspond to the polynomial coefficients the design variables in this optimization scheme are the significant factors deduced from the full factorial analysis that is the length l and the bending stiffness ei denoted with variables x 1 and x 2 respectively as far as the model s response y is concerned this was represented by the factor of safety fos calculated for each observation through the application of eq 6 the ccd set up comes well along with the rsm with observations set at points laying at the mid distance between 1 and 1 that is 0 hence axial points and a central point are placed on top of the four factorial points as depicted in fig 15 forming a 9 design point test matrix each design point i produces the response of interest τrepaired i through fea of generated model having a repository of 9 observations then the second order polynomial of eq 7 was used to fit the quadratic surface over the design space once this action is performed then it is evaluated whether the surface includes design solutions that satisfy the design requirement i e solutions that yield fos min fos in case the requirement is met then it is up to the designer to select a given design point based on the pool of candidates a given ei value might be obtained by controlling the cross sectional dimensions of the stiffener and by selecting material for fibers gfrp or cfrp as for example depicted in fig 5 hence one may prefer selecting one cross section and corresponding material over another due to cost weight manufacturability or other type of constraints in the opposite case where the requirement is not met then the design is enhanced with 2 pairs of stiffeners and the optimization process based rsm is re established this procedure continues automatically until design points that satisfy the fos requirement are found 4 3 design examples in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed repair design method an illustrative example is presented let s consider the square steel plate with dimensions 2 5 m 2 5 m and intact thickness of 10 mm by considering a 0 5 mm thickness wastage due to corrosion t corroded 9 5 mm coming from 5 thickness reduction from the original plate thickness dnv gl 2013 which leads to a near 15 reduction of the original shear buckling load and minimum requirement in fos of 1 0 then the algorithm yields feasible solutions for n 1 one pair of stiffeners as shown in fig 16 the respective response surface that was used to fit the nine observations is given by the following equation 8 f o s 0 9630 0 0795 x 1 0 0223 x 2 0 0381 x 1 2 0 0262 x 1 x 2 0 0191 x 2 2 by examining the chart see fig 16b it is evident that there do exist plenty of design solutions in the right hand sided area area with fos 1 0 the designer may for example select a case laying on the red line that corresponds to stiffeners being 0 74 m long and with ei of 13793 knm 2 this bending stiffness corresponds at a cfrp material with the double sided bond case shown in fig 4f alternatively due to cost savings a gfrp stiffener with a single sided bond and having one web as in fig 4f but with a longer length of 0 9 m may also be used as the solution satisfies the requirement the area with fos 1 0 may be regarded as the design space where one may perform an optimization with respect to cost or weight savings by applying simple to use algorithms such as steepest ascent method etc in the case of having an increased min fos requirement for the same problem described above say 1 2 instead of 1 0 then the proposed algorithm yields feasible solutions in the design space formed by n 2 two pairs of stiffeners as in fig 13 no acceptable solutions exist with one pair of stiffeners this apparently may be concluded from examing the contour range of fig 16 the corresponding response surface for n 2 is shown in fig 17 and the polynomial is given by the following equation 9 f o s 1 1460 0 1817 x 1 0 0550 x 2 0 0017 x 1 2 0 0450 x 1 x 2 0 0483 x 2 2 the design chart shows the feasible design solutions that again it is up to the designer to select the best choice given additional design constraints in the case where the designer is willing to examine the adequacy and corresponding factor of safety obtained for different number of stiffener pairs then a combinatory design chart as the one depicted in fig 18 may be generated for a min fos 1 1 it is clear that for this specific requirement one pair of stiffeners generates a small fraction of the explored design space that demands for long and very stiff composite stiffeners increasing the number of pairs to two then there do exist much more design solutions 5 concluding remarks this work is focused on a primary design assessment of a novel repair technique for steel plated ship structures that suffer from thickness wastage due to corrosion the technique proposes bonding of composite stiffeners instead of welding steel ones its effectiveness has recently been experimentally verified in civil engineering applications with regards to the reinforcement of the web of big girders with a view on providing a first assessment of the repair method to the rehabilitation of shear panels found in ship hull structures e g webs of transverse stiffening the involved design parameters are identified and evaluated with respect to their rehabilitation effectiveness the design variables of interest are the number length orientation angle cross section and material of the stiffeners the monitored response of interest was the elastic shear buckling strength following the exploration of the design space through methods sourcing from design of experiments together with numerical experimentation the following concluding remarks are drawn the numerical experimentation under the foundation of elastic buckling has proven to be effective for performing a preliminary study of the alternative repair method but still needs to be compared with non linear fea results that will include steel yielding composite damage and debonding statistical methods for exploring the design space have been found to be powerful for understanding the influence of the involved factors a full factorial analysis has revealed that the orientation angle has an insignificant effect on the response whereas the length and bending stiffness of the stiffeners have an interdependent significant effect a design framework is proposed for providing a preliminary design assessment of the composite repair that allows for selecting the optimal design variables which satisfy the imposed buckling requirements e g factor of safety over the elastic buckling strength through local optimization as per the response surface method although the findings of this work are encouraging on the proposed technique more realistic simulations that include non linear effects progressive buckling material plasticity for the steel plates composite and adhesive softening behaviours debonding etc are under development an experimental program to further validate the proposed method is as well essential the proposed preliminary design method is scalable and adaptive to be applied to physical experimentation of numerical simulations that include non linear effects 
22576,thickness wastage due to corrosion is a typical consequence of steel plated structures that operate in a sea environment corrosion below a given threshold calls for the performance of rehabilitation actions in order to avoid local structural instabilities an innovative repair technique that is based on the application of composite stiffeners in ship plated structures is evaluated numerically and at a preliminry basis the stiffeners act as means for strengthening the plating against buckling the adequacy of the new repair design is evaluated with particular focus on a shear panel through numerical experimentation with regards to the required number of stiffeners their cross section their material and their length methods sourcing from design of experiments doe have been employed initially a full factorial analysis 2 k has been performed so as to identify the significant design variables in the following a procedure based on response surface methodology rsm and central composite design ccd has been developed for deducing the feasible design space with repair solutions that satisfy the imposed requirements in the practical range of the design variables the performed study has provided initial findings which show the effectiveness of the proposed method depending on the design criteria and requirements imposed by the engineer different design points may be found through the application of optimization techniques keywords repair buckling finite element analysis composite materials shear panel ship 1 introduction plated geometry configurations dominate the design of marine offshore and ship hull structures the family of steel grade structural materials remains the most favorable choice as it covers most of the involved erection operation and maintenance requirements and its performance has been tested for over a century however since the aforementioned structures operate in a hostile environment i e seawater material wastage due to corrosion is building up along with time in the flooded regions of a ship ballast tanks hull weather decks etc the chemical composition of the cargo might also be corrosive in nature and hence cause corrosion in the cargo hold area howarth d j zhang j 2011 four types of corrosion related material wastage are distinguished as per dnv gl 2013 i e general or uniform corrosion degradation is uniformly distributed on the surface of the metal pitting corrosion degradation is randomly distributed with local material reduction and grooving edge corrosion degradation close to welds of a stiffener and at the stiffener edge a recent review study on the modeling approaches used for assessing corroded steel plated structures is presented in wang et al 2014 this particular review study after examining most of the related literature body has concluded that general corrosion is the most investigated type when it comes to assessing the stiffened or unstiffened plate s or structure s residual strength general corrosion may be modeled either through uniformly reducing the plate thickness or through creating complex rough surfaces the latter introduces thickness unevenness and as such allows for capturing localized plastic hinges in non linear buckling analysis which in turn leads to more accurate residual strength predictions teixeira et al 2013 silva et al 2013 nevertheless a uniform thickness reduction is quite often applied for assessing the residual strength response wang et al 2014 in either case finite element modeling techniques have revealed that thickness reduction due to corrosion has a direct impact on the local and subsequently global structural integrity of the platings since a ship functions like a thin walled structure and buckling collapse is most of the times the leading failure mode paik et al 2003 mackay et al 2010 of its involved structural assemblies for this purpose it is a requirement set by the international maritime organization imo to the corresponding class associated with a particular ship to perform a programme of periodical surveys special annual intermediate where the ship s health is evaluated as far as the hull structure inspection is concerned this is achieved visually and through the performance of thickness measurements of the plating in this regard the international association of classification societies iacs has issued a series of manuals in order to provide guidelines dedicated for assisting the surveyors of iacs member societies and other interested parties involved in the survey iacs 2001 the guidelines point the attention of the surveyor over specific types of damages cracks excessive deformation corrosion etc that are anticipated to be found at specific locations over the hull the surveyor then has to assess an identified damage and consequently take the required remedial measures so as to rehabilitate for the part s integrity for example when it comes to the inspection of the cargo hold region of a bulk carrier and especially the hopper tank s transverse web excessive deformations caused by local plate buckling may be identified as shown in fig 1 resulting from high local shear stresses such inspected damage may result from insufficient initial design or thickness wastage due to corrosion as a remedial action the guideline suggests a repair strategy that involves welding of additional stiffeners so as to reinforce the shear panels and protect them against buckling failure modes a promising repair strategy that has recently attracted the attention of the research community e g zhao and zhang 2007 hashim et al 2011 karr et al 2016 karatzas et al 2015 and the classes bureau veritas 2015 dnv gl 2012 concerns strengthening through composite materials based on bonded patch repair techniques the idea behind composite patch repair is to bond a composite stack usually cfrp 1 1 cfrp carbon fiber reinforced polymer on top of the damaged area so as to rehabilitate for the thickness wastage the patch acts like a metallic doubler plate welded around damaged areas and is responsible to carry part of the load that the wasted thickness of the plate was originally designed to do so although the method has been approved for the repair of piping in the petrochemical industry though usually applied in the form of bandages and in high diameter pipes as patches iso 24817 2017 it is yet to be approved in ship structures for damage repair one major technical factor for this delay is the lack of knowledge on the long term performance combined saltwater and fatigue for the dissimilar adhesive joint anyfantis 2016 shenoi et al 2011 nevertheless imo imo 2017 is taking actions towards supporting the utilization of composite materials in the ship s hull structure which action supports the continuation of respective research in the field as already pinpointed by pedersen in pedersen 2015 the great competitive advantage offered by the composite repair technology in ship structures is related to the potentiality of the technique to be applied in situ without the need of dry docking and degassing for plate welding hot work in the case of carrying inflammable freight eg lngs fpsos etc an alternative composite repair solution is based on the application of composite stiffeners instead of patches to the damaged areas such a solution has been named strengthening by stiffening and is experimentally assessed under laboratory conditions for the repair of the web of girders found in civil engineering applications ulger and okeil 2017 okeil et al 2009 as the girder s web is designed to carry the vertical force and corresponding shear stresses the ship s transverse web structures such as the hopper tank transverse web are respectively designed to carry the shear loads acting from the effective hydrostatic pressure hence these areas may be regarded as an assembly of shear panels which develop a shear dominated stress field that tends to cause localized structural instabilities if not properly designed or due to thickness wastage the strengthening by stiffening method ulger and okeil 2017 okeil et al 2009 involves the placement of a composite stiffener in vertical directions with respect to the beam s longitudinal axis as with the steel webs used against lateral torsional buckling given the aforementioned benefits of composite repair in ship structures and motivated by introducing innovative repair alternatives that are beyond the current regulated repair practice this work provides a first theoretical assessment of the effectiveness of the strengthening by stiffening method when extrapolated to ship hull structures in this regard the main aim of the current study is to develop a method that allows for a preliminary design assessment of the innovative repair technique applied to shear panels ship s transverse web floor girder etc found in the vessel s hull the relatively large dimensions of the ship s shear panels compared to webs of girders require more advanced stiffener configurations for the repair to be adequate in this direction the problem is parametrized and the main design variables that control the repair design have been defined the repair is assessed on the basis of elastic buckling under pure shear and given the multimaterial nature of the problem parametric finite element analysis fea of the repair geometries have been performed instead of applying methods based on global optimization the design space has been explored through the employment of methods sourcing from design of experiments doe that are proven to be efficient in numerical experimentation and metamodeling local optimization the statistical nature of these methods has also allowed for understanding the problem particulars and acquiring knowledge on the innovative repair aiming at distinguishing among the significant insignificant and depended independent design variables a full factorial 2k has been firstly performed the outcome design variables have been considered for metamodeling under the response surface methodology rsm through a central composite design ccd such an approach has prescribed the local optimization procedure and has allowed for dimensioning the repair design in accordance to the imposed design requirements 2 problem set up 2 1 background adequate design of the repair solution for rehabilitating an identified damage is a task that requires structural assessment for proving the effectiveness of the repair the geometry of the damaged structure needs to be defined and its structural integrity needs to be evaluated over the design load cases set by the rules e g common structural rules for the case of bulk carriers and oil tankers due to the complexity of the ship hull this procedure may be performed through finite element analysis fea by evaluating the performance of a cargo hold or a three cargo hold model and then applying submodelling techniques to identify localized stress capacities should the localized strength calculations conclude that the damaged buckled area s requires reinforcement so as to fall within strength and service requirements then a repair has to be designed in the case of using composite stiffeners instead of metallic ones an inherent weakness of composite materials comes to surface i e composites have lower stiffness compared to steel therefore the additional stiffeners as denoted in fig 1 used for repair might require an alternative cross section and corresponding dimensions so as to achieve the high bending stiffness required for the repair to be effective and simultaneously achieve the composite metal bond strength requirement anyfantis 2014 in cases where large out of plane displacements have been identified the placement of a stiffener increases the panel s resistance against buckling by enhancing the low bending stiffness of plate elements the elastic buckling stress of a plate subjected to pure shear is given by e g hughes and paik 2010 1 τ cr κ s π 2 e i a 1 v 2 b 2 κ s π 2 e 12 1 v 2 t 2 b 2 where ks is the buckling shear coefficient e and ν are the isotropic elastic constants of the plate a and i are the cross sectional area and moment of inertia of the plate t and b are the thickness and breadth of the plate ks is independent of the plate s thickness and depends only the number of half waves and the plate s aspect ratio it is clear that the stress is proportional to the thickness squared and inverse proportional to the breadth squared a fraction reduction of the panel s thickness e g due to corrosion wastage leads at important reduction of the buckling strength capacity as depicted in fig 2 consider for example the case of having an intact panel of 10 mm thickness a 5 thickness reduction is just a thin layer of rust equal to 0 5 mm the existence of which leads to 15 reduction of the initial design elastic buckling strength a repair involving the installation of additional stiffeners apparently increases locally the bending stiffness ei if the stiffener is of medium rigidity then the buckling stress is increased inducing the first buckling mode as occurs with the unstiffened plate if the stiffener is of high rigidity then it acts as a line imposing boundary conditions and the plate buckles in a much higher buckling stress in accordance to the second buckling mode mode switch the latter behavior is beneficial compared to the former and this is why a repair needs to be adequately designed so as to utilize as much as possible the capabilities provided by the strengthening by stiffening approach 2 2 configurations assumptions and design variables when it comes to structures involving multimaterials in the present study fiber reinforced composites connected through an adhesive medium to steel the involved assembly configuration must satisfy the imposed design requirements strength and stiffness generally speaking within the structural analysis of a particular multimaterial geometry assessment for the strength related requirements involves the evaluation of the respective strength criterion for the steel e g first material yielding plastification for the composite e g anisotropic failure of composite plies failure progression and for the adhesive medium e g first material yielding energetic approach to fracture on the other hand stiffness related requirements impose a certain threshold in the deflections or and buckling in the case where load bearing assemblies are under development in the framework of this study where the repair design is performed against structural instability buckling phenomena stiffness requirements are the most dominant for dimensioning purposes and hence the configuration must be designed such that its rigidity is adequate to prevent buckling following the repair since buckling capacity is directly related to the bending stiffness of the structural element under examination then the design of the retrofit must at first hand satisfy the requirement of elastic buckling in this direction the unified rules with respect to strength urs that apply to all classed sea going ships of 65 m in length and above base the compressive and shear buckling strength analysis of plates on an elastic buckling foundation correction for inelastic buckling as per johnson s formula is considered this foundation underestimate s the overall plate capacity to a certain extent since the plate s ultimate strength which may for example be calculated through non linear fea is found to be at higher levels than the ones predicted by linear buckling analysis even with the introduction of realistic geometric and material imperfections in non linear fea the buckling strength is somewhat below the ultimate strength hughes and paik 2010 based on the aforementioned and considering in this study a general type of uniform corrosion thickness wastage over a plate a preliminary assessment of the proposed retrofit on a linear buckling analysis foundation is considered in this work a strength assessment of the repair beyond the elastic buckling analysis requires the development of non linear fe models that involve accurate materials models which are able to capture failure in the three material constituents steel composite and adhesive layer under the aforementioned assumptions and without loss of generality a rectangular panel a x b here a b 2 5 m subjected to pure shear stresses as shown in fig 3 is considered for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed method this particular case approximately applies to the geometry of the shear panel of fig 1 to the floor panels located at the hull s double bottom and other shear elements due to the out of flatness geometry of the panels buckles practical issues arise that are related to adhesive bonding process of the composite stiffeners the panel s curvature together with its large in plane dimensions turns the bonding of long stiffeners to be prohibiting as the composite stiffeners come in cured condition solid state these need to be deformed bent and bonded through an adhesive layer of uneven thickness situations that involve bad design practice or the shape of the curvature may be accurately measured and then custom molds and consequently custom stiffeners may be created a procedure though that is time and cost expensive and downplays the benefits of the repair method with regards to installation a practical design alternative is to bond shorter stiffeners of length l as in fig 3 that will not need to be bent and will be bonded with a more uniform bondline having a span of 2 5 m then the selected range for l is taken equal to 0 2 m 1 0 m the upper limit was taken somewhat lower than the half of the panel s breadth for practicality issues and the lower limit was selected having a ratio between length and cross section breadth equal to two given this approach the angle of the stiffeners θ may be varied around the pivot point c see fig 3 this allows for the introduction of an extra design variable for assessing the proposed repair method which may take values within the range of 0 90 two repair design configurations will be examined that involve the installation of two stiffeners configuration a and four stiffeners configuration b these two configurations were selected since the installation of additional stiffeners increases the imposed bending stiffness the variation of the bending stiffness ei of the stiffeners is achieved by controlling the scantlings of the cross section selecting whether bonding will take place on one or both sides and by defining the material of the stiffener there do exist manufacturing technologies that allow for the production of composite beams with ordinary or custom sections based on compression moulding of pre impregnated carbon fabrics cfrp or pultrusion of gfrp 2 2 gfrp glass fiber reinforced polymer the experimental work performed in ulger and okeil 2017 and okeil et al 2009 considers such gfrp pultruded beams with a section taken by cutting in two pieces an out of the self h beam hence creating a t section with the flange being bonded to the plate see fig 4 a the advantage offered by the t section is that the flange acts as a flat panel that allows for forming the adhesive bond overlap the scantlings selected for case a are 200 mm wide x 10 mm thick for the flange element and 100 mm deep x 10 mm thick for the web element based on this solution the beams bending stiffness ei is varied by adding webs 100 mm wide x 10 mm thick with 50 mm spacing to the section as shown in fig 4 b d further increase may be performed by adding as well a beam in the opposite side as per fig 4 b d by altering the material from gfrp to cfrp then one may achieve much higher bending stiffnesses given the selected cross sections and material table 1 lists and fig 5 depicts the bending stiffness spectrum defined in this work that is 45 13794 kn m2 the significance in terms of the level of influence of each design variable l θ ei to the repair effectiveness needs to be understood in the framework of the current study the repair effectiveness of each defined set of design variables is quantified through the calculation of the elastic buckling shear stress namely τrepaired as the focus is entirely placed on an eigenvalue problem it is explicitly assumed that the stiffeners are perfectly bonded and no kind of material softening behavior is present i e plasticity cracking etc 2 3 finite element modeling the shear buckling strength for a repair case is to be evaluated through an eigenvalue buckling analysis performed in a fea environment ansys commercial fe software ansys an indicative fe model is presented in fig 6 a the relatively thin panel b t 60 was modeled by quadratic shell elements shell281 from the ansys element library and the composite stiffeners were modeled at their corresponding locations through quadratic beam elements beam189 from the ansys element library fig 6b presents a mesh convergence study from which one may conclude that the problem has converged since the difference between the buckling loads obtained with increasing the element size differ less than 1 25 in the present study a constant element size for all cases is taken equal to 50 mm 50 mm the effective young modulus of the entire stiffener cross section has been used along with the respective second moment of inertia so as to model the bending stiffness ei per each case the lateral rigidity with respect to the parallel to the plate axis as shown in fig 4 is the stiffness parameter that has been found to be the most influencial on the shear buckling ulger and okeil 2017 therefore the elastic isotropic material model e gfrp 17 gpa and e cfrp 140 gpa v 0 3 within the beam analysis framework of the composite stiffeners is considered in this work the steel material was modeled as isotropic elastic with e 207 gpa and v 0 3 this simplified modeling approach complies well with the adopted assumptions and is considered adequate for a primary evaluation of the repair in order to apply a uniform shear stress field over the plate s domain one edge of the panel is clamped and the remaining three edges are kept free to deform though beam elements of infinite bending stiffness were attached this technique has allowed for the minimization of the bending effect since the shear panel is modeled as cantilever fig 7 presents the stress fields obtained from a linear perturbation analysis examining the normal bending shear and principal stresses it may be concluded that with quite good approximation the models represent a uniformly stressed shear panel bending stresses are zero at the largest area within the panel while these concentrate at the corners shear stresses are uniform over the panel apart from local concentrations at the corners and the principal stresses have mostly direction equal to 45 such perturbation stress field was used for solving the eigenvalue problem and yield the buckling elastic stress and corresponding modes for the case of an intact square shear panel the buckling modeshapes that correspond to the two first eigenvalues are presented at fig 8 the first modeshape is actually one buckle that is shaped around the main diagonal where the principal stress is positive tension the second modeshape contains two buckles with the same main diagonal having zero stress and appears in a force 15 higher the first buckling load this is a typical deformation pattern that may be found in plate buckling textbooks the idea behind examining the effectiveness of the stiffener to be installed at a specific angle around the pivot point c sources from the stress field direction where shear is actually regarded as tension and compression in diagonal directions see fig 7c 3 design of experiments 3 1 full factorial design having defined the problem under investigation methods sourcing from design of experiments doe montgomery 2006 nevshupa et al 2018 woods and lewis 2015 kleijnen 2015 morris 1991 daniel 1959 myers et al 2016 have been employed for interrogating the proposed repair and acquiring knowledge about its particulars a conventional parametric analysis over the design space would require the evaluation of each design variable separately a method known as one factor at a time ofat analysis in the language of experimental design this method though frequently used in numerical simulation models is inefficient in terms of the number of required observations and does not lead to information about the dependency between the involved design variables a full factorial analysis 2 k is a well designed method for examining the design space as it provides interaction estimates between the involved design variables montgomery 2006 the fe model is considered as the system under evaluation with the design variables acting as the input factors and the elastic buckling force f repaired 3 3 the buckling stress is calculated from τrepaired f repaired a where a bt acting as the system s response kleijnen 2015 morris 1991 in doe the factors take sequential letters from the alphabet therefore factors a b and c are used for the design variables length l orientation angle θ and bending stiffness of the stiffener ei a test matrix is designed that includes in standard sequence the observations numerical simulations and the corresponding values for the factors to be considered as listed in table 2 as it is a full factorial analysis and three factors have been defined then only 23 8 n 8 observations need to be performed for evaluating each configuration a and b the factorial points are placed only at the extreme limits of the variable range as schematically depicted in fig 9 and thus a linearized pattern is assumed in the region between the observations an ofat analysis has been performed prior to the full factorial analysis and has shown that the response does not acquire higher levels within the tested range when compared to the outer limits fig 10 presents a typical response obtained from an ofat analysis for the orientation angle where one may first conclude that the effect of the orientation angle is not higher than 4 to the buckling stress and therefor it is considered to be an insignificant factor this finding is aligned with the experimental and numerical observations reported in ulger and okeil 2017 and okeil et al 2009 for factor b orientation angle in addition the outermost responses may be taken at 0 and 90 representing the minimum and maximum effects respectively in coded form the lower limit is defined as 1 and the upper limit is defined as 1 for example standard observation no 1 corresponds to a simulation where a b c 1 the combination of the very lower limit of all factors in practice a fe simulation if performed with l 0 2 m θ 0 and ei 45 kn m2 given the defined test matrix then the respective simulations have been performed and the obtained fe responses are provided as well in table 2 the full factorial method is statistical in nature and the main idea behind is to evaluate the effect of each factor and involved interactions to the system s response through the calculation of the average responses by applying the following equation 2 e f f e c t response n response n given the size of the problem the number of upper limit values is equal to the size of lower limit values n n 4 there do exist three main effects a b c and four interaction effects ab ac bc and abc that have to be calculated each effect may be computed through eq 2 this test matrix gives an orthogonal array in terms that there is no correlation among the factors by observing column c one may see that when c is at the minus level factors a and b contain an equal number of pluses and minuses thus their effect cancels the same result occurs when c is at the plus level therefore the effect of c is not influenced by factors a or b the effect may be regarded as the distance formed between the center of gravity average value of the cloud of observations performed at the upper level 1 and the corresponding one at the lower level 1 calculating the main and interaction effects and sorting them in an ascending order as listed in table 3 and table 4 for configurations a and b respectively one may initially say that the higher the magnitude of an effect is then the higher is its influence to the response this is partly correct and it is the founding criterion of significance in an ofat analysis however following the statistics foundation of the current employed method the seven sorted effects are assigned a cumulative probability value and then plotted at a half normal plot daniel 1959 in fig 11 a and in fig 12 a the significant effects in a statistical sense are the ones that diverge from the blue straight line around which values corresponding to observation noise are accumulated and hence are considered as insignificant note that a half normal plot is used to examine whether a set of data follows a normal gaussian probability distribution therefore this common technique may well be used for distinguishing between significant and insignificant effects and is called the pencil test observing the half normal plots it may be concluded that for both configurations a and b the orientation angle has no effect at all factor b is insignificant statistical wise and only the length of the stiffeners l and their corresponding bending stiffness ei are in fact the design variables that have a significant effect to the buckling strength the interaction effect ac seems to be as well of significance denoting hence that the simultaneous variation of the length and stiffness is of importance with regards to the calculated insignificance of the orientation angle factor b intuitively one would expect that a 45 angle might work best as it is aligned with the tension compression zones developing in pure shear problems however this is for example the design culture in continuous fibers in frp composite materials which are optimally oriented in directions parallel to the angle of the in plane principal stresses so as to exploit at most the strength and stiffness offered along their longitudinal axis the pure shear stress field of the considered case is examined under the perspective of elastic buckling which as aforementioned it is the out of plane stiffness that requires to be engineered so as to increase the buckling loads it has been concluded that for the evaluated range of the design parameters and adopted configuartions adjustments that have a significant effect in the out of plane rigidity are not related to the angle but on the stiffener s material cross section and number of stiffeners the pareto chart montgomery 2006 has been also constructed as shown in figs 11b and 12b for both configurations these are bar graphs that offer a simple view of the relative size of the effects that are placed in a descending order compared to the half normal plots they serve as a graphic representation of the 80 20 principle that becomes manifest by the vital few bars at the left towering over the trivial many on the right the three pinpointed effects from the previous analysis i e a c and ac are distinguished in the pareto charts as significant effects while the remaining b ab bc and abc effects are denoted as being insignificant although the relative size of the bars may support the previous conclusions there do exist situations causing the effects to exhibit differing standard errors and this subsequently turns the absolute magnitude of an effect to not reflect its statistical significance considering that the experimental programme is a set of t tests observations performed so as to find evidence of a significant difference between population means t values may be used to measure the size of the difference relative to the variation in the sample data hence the pareto charts are plotted in terms of the t values of the effects which are computed through the following equation 3 t value i e f f e c t i m s residual 1 n 1 n where as before n n 4 and ms residual corresponds to the sum of the squares of the residual insignificant effects computed from an anova analysis and given by 4 m s residual s s residual d o f s s residual i 1 4 n 4 e f f e c t i 2 where the subscript i sequentially corresponds to the four insignificant effects b ab bc and abc magnitude dof corresponds to the degrees of freedom that is equal to four ms residual is calculated equal to 0 000179 and 0 000284 for configuration a and b respectively t values refers to the calculated difference expressed in units of standard error therefore the greater the magnitude of t the greater the evidence against the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference the closer t is to 0 the more likely there isn t a significant difference to assist with the recognition the two tailed t value for 0 05 probability and given the four degrees of freedom of the residuals a critical t value of 2 776 is obtained from statistical tables in addition bonferroni s conservative critical t value has been calculated considering the seven effects and df 4 based on the formula given below 5 t α 2 tail 0 05 k 7 d f 4 t 0 007 4 5 1 examining figs 11b and 12b it is verified that the three identified effects a c and ac exceed even the more conservative bonferroni limit thus providing a high level of confidence that is greater than 95 4 primary design assessment 4 1 design particulars it has been found that it is the length and bending stiffness of the composite stiffeners that control the adequacy of the proposed repair the angle hence may not be considered as a design variable additionally configuration b has turned out to increase the buckling force of the damaged plate at a higher extent when compared to configuration a see responses in table 2 given the above in order to perform a repair design with composite stiffeners of corroded shear panels the designer should not worry about the orientation angle and focus only on calculating the sufficient number of stiffeners and their respective length and bending stiffness the vertical arrangement θ 90 of the stiffeners shown in fig 13 will be the examined case with the design variable n corresponding to the number of added stiffener pairs n 1 yields two stiffeners n 2 yields four stiffeners etc 4 2 design assessment procedure a preliminary design assessment procedure is proposed in fig 14 that promises the efficient derivation of a design that meets the imposed rehabilitation requirements the algorithm is perfomed in the combinatory ansys matlab framework the problem is focused on a shear panel with dimensions a x b and intact thickness t intact that was initially designed to be able to withstand the local loads in a hypothetical scenario of a special hull survey the panel was measured to have suffered from uniform over the area thickness wastage due to corrosion the measured thickness was t corroded in order to remain practical preliminary assessment of a repair design integrity is to be performed on the basis of a minimum factor of safety fos imposed requirement the obtained fos is defined as the ratio between the intact shear stress τintact and the one obtained from the corroded panel following a repair τrepaired 6 f o s τ repaired τ intact hence the optimization problem is set around finding the number length and cross section of the composite stiffeners that satisfy the min sof requirement the method initiates with the definition of the intact geometry and t corroded along with the min sof limit defined by the designer given the intact geometry of the shear panel the τ intact may be initially calculated directly through fea or through some sort of metamodels from experimental and or numerical tests the derivation of an adequate repair design depends on the initial thickness t intact of the panel and the thickness wastage according to eq 1 as aforementioned the thicker the plate is the higher is the resistance projected by the plate against elastic shear buckling therefore more in number and stiffer in bending composite stiffeners might be required to rehabilitate for the thickness wastage the same applies for relatively thin panels that have high thickness wastage in accordance to fig 2 therefore in the proposed method the number of stiffeners is evaluated incrementally over the design space defined by the range of l and ei at this point the problem is approached through doe methods and in particular central composite design ccd and response surface methods rsm nevshupa et al 2018 and myers et al 2016 the full factorial experimental design method assumed that the response varies in a linear manner within the selected range rsms allow for the interrogation of the design space by fitting quadratic polynomials that act as optimization models that have the general form 7 y β ο j 1 k β j x j j 1 k β j j x j 2 i j 2 k β i j x i x j where x j corresponds to the k design variables involved in the problem and parameters β ο β j and β jj correspond to the polynomial coefficients the design variables in this optimization scheme are the significant factors deduced from the full factorial analysis that is the length l and the bending stiffness ei denoted with variables x 1 and x 2 respectively as far as the model s response y is concerned this was represented by the factor of safety fos calculated for each observation through the application of eq 6 the ccd set up comes well along with the rsm with observations set at points laying at the mid distance between 1 and 1 that is 0 hence axial points and a central point are placed on top of the four factorial points as depicted in fig 15 forming a 9 design point test matrix each design point i produces the response of interest τrepaired i through fea of generated model having a repository of 9 observations then the second order polynomial of eq 7 was used to fit the quadratic surface over the design space once this action is performed then it is evaluated whether the surface includes design solutions that satisfy the design requirement i e solutions that yield fos min fos in case the requirement is met then it is up to the designer to select a given design point based on the pool of candidates a given ei value might be obtained by controlling the cross sectional dimensions of the stiffener and by selecting material for fibers gfrp or cfrp as for example depicted in fig 5 hence one may prefer selecting one cross section and corresponding material over another due to cost weight manufacturability or other type of constraints in the opposite case where the requirement is not met then the design is enhanced with 2 pairs of stiffeners and the optimization process based rsm is re established this procedure continues automatically until design points that satisfy the fos requirement are found 4 3 design examples in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed repair design method an illustrative example is presented let s consider the square steel plate with dimensions 2 5 m 2 5 m and intact thickness of 10 mm by considering a 0 5 mm thickness wastage due to corrosion t corroded 9 5 mm coming from 5 thickness reduction from the original plate thickness dnv gl 2013 which leads to a near 15 reduction of the original shear buckling load and minimum requirement in fos of 1 0 then the algorithm yields feasible solutions for n 1 one pair of stiffeners as shown in fig 16 the respective response surface that was used to fit the nine observations is given by the following equation 8 f o s 0 9630 0 0795 x 1 0 0223 x 2 0 0381 x 1 2 0 0262 x 1 x 2 0 0191 x 2 2 by examining the chart see fig 16b it is evident that there do exist plenty of design solutions in the right hand sided area area with fos 1 0 the designer may for example select a case laying on the red line that corresponds to stiffeners being 0 74 m long and with ei of 13793 knm 2 this bending stiffness corresponds at a cfrp material with the double sided bond case shown in fig 4f alternatively due to cost savings a gfrp stiffener with a single sided bond and having one web as in fig 4f but with a longer length of 0 9 m may also be used as the solution satisfies the requirement the area with fos 1 0 may be regarded as the design space where one may perform an optimization with respect to cost or weight savings by applying simple to use algorithms such as steepest ascent method etc in the case of having an increased min fos requirement for the same problem described above say 1 2 instead of 1 0 then the proposed algorithm yields feasible solutions in the design space formed by n 2 two pairs of stiffeners as in fig 13 no acceptable solutions exist with one pair of stiffeners this apparently may be concluded from examing the contour range of fig 16 the corresponding response surface for n 2 is shown in fig 17 and the polynomial is given by the following equation 9 f o s 1 1460 0 1817 x 1 0 0550 x 2 0 0017 x 1 2 0 0450 x 1 x 2 0 0483 x 2 2 the design chart shows the feasible design solutions that again it is up to the designer to select the best choice given additional design constraints in the case where the designer is willing to examine the adequacy and corresponding factor of safety obtained for different number of stiffener pairs then a combinatory design chart as the one depicted in fig 18 may be generated for a min fos 1 1 it is clear that for this specific requirement one pair of stiffeners generates a small fraction of the explored design space that demands for long and very stiff composite stiffeners increasing the number of pairs to two then there do exist much more design solutions 5 concluding remarks this work is focused on a primary design assessment of a novel repair technique for steel plated ship structures that suffer from thickness wastage due to corrosion the technique proposes bonding of composite stiffeners instead of welding steel ones its effectiveness has recently been experimentally verified in civil engineering applications with regards to the reinforcement of the web of big girders with a view on providing a first assessment of the repair method to the rehabilitation of shear panels found in ship hull structures e g webs of transverse stiffening the involved design parameters are identified and evaluated with respect to their rehabilitation effectiveness the design variables of interest are the number length orientation angle cross section and material of the stiffeners the monitored response of interest was the elastic shear buckling strength following the exploration of the design space through methods sourcing from design of experiments together with numerical experimentation the following concluding remarks are drawn the numerical experimentation under the foundation of elastic buckling has proven to be effective for performing a preliminary study of the alternative repair method but still needs to be compared with non linear fea results that will include steel yielding composite damage and debonding statistical methods for exploring the design space have been found to be powerful for understanding the influence of the involved factors a full factorial analysis has revealed that the orientation angle has an insignificant effect on the response whereas the length and bending stiffness of the stiffeners have an interdependent significant effect a design framework is proposed for providing a preliminary design assessment of the composite repair that allows for selecting the optimal design variables which satisfy the imposed buckling requirements e g factor of safety over the elastic buckling strength through local optimization as per the response surface method although the findings of this work are encouraging on the proposed technique more realistic simulations that include non linear effects progressive buckling material plasticity for the steel plates composite and adhesive softening behaviours debonding etc are under development an experimental program to further validate the proposed method is as well essential the proposed preliminary design method is scalable and adaptive to be applied to physical experimentation of numerical simulations that include non linear effects 
22577,short term predictions of wind and wave properties with a duration of 1 3 days are vital for decision making during the execution of marine operations one step ahead weather conditions can be accurately predicted via various methods however prediction over long horizons is challenging since multi step ahead prediction is typically faced with growing uncertainties in this study a hybrid method for predicting multi step ahead wind and wave conditions is proposed which combines a decomposition technique and the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis first the decomposition technique is applied to obtain stationary time series then multi step ahead forecasting is conducted using anfis in which three multi step ahead models the m 1 m n and m 1 slope models are employed to quantify the forecast uncertainty the mean value and standard deviation of the error factor are calculated the proposed method is evaluated by multi step ahead predictions within 24 h of wind and wave conditions at the north sea center utilizing hourly time series of the mean wind speed u w the significant wave height h s and the spectral peak period t p the results demonstrate that the forecast uncertainty increases with the prediction horizon and a prediction range determined by the error factor provides a basic reference for the use of predicted environmental conditions for marine operations keywords marine operations weather forecast multi step ahead prediction model uncertainty quantification 1 introduction according to the definition in det norske veritas 2011 marine operations are non routine operations of limited duration for handling objects and vessels in the marine environment during temporary phases such as the transport of large offshore oil gas platforms or topside structures the installation of offshore platforms and offshore wind turbines and the installation of subsea templates or structures such operations can only be performed within sea state limits weather statistics are used for planning operations while weather forecasts are required for deciding on when to start the operations as a result the accuracy of wind and wave condition forecasting is a critical factor in the planning of an operation during the execution phase if the forecasted weather conditions are unsuitable for a marine operation the operation will not be executed until the weather becomes suitable however if the actual future weather is within the safe limit the opportunity for executing the marine operation will be wasted and the duration of the operation will be extended by contrast if the forecasted weather conditions are suitable for operation while the actual weather conditions are unsuitable during the operation window the execution of the operation may lead to accidents such as injuries of personnel and damage to equipment however in the prediction of weather conditions several challenges are encountered such as the random and unsteady characteristics of wind and waves to predict environmental conditions accurately various methods have been proposed by researchers which can be classified into three main types physical methods statistical methods and machine learning methods the physical methods consider meteorological parameters and physical laws in establishing physical models for weather condition forecasting among them the use of empirical based models in wave and wind forecasting is widespread in empirical based models the generation of waves is assumed to be described by a function of meteorological parameters such as the fetch length and wind speed kazeminezhad et al 2005 the most popular of such models are smb bretschneider 1970 wilson 1965 jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 and donelan 1980 although the empirical based models are fast and accurate they can only be applied in limited cases bishop 1983 kamranzad et al 2011 with the rapid developments in computer technology during the last two decades several types of numerical models have been employed to forecast wave and wind characteristics to predict wind characteristics such as the wind speed numerical weather prediction nwp has been widely adopted cassola and burlando 2012 landberg 1999 watson et al 1994 the nwp model describes the physical processes of the atmosphere via conservation equations by numerically solving the equations in terms of weather data such as the temperatures pressure surface roughness and obstacles the wind speed can be predicted correspondingly nwp requires abundant physical background knowledge and relatively long computation time foley et al 2012 landberg et al 2003 wang et al 2016 in addition various problems are encountered such as lack of sufficient understanding for representing many physical processes in equation format and uncertainties in the surface characteristics lateral boundary conditions and initial state al yahyai et al 2010 which limit its practical application for wave characteristic prediction the most popular models are wam group 1988 wave watch iii tolman 1991 and swan booij et al 1999 these models represent the sea state and predict the evolution of the wave spectrum based on the energy balance equation in space and time via numerical techniques these techniques generally require expertise in their implementation browne et al 2007 mahjoobi et al 2008 in addition data driven approaches have been developed in recent years instead of considering physical phenomena in the environment the data driven approaches are purely mathematical and can predict wave and wind conditions based on only historical data these approaches can be divided into two main categories statistical methods and machine learning methods the statistical methods express the future data as a linear or non linear function of the historical data the most popular and widely known statistical methods that are applied in wave and wind forecasting are the autoregressive model ar poggi et al 2003 schlink and tetzlaff 1998 the autoregressive moving average arma erdem and shi 2011 lydia et al 2016 torres et al 2005 the autoregressive integrated moving average arima kamal and jafri 1997 kavasseri and seetharaman 2009 and kalman filter methods zuluaga et al 2015 however these methods typically cannot deal with non linear patterns qin et al 2017 by contrast machine learning models consider a network that represents the relationship between inputs and outputs based on various algorithms and utilize this network to perform wave and wind forecasting models of this type can be applied to systems in which the interrelations are not clear they can identify the relationship between the inputs and the outputs by learning from a large amount of data without relying on physical phenomena such as diffraction reflection and wave breaking for computing wave reflection and diffraction or the wave spectrum and energy balance equation because of this advantage representative machine learning techniques have been used for weather forecasting such as support vector machine svm berbić et al 2017 kamranzad et al 2011 mahjoobi and mosabbeb 2009 artificial neural networks anns agrawal and deo 2002 chang et al 2017 deo et al 2001 jain and deo 2007 mandal et al 2005 and the fuzzy inference system fis kazeminezhad et al 2005 özger and şen 2007 the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis which is a hybrid intelligent system a combination of ann and fis has been employed recently özger and şen 2007 and akpınar et al 2014 applied anfis to predict wave parameters and compared the auto regressive moving average results with the results of the exogenous input armax wilson shore protection manual spm jonswap and coastal engineering manual cem methods kazeminezhad et al 2007 compared wave predictions that were obtained via anfis with those of other methods such as the cem ann and fis methods in addition the efficiencies of anfis support vector machines svms bayesian networks bns and anns in wave height prediction were investigated by malekmohamadi et al 2011 in most of the above studies historical data were used directly to train anfis model thus the non stationarity of the data was ignored stefanakos and schinas 2015 and duru and yoshida 2012 conducted a series of studies and proved that non stationarity is inherent in time series of wind and wave parameters due to the seasonal effect therefore prior to forecasting the non stationarity should be removed from the initial time series based on this strategy stefanakos stefanakos 2016a b stefanakos and vanem 2018 developed an anfis model via non stationary modelling for the prediction of wind and wave parameters at the north atlantic and the pacific ocean and more accurate forecasts were obtained these studies consider only one step ahead prediction approaches for generating multi step ahead forecasts have rarely been studied because compared to one step ahead forecasting multi step ahead prediction is more difficult taieb and bontempi 2011 since growing uncertainties due to e g lack of information and accumulation of prediction errors must be considered however an advantage of multi step ahead wind and wave forecasting is that it can provide more information about the future which is important for marine operations as weather variations in the future are a critical factor in decision making during the execution of marine operations deo and naidu 1998 used neural networks to predict ocean wave heights in real time in that study one to two step ahead predictions were obtained based on the current observations and according to the simulations the forecasting accuracy decreased as the forecasting lead time increased basu et al 2005 developed a nonlinear technique that was based on the genetic algorithm ga for significant wave height prediction in that work daily time series of the surface wind speed and the significant wave height in the arabian sea and the bay of bengal were used to develop the technique and three step ahead prediction was conducted ahmed and khalid 2017 presented a nonlinear autoregressive neural network narnn for predicting wind speed up to six hours ahead niu et al 2018 proposed a hybrid approach for 1 step 3 step and 6 step ahead wind speed forecasting that utilized optimal feature selection and an ann all results demonstrated that the forecast error increased significantly with each step ahead forecast although the above studies consider the application of multi step ahead prediction models they focus on forecasting up to six steps in the future few studies have considered prediction with more steps ahead such forecasting is much more important in practice especially for marine operations because some operations must be viewed as continuous events hence once the first operation has been performed the operation cannot be interrupted and the duration of the entire process will be more than just a few hours under this circumstance multi step ahead prediction with larger numbers of steps ahead can effectively capture the dynamic behavior of future wave and wind conditions during the execution process which is crucial for improving the security of entire marine operations based on this background the main objective of this work is the development of a multi step ahead model for weather condition forecasting with a long forecast horizon considering the data used hourly time series of mean wind speed u w significant wave height h s and spectral peak period t p from 2001 to 2010 at the north sea center and the timetable for marine operations this work intends to predict wind and wave conditions in one day ahead namely twenty four steps ahead to realize multi step ahead predictions a hybrid method consisting decomposition technique and anfis is developed firstly the training and testing data are pre processed by the decomposition technique then the anfis combined with a multi step ahead model m 1 m n or m 1 slope is built based on the training data the m 1 model applies a one step prediction model iteratively where the forecasted data are utilized as the input for the prediction of the following time step the m 1 slope model also adopts forecasted data but includes slope information when selecting the training dataset instead of using forecasted data the m n model only applies the actual data and redevelops a new model for each time step furthermore the forecast performance of the prediction model is evaluated on the testing data by an uncertainty quantification analysis of the forecast errors at each lead time finally a method of applying the confidence interval for the predicted conditions is proposed to utilize the long horizon forecasts the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a brief description of the study site and the considered environmental data in section 3 the details of the methodology are introduced the decomposition technique anfis multi step ahead forecasting models uncertainty quantification analysis and the whole process are described in this section then the short term prediction of wind and wave conditions at the center of the north sea is conducted in section 4 section 4 1 investigates the weather forecasting performance of the decomposition anfis method in terms of the one step ahead prediction results section 4 2 selects the optimal multi step ahead models and performs a comparative analysis with the proposed models finally the main conclusions of this study are summarized in section 5 2 offshore site and environmental data in the application of the weather conditions to marine operations the environmental variables that typically must be forecasted are the mean wind speed u w the significant wave height h s and the peak spectral wave period t p in this study the north sea is considered and 18 sites in this area are illustrated in fig 1 the dataset in each site is comprised of hindcast data that are based on a high resolution regional atmospheric model skiron and an ocean wave model wam to generate the hindcast data the mean wind speed at a height of 10 m above the mean sea level is produced by the atmospheric model then it will be used as the input for the wave model to obtain wave properties based on these properties three hourly time series of the mean wind speed u w and hourly time series of the significant wave height h s and the peak spectral wave period t p are obtained the covered period is from january 2001 to december 2010 for additional details see li et al 2013 although these data are hindcast data we consider them as actual data that will be used to generate the anfis model for prediction and for testing the north sea center site 15 fig 1 is selected as the study site in this paper many marine operations such as the monopile installation acero et al 2016 and blade installation jiang et al 2018 of an offshore wind turbine have been designed and analyzed in this region this site is a shallow shelf sea with a mean water depth of 29 m and a distance to shore of 300 km during the specified period the 50 year return period wind speed and the significant wave height are 27 2 m s and 8 66 m respectively and the mean value of the peak spectral wave period is 6 93 s as an overview of the environment at this site time series u w h s and t p of two months of winter from 2001 01 01 to 2001 02 28 1416 hourly points and those of summer from 2001 07 01 to 2001 08 31 1488 hourly points are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively high variability is observed in all three series in summer and winter therefore it is necessary to predict environmental conditions prior to executing marine operations however in modelling multi step ahead prediction significant challenges are encountered due to the randomness and non stationarity of the time series in such cases to obtain predictions via forecasting methods sufficient data must be used to train the model accordingly in the ten year hourly time series of u w h s and t p the data for the first nine years 78888 data points are selected as the training data and the data for the tenth year 8760 data points are selected as the testing data which is sufficiently long for investigating the behavior of forecast uncertainty in models with a possibility of covering most of the typical sea states 3 methodology 3 1 decomposition technique a long term time series of wave or wind data can be considered as a nonlinear non stationary and seasonal time series for data of this type the monthly mean value and the standard deviation of the series can be used to extract the non stationarity athanassoulis and stefanakos 1995 the object is extended to a multi variate time series and the decomposition model stefanakos and schinas 2014 can be expressed as follows eq 1 1 y t m t t w t n 1 n 1 n n n 1 or in matrix notation 2 y 1 t y 2 t y n t y n t m 1 t m 2 t m n t m n t σ 11 t σ 12 t σ 1 n t σ 21 t σ 22 t σ 2 n t σ n 1 t σ n 1 t σ n 2 t σ n 2 t σ n n t σ n n t w 1 t w 2 t w n t w n t where the number of time series is n in eq 2 y t represents the initial time series and it can be expressed as 3 y n j m τ k j 1 j m 1 12 k 1 k m n 1 n where j is the year index m is the month index and τk is the kth observation in the mth month the number of observations in the mth month is k m the seasonal patterns are characterized by m t and σ t which are the monthly mean value vector and the covariance matrix with period of one year respectively these two terms can be estimated by averaging the time series of monthly mean values m 3 n j m and the covariance matrix s 3 nl j m over j years stefanakos et al 2006 4 m 3 n m 1 j j 1 j m 3 n j m 1 j j 1 j 1 k m k 1 k m y n j m τ k 5 s

third index in y n j m τ k apart from the seasonal patterns the residue part namely w t is the corresponding stationary time series of y t in this study there are three initial joint long term time series of wind and wave parameters the mean wind speed u w the significant wave height h s and the peak spectral wave period t p namely n equals 3 in eq 3 via eqs 4 5 the deterministic seasonal patterns namely m t σ t can be easily estimated from the data after that the corresponding stationary time series namely w t can be calculated via eq 2 to demonstrate this clearly the decomposed time series that correspond to the series in figs 2 and 3 are plotted in figs 4 and 5 the time series after decomposition are zero mean stochastic processes and the seasonal effects in the data are significantly reduced 3 2 anfis the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis jang et al 1996 is a hybrid intelligent system that is a combination of a fuzzy inference system fis and an adaptive neural network ann first the fis is presented a fuzzy inference system fis is a nonlinear method for mapping inputs to output that is based on fuzzy logic theory in fuzzy logic theory the focus is on understanding the concept of a fuzzy set in a class set an element is either a member of the set or not and the corresponding result is 1 or 0 by contrast a fuzzy set is a set that lacks a clearly defined boundary a fuzzy set is an extension of a classical set whose elements can belong to more than one set and the membership degree which is between 0 and 1 is used to quantify the grade of membership of the element to each set the degree of membership of a set is defined by a membership function mf which provides a measure of the similarity of the element to a fuzzy set for example if x is a universe of discourse such as h s and x is an element of x then a fuzzy set o such as high on x can be described as eq 6 6 o x μ o x x x where μ o x is the membership function that is associated with x in fuzzy set o and expresses the degree to which a value of h s belongs to set high the most common types of mfs are triangular gaussian and sigmoid in a fis the mapping of input variables to an output is characterized by a list of fuzzy statements which are called if then rules if then rules are expressions of the form if x is a then y is b and are used to infer a fuzzy output based on fuzzy inputs where a and b are linguistic labels of fuzzy sets characterized by mfs the structure of a fis is illustrated in fig 6 that consists of four functional blocks there are two important types of fuzzy inference methods the mamdani 1974 and takagi sugeno takagi and sugeno 1993 fuzzy inference methods they differ in terms of their defuzzification schemes and the latter is used in this study in the ts method the outcome of each if then fuzzy rule is a scalar value rather than a fuzzy set for the output variable of the form eq 7 if x 1 i s s r 1 x 2 i s s r 2 x n i s s r n 7 then y p r x 1 q r x 2 t r x n where x i and y are the inputs and output respectively s r i is a linguistic value such as low or high for h s which is represented by a fuzzy set and p r q r and t r are parameters that must be determined the if part is called the premise which contains the mfs parameters that describe the shapes of the mfs and the then part is called the consequent which contains parameters that describe the linear relationship of the inputs when using fis the main challenge is the selection of the parameters in the fuzzy knowledge base traditionally the parameters are determined based on the experience of experts or past available data of the system for selecting the parameters an adaptive neural network is combined with the fis to optimize the premise and consequent parameters based on the available datasets using a hybrid learning algorithm this strategy was proposed by jang 1993 and the method in which an adaptive neural network and fis are combined is called the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis in practice the structure of anfis is similar to that of a multi layer neural network anfis has an input layer an output layer and three hidden layers that are related to mfs and if then rules to illustrate the procedure the structure of a simple anfis that consists of two inputs namely x1 and x2 and one output namely y is presented in fig 7 in this anfis structure the first layer is the input layer which contains crisp inputs x 1 and x 2 the second layer is the fuzzifying layer in which the inputs x i are fuzzified into the membership values μ aj x i based on the mfs of linguistic labels a j as expressed in eq 8 this layer can be considered an adaptive layer since the outputs depend on the parameters in the mfs in this example the mfs which are denoted as μ aj are gaussian type functions 8 o i j μ a j x i f o r i j 1 2 if the number of crisp inputs exceeds one the weight of each rule must be determined by using fuzzy operators the third layer contains two operators and is divided into two layers which are called the implication and normalizing layers in these two layers the firing strength w i j for each rule and the normalized firing strength w i j are calculated via eqs 9 10 9 w i j μ a i x 1 μ a j x 2 f o r i j 1 2 10 w i j w i j w i j f o r i j 1 2 then the outcome o i j of each rule can be calculated in the defuzzifying layer using the corresponding if then rule and the obtained rule s weight as expressed in eq 11 similarly this layer is also an adaptive layer because parameters p i q i and r i in the if then rules should be determined 11 o i j w i j y i j w i j p k x 1 q k x 2 r k f o r i j 1 2 k 1 i j based on the sum of all outcomes o i j the weighted average of all if then rules results the overall output y can be estimated via eq 12 12 y o i j in this process an adaptive neural network is applied to determine the parameters in the two adaptive layers which is represented by the red cycle in fig 7 according to the fixed values of the premise parameters in the if part the information is propagated forward to identify the consequent parameters via the least square method in addition by fixing the consequent parameters in the then part the error is propagated back to the fuzzifying layer and the premise parameters are modified then the optimal values can be tracked by performing this procedure based on the training data the optimal anfis can be identified overall the only information that must be specified by the user is the number and the types of mfs for each input variable in this study the anfis is utilized for both one and multi step ahead predictions for one step ahead prediction three simplest anfiss for the mean wind speed u w the significant wave height h s and the spectral peak period t p are developed which are expressed in eqs 13 15 respectively the basic idea is to use the training dataset to derive functional relationships between the parameters at the current time and at the next time step so that one step ahead prediction can be made however multi step ahead prediction requires more complex anfis models which will be presented and discussed in section 3 3 a mean wind speed u w 13 u w t 1 f 1 u w t b significant wave height h s 14 h s t 1 f 2 u w t h s t c peak spectral wave period t p 15 t p t 1 f 3 u w t h s t t p t where function f in each system represents the prediction model the number of rules depends on the fuzzy sets for each input variable 3 3 multi step ahead forecasting models for one step ahead prediction only data at the current time are used as input to predict the next step data as expressed in eqs 13 15 however due to the complexity of the prediction applying the same model to multi step ahead forecasting will result in a significant reduction in accuracy therefore several alternatives have been proposed for building multi step ahead prediction models in sections 3 3 1 3 3 3 three models for realizing multi step ahead forecasting are discussed in detail every forecasting model requires more than one input to maintain the consistency of the variables data at any time t are represented by x t x t n denotes the n step ahead data which are unknown output and x t x t 1 x t m 1 represents the input set which contains the previous m data in addition f denotes the prediction model between the inputs and the output 3 3 1 m 1 model the m 1 model requires only the training of a one step ahead prediction model f based on the training data which is expressed as eq 16 16 x t 1 f x t x t 1 x t 2 x t m 1 to forecast n steps ahead the above model is applied iteratively however in the input set the predicted value of the previous step is used instead of the actual data considering prediction of significant wave height h s as an example after establishing the one step ahead prediction model one step ahead value hs t 1 is predicted eq 17 17 h ˆ s t 1 f h s t h s t 1 h s t 2 h s t m 1 then the forecasted value namely h ˆ s t 1 is considered as part of the input set for predicting the next step value namely h ˆ s t 2 based on the same one step ahead model f eq 18 18 h ˆ s t 2 f h ˆ s t 1 h s t h s t 1 h s t 2 h s t m 2 then for the n step ahead prediction this procedure is repeated and h ˆ s t 3 to h ˆ s t n are predicted iteratively the iteration process may lead to accumulated errors since after one step prediction the input set is composed of forecasted values rather than actual data especially when n exceeds m namely after m step ahead prediction the input set does not contain any actual data but only forecasted values in such cases the forecasts may suffer from low performance however the main advantage of the m 1 model is that only one training process is required for obtaining the prediction model and this model does not change between steps therefore the forecasting time is significantly reduced and the computational efficiency is increased to illustrate the application of the m 1 model in this study the architectures of both the training and testing processes are plotted in fig 8 in fig 8 it is assumed that the training and testing sets contain l and k points respectively to determine the optimal function which is expressed in eq 16 l m samples are used to train the relationship between the inputs and the output the inputs and output are represented by blue and red boxes respectively in fig 8 then in the testing data set for a specified input vector the following n step ahead forecasts can be predicted directly via iteration under the established prediction model the boxes that are highlighted in yellow represent the predicted data and as the number of steps increases the number of predictions that are used as inputs to obtain the next step forecast value also increases a complete simulation of obtaining n step ahead predictions is considered one case to evaluate the m 1 model the prediction process is repeated over the testing period to obtain many forecast cases k m n cases in this example then the forecast uncertainty of the model at step one to step n can be evaluated via uncertainty quantification analysis which is described in section 3 4 3 3 2 m n model in the m n model a separate training process and the corresponding prediction model f n are required at each step n the prediction model can be represented as eq 19 19 x t n f n x t x t 1 x t 2 x t m 1 where f n denotes the prediction model at step n in the m n model the input set always consists of the last m data in the time series that are known therefore in contrast to the m 1 model the m n model does not use any predicted value and thus prevents accumulated errors however this model is time consuming since n models must be trained independently when forecasting n steps ahead furthermore the correlation between inputs and output weakens as n increases thereby increasing the difficulty of capturing their relationship the architecture of the m n model that is applied in this study is illustrated in fig 9 in the training process n step ahead prediction models are established separately for each n to display them clearly fig 9 shows them according to the color of the output after establishing n step ahead prediction models for a specified input vector n step ahead values are predicted according to the corresponding model for example in the testing time series the first m data are selected as inputs for predicting the data for the subsequent n steps first the first step ahead data namely the m 1 data are predicted based on the one step ahead model whose outputs are both displayed in red then the second step ahead data namely the m 2 data green are predicted according to the same input vector by the green model the second step ahead prediction model this procedure is repeated until at the last step n the m n data purple are predicted according to the purple model which is the n step ahead prediction model this is one complete case of m n multi step prediction via repeated prediction in the testing period the uncertainty for each step can be quantified as in the m 1 model 3 3 3 m 1 slope model since the incoming weather conditions are closely related to the trend of the last several observations the slope information between the last few data can be induced for prediction the model in this study is called m 1 slope model the m 1 slope model is similar to the m 1 model which is also based on a recursive process however there are several differences between these two models in the selection of training data in the m 1 model all data during the training period are included in the training dataset in contrast in the m 1 slope model only data that have similar properties to the current data can be selected as training data this means that for weather forecasting to predict the future weather variations it is necessary to find historical data that are similar to the current weather conditions and utilize them to predict the future weather the selection criteria are the values and slopes of the current and previous data the prediction procedure is as follows 3 3 3 1 selection of the training dataset assume the current time is t and denote the data by x t find historical data x t during the training period that satisfy the following conditions a x t x t an allowable error b the symbols of the slopes at x t and x t are the same c slope at x t slope at x t an allowable error d the symbols of the slopes at x t 1 and x t 1 are the same e slope at x t 1 slope at x t 1 an allowable error then data x t can be selected the corresponding input set x t m 1 x t 1 x t and output x t 1 can be selected as one training sample after all the data that satisfy the above requirements have been selected the prediction model can be established according to the corresponding training samples in this method allowable errors are determined based on the bivariate histogram of the parameter and its slope 3 3 3 2 prediction after establishing the prediction model x t m 1 x t 1 x t is supplied to this model as input and one step ahead prediction x ˆ t 1 can be obtained 3 3 3 3 iteration next the prediction x ˆ t 1 is utilized as the input and the input vector becomes x t m 2 x t x ˆ t 1 then the training dataset is selected according to x ˆ t 1 and x t the selection process is the same as in 1 the prediction model based on the new training data is applied to obtain the two step ahead prediction x ˆ t 2 when no training data are available the prediction process stops otherwise the process is iterated until an n step ahead prediction namely x ˆ t n is obtained if all values from x t 1 to x t n must be predicted n models must be constructed similar to the m n model however this model only applies historical data that have the same values and slopes as the current data to establish the prediction model which could improve the prediction efficiency in addition compared with the m 1 model the m 1 slope model may accumulate less error since the prediction model will be updated at each step ahead to illustrate the architecture of the m 1 slope model the selection process of the training data in the m 1 slope model is sketched in fig 10 according to fig 10 a long term time series of data is divided into training data and testing data instead of building a prediction model based on all training data the first step is to select a suitable training data set in terms of the values and slopes of the testing data at points m and m 1 here the input vector consists of the first m data during testing period limited by the figure display only the information of the point m is plotted in the figure by taking advantage of this value and slope by adding an allowable error a series of points within the yellow range can be identified in the training period shown as red circles the corresponding input output pairs of these points can be selected as training data for predicting the next step data then using the value and slope of the predicted data x m 1 another training data set can be identified for establishing a new prediction model and the second step ahead value x m 2 can be forecasted via this recursive process the predicted time series shown as the blue dashed line can be obtained to illustrate the process more clearly a magnified image of the difference between the forecasted and the actual time series is plotted and the eight step ahead prediction procedure is also shown the red circle within the purple range after obtaining the forecasted time series the same uncertainty quantification analysis can be conducted as described above in contrast to the previous two models the m 1 slope model considers the slope of the data hence the historical data cannot be considered when the slope is opposite that of the current data even if the values are nearly the same via this approach many irrelevant sea conditions can be removed thereby significantly reducing the computation time compared to the m n model furthermore this method is essentially a recursive method that can preserve the complex dependencies among the forecasted data 3 4 uncertainty quantification traditionally various error statistics have been used to measure the forecast accuracy such as the mean absolute error mae the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute percentage error mape most of these statistics are non negative and the direction of the errors is not considered however in weather forecasting the directions of forecast errors in various sea states are of great importance ignoring the directions of the errors would increase the risk of decision making during the execution of marine operations in addition to account for the uncertainty in the forecasts dnv jip 2007 introduced a safety factor into the allowable limits of sea states that are used for marine operations however this alpha factor approach has several limitations for instance the alpha factor for significant wave height depending on the prediction horizon is explicitly given in the dnv offshore standard while this factor for other weather parameters such as spectral peak period has not been given yet meanwhile the alpha factor which is tabulated in the dnv offshore standard is only developed for the north and norwegian seas and is also dependent on the weather forecast techniques in this section an uncertainty quantification method is presented for improving the knowledge and understanding of a forecasting model for the short term prediction of wind and wave conditions the accuracy of a forecasting model is evaluated by comparing the forecasts to corresponding actual values to quantify environmental variables the error must be normalized for this purpose a forecast error factor which is denoted as ϵ m t is introduced which is utilized as an estimate of the forecast accuracy this error factor is defined as the difference between the forecasted and actual values at the same time instant normalized by the corresponding actual value 20 ε m t f t a t a t where f t and a t are the forecasted and actual values respectively at time t according to the above equation a perfect weather forecast would yield a forecast error factor of 0 to assess the performance of a forecasting model under various sea states all values of ϵ m during the testing period must be calculated based on the series of ϵ m values the forecast uncertainty is quantified by the statistics mean and standard deviation and their distributions for example the methodology for estimating the uncertainty in a one step ahead prediction model is illustrated in fig 11 for multi step ahead forecasts uncertainty quantification analysis is performed for each forecast time step in addition the quantified uncertainties can be utilized to provide a prediction range that is based on the multi step ahead predictions the details are provided in section 5 3 5 summary this section describes the main procedures of the proposed method for predicting short term weather conditions and assessing the forecasting performance the whole prediction process is illustrated in fig 12 and the main steps are listed below 4 results and discussion referring to the execution time of the typical marine operation the prediction period is expected to be more than one day hence n is selected as 24 in this study adopting the proposed prediction models the 24 steps case is conducted to predict u w h s and t p at the north sea center based on the results a comparative analysis of the decomposition anfis method with three multi step ahead forecasting models is performed in the following parts to demonstrate the forecasting performance of the decomposition anfis method the one step ahead prediction results are presented in section 4 1 and the results of multi step ahead prediction are summarized in section 4 2 4 1 one step ahead prediction results in this part one step ahead models for predicting wave and wind conditions are developed three simple fis models are represented by eqs 13 15 and the structure of the models are summarized in table 1 in each model all input variables are partitioned into two fuzzy sets low and high gaussian type mfs are selected for inputs and linear type for the output as a result the total numbers of if then rules in the u w h s and t p prediction models are 2 4 and 8 respectively for instance one of the rules of t p prediction can be expressed as follows if u w t is low h s t is high and t p t is high then t p t 1 p1 u w t q1 h s t r1 t p t where p1 q1 and r1 are the unknown parameters that must be determined from the training data after determining the structure of the fis model the training data are utilized to train this model and to optimize the parameters of fis using neural networks as an example the mfs of h s that are used in t p prediction before and after training are plotted in fig 13 there are considerable changes in the shapes of the membership functions after training it should be noted that the initial shape of mfs only depends on the type of mfs and the range of training data which would enhance the reproducibility of this method after establishing the optimal anfis testing data are used to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction method the forecasted u w h s and t p and the corresponding actual data are plotted in fig 14 a b and c respectively in each subfigure the blue lines are obtained using the actual data at the current time to predict the one step ahead environmental conditions all the predicted data are presented in the figures and compared with the actual data according to fig 14 the forecasted data are close to the actual data in both wind and wave conditions throughout the entire testing period which can also be observed in the distributions of the forecast error factors as shown in fig 15 all three distributions of the forecast error factors of u w h s and t p predictions are concentrated around zero in addition the range of errors that are within one standard deviation of the mean e g the range for u w prediction which is shown as red dash lines is narrow hence the one step ahead prediction model has lower forecast uncertainty under various sea states therefore the prediction method that combines the decomposition technique and anfis has high application potential for predicting environmental conditions the detailed statistical results of the forecast error factor are included in the multi step ahead prediction results in section 4 2 4 2 multi step ahead prediction results 4 2 1 selection of the optimal model in the multi step ahead forecasting models the size of input set m must be specified in advance in practice a suitable value for m is not easy to determine typically if a larger amount of input data is available more historical information can be utilized and thus predictions are expected to be more accurate however the computation time of a prediction model would increase dramatically with the number of inputs especially if optimization techniques are required during the training phase in this study m is determined by comparing the forecast performances of multi step ahead prediction models under various values of m starting from m 1 the optimal value of m is the value that corresponds to the minimum statistics of forecast error factors for the predictions in the m 1 model the optimal value of m is selected by comparing the forecast uncertainties of all 24 steps because the computational burden is low by contrast in the m n model only the forecast uncertainties at a few steps are considered as criteria because this model demands a large computational effort compared to the m 1 model in addition the m n model only uses actual data as inputs hence it is possible to apply many variables that are related to the predicted parameter for prediction for example historical wind conditions such as wind speed and wind direction can be applied to predict the future significant wave height in addition the structure of the m n model may be more complicated and the corresponding computation time is longer therefore the optimal m for the m n model is selected by only comparing the forecast uncertainties at several specified steps 4 2 1 1 m 1 model in the following u w h s and t p predictions m is varied from 1 to 5 to modify the structure of the prediction model after establishing the model with a specified m 24 step ahead values are predicted iteratively by repeatedly making 24 step ahead predictions within the testing period the statistical results of forecast error factors at each step n for various values of m are calculated and plotted in fig 16 where a b and c are the results of u w h s and t p respectively in each subfigure the mean values and standard deviations of forecast error factors are represented by solid lines and dashed lines as functions of the number of steps n individually as illustrated in fig 16 a the blue line which corresponds to m 2 is the optimal result since the mean values and the standard deviations for all steps are less than 0 2 and 0 8 respectively in fig 16 b and c m 2 is a more suitable choice for h s and t p predictions in terms of both the forecast performance and the computation time in summary the optimal m 1 models for multi step ahead u w h s and t p predictions with m 2 are listed below eqs 22 and 23 21 u w t 1 f u w t u w t 3 22 h s t 1 f h s t h s t 1 23 t p t 1 f t p t t p t 1 in eq 21 the input terms are u w t and u w t 3 instead of u w t and u w t 1 because the wind speed data are three hourly data 4 2 1 2 m n model to evaluate the influence of the value of m on the m n model prediction of the wind speed the significant wave height and the peak spectral wave period will be discussed in wind speed prediction the historical data of wind direction dir and wind speed u w can be considered as input variables the wind direction must be transformed to range between 0 and 1 sylaios et al 2009 which is expressed as eq 24 u w m n models for various combinations of m and variables are listed in table a 1 in the appendix in the t p and h s m n prediction models as waves are influenced by the strength of the wind models that consider wind variables such as the wind direction dir and the wind speed u w are also induced in an attempt to capture this dependency the possible models of h s and t p are summarized in the appendix and described in tables a 2 and a 3 since the calculation time sharply increases with the size of the input set only models with 6 or fewer items are considered 24 d i r 1 θ 180 i f 0 θ 180 θ 180 180 i f 180 θ 360 after determining the structure of the prediction models several 1st 5th 15th and 24th step ahead predictions are made for each variable after prediction the statistics of forecast error factors for the corresponding models are summarized and plotted in figs 17 19 as displayed in fig 17 there is not much difference in the prediction accuracy among models however the models models 4 8 that include both u w and dir yield more accurate prediction results compared with the models models 1 3 that are only based on u w a similar phenomenon can also be observed in figs 18 and 19 by considering both the computation time and the forecast uncertainty the optimal u w h s and t p m n prediction models are models 7 9 and 6 in tables a 1 a 3 respectively which are listed below eqs 25 26 and 27 25 u w t n f u w t d i r t u w t 3 u w t 6 u w t 9 26 h s t n f h s t u w t d i r t h s t 1 u w t 1 27 t p t n f t p t h s t u w t the accuracy of the m n model appears to be only slightly sensitive to the value of m with the selected anfis configuration and data there is no clear benefit in increasing m however due to heavy computational demand of running the anfis simulations only relatively simple models with small m values are developed in this study since the use of more complex anfis models may improve the forecast accuracy an effort can be considered to simulate anfis with more inputs in future researches by contrast the types of variables that are included in the prediction model have a strong impact on the accuracy for wind and waves the more variables that are associated with the predicted value the more accurate the obtained prediction thus to decrease the forecast uncertainty in multi step ahead predictions the variables that are related to the predicted parameter should be included if possible for the m 1 slope model since it is essentially an iterative model m is selected as 2 for all u w h s and t p prediction models by referring to the above sensitivity analysis results of the m 1 model 4 2 2 comparison of the forecasting models this section presents a comparative analysis among the three multi step ahead forecasting models at the beginning three models of multi step ahead prediction namely the m 1 m n and m 1 slope models which use decomposition anfis are developed based on the training data the input size m for each model is the optimal value that was determined in section 4 2 1 and the forecast horizon is the following 24 h then many twenty four step ahead predictions can be obtained during the testing period on basis of the corresponding obtained prediction model finally an uncertainty quantification analysis of the forecast error is conducted to assess the forecasting performances of the models the prediction results of u w h s and t p and the corresponding actual series are plotted in fig b 1 b 2 and b 3 in the appendix in which the actual and forecasted data are represented by black and red lines subfigures a and b in each figure depict the results that are based on the m 1 and m 1 slope models and c depicts the results that are based on the m n model the predicted time series that were obtained iteratively and separately by applying the m 1 and m n models consist of a few consecutive 24 step predictions which correspond to the architectures in figs 8 and 9 by contrast for the m 1 slope model it may not be possible to predict 24 steps for all cases to present the characteristics of the prediction models clearly considering the h s prediction as an example several cases of prediction results that are based on the three models are extracted from fig b2 and shown in fig 20 in each subfigure the black lines depict actual time series and the predicted time series are represented by red lines in addition the green points correspond to the beginning of each 24 step prediction case which correspond to one step ahead forecasted data similarly the blue points represent the 24 step ahead forecasted data according to fig 20 b the m 1 slope model cannot perform the 24 step prediction in all cases especially near the peaks of high sea states however compared to the results in fig 20 a and c the m 1 slope model can capture the data variation although the positions of peaks troughs may not be captured exactly overall from the predicted time series in fig b1 b 3 it is concluded that the proposed models can predict the environmental conditions to a certain extent however due to the randomness in the occurrence of waves and wind it is difficult to realize high accuracy in forecasting all points especially for high sea states in addition only observing the long term forecasted time series renders it difficult to compare the proposed three prediction models therefore the uncertainty quantification analysis must be used to evaluate and compare the accuracies of the three multi step ahead prediction methods fig 21 presents the results of multi step ahead forecasting models in predicting u w h s and t p at various steps n in each subfigure black red and blue lines represent statistics of the corresponding forecast error factors ϵ m that are based on the m 1 model the m n model and the m 1 slope model respectively to distinguish the statistics the mean values are represented by circle marks and the asterisks correspond to the standard deviations the forecast uncertainty varies with the step n in both wind and wave condition predictions the forecast error of the m n model exhibits monotonic behavior with respect to the prediction step whereas the forecast errors of the other two models exhibit variations because predicted values are used in the other two models fig 21 a compares the models in terms of forecast performance for the wind speed u w among the three proposed multi step ahead forecasting models the m 1 and m 1 slope models outperform the m n model as n increases the forecast uncertainty of the m n model significantly increases which is reflected in the mean value and the standard deviation of the 24th step which reach 0 33 and 1 respectively this increase in uncertainty may be because the wind speed time series is so random that there is little correlation between the current data and the data for the following few hours in the comparative analysis of the m 1 and m 1 slope models when n is large the mean values of the forecast error factors are positive and negative respectively as a result the m 1 model can be considered the best performing model for u w prediction since its prediction is relatively conservative fig 21 b shows the h s prediction all three models yield almost identical results at the first step at this step the forecast uncertainties from the three models are low as reflected in the near zero mean values and standard deviations with the increase of the forecast horizon the m 1 slope model shows lower forecast uncertainty compared with the other two methods by inspecting fig 21 b although the standard deviation of the forecast error factors from the three models are similar the mean values of the errors from the m 1 slope model are lower for example for n 24 the mean values of the forecast error factors that are obtained using the m 1 model and the m n model are 0 14 and 0 22 respectively compared to only 0 004 for the m 1 slope model hence the m 1 slope model outperforms the others in fig 21 c the t p forecast performances for the three multi step ahead prediction models are displayed the level of uncertainty is lower than in h s and u w predictions all three models yield satisfactory results since the mean values and standard deviations of the forecast error factor for all steps are less than 0 1 and 0 28 respectively comparing the statistical results the m n method can provide more stable multi step ahead predictions at any step this can be observed in the lower fluctuation of the forecast performance as functions of the forecast lead time thus the m n model performs the best in predicting multi step t p according to fig 21 as the lead time increases the forecast uncertainty increases for all multi step ahead forecasting methods to display it clearly a probability distribution of the forecast error factor is used to describe forecast uncertainty at each step for example fig 22 shows forecast error distributions in t p prediction for various values of n in fig 22a the distributions are more concentrated around the mean value in the cases with small n hence there is a lower forecast uncertainty for lead times from 1 to 8 h ahead however as n increases the distributions become increasingly wide hence the uncertainty in the forecasts increases most of the forecast errors prior to the 8th step are concentrated between 0 3 and 0 3 while those after the 8th step are in the range of 0 6 to 0 6 as illustrated above the forecast horizon has an important effect on the performances of the multi step ahead forecasting models in predicting both wind and wave conditions by applying the combination of the decomposition technique and anfis the environmental conditions one to five steps ahead can be predicted accurately however due to the error accumulation problem of the m 1 and m 1 slope models and the uncorrelated input output sample in the m n model the performances of all three multi step ahead prediction models deteriorate as n increases under the circumstances for a specified step prediction the mean value and the standard deviation of the errors can be utilized to provide a prediction range instead of a single forecasted point based on the central limit theorem the distribution of the forecast error factor can be approximated by a normal distribution according to the properties of the normal distribution 68 of the error is contained within one standard deviation of the mean namely within m σ m σ applying this error range to the predicted value f t a prediction range r a t is calculated via eq 20 this range can be expressed as eq 28 where it is expected to cover the future actual weather conditions 28 r a t f t 1 m s t d where m and std are the mean value and the standard deviation of the forecast error factor and f t is the forecasted data at time t through the above process the future data at a specified step ahead can be represented by a range r a t rather than a separate prediction point f t via this approach the high uncertainty prediction can be used in practice to evaluate the proposed method two typical examples are selected for each environmental parameter and the prediction ranges for the following 24 h are identified from the fitted error curves the corresponding prediction ranges of u w h s and t p are shown in figs 23 25 respectively each subfigure depicts one example including the predicted and actual data and the prediction range according to all three figures although the red and blue lines differ which demonstrates that the forecasts may not be accurate for all 24 steps ahead the prediction ranges grey areas always contain the actual data hence if the accuracy of a large step ahead prediction is too uncertain to be adopted the prediction range can provide guidance for the variation of the future sea state therefore it is concluded that the proposed method is effective in capturing the future weather conditions in practice in addition in fig 23 b as the number of prediction steps increases the prediction range does not always widen because the m 1 model uses forecasted data for prediction which will lead to error accumulation this situation is not realistic especially if the number of forecast steps is further increased as a result the m n model may be considered the most appropriate model for applying the prediction range for a long forecast horizon 5 conclusions predicting short term wind and wave conditions is an important part of decision making during the execution of marine operations this work proposes a hybrid multi step ahead prediction model for predicting wind and wave conditions and investigates the forecast uncertainties in the suggested model over various seasons and sea states a hybrid method that combines a decomposition technique and anfis is introduced in this method the decomposition technique is applied to convert the original series to the corresponding stationary series to improve the overall forecasting accuracy then the anfis is established in which the input output pairs are determined by three multi step ahead models the m 1 m n and m 1 slope models finally by utilizing the three multi step ahead forecasting models twenty four step ahead predictions can be obtained recursively or directly to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method hourly time series of the mean wind speed u w the significant wave height h s and the peak spectral wave period t p at the north sea center are utilized the results demonstrate that the proposed decomposition anfis method performs well in one step ahead wave and wind forecasting by contrast the multi step ahead prediction models are more complex and the forecast accuracy decreases as the forecast horizon increases to quantify the forecast performance of the proposed method and to compare it with various multi step ahead models an uncertainty quantification analysis is proposed in the analysis the forecast uncertainty for each model is assessed in terms of the forecast error factor for a specified multi step ahead prediction model by statistically analyzing a set of the forecast error factors that were obtained during the testing period the forecast performance at each forecast step can be evaluated based on the quantification results the optimal values of m of three multi step ahead models can be determined in addition three optimal multi step ahead models are also compared on both wind and wave predictions the results demonstrate that the prediction model performance strongly depends on the properties of the variable for u w h s and t p predictions the best performing model is m 1 followed by m 1 slope and m n typically the proposed methods can effectively obtain exact predictions for the first five steps ahead due to the lower level of uncertainty however the uncertainty of forecasts will increase with the forecast horizon fitted equations of the mean and standard deviation of the forecast errors can be utilized to provide a prediction range instead of prediction points case studies demonstrate that this is an effective approach for utilizing the multi step ahead predictions in practice overall the proposed decomposition anfis multi step ahead forecasting methods can be applied for the short term prediction of wave and wind conditions and have application potential in marine operations however the randomness and unsteadiness of wind and waves render forecasting highly difficult for longer forecast horizons the forecast uncertainty quantification method can overcome this problem however

22577,short term predictions of wind and wave properties with a duration of 1 3 days are vital for decision making during the execution of marine operations one step ahead weather conditions can be accurately predicted via various methods however prediction over long horizons is challenging since multi step ahead prediction is typically faced with growing uncertainties in this study a hybrid method for predicting multi step ahead wind and wave conditions is proposed which combines a decomposition technique and the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis first the decomposition technique is applied to obtain stationary time series then multi step ahead forecasting is conducted using anfis in which three multi step ahead models the m 1 m n and m 1 slope models are employed to quantify the forecast uncertainty the mean value and standard deviation of the error factor are calculated the proposed method is evaluated by multi step ahead predictions within 24 h of wind and wave conditions at the north sea center utilizing hourly time series of the mean wind speed u w the significant wave height h s and the spectral peak period t p the results demonstrate that the forecast uncertainty increases with the prediction horizon and a prediction range determined by the error factor provides a basic reference for the use of predicted environmental conditions for marine operations keywords marine operations weather forecast multi step ahead prediction model uncertainty quantification 1 introduction according to the definition in det norske veritas 2011 marine operations are non routine operations of limited duration for handling objects and vessels in the marine environment during temporary phases such as the transport of large offshore oil gas platforms or topside structures the installation of offshore platforms and offshore wind turbines and the installation of subsea templates or structures such operations can only be performed within sea state limits weather statistics are used for planning operations while weather forecasts are required for deciding on when to start the operations as a result the accuracy of wind and wave condition forecasting is a critical factor in the planning of an operation during the execution phase if the forecasted weather conditions are unsuitable for a marine operation the operation will not be executed until the weather becomes suitable however if the actual future weather is within the safe limit the opportunity for executing the marine operation will be wasted and the duration of the operation will be extended by contrast if the forecasted weather conditions are suitable for operation while the actual weather conditions are unsuitable during the operation window the execution of the operation may lead to accidents such as injuries of personnel and damage to equipment however in the prediction of weather conditions several challenges are encountered such as the random and unsteady characteristics of wind and waves to predict environmental conditions accurately various methods have been proposed by researchers which can be classified into three main types physical methods statistical methods and machine learning methods the physical methods consider meteorological parameters and physical laws in establishing physical models for weather condition forecasting among them the use of empirical based models in wave and wind forecasting is widespread in empirical based models the generation of waves is assumed to be described by a function of meteorological parameters such as the fetch length and wind speed kazeminezhad et al 2005 the most popular of such models are smb bretschneider 1970 wilson 1965 jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 and donelan 1980 although the empirical based models are fast and accurate they can only be applied in limited cases bishop 1983 kamranzad et al 2011 with the rapid developments in computer technology during the last two decades several types of numerical models have been employed to forecast wave and wind characteristics to predict wind characteristics such as the wind speed numerical weather prediction nwp has been widely adopted cassola and burlando 2012 landberg 1999 watson et al 1994 the nwp model describes the physical processes of the atmosphere via conservation equations by numerically solving the equations in terms of weather data such as the temperatures pressure surface roughness and obstacles the wind speed can be predicted correspondingly nwp requires abundant physical background knowledge and relatively long computation time foley et al 2012 landberg et al 2003 wang et al 2016 in addition various problems are encountered such as lack of sufficient understanding for representing many physical processes in equation format and uncertainties in the surface characteristics lateral boundary conditions and initial state al yahyai et al 2010 which limit its practical application for wave characteristic prediction the most popular models are wam group 1988 wave watch iii tolman 1991 and swan booij et al 1999 these models represent the sea state and predict the evolution of the wave spectrum based on the energy balance equation in space and time via numerical techniques these techniques generally require expertise in their implementation browne et al 2007 mahjoobi et al 2008 in addition data driven approaches have been developed in recent years instead of considering physical phenomena in the environment the data driven approaches are purely mathematical and can predict wave and wind conditions based on only historical data these approaches can be divided into two main categories statistical methods and machine learning methods the statistical methods express the future data as a linear or non linear function of the historical data the most popular and widely known statistical methods that are applied in wave and wind forecasting are the autoregressive model ar poggi et al 2003 schlink and tetzlaff 1998 the autoregressive moving average arma erdem and shi 2011 lydia et al 2016 torres et al 2005 the autoregressive integrated moving average arima kamal and jafri 1997 kavasseri and seetharaman 2009 and kalman filter methods zuluaga et al 2015 however these methods typically cannot deal with non linear patterns qin et al 2017 by contrast machine learning models consider a network that represents the relationship between inputs and outputs based on various algorithms and utilize this network to perform wave and wind forecasting models of this type can be applied to systems in which the interrelations are not clear they can identify the relationship between the inputs and the outputs by learning from a large amount of data without relying on physical phenomena such as diffraction reflection and wave breaking for computing wave reflection and diffraction or the wave spectrum and energy balance equation because of this advantage representative machine learning techniques have been used for weather forecasting such as support vector machine svm berbić et al 2017 kamranzad et al 2011 mahjoobi and mosabbeb 2009 artificial neural networks anns agrawal and deo 2002 chang et al 2017 deo et al 2001 jain and deo 2007 mandal et al 2005 and the fuzzy inference system fis kazeminezhad et al 2005 özger and şen 2007 the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis which is a hybrid intelligent system a combination of ann and fis has been employed recently özger and şen 2007 and akpınar et al 2014 applied anfis to predict wave parameters and compared the auto regressive moving average results with the results of the exogenous input armax wilson shore protection manual spm jonswap and coastal engineering manual cem methods kazeminezhad et al 2007 compared wave predictions that were obtained via anfis with those of other methods such as the cem ann and fis methods in addition the efficiencies of anfis support vector machines svms bayesian networks bns and anns in wave height prediction were investigated by malekmohamadi et al 2011 in most of the above studies historical data were used directly to train anfis model thus the non stationarity of the data was ignored stefanakos and schinas 2015 and duru and yoshida 2012 conducted a series of studies and proved that non stationarity is inherent in time series of wind and wave parameters due to the seasonal effect therefore prior to forecasting the non stationarity should be removed from the initial time series based on this strategy stefanakos stefanakos 2016a b stefanakos and vanem 2018 developed an anfis model via non stationary modelling for the prediction of wind and wave parameters at the north atlantic and the pacific ocean and more accurate forecasts were obtained these studies consider only one step ahead prediction approaches for generating multi step ahead forecasts have rarely been studied because compared to one step ahead forecasting multi step ahead prediction is more difficult taieb and bontempi 2011 since growing uncertainties due to e g lack of information and accumulation of prediction errors must be considered however an advantage of multi step ahead wind and wave forecasting is that it can provide more information about the future which is important for marine operations as weather variations in the future are a critical factor in decision making during the execution of marine operations deo and naidu 1998 used neural networks to predict ocean wave heights in real time in that study one to two step ahead predictions were obtained based on the current observations and according to the simulations the forecasting accuracy decreased as the forecasting lead time increased basu et al 2005 developed a nonlinear technique that was based on the genetic algorithm ga for significant wave height prediction in that work daily time series of the surface wind speed and the significant wave height in the arabian sea and the bay of bengal were used to develop the technique and three step ahead prediction was conducted ahmed and khalid 2017 presented a nonlinear autoregressive neural network narnn for predicting wind speed up to six hours ahead niu et al 2018 proposed a hybrid approach for 1 step 3 step and 6 step ahead wind speed forecasting that utilized optimal feature selection and an ann all results demonstrated that the forecast error increased significantly with each step ahead forecast although the above studies consider the application of multi step ahead prediction models they focus on forecasting up to six steps in the future few studies have considered prediction with more steps ahead such forecasting is much more important in practice especially for marine operations because some operations must be viewed as continuous events hence once the first operation has been performed the operation cannot be interrupted and the duration of the entire process will be more than just a few hours under this circumstance multi step ahead prediction with larger numbers of steps ahead can effectively capture the dynamic behavior of future wave and wind conditions during the execution process which is crucial for improving the security of entire marine operations based on this background the main objective of this work is the development of a multi step ahead model for weather condition forecasting with a long forecast horizon considering the data used hourly time series of mean wind speed u w significant wave height h s and spectral peak period t p from 2001 to 2010 at the north sea center and the timetable for marine operations this work intends to predict wind and wave conditions in one day ahead namely twenty four steps ahead to realize multi step ahead predictions a hybrid method consisting decomposition technique and anfis is developed firstly the training and testing data are pre processed by the decomposition technique then the anfis combined with a multi step ahead model m 1 m n or m 1 slope is built based on the training data the m 1 model applies a one step prediction model iteratively where the forecasted data are utilized as the input for the prediction of the following time step the m 1 slope model also adopts forecasted data but includes slope information when selecting the training dataset instead of using forecasted data the m n model only applies the actual data and redevelops a new model for each time step furthermore the forecast performance of the prediction model is evaluated on the testing data by an uncertainty quantification analysis of the forecast errors at each lead time finally a method of applying the confidence interval for the predicted conditions is proposed to utilize the long horizon forecasts the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a brief description of the study site and the considered environmental data in section 3 the details of the methodology are introduced the decomposition technique anfis multi step ahead forecasting models uncertainty quantification analysis and the whole process are described in this section then the short term prediction of wind and wave conditions at the center of the north sea is conducted in section 4 section 4 1 investigates the weather forecasting performance of the decomposition anfis method in terms of the one step ahead prediction results section 4 2 selects the optimal multi step ahead models and performs a comparative analysis with the proposed models finally the main conclusions of this study are summarized in section 5 2 offshore site and environmental data in the application of the weather conditions to marine operations the environmental variables that typically must be forecasted are the mean wind speed u w the significant wave height h s and the peak spectral wave period t p in this study the north sea is considered and 18 sites in this area are illustrated in fig 1 the dataset in each site is comprised of hindcast data that are based on a high resolution regional atmospheric model skiron and an ocean wave model wam to generate the hindcast data the mean wind speed at a height of 10 m above the mean sea level is produced by the atmospheric model then it will be used as the input for the wave model to obtain wave properties based on these properties three hourly time series of the mean wind speed u w and hourly time series of the significant wave height h s and the peak spectral wave period t p are obtained the covered period is from january 2001 to december 2010 for additional details see li et al 2013 although these data are hindcast data we consider them as actual data that will be used to generate the anfis model for prediction and for testing the north sea center site 15 fig 1 is selected as the study site in this paper many marine operations such as the monopile installation acero et al 2016 and blade installation jiang et al 2018 of an offshore wind turbine have been designed and analyzed in this region this site is a shallow shelf sea with a mean water depth of 29 m and a distance to shore of 300 km during the specified period the 50 year return period wind speed and the significant wave height are 27 2 m s and 8 66 m respectively and the mean value of the peak spectral wave period is 6 93 s as an overview of the environment at this site time series u w h s and t p of two months of winter from 2001 01 01 to 2001 02 28 1416 hourly points and those of summer from 2001 07 01 to 2001 08 31 1488 hourly points are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively high variability is observed in all three series in summer and winter therefore it is necessary to predict environmental conditions prior to executing marine operations however in modelling multi step ahead prediction significant challenges are encountered due to the randomness and non stationarity of the time series in such cases to obtain predictions via forecasting methods sufficient data must be used to train the model accordingly in the ten year hourly time series of u w h s and t p the data for the first nine years 78888 data points are selected as the training data and the data for the tenth year 8760 data points are selected as the testing data which is sufficiently long for investigating the behavior of forecast uncertainty in models with a possibility of covering most of the typical sea states 3 methodology 3 1 decomposition technique a long term time series of wave or wind data can be considered as a nonlinear non stationary and seasonal time series for data of this type the monthly mean value and the standard deviation of the series can be used to extract the non stationarity athanassoulis and stefanakos 1995 the object is extended to a multi variate time series and the decomposition model stefanakos and schinas 2014 can be expressed as follows eq 1 1 y t m t t w t n 1 n 1 n n n 1 or in matrix notation 2 y 1 t y 2 t y n t y n t m 1 t m 2 t m n t m n t σ 11 t σ 12 t σ 1 n t σ 21 t σ 22 t σ 2 n t σ n 1 t σ n 1 t σ n 2 t σ n 2 t σ n n t σ n n t w 1 t w 2 t w n t w n t where the number of time series is n in eq 2 y t represents the initial time series and it can be expressed as 3 y n j m τ k j 1 j m 1 12 k 1 k m n 1 n where j is the year index m is the month index and τk is the kth observation in the mth month the number of observations in the mth month is k m the seasonal patterns are characterized by m t and σ t which are the monthly mean value vector and the covariance matrix with period of one year respectively these two terms can be estimated by averaging the time series of monthly mean values m 3 n j m and the covariance matrix s 3 nl j m over j years stefanakos et al 2006 4 m 3 n m 1 j j 1 j m 3 n j m 1 j j 1 j 1 k m k 1 k m y n j m τ k 5 s 3 n l m 1 j j 1 j s 3 n l j m 1 j j 1 j 1 k m k 1 k m y n j m τ k m 3 n j m y l j m τ k m 3 l j m n l 1 n with m 1 2 12 the subscript 3 denotes that these two terms are statistics with respect to the third index in y n j m τ k apart from the seasonal patterns the residue part namely w t is the corresponding stationary time series of y t in this study there are three initial joint long term time series of wind and wave parameters the mean wind speed u w the significant wave height h s and the peak spectral wave period t p namely n equals 3 in eq 3 via eqs 4 5 the deterministic seasonal patterns namely m t σ t can be easily estimated from the data after that the corresponding stationary time series namely w t can be calculated via eq 2 to demonstrate this clearly the decomposed time series that correspond to the series in figs 2 and 3 are plotted in figs 4 and 5 the time series after decomposition are zero mean stochastic processes and the seasonal effects in the data are significantly reduced 3 2 anfis the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis jang et al 1996 is a hybrid intelligent system that is a combination of a fuzzy inference system fis and an adaptive neural network ann first the fis is presented a fuzzy inference system fis is a nonlinear method for mapping inputs to output that is based on fuzzy logic theory in fuzzy logic theory the focus is on understanding the concept of a fuzzy set in a class set an element is either a member of the set or not and the corresponding result is 1 or 0 by contrast a fuzzy set is a set that lacks a clearly defined boundary a fuzzy set is an extension of a classical set whose elements can belong to more than one set and the membership degree which is between 0 and 1 is used to quantify the grade of membership of the element to each set the degree of membership of a set is defined by a membership function mf which provides a measure of the similarity of the element to a fuzzy set for example if x is a universe of discourse such as h s and x is an element of x then a fuzzy set o such as high on x can be described as eq 6 6 o x μ o x x x where μ o x is the membership function that is associated with x in fuzzy set o and expresses the degree to which a value of h s belongs to set high the most common types of mfs are triangular gaussian and sigmoid in a fis the mapping of input variables to an output is characterized by a list of fuzzy statements which are called if then rules if then rules are expressions of the form if x is a then y is b and are used to infer a fuzzy output based on fuzzy inputs where a and b are linguistic labels of fuzzy sets characterized by mfs the structure of a fis is illustrated in fig 6 that consists of four functional blocks there are two important types of fuzzy inference methods the mamdani 1974 and takagi sugeno takagi and sugeno 1993 fuzzy inference methods they differ in terms of their defuzzification schemes and the latter is used in this study in the ts method the outcome of each if then fuzzy rule is a scalar value rather than a fuzzy set for the output variable of the form eq 7 if x 1 i s s r 1 x 2 i s s r 2 x n i s s r n 7 then y p r x 1 q r x 2 t r x n where x i and y are the inputs and output respectively s r i is a linguistic value such as low or high for h s which is represented by a fuzzy set and p r q r and t r are parameters that must be determined the if part is called the premise which contains the mfs parameters that describe the shapes of the mfs and the then part is called the consequent which contains parameters that describe the linear relationship of the inputs when using fis the main challenge is the selection of the parameters in the fuzzy knowledge base traditionally the parameters are determined based on the experience of experts or past available data of the system for selecting the parameters an adaptive neural network is combined with the fis to optimize the premise and consequent parameters based on the available datasets using a hybrid learning algorithm this strategy was proposed by jang 1993 and the method in which an adaptive neural network and fis are combined is called the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis in practice the structure of anfis is similar to that of a multi layer neural network anfis has an input layer an output layer and three hidden layers that are related to mfs and if then rules to illustrate the procedure the structure of a simple anfis that consists of two inputs namely x1 and x2 and one output namely y is presented in fig 7 in this anfis structure the first layer is the input layer which contains crisp inputs x 1 and x 2 the second layer is the fuzzifying layer in which the inputs x i are fuzzified into the membership values μ aj x i based on the mfs of linguistic labels a j as expressed in eq 8 this layer can be considered an adaptive layer since the outputs depend on the parameters in the mfs in this example the mfs which are denoted as μ aj are gaussian type functions 8 o i j μ a j x i f o r i j 1 2 if the number of crisp inputs exceeds one the weight of each rule must be determined by using fuzzy operators the third layer contains two operators and is divided into two layers which are called the implication and normalizing layers in these two layers the firing strength w i j for each rule and the normalized firing strength w i j are calculated via eqs 9 10 9 w i j μ a i x 1 μ a j x 2 f o r i j 1 2 10 w i j w i j w i j f o r i j 1 2 then the outcome o i j of each rule can be calculated in the defuzzifying layer using the corresponding if then rule and the obtained rule s weight as expressed in eq 11 similarly this layer is also an adaptive layer because parameters p i q i and r i in the if then rules should be determined 11 o i j w i j y i j w i j p k x 1 q k x 2 r k f o r i j 1 2 k 1 i j based on the sum of all outcomes o i j the weighted average of all if then rules results the overall output y can be estimated via eq 12 12 y o i j in this process an adaptive neural network is applied to determine the parameters in the two adaptive layers which is represented by the red cycle in fig 7 according to the fixed values of the premise parameters in the if part the information is propagated forward to identify the consequent parameters via the least square method in addition by fixing the consequent parameters in the then part the error is propagated back to the fuzzifying layer and the premise parameters are modified then the optimal values can be tracked by performing this procedure based on the training data the optimal anfis can be identified overall the only information that must be specified by the user is the number and the types of mfs for each input variable in this study the anfis is utilized for both one and multi step ahead predictions for one step ahead prediction three simplest anfiss for the mean wind speed u w the significant wave height h s and the spectral peak period t p are developed which are expressed in eqs 13 15 respectively the basic idea is to use the training dataset to derive functional relationships between the parameters at the current time and at the next time step so that one step ahead prediction can be made however multi step ahead prediction requires more complex anfis models which will be presented and discussed in section 3 3 a mean wind speed u w 13 u w t 1 f 1 u w t b significant wave height h s 14 h s t 1 f 2 u w t h s t c peak spectral wave period t p 15 t p t 1 f 3 u w t h s t t p t where function f in each system represents the prediction model the number of rules depends on the fuzzy sets for each input variable 3 3 multi step ahead forecasting models for one step ahead prediction only data at the current time are used as input to predict the next step data as expressed in eqs 13 15 however due to the complexity of the prediction applying the same model to multi step ahead forecasting will result in a significant reduction in accuracy therefore several alternatives have been proposed for building multi step ahead prediction models in sections 3 3 1 3 3 3 three models for realizing multi step ahead forecasting are discussed in detail every forecasting model requires more than one input to maintain the consistency of the variables data at any time t are represented by x t x t n denotes the n step ahead data which are unknown output and x t x t 1 x t m 1 represents the input set which contains the previous m data in addition f denotes the prediction model between the inputs and the output 3 3 1 m 1 model the m 1 model requires only the training of a one step ahead prediction model f based on the training data which is expressed as eq 16 16 x t 1 f x t x t 1 x t 2 x t m 1 to forecast n steps ahead the above model is applied iteratively however in the input set the predicted value of the previous step is used instead of the actual data considering prediction of significant wave height h s as an example after establishing the one step ahead prediction model one step ahead value hs t 1 is predicted eq 17 17 h ˆ s t 1 f h s t h s t 1 h s t 2 h s t m 1 then the forecasted value namely h ˆ s t 1 is considered as part of the input set for predicting the next step value namely h ˆ s t 2 based on the same one step ahead model f eq 18 18 h ˆ s t 2 f h ˆ s t 1 h s t h s t 1 h s t 2 h s t m 2 then for the n step ahead prediction this procedure is repeated and h ˆ s t 3 to h ˆ s t n are predicted iteratively the iteration process may lead to accumulated errors since after one step prediction the input set is composed of forecasted values rather than actual data especially when n exceeds m namely after m step ahead prediction the input set does not contain any actual data but only forecasted values in such cases the forecasts may suffer from low performance however the main advantage of the m 1 model is that only one training process is required for obtaining the prediction model and this model does not change between steps therefore the forecasting time is significantly reduced and the computational efficiency is increased to illustrate the application of the m 1 model in this study the architectures of both the training and testing processes are plotted in fig 8 in fig 8 it is assumed that the training and testing sets contain l and k points respectively to determine the optimal function which is expressed in eq 16 l m samples are used to train the relationship between the inputs and the output the inputs and output are represented by blue and red boxes respectively in fig 8 then in the testing data set for a specified input vector the following n step ahead forecasts can be predicted directly via iteration under the established prediction model the boxes that are highlighted in yellow represent the predicted data and as the number of steps increases the number of predictions that are used as inputs to obtain the next step forecast value also increases a complete simulation of obtaining n step ahead predictions is considered one case to evaluate the m 1 model the prediction process is repeated over the testing period to obtain many forecast cases k m n cases in this example then the forecast uncertainty of the model at step one to step n can be evaluated via uncertainty quantification analysis which is described in section 3 4 3 3 2 m n model in the m n model a separate training process and the corresponding prediction model f n are required at each step n the prediction model can be represented as eq 19 19 x t n f n x t x t 1 x t 2 x t m 1 where f n denotes the prediction model at step n in the m n model the input set always consists of the last m data in the time series that are known therefore in contrast to the m 1 model the m n model does not use any predicted value and thus prevents accumulated errors however this model is time consuming since n models must be trained independently when forecasting n steps ahead furthermore the correlation between inputs and output weakens as n increases thereby increasing the difficulty of capturing their relationship the architecture of the m n model that is applied in this study is illustrated in fig 9 in the training process n step ahead prediction models are established separately for each n to display them clearly fig 9 shows them according to the color of the output after establishing n step ahead prediction models for a specified input vector n step ahead values are predicted according to the corresponding model for example in the testing time series the first m data are selected as inputs for predicting the data for the subsequent n steps first the first step ahead data namely the m 1 data are predicted based on the one step ahead model whose outputs are both displayed in red then the second step ahead data namely the m 2 data green are predicted according to the same input vector by the green model the second step ahead prediction model this procedure is repeated until at the last step n the m n data purple are predicted according to the purple model which is the n step ahead prediction model this is one complete case of m n multi step prediction via repeated prediction in the testing period the uncertainty for each step can be quantified as in the m 1 model 3 3 3 m 1 slope model since the incoming weather conditions are closely related to the trend of the last several observations the slope information between the last few data can be induced for prediction the model in this study is called m 1 slope model the m 1 slope model is similar to the m 1 model which is also based on a recursive process however there are several differences between these two models in the selection of training data in the m 1 model all data during the training period are included in the training dataset in contrast in the m 1 slope model only data that have similar properties to the current data can be selected as training data this means that for weather forecasting to predict the future weather variations it is necessary to find historical data that are similar to the current weather conditions and utilize them to predict the future weather the selection criteria are the values and slopes of the current and previous data the prediction procedure is as follows 3 3 3 1 selection of the training dataset assume the current time is t and denote the data by x t find historical data x t during the training period that satisfy the following conditions a x t x t an allowable error b the symbols of the slopes at x t and x t are the same c slope at x t slope at x t an allowable error d the symbols of the slopes at x t 1 and x t 1 are the same e slope at x t 1 slope at x t 1 an allowable error then data x t can be selected the corresponding input set x t m 1 x t 1 x t and output x t 1 can be selected as one training sample after all the data that satisfy the above requirements have been selected the prediction model can be established according to the corresponding training samples in this method allowable errors are determined based on the bivariate histogram of the parameter and its slope 3 3 3 2 prediction after establishing the prediction model x t m 1 x t 1 x t is supplied to this model as input and one step ahead prediction x ˆ t 1 can be obtained 3 3 3 3 iteration next the prediction x ˆ t 1 is utilized as the input and the input vector becomes x t m 2 x t x ˆ t 1 then the training dataset is selected according to x ˆ t 1 and x t the selection process is the same as in 1 the prediction model based on the new training data is applied to obtain the two step ahead prediction x ˆ t 2 when no training data are available the prediction process stops otherwise the process is iterated until an n step ahead prediction namely x ˆ t n is obtained if all values from x t 1 to x t n must be predicted n models must be constructed similar to the m n model however this model only applies historical data that have the same values and slopes as the current data to establish the prediction model which could improve the prediction efficiency in addition compared with the m 1 model the m 1 slope model may accumulate less error since the prediction model will be updated at each step ahead to illustrate the architecture of the m 1 slope model the selection process of the training data in the m 1 slope model is sketched in fig 10 according to fig 10 a long term time series of data is divided into training data and testing data instead of building a prediction model based on all training data the first step is to select a suitable training data set in terms of the values and slopes of the testing data at points m and m 1 here the input vector consists of the first m data during testing period limited by the figure display only the information of the point m is plotted in the figure by taking advantage of this value and slope by adding an allowable error a series of points within the yellow range can be identified in the training period shown as red circles the corresponding input output pairs of these points can be selected as training data for predicting the next step data then using the value and slope of the predicted data x m 1 another training data set can be identified for establishing a new prediction model and the second step ahead value x m 2 can be forecasted via this recursive process the predicted time series shown as the blue dashed line can be obtained to illustrate the process more clearly a magnified image of the difference between the forecasted and the actual time series is plotted and the eight step ahead prediction procedure is also shown the red circle within the purple range after obtaining the forecasted time series the same uncertainty quantification analysis can be conducted as described above in contrast to the previous two models the m 1 slope model considers the slope of the data hence the historical data cannot be considered when the slope is opposite that of the current data even if the values are nearly the same via this approach many irrelevant sea conditions can be removed thereby significantly reducing the computation time compared to the m n model furthermore this method is essentially a recursive method that can preserve the complex dependencies among the forecasted data 3 4 uncertainty quantification traditionally various error statistics have been used to measure the forecast accuracy such as the mean absolute error mae the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute percentage error mape most of these statistics are non negative and the direction of the errors is not considered however in weather forecasting the directions of forecast errors in various sea states are of great importance ignoring the directions of the errors would increase the risk of decision making during the execution of marine operations in addition to account for the uncertainty in the forecasts dnv jip 2007 introduced a safety factor into the allowable limits of sea states that are used for marine operations however this alpha factor approach has several limitations for instance the alpha factor for significant wave height depending on the prediction horizon is explicitly given in the dnv offshore standard while this factor for other weather parameters such as spectral peak period has not been given yet meanwhile the alpha factor which is tabulated in the dnv offshore standard is only developed for the north and norwegian seas and is also dependent on the weather forecast techniques in this section an uncertainty quantification method is presented for improving the knowledge and understanding of a forecasting model for the short term prediction of wind and wave conditions the accuracy of a forecasting model is evaluated by comparing the forecasts to corresponding actual values to quantify environmental variables the error must be normalized for this purpose a forecast error factor which is denoted as ϵ m t is introduced which is utilized as an estimate of the forecast accuracy this error factor is defined as the difference between the forecasted and actual values at the same time instant normalized by the corresponding actual value 20 ε m t f t a t a t where f t and a t are the forecasted and actual values respectively at time t according to the above equation a perfect weather forecast would yield a forecast error factor of 0 to assess the performance of a forecasting model under various sea states all values of ϵ m during the testing period must be calculated based on the series of ϵ m values the forecast uncertainty is quantified by the statistics mean and standard deviation and their distributions for example the methodology for estimating the uncertainty in a one step ahead prediction model is illustrated in fig 11 for multi step ahead forecasts uncertainty quantification analysis is performed for each forecast time step in addition the quantified uncertainties can be utilized to provide a prediction range that is based on the multi step ahead predictions the details are provided in section 5 3 5 summary this section describes the main procedures of the proposed method for predicting short term weather conditions and assessing the forecasting performance the whole prediction process is illustrated in fig 12 and the main steps are listed below 4 results and discussion referring to the execution time of the typical marine operation the prediction period is expected to be more than one day hence n is selected as 24 in this study adopting the proposed prediction models the 24 steps case is conducted to predict u w h s and t p at the north sea center based on the results a comparative analysis of the decomposition anfis method with three multi step ahead forecasting models is performed in the following parts to demonstrate the forecasting performance of the decomposition anfis method the one step ahead prediction results are presented in section 4 1 and the results of multi step ahead prediction are summarized in section 4 2 4 1 one step ahead prediction results in this part one step ahead models for predicting wave and wind conditions are developed three simple fis models are represented by eqs 13 15 and the structure of the models are summarized in table 1 in each model all input variables are partitioned into two fuzzy sets low and high gaussian type mfs are selected for inputs and linear type for the output as a result the total numbers of if then rules in the u w h s and t p prediction models are 2 4 and 8 respectively for instance one of the rules of t p prediction can be expressed as follows if u w t is low h s t is high and t p t is high then t p t 1 p1 u w t q1 h s t r1 t p t where p1 q1 and r1 are the unknown parameters that must be determined from the training data after determining the structure of the fis model the training data are utilized to train this model and to optimize the parameters of fis using neural networks as an example the mfs of h s that are used in t p prediction before and after training are plotted in fig 13 there are considerable changes in the shapes of the membership functions after training it should be noted that the initial shape of mfs only depends on the type of mfs and the range of training data which would enhance the reproducibility of this method after establishing the optimal anfis testing data are used to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction method the forecasted u w h s and t p and the corresponding actual data are plotted in fig 14 a b and c respectively in each subfigure the blue lines are obtained using the actual data at the current time to predict the one step ahead environmental conditions all the predicted data are presented in the figures and compared with the actual data according to fig 14 the forecasted data are close to the actual data in both wind and wave conditions throughout the entire testing period which can also be observed in the distributions of the forecast error factors as shown in fig 15 all three distributions of the forecast error factors of u w h s and t p predictions are concentrated around zero in addition the range of errors that are within one standard deviation of the mean e g the range for u w prediction which is shown as red dash lines is narrow hence the one step ahead prediction model has lower forecast uncertainty under various sea states therefore the prediction method that combines the decomposition technique and anfis has high application potential for predicting environmental conditions the detailed statistical results of the forecast error factor are included in the multi step ahead prediction results in section 4 2 4 2 multi step ahead prediction results 4 2 1 selection of the optimal model in the multi step ahead forecasting models the size of input set m must be specified in advance in practice a suitable value for m is not easy to determine typically if a larger amount of input data is available more historical information can be utilized and thus predictions are expected to be more accurate however the computation time of a prediction model would increase dramatically with the number of inputs especially if optimization techniques are required during the training phase in this study m is determined by comparing the forecast performances of multi step ahead prediction models under various values of m starting from m 1 the optimal value of m is the value that corresponds to the minimum statistics of forecast error factors for the predictions in the m 1 model the optimal value of m is selected by comparing the forecast uncertainties of all 24 steps because the computational burden is low by contrast in the m n model only the forecast uncertainties at a few steps are considered as criteria because this model demands a large computational effort compared to the m 1 model in addition the m n model only uses actual data as inputs hence it is possible to apply many variables that are related to the predicted parameter for prediction for example historical wind conditions such as wind speed and wind direction can be applied to predict the future significant wave height in addition the structure of the m n model may be more complicated and the corresponding computation time is longer therefore the optimal m for the m n model is selected by only comparing the forecast uncertainties at several specified steps 4 2 1 1 m 1 model in the following u w h s and t p predictions m is varied from 1 to 5 to modify the structure of the prediction model after establishing the model with a specified m 24 step ahead values are predicted iteratively by repeatedly making 24 step ahead predictions within the testing period the statistical results of forecast error factors at each step n for various values of m are calculated and plotted in fig 16 where a b and c are the results of u w h s and t p respectively in each subfigure the mean values and standard deviations of forecast error factors are represented by solid lines and dashed lines as functions of the number of steps n individually as illustrated in fig 16 a the blue line which corresponds to m 2 is the optimal result since the mean values and the standard deviations for all steps are less than 0 2 and 0 8 respectively in fig 16 b and c m 2 is a more suitable choice for h s and t p predictions in terms of both the forecast performance and the computation time in summary the optimal m 1 models for multi step ahead u w h s and t p predictions with m 2 are listed below eqs 22 and 23 21 u w t 1 f u w t u w t 3 22 h s t 1 f h s t h s t 1 23 t p t 1 f t p t t p t 1 in eq 21 the input terms are u w t and u w t 3 instead of u w t and u w t 1 because the wind speed data are three hourly data 4 2 1 2 m n model to evaluate the influence of the value of m on the m n model prediction of the wind speed the significant wave height and the peak spectral wave period will be discussed in wind speed prediction the historical data of wind direction dir and wind speed u w can be considered as input variables the wind direction must be transformed to range between 0 and 1 sylaios et al 2009 which is expressed as eq 24 u w m n models for various combinations of m and variables are listed in table a 1 in the appendix in the t p and h s m n prediction models as waves are influenced by the strength of the wind models that consider wind variables such as the wind direction dir and the wind speed u w are also induced in an attempt to capture this dependency the possible models of h s and t p are summarized in the appendix and described in tables a 2 and a 3 since the calculation time sharply increases with the size of the input set only models with 6 or fewer items are considered 24 d i r 1 θ 180 i f 0 θ 180 θ 180 180 i f 180 θ 360 after determining the structure of the prediction models several 1st 5th 15th and 24th step ahead predictions are made for each variable after prediction the statistics of forecast error factors for the corresponding models are summarized and plotted in figs 17 19 as displayed in fig 17 there is not much difference in the prediction accuracy among models however the models models 4 8 that include both u w and dir yield more accurate prediction results compared with the models models 1 3 that are only based on u w a similar phenomenon can also be observed in figs 18 and 19 by considering both the computation time and the forecast uncertainty the optimal u w h s and t p m n prediction models are models 7 9 and 6 in tables a 1 a 3 respectively which are listed below eqs 25 26 and 27 25 u w t n f u w t d i r t u w t 3 u w t 6 u w t 9 26 h s t n f h s t u w t d i r t h s t 1 u w t 1 27 t p t n f t p t h s t u w t the accuracy of the m n model appears to be only slightly sensitive to the value of m with the selected anfis configuration and data there is no clear benefit in increasing m however due to heavy computational demand of running the anfis simulations only relatively simple models with small m values are developed in this study since the use of more complex anfis models may improve the forecast accuracy an effort can be considered to simulate anfis with more inputs in future researches by contrast the types of variables that are included in the prediction model have a strong impact on the accuracy for wind and waves the more variables that are associated with the predicted value the more accurate the obtained prediction thus to decrease the forecast uncertainty in multi step ahead predictions the variables that are related to the predicted parameter should be included if possible for the m 1 slope model since it is essentially an iterative model m is selected as 2 for all u w h s and t p prediction models by referring to the above sensitivity analysis results of the m 1 model 4 2 2 comparison of the forecasting models this section presents a comparative analysis among the three multi step ahead forecasting models at the beginning three models of multi step ahead prediction namely the m 1 m n and m 1 slope models which use decomposition anfis are developed based on the training data the input size m for each model is the optimal value that was determined in section 4 2 1 and the forecast horizon is the following 24 h then many twenty four step ahead predictions can be obtained during the testing period on basis of the corresponding obtained prediction model finally an uncertainty quantification analysis of the forecast error is conducted to assess the forecasting performances of the models the prediction results of u w h s and t p and the corresponding actual series are plotted in fig b 1 b 2 and b 3 in the appendix in which the actual and forecasted data are represented by black and red lines subfigures a and b in each figure depict the results that are based on the m 1 and m 1 slope models and c depicts the results that are based on the m n model the predicted time series that were obtained iteratively and separately by applying the m 1 and m n models consist of a few consecutive 24 step predictions which correspond to the architectures in figs 8 and 9 by contrast for the m 1 slope model it may not be possible to predict 24 steps for all cases to present the characteristics of the prediction models clearly considering the h s prediction as an example several cases of prediction results that are based on the three models are extracted from fig b2 and shown in fig 20 in each subfigure the black lines depict actual time series and the predicted time series are represented by red lines in addition the green points correspond to the beginning of each 24 step prediction case which correspond to one step ahead forecasted data similarly the blue points represent the 24 step ahead forecasted data according to fig 20 b the m 1 slope model cannot perform the 24 step prediction in all cases especially near the peaks of high sea states however compared to the results in fig 20 a and c the m 1 slope model can capture the data variation although the positions of peaks troughs may not be captured exactly overall from the predicted time series in fig b1 b 3 it is concluded that the proposed models can predict the environmental conditions to a certain extent however due to the randomness in the occurrence of waves and wind it is difficult to realize high accuracy in forecasting all points especially for high sea states in addition only observing the long term forecasted time series renders it difficult to compare the proposed three prediction models therefore the uncertainty quantification analysis must be used to evaluate and compare the accuracies of the three multi step ahead prediction methods fig 21 presents the results of multi step ahead forecasting models in predicting u w h s and t p at various steps n in each subfigure black red and blue lines represent statistics of the corresponding forecast error factors ϵ m that are based on the m 1 model the m n model and the m 1 slope model respectively to distinguish the statistics the mean values are represented by circle marks and the asterisks correspond to the standard deviations the forecast uncertainty varies with the step n in both wind and wave condition predictions the forecast error of the m n model exhibits monotonic behavior with respect to the prediction step whereas the forecast errors of the other two models exhibit variations because predicted values are used in the other two models fig 21 a compares the models in terms of forecast performance for the wind speed u w among the three proposed multi step ahead forecasting models the m 1 and m 1 slope models outperform the m n model as n increases the forecast uncertainty of the m n model significantly increases which is reflected in the mean value and the standard deviation of the 24th step which reach 0 33 and 1 respectively this increase in uncertainty may be because the wind speed time series is so random that there is little correlation between the current data and the data for the following few hours in the comparative analysis of the m 1 and m 1 slope models when n is large the mean values of the forecast error factors are positive and negative respectively as a result the m 1 model can be considered the best performing model for u w prediction since its prediction is relatively conservative fig 21 b shows the h s prediction all three models yield almost identical results at the first step at this step the forecast uncertainties from the three models are low as reflected in the near zero mean values and standard deviations with the increase of the forecast horizon the m 1 slope model shows lower forecast uncertainty compared with the other two methods by inspecting fig 21 b although the standard deviation of the forecast error factors from the three models are similar the mean values of the errors from the m 1 slope model are lower for example for n 24 the mean values of the forecast error factors that are obtained using the m 1 model and the m n model are 0 14 and 0 22 respectively compared to only 0 004 for the m 1 slope model hence the m 1 slope model outperforms the others in fig 21 c the t p forecast performances for the three multi step ahead prediction models are displayed the level of uncertainty is lower than in h s and u w predictions all three models yield satisfactory results since the mean values and standard deviations of the forecast error factor for all steps are less than 0 1 and 0 28 respectively comparing the statistical results the m n method can provide more stable multi step ahead predictions at any step this can be observed in the lower fluctuation of the forecast performance as functions of the forecast lead time thus the m n model performs the best in predicting multi step t p according to fig 21 as the lead time increases the forecast uncertainty increases for all multi step ahead forecasting methods to display it clearly a probability distribution of the forecast error factor is used to describe forecast uncertainty at each step for example fig 22 shows forecast error distributions in t p prediction for various values of n in fig 22a the distributions are more concentrated around the mean value in the cases with small n hence there is a lower forecast uncertainty for lead times from 1 to 8 h ahead however as n increases the distributions become increasingly wide hence the uncertainty in the forecasts increases most of the forecast errors prior to the 8th step are concentrated between 0 3 and 0 3 while those after the 8th step are in the range of 0 6 to 0 6 as illustrated above the forecast horizon has an important effect on the performances of the multi step ahead forecasting models in predicting both wind and wave conditions by applying the combination of the decomposition technique and anfis the environmental conditions one to five steps ahead can be predicted accurately however due to the error accumulation problem of the m 1 and m 1 slope models and the uncorrelated input output sample in the m n model the performances of all three multi step ahead prediction models deteriorate as n increases under the circumstances for a specified step prediction the mean value and the standard deviation of the errors can be utilized to provide a prediction range instead of a single forecasted point based on the central limit theorem the distribution of the forecast error factor can be approximated by a normal distribution according to the properties of the normal distribution 68 of the error is contained within one standard deviation of the mean namely within m σ m σ applying this error range to the predicted value f t a prediction range r a t is calculated via eq 20 this range can be expressed as eq 28 where it is expected to cover the future actual weather conditions 28 r a t f t 1 m s t d where m and std are the mean value and the standard deviation of the forecast error factor and f t is the forecasted data at time t through the above process the future data at a specified step ahead can be represented by a range r a t rather than a separate prediction point f t via this approach the high uncertainty prediction can be used in practice to evaluate the proposed method two typical examples are selected for each environmental parameter and the prediction ranges for the following 24 h are identified from the fitted error curves the corresponding prediction ranges of u w h s and t p are shown in figs 23 25 respectively each subfigure depicts one example including the predicted and actual data and the prediction range according to all three figures although the red and blue lines differ which demonstrates that the forecasts may not be accurate for all 24 steps ahead the prediction ranges grey areas always contain the actual data hence if the accuracy of a large step ahead prediction is too uncertain to be adopted the prediction range can provide guidance for the variation of the future sea state therefore it is concluded that the proposed method is effective in capturing the future weather conditions in practice in addition in fig 23 b as the number of prediction steps increases the prediction range does not always widen because the m 1 model uses forecasted data for prediction which will lead to error accumulation this situation is not realistic especially if the number of forecast steps is further increased as a result the m n model may be considered the most appropriate model for applying the prediction range for a long forecast horizon 5 conclusions predicting short term wind and wave conditions is an important part of decision making during the execution of marine operations this work proposes a hybrid multi step ahead prediction model for predicting wind and wave conditions and investigates the forecast uncertainties in the suggested model over various seasons and sea states a hybrid method that combines a decomposition technique and anfis is introduced in this method the decomposition technique is applied to convert the original series to the corresponding stationary series to improve the overall forecasting accuracy then the anfis is established in which the input output pairs are determined by three multi step ahead models the m 1 m n and m 1 slope models finally by utilizing the three multi step ahead forecasting models twenty four step ahead predictions can be obtained recursively or directly to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method hourly time series of the mean wind speed u w the significant wave height h s and the peak spectral wave period t p at the north sea center are utilized the results demonstrate that the proposed decomposition anfis method performs well in one step ahead wave and wind forecasting by contrast the multi step ahead prediction models are more complex and the forecast accuracy decreases as the forecast horizon increases to quantify the forecast performance of the proposed method and to compare it with various multi step ahead models an uncertainty quantification analysis is proposed in the analysis the forecast uncertainty for each model is assessed in terms of the forecast error factor for a specified multi step ahead prediction model by statistically analyzing a set of the forecast error factors that were obtained during the testing period the forecast performance at each forecast step can be evaluated based on the quantification results the optimal values of m of three multi step ahead models can be determined in addition three optimal multi step ahead models are also compared on both wind and wave predictions the results demonstrate that the prediction model performance strongly depends on the properties of the variable for u w h s and t p predictions the best performing model is m 1 followed by m 1 slope and m n typically the proposed methods can effectively obtain exact predictions for the first five steps ahead due to the lower level of uncertainty however the uncertainty of forecasts will increase with the forecast horizon fitted equations of the mean and standard deviation of the forecast errors can be utilized to provide a prediction range instead of prediction points case studies demonstrate that this is an effective approach for utilizing the multi step ahead predictions in practice overall the proposed decomposition anfis multi step ahead forecasting methods can be applied for the short term prediction of wave and wind conditions and have application potential in marine operations however the randomness and unsteadiness of wind and waves render forecasting highly difficult for longer forecast horizons the forecast uncertainty quantification method can overcome this problem however

22578,the deformation mechanism of warships subjected to underwater explosion is very important to the survivability assessment of warships therefore in this study the deformation mechanism of a hull girder similar to a real warship structure subjected to underwater explosion loads has been investigated experimentally and numerically in addition the non spherical effect of underwater explosion bubble is considered the experiment is conducted in a water pool of underwater explosion and the numerical calculation is carried out through the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel algorithm then the validation of the method is conducted and numerical results agree well with the experimental results after that the detailed discussions on the overall damage characteristics of a hull girder under explosion bubble collapse are implemented finally a series of cases are conducted to investigate the response of the hull girder under different underwater explosion conditions by analyzing the experimental and numerical results conclusions can be drawn that with detonation distances decrease the deformation form of the hull girder converts rigid body motion to whipping and a plastic hinge generates when the charge weights are in a certain range the dynamic responses of the hull girder are similar for different charge weights with same dimensionless distance keywords underwater explosion hull girder whipping motion longitudinal strength cel 1 introduction during the strength assessment of the slender structures such as warships subjected to underwater explosion the longitudinal strength of is one of the concerned criterion there are two types of loads the shock wave load and bubble loads in the event of underwater explosion generally the shock wave load can lead to local structural damage but the bubble loads can affect the longitudinal strength of the slender structures which will lead to overall damage of the structures especially when the frequency of bubble pulsation is approach to the inherent frequency of the warships the effect of the bubble pulsation and collapse on the slender structures deformation will become obvious and the slender structures may be cut off in the middle cole and weller 1948 zhang et al 2008 zhang and zong 2011 however the deformation mechanism of the slender structures is still not clear therefore it is necessary to investigate the dynamic response of the slender structures subjected to underwater explosion within the effect of explosion bubble collapse the research on interactions between underwater explosion loads and plates is conducted firstly in order to study the dynamic response of structures subjected to underwater explosion best and blake 1994 best and kucera 1992 brujan et al 2001a b brujan et al 2005 kan et al 2005 klaseboer et al 2005 ramajeyathilagam and vendhan 2004 zhang et al 2008 zong et al 2013 in the work of these articles the dynamic responses of circle plates or rectangular plates subjected to shock wave load and bubble pulsing load were investigated in the meanwhile the bubble dynamic behaviors near flat rigid or elastic boundaries were studied numerically and experimentally in the research mentioned above since the plates are fixed at a place boundary conditions of these plates are slightly different from the plates of a surface ship therefore some research on interactions between a surface ship and underwater explosion loads has been carried out shin 2004 carried out ship shock analyses for far field underwater explosion by using ls dyna code coupled with usa code and the numerical results agreed well with the results of ship shock test data based on the potential flow theory a method that coupled boundary element method and finite element method was utilized by zhang et al 2008 to investigate the interactions between a bubble and a surface ship for near field middle field and far field explosions a conclusion was drawn that the shock wave load only causes the local damage of the surface ship and the bubble load will affect the longitudinal strength of the ship also a similar conclusion can be seen in the work of zhang et al 2011a where an evaluation method of total destruction based on bubble dynamic bending moment was proposed to assess the damage of a ship zong et al 2013 investigated the structural destruction of a ship subjected to close in underwater explosion shock wave load by using the acoustic structure coupling method and the damage modes of the ship under different detonation distances were sorted to three modes dishing deformation buckled frame deformation and bottom indented deformation although the modes are different for different ships the damage modes also have reference value for dynamic response of surface ship subjected to underwater explosion zong et al 2013 in the work of liu et al 2018b the effect of wave on the dynamic response of a ship subjected to underwater explosion was studied when a surface ship subjected underwater explosion in waves there is an initial bending moment in the ship and the bubble dynamic is different from that in non wave condition and the added masses of the ship are affected which will affect the global response of the ship although the research on a real ship is suitable for reality the results are ship dependent and the deformation mechanism of the complex structures is complicated which may has an effect on the analysis of the structure damage in order to simplify the damage evolution of a real ship meanwhile maintain the dynamic destruction characteristics of the ship many scholars and researchers consider the real ship as a hull girder model some researches on the hull girder have been conducted numerically and experimentally based on unidirectional coupling between a floating free free beam and a far field underwater explosion bubble zong 2005 investigated the dynamic response of the free free beam whose material was rigid perfectly plastic in the work of zong 2005 the motion of the beam was decomposed to three phases rigid body motion with bubble expansion a plastic hinge occurs and plastic deformation when the bending moment in the beam exceeded the limiting bending moment and rigid body motion after the plastic deformation ceases in the cases studied in zong 2005 it is can be observed that the rigid body motion of shorter beam is larger than longer beam which is also observed in zhang and zong 2011 considering the hydro elastic plastic feature of a hull girder motion in the water zhang and zong 2012 studied the dynamic response of the hull girder theoretically and examples of real scale ship are given to investigate the dynamic elastic and plastic response of the hull girder according to the similarity analysis and based on numerical and experimental data zhang et al 2011b established a theory prediction formula of the hog and sag deformation of the ship girder when the underwater explosion happens under the middle of the ship girder for near field underwater explosion the ship girder is hogged firstly and then sag in addition an experiment was conducted by zhang et al 2015 to investigate the hogging deformation of a hull girder subjected to near field underwater explosion and the hull girder had hogging deformation due to shock wave load during the same period wang et al 2014 investigated the dynamic response of ship structures by experiments and acoustic structure method then a semi analytical model to investigated the damage of the ship structures subjected to underwater explosion was proposed wang et al 2016 the work mentioned above mainly focus on the dynamic response of a hull girder which has only one layer material without coating according to the work of gong and lam 2006 and chen et al 2009 multi layers structures and the rubber sandwich coatings have significant effect on damage induced by shock wave load which can reduce the effect of the shock wave on the dynamic response of the hull girder however rubber sandwich coatings cannot reduce the whipping damage induced by bubble pulsation effectively chen et al 2009 therefore the effect of bubble loads on dynamic response of the hull girder is significant to investigate especially the deformation mechanism of the hull girder at the best of authors knowledge numerical calculations based on bidirectional coupling have not been widely utilized for investigating interactions between the hull girder and underwater explosion bubble therefore a coupled method will be used for our numerical calculations in this paper an experiment is conducted to study the dynamic response of the hull girder subjected to underwater explosion however the cost of experiment is expensive and many variables are hard to gain directly in order to learn more about the deformation mechanism of a hull girder a numerical method named coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method is utilized in the rest of this paper the experiment setups are introduced firstly then numerical background and validation of the numerical method are described after that interactions between the underwater explosion loads and the hull girder are investigated experimentally and numerically finally a series of cases for different detonation distances with the same charge weight and different charge weights with the same dimensionless distance are investigated meanwhile the effects of the variables on the dynamic response of the hull girder are analyzed 2 experimental arrangement and numerical background 2 1 experimental arrangement as shown in fig 1 the experiment was conducted in a water pool of underwater explosion the floating pontoons beside the hull girder were utilized to keep the hull girder at the right position the charge was placed under the middle of a hull girder shown in fig 1 b in the experiment charge weight is 0 22 kg and detonation distance is 0 7 m fig 2 shows the diagram of the experimental model the length width and depth of the hull girder is 6 3 m 1 m and 0 25 m respectively in addition the thickness of the deck and the transverse bulkhead of the hull girder is 0 004 m the thickness of the side plates and bottom of the hull girder is 0 006 m there are nine cabins in the model which are numbered from c1 to c9 and the length of each cabin is 0 7 m there is a rectangular opening on the deck of each cabin whose size is 0 7 m 0 4 m and the opening is located at the central of the deck in each cabin furthermore there are three t section longitudinal stiffeners in the bottom and the spacing between each stiffener is 0 25 m the panel width of the stiffener is 0 05 m and the thickness is 0 004 m for the web plate of the stiffener the height is 0 07 m and the thickness is 0 006 m the material of the experimental model is q235 steel as shown in fig 3 the arrangement of the strain transducers is illustrated the strain transducers are mainly set along the longitudinal direction of the hull girder in fig 3 b d the detailed arrangement of the strain transducers on deck line at side and side plate line at top is presented the strain transducers numbered 25 27 and 29 are utilized to measure the transverse strain on the plate the others are used to measure the longitudinal strain of the plate 2 2 numerical background the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method combines the advantages of the eulerian analysis and the lagrange method where the eulerian field and lagrangian bodies are allowed to interact in the same model aboshio and ye 2016 simulia 2011 in the cel method the fluid motions are based on traditional eulerian description but the deformation of the hull girder is defined by the traditional lagrangian description the eulerian grid are fixed during numerical calculation process and fluid transfer from one fixed mesh to another in the cel method however the mesh updates in calculation process with deformation of the materials in the ale method although the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method is a typical method used to control element distortion by adaptive meshing problems associated with strongly distorted mesh that are commonly encountered with a lagrangian or ale formulation will lead to some unrealistic results and even break the calculation aboshio and ye 2016 aquelet et al 2006 simulia 2011 according to the work of hsu et al 2014 the code of abaqus explicit can simulate the process of the underwater explosion well therefore the cel method in abaqus explicit code is utilized to calculate interactions between a hull girder and underwater explosion loads in this paper there are many articles such as qiu et al 2011 and aboshio and ye 2016 where the cel method has been explained in detail the underwater explosion process considered as an adiabatic process in this research when charge is detonated shock wave generates and propagates in the flow field in addition secondary pressure pulse will generate in the flow field when bubble reaches its minimum volume cole and weller 1948 in order to calculate propagation of wave in the flow field compressibility of the liquid water should be considered viscosity of water is neglected in traditional investigation on underwater explosion problems however some of the features related to bubble dynamic behaviors may be affected for example the velocity of liquid jet can be affected by viscosity of water according to the work of popinet and zaleski 2002 the jet impact velocity is found to decrease as viscosity increases and above a certain threshold jet impact is impossible therefore in our research the compressibility and viscosity of water is considered in addition the air and explosion products are compressible the compressible navier stokes equations are solved for eulerian materials water air and explosion products 2 2 1 ideal gas equation of state for air in the simulation air is considered as ideal gas and the equation of state used to simulate air is stated as follow 1 p p a ρ r θ θ z where ρ is air density p a is ambient pressure ris gas constant θ is current temperature and θ z is absolute zero on the temperature scale used in the simulation simulia 2011 2 2 2 us up equation of state for water for water a mie grüneisen equation can be used to describe the state of water in which the pressure is assumed as a function of fluid density and the internal energy of unit mass the mie grüneisen equation can be usually written as meyers 1994 simulia 2011 2 p p h γ ρ e m e h wherep h ande h are the hugoniot pressure and specific energy and γ is the grüneisen ratio defined as γ γ 0 ρ 0 ρ the hugoniot pressurep h and specific energye h are related by the relationship simulia 2011 3 e h p h η 2 ρ 0 where η is the volumetric compressive strain and defined as η 1 ρ 0 ρ the hugoniot pressure p h can be given as a function simulia 2011 4 p h ρ 0 c 0 2 η 1 s η 2 and in that equation there is an assumption that the relationship between the shock velocity u s and particle velocity u p is liner i e u s c 0 s u p meyers 1994 simulia 2011 by substituting the p h and e h in eq 2 the linear u s u p hugoniot form of mie grüneisen equation can be written as simulia 2011 5 p ρ 0 c 0 2 η 1 s η 2 1 γ 0 η 2 γ 0 ρ 0 e m where ρ 0 is a reference density c 0 is speed velocity in the water γ 0 is a material constant s is a constant in the u s u p equation meyers 1994 and e m is internal energy per unit mass there is much information about mie grüneisen equation heuzé 2012 meyers 1994 2 2 3 jwl equation of state for tnt to simulate the detonation products of tnt the jones wilkins lee jwl equation of state is used which was proposed by lee with the previous work of jones and wilkin lee et al 1973 lee and hornig 1969 simulia 2011 the common form of the jwl equation is written as lee et al 1973 simulia 2011 6 p a 1 ω ρ r 1 ρ 0 exp r 1 ρ 0 ρ b 1 ω ρ r 2 ρ 0 exp r 2 ρ 0 ρ ω ρ e m wherea b r 1 r 2and ω are material constant which are defined by experimental results ρ 0 is the density of tnt used in the simulation ρ is density of detonation products and e m is the internal energy per unit mass 2 2 4 material of the hull girder in the simulation the steel q235 is used for the hull girder the density of steel q235 is 7850 kg m3 the young s modulus is 2 1e11pa and poisson s ratio of the steel q235 is 0 3 in addition the strain rate dependent data of q235 steel is used to describe the plastic nature of the steel shown in table 1 3 validation of the numerical method the validation of the numerical method cel is carried out by comparing with the experiment conducted by cui et al 2016 the experiment was conducted in a 2 m 2 m 2 m cubic tank a petn charge with 4 0 g was placed 0 19 m below a horizontal fixed steel plate with 0 8 m length 0 8 m width and 0 02 m thickness the tnt equivalence of the charge is 5 2 g cui et al 2016 and therefore in the simulation a tnt charge with 5 2 g weight is used to replace the petn charge fig 4 gives the comparison of experimental and numerical results of bubble shapes as shown in fig 4 a when the charge is detonated a gas bubble at high temperature and pressure generates cole and weller 1948 the bubble expands because the inner pressure of the bubble is larger than ambient pressure and the bubble shape is spherical firstly shown in fig 4 b with bubble growth the effect of the horizontal plate fixed in the water on the bubble becomes obvious and the upside of the bubble becomes flat shown in fig 4 c at that time the pressure in the bubble decreases until equals to ambient due to the inertia of the outflowing water the bubble continues expanding until the bubble volume reaches to its maximum value where the pressure in the bubble is smaller than that in the ambient cole and weller 1948 after that the bubble begins to collapse and the bubble collapse slower in vertical direction due to existence of the plate shown in fig 4 d and e with bubble collapsing the bubble shape likes an inverted circular cone shown in fig 4 f at that time the pressure at the top of the circular cone like bubble is higher than that at the bottom of the circular cone like bubble which has been illustrated in previous researches kan et al 2005 liu et al 2018a finally due to the difference of pressure and the existence of fixed plate a water jet generates and points to the plate shown in fig 4 g and the rebound of the water jet can be observed in fig 4 h by comparing the evolution of the bubble shapes the numerical results agree well with that observed in the experiment as shown in fig 4 because the charge type used in the numerical simulation is tnt rather than petn and the charge used in simulation is spherical rather than cylindrical the time for the same bubble form between numerical and experimental results is not exactly identical however the comparison still can illustrate that the numerical method used in this paper is reasonable to describe the bubble dynamic near structures 4 overall damage characteristics of the hull girder in the experiment the hull girder has local deformation and global deformation when subjected to underwater explosion the effect of the shock wave on the hull girder is mainly local deformation and in the experiment the charge is not so close enough that the hull girder have a little local damage induced by the shock wave the mainly deformation is induced by the underwater explosion bubble in this section the dynamic response of the hull girder subjected to the underwater explosion of a charge with 0 22 kg weight and the detonation distance of 0 7 m will be discussed in order to obtain more information about the dynamic response of the hull girder the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method is utilized to calculate the interactions between underwater explosion and the hull girder 4 1 experimental results on the overall damage characteristics of the hull girder a high speed camera was utilized to record the motion of the hull girder and the shooting frequency in this experiment is 5000 hz fig 5 gives the experimental results of motion of the hull girder the initial situation of the hull girder is described in fig 5 a and the charge is detonated as bubble growth the hull girder shows the hogging motion firstly in fig 5 b and then as shown in fig 5 c the hull girder returns to its initial shape however the hull girder has a global displacement after the recovery of the hull girder due to the collapse of bubble and inertia the hull girder shows a sagging motion in fig 5 d in the process of the underwater explosion the spike of the free surface becomes higher and higher fig 6 presents the final deformation and the deformation distribution of the hull girder in the experiment as shown in fig 6 a there is a plastic hinge in the middle of the hull girder due to the underwater explosion the longitudinal deformation distribution of the hull girder are shown in fig 6 b according to the experimental results the plastic deformation of the side shell is mainly generated in the middle cabin c5 of the hull girder and the plastic deformation regions of the deck plate are larger than that of side shell furthermore the regions of the deck plates where plastic deformation is generated are mainly the three cabins in the mid hull girder such as c4 c5 and c6 in fig 6 c and d the deformation of the middle cabin c5 are shown because the internal force evolution and the vibration which are induced by high frequency shock wave load and low frequency of the bubble loads are very complicated in the deck plate it is reasonable that the deformation form of the deck plate in each side of the hull girder has a few differences moreover the deformation of the deck plate is larger than that in the side plate shown in fig 6 d which is induced by the different boundary conditions between deck plates and side shells in the experimental model the strain evolutions of the points observed in the experiment will be investigated later fig 7 presents the strain signals obtained in the experiment the strain transducers numbered 20 24 are located in the center line of the bottom plate described in fig 3 as shown in fig 7 a e the regions where the strain transducers 23 and 24 are placed have plastic deformation and other regions are mainly have elastic deformation therefore for the bottom plate of the hull girder plastic deformation mainly occurs at the third cabins in the middle of the hull girder as shown in fig 7 c k l e g and i the final strains of these measure points are approximately 2e 5 1 76e 3 1 5e 5 6e 4 3 2e 3 and 1 57e 3 respectively therefore a conclusion can be drawn that the largest deformation of a transverse section within deck opening is generated in the deck and the deformation of the side shell is larger than that in the bottom plate furthermore as shown in fig 3 a the strain transducers numbered 24 26 and 28 are used to observe the strain along the longitudinal direction and the strain transducers numbered 25 27 and 29 are used to observe the strain along the transverse direction in the middle of the hull girder from the strain evolution in fig 7 e and f the phenomenon that the strains in both figures are in the same order of magnitude indicate the deformation of the bottom plate along the longitudinal and transverse directions are similar when the charge is detonated under the middle of the hull girder in addition the strain along the longitudinal direction is larger than that along the transverse direction and the deck plate enters a plastic state in the deck of the hull girder as shown in fig 7 i and j the transverse plastic strain is larger than the longitudinal plastic strain which indicates that the transverse deformation of the side shell in the middle of the hull girder is larger than that along the longitudinal direction the experimental results including the hull girder motions the final deformation of the hull girder and the strain evolutions of some observation points are discussed above however some phenomena such as underwater explosion bubble motion are difficult to observe and some variables such as bending moments in some sections are difficult to gain in order to get more information numerical simulation results will be further discussed to know more about the dynamic response of the hull girder 4 2 numerical results on the overall damage characteristics of the hull girder according to the viewpoint that after the first bubble pulsing the energy contained in the underwater explosion bubble is less than 15 of the total energy and the critical bending moment of the hull girder usually occurs after the first bubble pulsation zhang and zong 2011 therefore the dynamic response of the hull girder under the first bubble collapse is investigated in the numerical simulation the observation points are renumbered as shown in fig 8 the observation points p1 p5 are located at the middle line of the bottom plate p6 p10 are located at the deck line at side and the points p11 and p15 are placed at bottom plating line at side in the rest parts the new observation point numbers are used for numerical results fig 9 shows the transverse section form of the mid hull girder and the properties of the transverse section are stated in table 2 the area moment of inertia about neutral axis is 8 877e 5m 4 for the deck plates the stress of the deck at the middle of the hull girder will exceed 235mpa when the bending moment value beyond 1 139e5 n m similarly the yield bending moment of the bottom plates is 3 3676e5 n mwhich is larger than that of deck plate the properties of the transverse section indicates that the deformation will be generated in the deck plate firstly fig 10 shows the interactions between the bubble induced by underwater explosion and the hull girder in fig 11 and fig 12 the displacement and bending moment distributions along the longitudinal direction of the hull girder at different time are described the initial relative position between the charge and the hull girder is described in fig 10 a when the charge is detonated the shock wave generated firstly and the explosion products become to a bubble at high temperature and high pressure cole and weller 1948 as time goes on the bubble begins to grow because the pressure in the bubble is larger than ambient pressure and the hull girder shows the hogging motions as shown in fig 10 b the stress in the deck plates is higher than other parts and the high stress regions are mainly located in the middle of the hull girder at that time the displacement of the middle of the hull girder are larger than that in other parts especially displacements of both ends which are almost in a static state moreover the bending moment in the middle of the hull girder is larger than the critical bending moment of the deck plate but the deck plate has little deformation because the stress in deck plates is tensile stress which can strength stability of the deck plates with bubble growth the hogging motion of the hull girder continues fig 10 c and the difference of the displacement at different parts of the hull girder becomes larger shown in fig 11 as shown in fig 10 c the regions of high stress move toward both ends and the bending moment at that regions are larger than that at other parts fig 12 t 16 m s which will accelerate the upward motion of the ends parts of the hull girder after that the bubble continues becoming large and has more effect on the deformation of the hull girder the high stress regions move toward the middle part of the hull girder and the bending moments in the mid hull girder become larger than other parts once more fig 12 t 28 m s which lead to continuously hogging motion of the hull girder shown in fig 10 d at that moment as shown in fig 11 the hull girder has a global motion described at t 28 m s moreover the bubble does not reach its maximum volume but the displacement of the mid hull girder is approximate to its maximum displacement as shown in fig 10 e f and g the bubble expending and reaches its maximum volume there are not obvious high stress regions in the hull girder because the expending velocity of the bubble becomes so weak that it has little influence on the hogging motion of the hull girder due to weakness of bubble expanding and inertia of the hull girder the bending moment differences between different parts become smaller and the bending moments at quarter position of the hull girder are larger than mid hull girder which lead to restoring forces in the hull girder when the hull girder reaches its initial shape the velocity of middle part of the hull girder is smaller than that at the ends due to the inertia of the ends which leads the motion of the ends and the hull girder begins to sag at that time the upward motion velocities of the ends become smaller due to the bending moment generated in the hull girder shown in fig 12 at t 44 m s and t 48 m s after that the bubble begins to collapse meanwhile the hull girder continues sagging with the collapse of the bubble and has a global downward motion shown in fig 10 h and i the direction of bending moment in the hull girder at that period is opposite to the bending moment direction in hogging process and the bending moment in the middle regions of the hull girder is larger than that in other parts shown in fig 12 with bubble collapsing the displacement of the hull girder becomes larger fig 11 t 70 m s t 100 m s but the bending moment in the hull girder is getting smaller fig 12 t 70 m s t 100 m s the reason is that the downward velocity differences of different parts become smaller and the bubble becomes so small that has little effect on the hull girder as shown in fig 11 the displacements of the middle of the hull girder are larger than that in the ends from t 70 m s to t 100 m s and a plastic hinge occurs in the middle of the hull girder finally as shown in fig 10 j there is a water jet which penetrates the explosion bubble and acts on the bottom plate of the hull girder the water jet load leads to local deformation of the hull girder and sharply reduces the downward motion of the middle regions of the hull girder moreover bending moment in the middle of the hull girder is smaller than that in other parts fig 12 t 138 m s in order to learn more about the mechanism of the overall deformation of the hull girder fig 13 gives the bending moment evolutions at different transverse sections of the hull girder as shown in fig 13 the evolution trends of the bending moment at different sections are almost similar and the bending moment at x 3 0 m is smaller than other parts however there are some situations should be paid more attention when the charge is detonated the bending moment direction in the middle region of the hull girder is opposite to other parts and the bending moment magnitudes of middle of the hull girder in that period are larger than the critical bending moment of the deck plate described in table 2 there is a decrease at t 5 m s approximately at section x 0 m at that time there are turning points in other sections such as x 1 2 m x 1 8 m and x 2 4 m the change of the bending moment is consistence with the stress evolution that high stress regions move toward the ends from the middle of the hull girder when all the bending moments are in the same direction the decrease of the bending moment in the middle of the hull girder terminates and the hull girder continues hogging with global displacement moreover the bending moment direction change is reduced by restoring force in the hull girder due to inertia after that the bending moment in the middle parts increase once more and the moment in other parts decrease due to the effect of bubble expanding in the rest time of hogging the bending moment trend evolutions at middle of the hull girder e g x 0 m and x 0 6 m are consistent and the evolutions of others parts are similar concretely when bending moments at x 0 m and x 0 6 m increase bending moments at other sections decrease and when bending moments at x 0 m and x 0 6 m decrease bending moments at other sections increase in addition the bending moments at x 0 6 m x 1 2 m and x 1 8 m are larger than bending moment in middle section at 20 m s furthermore the bending moments in hogging period are larger than the critical bending moment of deck plates especially at x 0 m and x 0 6 m however there is no obvious deformation in the deck of the hull girder the reason is that the stress in the deck plates is tensile stress which can strength the stability of the deck plates the bending moments in the bottom plates are smaller than the critical bending moment in the bottom plates although the bending moment makes no obvious deformation in the hull girder it has great effect on the sagging motion of the hull girder compared to hogging period the bending moment evolutions in sagging period are relatively simple the regulation revealed in the bending moment evolutions is that the larger distance from the middle section x 0 m the smaller bending moment in the hull girder at last the sagging bending moment at middle regions decrease and bending moment at the ends increase due to water jet load the evolution trends mentioned above are consistent with motions of the hull girder and the mechanism of the hull girder motion becomes clear from the bending moment evolutions at different sections 5 effect of detonation distance and charge weight the detonation distance for same charge weight 0 22 kg and the charge weight for same dimensionless detonation distance 0 77 are taken to investigate the effect of parameters on the deformation of a hull girder the nondimensionalization of the dimensionless detonation distance is achieved by dividing the maximum radius of bubble in free field conditions in each case and the buoyancy parameter in different cases is estimated buoyancy parameter is defined as δ ρ g r m δ p 1 2 and δ p p p c wherer m is the maximum radius of bubble in free field with same depth of water ρ is density of the liquid gis gravitational acceleration pis ambient pressure in the fluid at the initial bubble centroid andp c is saturated vapor pressure inside the bubble because the charge weights are not large enough and the detonation distances investigated are not so small the main global deformation of the hull girder is induced by bubble dynamic loads in this paper therefore the effects of bubble loads on the overall damage characteristics of the hull girder are mainly discussed 5 1 effect of detonation distance on the overall damage characteristics of the hull girder cases shown in table 3 are taken to illustrate the effect of detonation distance on the overall damage characteristics of the hull girder the charge weight is 0 22 kg the detonation distance increases from 0 70 m to 1 30 m with the interval of 0 2 m fig 14 gives the deformation of the hull girder and the bubble shape in different cases when the water jet penetrates the bubble as shown in fig 14 the effect of the detonation distance on the dynamic response of the hull girder are very obvious comparing the interactions in the four cases there are two obvious features one is that the deformation of the hull girder decrease with detonation distance increase the other is that the bubble shapes in the process of collapse are different due to the different effect of the hull girder especially when the water jet penetrates the underwater explosion bubble according to the work of brujan et al 2001a and brujan et al 2001b depending on the initial distance between bubble and wall a liquid jet directed towards the wall would generate or the bubble with a mushroom like shape due to radial jet induced by rebound of elastic material can be observed with bubble collapse also the radial jet would lead to bubble splitting and generation of two axial jets flowing in opposing directions the situations investigated in our paper are similar to the case investigated by brujan et al 2001b where material of boundary is stiff therefore due to large elastic module the second pressure gradient induced by elastic boundary rebound is so weak that bubble are not split by radial flow fig 15 presents dynamic behaviors of the bubble in case 3 after a liquid jet penetrates the bubble the bubble begins to expand after the liquid jet penetrates the bubble with the detonation distance increase the effect between the hull girder and the underwater explosion bubble decreases in case 1 there is an obvious plastic hinge in the middle of the hull girder however there is no obvious deformation in case 3 and case 4 in order to learn more about the effect of detonation distance on deformation of the hull girder the local deformation of the hull girder and the displacement of the hull girder are further discussed fig 16 gives the local deformation forms of the middle regions of the hull girder when the hull girder displacement reaches its maximum value in sagging motion period of case 1 4 as shown in fig 16 a large deformation occurs in the deck plates and side shells of the hull girder also the deformation of the deck plates in the adjacent cabins are smaller than that in the middle cabin of the hull girder similar deformation occurs in case 2 but the magnitude of the deformation is smaller than that in case 1 as shown in fig 16 b in case 3 and case 4 the deformation of the deck plates are smaller than the two cases case 1 and 2 and the side shells have little deformation fig 16 c and d the differences of the deformation forms may result in the situation that the stress and strain at the same observation point in different cases have different evolution trends however the local difference have little effect on the global dynamic response of the hull girder fig 17 a gives the global displacement evolutions of the middle of the hull girder in case 1 4 the displacement distributions along the longitudinal direction of the hull girder are shown in fig 17 b when the displacement reaches its extreme values in the process of hogging and sagging in the four cases the evolution trends of the displacement are similar because the bubble dynamic behaviors are similar however the magnitudes of the displacement in different cases are different the increase rate or decrease rate of the displacement increase with decrease of the detonation distance shown in fig 17 a as shown in fig 17 b displacement differences are mainly concentrated on the middle of the hull girder and displacements of both ends have a few differences in the process of hogging in the process of sagging there are plastic hinges in the first two cases case 1 and 2 and the displacement difference of both ends in different cases are obvious table 4 presents the comparison of displacements in different cases δp i is calculated by using the displacement of case 1 as a baseline in the same process the maximum displacement of the mid hull girder in the process of sagging decreases faster than that in the process of hogging with detonation distance increase which indicates that the detonation distance have more influence on the displacement in sagging process as shown in table 5 deformation angles of the hull girder described in fig 17 b in the four cases are stated and δα is calculated by using the angle value of case 1 as a baseline the difference angle between case 1 and case 4 which has little deformation is 14 24 and it is relatively large for the deformation of the hull girder fig 18 gives the bending moment evolutions of middle of the hull girder section in different cases because of the difference in detonation distance the load evolutions acted on the hull girder are difference therefore the bending moments generated in the hull girder have different magnitudes and action times which result in different dynamic response of the hull girder as shown in fig 18 the bending moment evolutions are similar in different cases the moment increases and keeping in a state at relatively high bending moment for a period of time in the process of hogging with bubble collapsing the motion of the hull girder converts to sagging so the bending moment decrease until the direction changed in the sagging motion process the bending moment increase firstly and then decrease due to bubble dynamic behaviors and motion of the hull girder however the phenomenon that bending moment decrease at 10 m s does not occurs in case 3 and case 4 because with detonation distance increase the rebounding motion of the ends parts becomes weaker and the deformation rate becomes smaller table 6 presents the action time in different cases when the bending moment beyond a critical value is described and the variable γ is calculated by using the action time of the bending moment in case 1 as a baseline in the corresponding motion process as shown in table 6 with detonation distance increase the magnitude and action time of the bending moment decrease which reduce the effect of the underwater explosion loads on the hull girder considering the displacement of the middle of the hull girder and the action time when bending moment beyond the critical bending moment the displacement percent reduce to 53 33 from case 1 to case 4 when the action time percent reduce to 33 47 in the hogging process however the displacement percent reduce to 29 24 from case 1 to case 4 when the action time percent reduce to 72 85 in the sagging process the phenomenon indicates the action time of higher bending moment in hogging motion are important to the sagging process in general the action time of critical bending moment have an significant effect on the dynamic response of the hull girder and the bending moment in hogging process have an effect on the response of the hull girder in the sagging process fig 19 presents the comparison of bending moment distributions at different time and the results agree well with the conclusion mentioned above as shown in fig 19 a d because the interactions between the bubble and the hull girder in different cases are difference the bending moment distributions in different cases at the same time are different moreover the differences are obvious in fig 19 d due to water jet load because of the existence of the hull girder the water jet load points toward the bottom plate of the hull girder and acts on the plate directly case 1 case 2 however for longer detonation distance case 3 case 4 the load could not act on the bottom plate directly therefore the hull girder in different conditions has different responses and the rapidly decrease of the bending moment in the mid hull girder in case 1 is reduced by the water jet load as shown in fig 20 principal logarithmic strain evolutions of some observation points in the four cases are compared from the discussion stated above the larger detonation distance the smaller effect on the hull girder the results described in fig 20 are consistence with the conclusion in general the increase rate value and the magnitude of the strain in the observation point p10 in case 2 are larger than that in case 3 which in turn are larger than that in case 4 while both the increase rate value and the magnitude of the strain in case 2 and case 3 are smaller than that in case 1 that situation also can be observed in fig 20 b c and d there are some situations should be illustrated clearly the evolutions of the strain have similar trend in the whole however there are some slight differences in different cases especially for strain in p10 the difference is induced by the different deformation form of the deck plates illustrated in fig 16 another situation should be paid more attention is that the strain in different cases are approximate to each other for parts near the ends of the hull shown in fig 20 c in total the smaller detonation distance the larger strain in structures 5 2 effect of charge weight on the overall damage characteristics of the hull girder the effects of charge weight for same dimensionless detonation distance on the overall damage characteristics of the hull girder will be investigated in this section cases shown in table 7 are taken to illustrate the effect of charge weight on the overall damage characteristics of the hull girder the charge weights in the simulation are from 0 18 kg to 0 26 kg and different detonation distances are used to obtain same initial dimensionless detonation distance in addition the buoyancy parameter in different cases is estimated fig 21 presents the interactions between underwater explosion bubble and the hull girder in case 5 the evolutions of the interactions in other four cases are similar to case 5 the interactions in case 3 are presented in fig 10 when the charge is detonated a bubble generates and expands at the same time the hull girder has hogging motion and the stress in the deck plate are larger than other parts due to the existence of the hull girder and small detonation distance the bubble is influenced and not spherical any more after the bubble reaches its maximum volume the bubble begins to collapse and the hull girder has sagging motions because the bending moment in the hull girder beyond the critical bending moment there is a plastic hinge generated in the middle of the hull girder and the plastic deformation continues with bubble collapsing when the bubble reaches its minimum volume a water jet occurs and acts on the bottom plate of the hull girder from the results a conclusion can be drawn that the bubble dynamic and response of the hull girder are similar for different charge weights with the same initial dimensionless detonation distance in a certain range the deformation of the hull girder and the bubble form evolution in case 1 case 2 case 4 and case 5 when the water jet penetrates the bubble are presented in fig 22 the result of case 3 has been described in section 4 2 the morphological characteristics of the bubble and the hull girder are almost similar global behaviors of the hull girder in different cases investigated above are consistence with each other and plastic hinges generate in the sagging process of the hull girder in order to learn more about the plastic hinge the local plastic deformation in the four cases will be investigated in next part as shown in fig 23 local deformation of the middle regions of the hull girder are presented when displacement of the mid hull girder reaches maximum value in the process of sagging although global behaviors of the hull girder are similar local deformation in different cases have relatively large difference on deformation form of the plate which are marked in fig 23 the difference of the local deformation is induced by vibrations of the plate generated by bubble dynamic loads and response of the hull girder the difference have little influence on the global response of the hull girder but the strain at the same location in different cases may be different fig 24 presents the displacement evolutions of the middle section of the hull girder and displacement distributions along the longitudinal directions of the hull girder as shown in fig 24 a the increase rate reduced by shock wave and bubble expanding increase with charge weight increase when the mid hull girder reaches its maximum displacement in hogging process the hull girder begins to sag after the mid hull girder reaches its maximum displacement in sagging process the hull girder begins to restore its initial shape for different charge weights the period of the bubble pulsation in different cases are different which lead to different action time of the bubble dynamic loads comparisons of the maximum displacements in the five cases in the hogging and sagging process are stated in table 8 and parameters such as p 1 δp 1 p 2 δp 2 are calculated by using the corresponding values of case 3 as a baseline the displacement differences between different cases in the hogging process are larger than that in sagging process furthermore the displacements of case 3 5 in sagging process are close to each other for the plastic hinge angles generated in the cases the difference values between different cases are stated in table 9 and parameter δα is calculated by using the angle in case 3 as a baseline from fig 24 b and table 9 there are plastic hinges in the middle of the hull girder in all cases and the plastic hinge angles are close to each other therefore the hull girder has similar dynamic response for various charge weights with same initial dimensionless detonation distance if the charge weight beyond a critical value which can lead to a situation that a plastic hinge generates in the middle of the hull girder the bending moment evolutions and distributions are presented in fig 25 and fig 26 respectively as shown in fig 25 the evolutions of bending moment in the five cases are consistent except at the moment when the bending moment decrease reduced by water jet load the reason for the difference is that different charge weights make different bubble pulsation periods which result in different water jet acting times the similar evolution of the bending moment in same structures indicates that the interactions between the hull girder and the loads are similar which is consistence with the conclusion mentioned above however bending moment distributions at the specific time moments may be affected by the difference of the bubble pulsation periods as shown in fig 26 the distributions of the bending moment for different cases are similar at t 25 m s and 80 m s fig 26 a and c when t 43 m s fig 26 b the bending moment values in the hull girder are difference obviously because the hull girders in the cases are in a period that hogging motion converts to sagging motion and the time that bubble needed to reach its maximum volume is different due to different charge weights fig 26 d presents the bending moment distributions of the hull girder when the displacement of the hull girder is approximate to its maximum displacement in sagging process the local decrease of the bending moment are reduced by water jet load and the bending moments in other parts are similar in general the influences which are induced by difference in bubble pulsation period and local loads are finite in the conditions investigated in this section fig 27 gives comparisons of the strain evolutions of different observation points in different cases as shown in fig 27 a c the strain in the middle of the hull girder p10 are larger than other parts p8 and p6 which agree well with the results discussed in section 4 2 moreover the magnitudes and evolutions of the strain in the five cases are similar which indicates the deformation generated in the deck plate of the hull girder are similar in addition the strain evolutions shown in fig 27 d indicate that dynamic behaviors are similar in the bottom plate of the hull girder and the strain reduced by water jet load in the five cases is not presented in order to observe the evolutions clearly the difference of strain evolution in p10 between case 1 case 3 and the other cases are caused by the uncertainty of the plate local deformation mentioned above in total the hull girder has similar dynamic behaviors for different charge weights with same dimensionless detonation distance when the charge weight beyond a critical value the dynamic responses of the hull girder for different charge weights with same dimensionless detonation distance have been studied in this section in the cases studied in this subsection the charge weights are in a certain range where underwater explosions can lead to plastic deformation of the hull girder and the dynamic behaviors of the hull girder are similar except for some differences on the magnitude of some variables this phenomenon indicates that it is possible to make serious damage on a structure for small charge weight 6 conclusions this study has investigated the dynamic response of a hull girder model experimentally and numerically based on coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method numerical research has been conducted to avoid expensive and complex experiments and obtain more information which is difficult to obtain in the experiment the validation of the cel method is conducted firstly and the simulation results can capture essential features of underwater explosion with structures which agree well with experimental results in this study an experiment was conducted to study the overall damage mechanism of the hull girder from the pictures captured by a high speed camera and the final damage form of the hull girder the hull girder has hogging motion firstly and then sagging when subjected to underwater explosion and there is a plastic hinge in the middle part of the hull girder meanwhile the deck plates of the hull girder lost their stability and has plastic deformation the parts with free boundaries should be paid more attention which have significant effect on the local and global structural strength especially in the middle of the slender structures in order to learn more about deformation mechanism of the hull girder induced by underwater explosion numerical investigations were conducted the deformation mechanism of the hull girder is discussed in detail by analyzing bending moments and displacements of the hull girder in our research the overall damage of the hull girder is mainly reduced by explosion bubble loads in addition the dynamic response of the hull girder in the process of hogging have significant effect on the overall damage of the hull girder induced by bubble collapse in sagging process due to the effect of structures the water jet points the structure which is different from the situations that bubble collapse near the free surface or under structures whose size is so small that the effect of free surface is dominated the effects of variables such as charge weight and detonation distance on interactions between underwater explosion loads and a hull girder are discussed with detonation distances decrease for same charge weight the motion of a hull girder converts rigid body motion to whipping motion and a plastic hinge generates when the charge weights are in a certain range the deformation features are similar to each other another deformation feature is that the local deformation form for different cases are different due to the bubble dynamic behaviors especially for the deck plates which have free boundaries acknowledgement this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 51779056 
22578,the deformation mechanism of warships subjected to underwater explosion is very important to the survivability assessment of warships therefore in this study the deformation mechanism of a hull girder similar to a real warship structure subjected to underwater explosion loads has been investigated experimentally and numerically in addition the non spherical effect of underwater explosion bubble is considered the experiment is conducted in a water pool of underwater explosion and the numerical calculation is carried out through the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel algorithm then the validation of the method is conducted and numerical results agree well with the experimental results after that the detailed discussions on the overall damage characteristics of a hull girder under explosion bubble collapse are implemented finally a series of cases are conducted to investigate the response of the hull girder under different underwater explosion conditions by analyzing the experimental and numerical results conclusions can be drawn that with detonation distances decrease the deformation form of the hull girder converts rigid body motion to whipping and a plastic hinge generates when the charge weights are in a certain range the dynamic responses of the hull girder are similar for different charge weights with same dimensionless distance keywords underwater explosion hull girder whipping motion longitudinal strength cel 1 introduction during the strength assessment of the slender structures such as warships subjected to underwater explosion the longitudinal strength of is one of the concerned criterion there are two types of loads the shock wave load and bubble loads in the event of underwater explosion generally the shock wave load can lead to local structural damage but the bubble loads can affect the longitudinal strength of the slender structures which will lead to overall damage of the structures especially when the frequency of bubble pulsation is approach to the inherent frequency of the warships the effect of the bubble pulsation and collapse on the slender structures deformation will become obvious and the slender structures may be cut off in the middle cole and weller 1948 zhang et al 2008 zhang and zong 2011 however the deformation mechanism of the slender structures is still not clear therefore it is necessary to investigate the dynamic response of the slender structures subjected to underwater explosion within the effect of explosion bubble collapse the research on interactions between underwater explosion loads and plates is conducted firstly in order to study the dynamic response of structures subjected to underwater explosion best and blake 1994 best and kucera 1992 brujan et al 2001a b brujan et al 2005 kan et al 2005 klaseboer et al 2005 ramajeyathilagam and vendhan 2004 zhang et al 2008 zong et al 2013 in the work of these articles the dynamic responses of circle plates or rectangular plates subjected to shock wave load and bubble pulsing load were investigated in the meanwhile the bubble dynamic behaviors near flat rigid or elastic boundaries were studied numerically and experimentally in the research mentioned above since the plates are fixed at a place boundary conditions of these plates are slightly different from the plates of a surface ship therefore some research on interactions between a surface ship and underwater explosion loads has been carried out shin 2004 carried out ship shock analyses for far field underwater explosion by using ls dyna code coupled with usa code and the numerical results agreed well with the results of ship shock test data based on the potential flow theory a method that coupled boundary element method and finite element method was utilized by zhang et al 2008 to investigate the interactions between a bubble and a surface ship for near field middle field and far field explosions a conclusion was drawn that the shock wave load only causes the local damage of the surface ship and the bubble load will affect the longitudinal strength of the ship also a similar conclusion can be seen in the work of zhang et al 2011a where an evaluation method of total destruction based on bubble dynamic bending moment was proposed to assess the damage of a ship zong et al 2013 investigated the structural destruction of a ship subjected to close in underwater explosion shock wave load by using the acoustic structure coupling method and the damage modes of the ship under different detonation distances were sorted to three modes dishing deformation buckled frame deformation and bottom indented deformation although the modes are different for different ships the damage modes also have reference value for dynamic response of surface ship subjected to underwater explosion zong et al 2013 in the work of liu et al 2018b the effect of wave on the dynamic response of a ship subjected to underwater explosion was studied when a surface ship subjected underwater explosion in waves there is an initial bending moment in the ship and the bubble dynamic is different from that in non wave condition and the added masses of the ship are affected which will affect the global response of the ship although the research on a real ship is suitable for reality the results are ship dependent and the deformation mechanism of the complex structures is complicated which may has an effect on the analysis of the structure damage in order to simplify the damage evolution of a real ship meanwhile maintain the dynamic destruction characteristics of the ship many scholars and researchers consider the real ship as a hull girder model some researches on the hull girder have been conducted numerically and experimentally based on unidirectional coupling between a floating free free beam and a far field underwater explosion bubble zong 2005 investigated the dynamic response of the free free beam whose material was rigid perfectly plastic in the work of zong 2005 the motion of the beam was decomposed to three phases rigid body motion with bubble expansion a plastic hinge occurs and plastic deformation when the bending moment in the beam exceeded the limiting bending moment and rigid body motion after the plastic deformation ceases in the cases studied in zong 2005 it is can be observed that the rigid body motion of shorter beam is larger than longer beam which is also observed in zhang and zong 2011 considering the hydro elastic plastic feature of a hull girder motion in the water zhang and zong 2012 studied the dynamic response of the hull girder theoretically and examples of real scale ship are given to investigate the dynamic elastic and plastic response of the hull girder according to the similarity analysis and based on numerical and experimental data zhang et al 2011b established a theory prediction formula of the hog and sag deformation of the ship girder when the underwater explosion happens under the middle of the ship girder for near field underwater explosion the ship girder is hogged firstly and then sag in addition an experiment was conducted by zhang et al 2015 to investigate the hogging deformation of a hull girder subjected to near field underwater explosion and the hull girder had hogging deformation due to shock wave load during the same period wang et al 2014 investigated the dynamic response of ship structures by experiments and acoustic structure method then a semi analytical model to investigated the damage of the ship structures subjected to underwater explosion was proposed wang et al 2016 the work mentioned above mainly focus on the dynamic response of a hull girder which has only one layer material without coating according to the work of gong and lam 2006 and chen et al 2009 multi layers structures and the rubber sandwich coatings have significant effect on damage induced by shock wave load which can reduce the effect of the shock wave on the dynamic response of the hull girder however rubber sandwich coatings cannot reduce the whipping damage induced by bubble pulsation effectively chen et al 2009 therefore the effect of bubble loads on dynamic response of the hull girder is significant to investigate especially the deformation mechanism of the hull girder at the best of authors knowledge numerical calculations based on bidirectional coupling have not been widely utilized for investigating interactions between the hull girder and underwater explosion bubble therefore a coupled method will be used for our numerical calculations in this paper an experiment is conducted to study the dynamic response of the hull girder subjected to underwater explosion however the cost of experiment is expensive and many variables are hard to gain directly in order to learn more about the deformation mechanism of a hull girder a numerical method named coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method is utilized in the rest of this paper the experiment setups are introduced firstly then numerical background and validation of the numerical method are described after that interactions between the underwater explosion loads and the hull girder are investigated experimentally and numerically finally a series of cases for different detonation distances with the same charge weight and different charge weights with the same dimensionless distance are investigated meanwhile the effects of the variables on the dynamic response of the hull girder are analyzed 2 experimental arrangement and numerical background 2 1 experimental arrangement as shown in fig 1 the experiment was conducted in a water pool of underwater explosion the floating pontoons beside the hull girder were utilized to keep the hull girder at the right position the charge was placed under the middle of a hull girder shown in fig 1 b in the experiment charge weight is 0 22 kg and detonation distance is 0 7 m fig 2 shows the diagram of the experimental model the length width and depth of the hull girder is 6 3 m 1 m and 0 25 m respectively in addition the thickness of the deck and the transverse bulkhead of the hull girder is 0 004 m the thickness of the side plates and bottom of the hull girder is 0 006 m there are nine cabins in the model which are numbered from c1 to c9 and the length of each cabin is 0 7 m there is a rectangular opening on the deck of each cabin whose size is 0 7 m 0 4 m and the opening is located at the central of the deck in each cabin furthermore there are three t section longitudinal stiffeners in the bottom and the spacing between each stiffener is 0 25 m the panel width of the stiffener is 0 05 m and the thickness is 0 004 m for the web plate of the stiffener the height is 0 07 m and the thickness is 0 006 m the material of the experimental model is q235 steel as shown in fig 3 the arrangement of the strain transducers is illustrated the strain transducers are mainly set along the longitudinal direction of the hull girder in fig 3 b d the detailed arrangement of the strain transducers on deck line at side and side plate line at top is presented the strain transducers numbered 25 27 and 29 are utilized to measure the transverse strain on the plate the others are used to measure the longitudinal strain of the plate 2 2 numerical background the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method combines the advantages of the eulerian analysis and the lagrange method where the eulerian field and lagrangian bodies are allowed to interact in the same model aboshio and ye 2016 simulia 2011 in the cel method the fluid motions are based on traditional eulerian description but the deformation of the hull girder is defined by the traditional lagrangian description the eulerian grid are fixed during numerical calculation process and fluid transfer from one fixed mesh to another in the cel method however the mesh updates in calculation process with deformation of the materials in the ale method although the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method is a typical method used to control element distortion by adaptive meshing problems associated with strongly distorted mesh that are commonly encountered with a lagrangian or ale formulation will lead to some unrealistic results and even break the calculation aboshio and ye 2016 aquelet et al 2006 simulia 2011 according to the work of hsu et al 2014 the code of abaqus explicit can simulate the process of the underwater explosion well therefore the cel method in abaqus explicit code is utilized to calculate interactions between a hull girder and underwater explosion loads in this paper there are many articles such as qiu et al 2011 and aboshio and ye 2016 where the cel method has been explained in detail the underwater explosion process considered as an adiabatic process in this research when charge is detonated shock wave generates and propagates in the flow field in addition secondary pressure pulse will generate in the flow field when bubble reaches its minimum volume cole and weller 1948 in order to calculate propagation of wave in the flow field compressibility of the liquid water should be considered viscosity of water is neglected in traditional investigation on underwater explosion problems however some of the features related to bubble dynamic behaviors may be affected for example the velocity of liquid jet can be affected by viscosity of water according to the work of popinet and zaleski 2002 the jet impact velocity is found to decrease as viscosity increases and above a certain threshold jet impact is impossible therefore in our research the compressibility and viscosity of water is considered in addition the air and explosion products are compressible the compressible navier stokes equations are solved for eulerian materials water air and explosion products 2 2 1 ideal gas equation of state for air in the simulation air is considered as ideal gas and the equation of state used to simulate air is stated as follow 1 p p a ρ r θ θ z where ρ is air density p a is ambient pressure ris gas constant θ is current temperature and θ z is absolute zero on the temperature scale used in the simulation simulia 2011 2 2 2 us up equation of state for water for water a mie grüneisen equation can be used to describe the state of water in which the pressure is assumed as a function of fluid density and the internal energy of unit mass the mie grüneisen equation can be usually written as meyers 1994 simulia 2011 2 p p h γ ρ e m e h wherep h ande h are the hugoniot pressure and specific energy and γ

strain and defined as η 1 ρ 0 ρ the hugoniot pressure p h can be given as a function simulia 2011 4 p h ρ 0 c 0 2 η 1 s η 2 and in that equation there is an assumption that the relationship between the shock velocity u s and particle velocity u p is liner i e u s c 0 s u p meyers 1994 simulia 2011 by substituting the p h and e h in eq 2 the linear u s u p hugoniot form of mie grüneisen equation can be written as simulia 2011 5 p ρ 0 c 0 2 η 1 s η 2 1 γ 0 η 2 γ 0 ρ 0 e m where ρ 0 is a reference density c 0 is speed velocity in the water γ 0 is a material constant s is a constant in the u s u p equation meyers 1994 and e m is internal energy per unit mass there is much information about mie grüneisen equation heuzé 2012 meyers 1994 2 2 3 jwl equation of state for tnt to simulate the detonation products of tnt the jones wilkins lee jwl equation of state is used which was proposed by lee with the previous work of jones and wilkin lee et al 1973 lee and hornig 1969 simulia 2011 the common form of the jwl equation is written as lee et al 1973 simulia 2011 6 p a 1 ω ρ r 1 ρ 0 exp r 1 ρ 0 ρ b 1 ω ρ r 2 ρ 0 exp r 2 ρ 0 ρ ω ρ e m wherea b r 1 r 2and ω are material constant which are defined by experimental results ρ 0 is the density of tnt used in the simulation ρ is density of detonation products and e m is the internal energy per unit mass 2 2 4 material of the hull girder in the simulation the steel q235 is used for the hull girder the density of steel q235 is 7850 kg m3 the young s modulus is 2 1e11pa and poisson s ratio of the steel q235 is 0 3 in addition the strain rate dependent data of q235 steel is used to describe the plastic nature of the steel shown in table 1 3 validation of the numerical method the validation of the numerical method cel is carried out by comparing with the experiment conducted by cui et al 2016 the experiment was conducted in a 2 m 2 m 2 m cubic tank a petn charge with 4 0 g was placed 0 19 m below a horizontal fixed steel plate with 0 8 m length 0 8 m width and 0 02 m thickness the tnt equivalence of the charge is 5 2 g cui et al 2016 and therefore in the simulation a tnt charge with 5 2 g weight is used to replace the petn charge fig 4 gives the comparison of experimental and numerical results of bubble shapes as shown in fig 4 a when the charge is detonated a gas bubble at high temperature and pressure generates cole and weller 1948 the bubble expands because the inner pressure of the bubble is larger than ambient pressure and the bubble shape is spherical firstly shown in fig 4 b with bubble growth the effect of the horizontal plate fixed in the water on the bubble becomes obvious and the upside of the bubble becomes flat shown in fig 4 c at that time the pressure in the bubble decreases until equals to ambient due to the inertia of the outflowing water the bubble continues expanding until the bubble volume reaches to its maximum value where the pressure in the bubble is smaller than that in the ambient cole and weller 1948 after that the bubble begins to collapse and the bubble collapse slower in vertical direction due to existence of the plate shown in fig 4 d and e with bubble collapsing the bubble shape likes an inverted circular cone shown in fig 4 f at that time the pressure at the top of the circular cone like bubble is higher than that at the bottom of the circular cone like bubble which has been illustrated in previous researches kan et al 2005 liu et al 2018a finally due to the difference of pressure and the existence of fixed plate a water jet generates and points to the plate shown in fig 4 g and the rebound of the water jet can be observed in fig 4 h by comparing the evolution of the bubble shapes the numerical results agree well with that observed in the experiment as shown in fig 4 because the charge type used in the numerical simulation is tnt rather than petn and the charge used in simulation is spherical rather than cylindrical the time for the same bubble form between numerical and experimental results is not exactly identical however the comparison still can illustrate that the numerical method used in this paper is reasonable to describe the bubble dynamic near structures 4 overall damage characteristics of the hull girder in the experiment the hull girder has local deformation and global deformation when subjected to underwater explosion the effect of the shock wave on the hull girder is mainly local deformation and in the experiment the charge is not so close enough that the hull girder have a little local damage induced by the shock wave the mainly deformation is induced by the underwater explosion bubble in this section the dynamic response of the hull girder subjected to the underwater explosion of a charge with 0 22 kg weight and the detonation distance of 0 7 m will be discussed in order to obtain more information about the dynamic response of the hull girder the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method is utilized to calculate the interactions between underwater explosion and the hull girder 4 1 experimental results on the overall damage characteristics of the hull girder a high speed camera was utilized to record the motion of the hull girder and the shooting frequency in this experiment is 5000 hz fig 5 gives the experimental results of motion of the hull girder the initial situation of the hull girder is described in fig 5 a and the charge is detonated as bubble growth the hull girder shows the hogging motion firstly in fig 5 b and then as shown in fig 5 c the hull girder returns to its initial shape however the hull girder has a global displacement after the recovery of the hull girder due to the collapse of bubble and inertia the hull girder shows a sagging motion in fig 5 d in the process of the underwater explosion the spike of the free surface becomes higher and higher fig 6 presents the final deformation and the deformation distribution of the hull girder in the experiment as shown in fig 6 a there is a plastic hinge in the middle of the hull girder due to the underwater explosion the longitudinal deformation distribution of the hull girder are shown in fig 6 b according to the experimental results the plastic deformation of the side shell is mainly generated in the middle cabin c5 of the hull girder and the plastic deformation regions of the deck plate are larger than that of side shell furthermore the regions of the deck plates where plastic deformation is generated are mainly the three cabins in the mid hull girder such as c4 c5 and c6 in fig 6 c and d the deformation of the middle cabin c5 are shown because the internal force evolution and the vibration which are induced by high frequency shock wave load and low frequency of the bubble loads are very complicated in the deck plate it is reasonable that the deformation form of the deck plate in each side of the hull girder has a few differences moreover the deformation of the deck plate is larger than that in the side plate shown in fig 6 d which is induced by the different boundary conditions between deck plates and side shells in the experimental model the strain evolutions of the points observed in the experiment will be investigated later fig 7 presents the strain signals obtained in the experiment the strain transducers numbered 20 24 are located in the center line of the bottom plate described in fig 3 as shown in fig 7 a e the regions where the strain transducers 23 and 24 are placed have plastic deformation and other regions are mainly have elastic deformation therefore for the bottom plate of the hull girder plastic deformation mainly occurs at the third cabins in the middle of the hull girder as shown in fig 7 c k l e g and i the final strains of these measure points are approximately 2e 5 1 76e 3 1 5e 5 6e 4 3 2e 3 and 1 57e 3 respectively therefore a conclusion can be drawn that the largest deformation of a transverse section within deck opening is generated in the deck and the deformation of the side shell is larger than that in the bottom plate furthermore as shown in fig 3 a the strain transducers numbered 24 26 and 28 are used to observe the strain along the longitudinal direction and the strain transducers numbered 25 27 and 29 are used to observe the strain along the transverse direction in the middle of the hull girder from the strain evolution in fig 7 e and f the phenomenon that the strains in both figures are in the same order of magnitude indicate the deformation of the bottom plate along the longitudinal and transverse directions are similar when the charge is detonated under the middle of the hull girder in addition the strain along the longitudinal direction is larger than that along the transverse direction and the deck plate enters a plastic state in the deck of the hull girder as shown in fig 7 i and j the transverse plastic strain is larger than the longitudinal plastic strain which indicates that the transverse deformation of the side shell in the middle of the hull girder is larger than that along the longitudinal direction the experimental results including the hull girder motions the final deformation of the hull girder and the strain evolutions of some observation points are discussed above however some phenomena such as underwater explosion bubble motion are difficult to observe and some variables such as bending moments in some sections are difficult to gain in order to get more information numerical simulation results will be further discussed to know more about the dynamic response of the hull girder 4 2 numerical results on the overall damage characteristics of the hull girder according to the viewpoint that after the first bubble pulsing the energy contained in the underwater explosion bubble is less than 15 of the total energy and the critical bending moment of the hull girder usually occurs after the first bubble pulsation zhang and zong 2011 therefore the dynamic response of the hull girder under the first bubble collapse is investigated in the numerical simulation the observation points are renumbered as shown in fig 8 the observation points p1 p5 are located at the middle line of the bottom plate p6 p10 are located at the deck line at side and the points p11 and p15 are placed at bottom plating line at side in the rest parts the new observation point numbers are used for numerical results fig 9 shows the transverse section form of the mid hull girder and the properties of the transverse section are stated in table 2 the area moment of inertia about neutral axis is 8 877e 5m 4 for the deck plates the stress of the deck at the middle of the hull girder will exceed 235mpa when the bending moment value beyond 1 139e5 n m similarly the yield bending moment of the bottom plates is 3 3676e5 n mwhich is larger than that of deck plate the properties of the transverse section indicates that the deformation will be generated in the deck plate firstly fig 10 shows the interactions between the bubble induced by underwater explosion and the hull girder in fig 11 and fig 12 the displacement and bending moment distributions along the longitudinal direction of the hull girder at different time are described the initial relative position between the charge and the hull girder is described in fig 10 a when the charge is detonated the shock wave generated firstly and the explosion products become to a bubble at high temperature and high pressure cole and weller 1948 as time goes on the bubble begins to grow because the pressure in the bubble is larger than ambient pressure and the hull girder shows the hogging motions as shown in fig 10 b the stress in the deck plates is higher than other parts and the high stress regions are mainly located in the middle of the hull girder at that time the displacement of the middle of the hull girder are larger than that in other parts especially displacements of both ends which are almost in a static state moreover the bending moment in the middle of the hull girder is larger than the critical bending moment of the deck plate but the deck plate has little deformation because the stress in deck plates is tensile stress which can strength stability of the deck plates with bubble growth the hogging motion of the hull girder continues fig 10 c and the difference of the displacement at different parts of the hull girder becomes larger shown in fig 11 as shown in fig 10 c the regions of high stress move toward both ends and the bending moment at that regions are larger than that at other parts fig 12 t 16 m s which will accelerate the upward motion of the ends parts of the hull girder after that the bubble continues becoming large and has more effect on the deformation of the hull girder the high stress regions move toward the middle part of the hull girder and the bending moments in the mid hull girder become larger than other parts once more fig 12 t 28 m s which lead to continuously hogging motion of the hull girder shown in fig 10 d at that moment as shown in fig 11 the hull girder has a global motion described at t 28 m s moreover the bubble does not reach its maximum volume but the displacement of the mid hull girder is approximate to its maximum displacement as shown in fig 10 e f and g the bubble expending and reaches its maximum volume there are not obvious high stress regions in the hull girder because the expending velocity of the bubble becomes so weak that it has little influence on the hogging motion of the hull girder due to weakness of bubble expanding and inertia of the hull girder the bending moment differences between different parts become smaller and the bending moments at quarter position of the hull girder are larger than mid hull girder which lead to restoring forces in the hull girder when the hull girder reaches its initial shape the velocity of middle part of the hull girder is smaller than that at the ends due to the inertia of the ends which leads the motion of the ends and the hull girder begins to sag at that time the upward motion velocities of the ends become smaller due to the bending moment generated in the hull girder shown in fig 12 at t 44 m s and t 48 m s after that the bubble begins to collapse meanwhile the hull girder continues sagging with the collapse of the bubble and has a global downward motion shown in fig 10 h and i the direction of bending moment in the hull girder at that period is opposite to the bending moment direction in hogging process and the bending moment in the middle regions of the hull girder is larger than that in other parts shown in fig 12 with bubble collapsing the displacement of the hull girder becomes larger fig 11 t 70 m s t 100 m s but the bending moment in the hull girder is getting smaller fig 12 t 70 m s t 100 m s the reason is that the downward velocity differences of different parts become smaller and the bubble becomes so small that has little effect on the hull girder as shown in fig 11 the displacements of the middle of the hull girder are larger than that in the ends from t 70 m s to t 100 m s and a plastic hinge occurs in the middle of the hull girder finally as shown in fig 10 j there is a water jet which penetrates the explosion bubble and acts on the bottom plate of the hull girder the water jet load leads to local deformation of the hull girder and sharply reduces the downward motion of the middle regions of the hull girder moreover bending moment in the middle of the hull girder is smaller than that in other parts fig 12 t 138 m s in order to learn more about the mechanism of the overall deformation of the hull girder fig 13 gives the bending moment evolutions at different transverse sections of the hull girder as shown in fig 13 the evolution trends of the bending moment at different sections are almost similar and the bending moment at x 3 0 m is smaller than other parts however there are some situations should be paid more attention when the charge is detonated the bending moment direction in the middle region of the hull girder is opposite to other parts and the bending moment magnitudes of middle of the hull girder in that period are larger than the critical bending moment of the deck plate described in table 2 there is a decrease at t 5 m s approximately at section x 0 m at that time there are turning points in other sections such as x 1 2 m x 1 8 m and x 2 4 m the change of the bending moment is consistence with the stress evolution that high stress regions move toward the ends from the middle of the hull girder when all the bending moments are in the same direction the decrease of the bending moment in the middle of the hull girder terminates and the hull girder continues hogging with global displacement moreover the bending moment direction change is reduced by restoring force in the hull girder due to inertia after that the bending moment in the middle parts increase once more and the moment in other parts decrease due to the effect of bubble expanding in the rest time of hogging the bending moment trend evolutions at middle of the hull girder e g x 0 m and x 0 6 m are consistent and the evolutions of others parts are similar concretely when bending moments at x 0 m and x 0 6 m increase bending moments at other sections decrease and when bending moments at x 0 m and x 0 6 m decrease bending moments at other sections increase in addition the bending moments at x 0 6 m x 1 2 m and x 1 8 m are larger than bending moment in middle section at 20 m s furthermore the bending moments in hogging period are larger than the critical bending moment of deck plates especially at x 0 m and x 0 6 m however there is no obvious deformation in the deck of the hull girder the reason is that the stress in the deck plates is tensile stress which can strength the stability of the deck plates the bending moments in the bottom plates are smaller than the critical bending moment in the bottom plates although the bending moment makes no obvious deformation in the hull girder it has great effect on the sagging motion of the hull girder compared to hogging period the bending moment evolutions in sagging period are relatively simple the regulation revealed in the bending moment evolutions is that the larger distance from the middle section x 0 m the smaller bending moment in the hull girder at last the sagging bending moment at middle regions decrease and bending moment at the ends increase due to water jet load the evolution trends mentioned above are consistent with motions of the hull girder and the mechanism of the hull girder motion becomes clear from the bending moment evolutions at different sections 5 effect of detonation distance and charge weight the detonation distance for same charge weight 0 22 kg and the charge weight for same dimensionless detonation distance 0 77 are taken to investigate the effect of parameters on the deformation of a hull girder the nondimensionalization of the dimensionless detonation distance is achieved by dividing the maximum radius of bubble in free field conditions in each case and the buoyancy parameter in different cases is estimated buoyancy parameter is defined as δ ρ g r m δ p 1 2 and δ p p p c wherer m is the maximum radius of bubble in free field with same depth of water ρ is density of the liquid gis gravitational acceleration pis ambient pressure in the fluid at the initial bubble centroid andp c is saturated vapor pressure inside the bubble because the charge weights are not large enough and the detonation distances investigated are not so small the main global deformation of the hull girder is induced by bubble dynamic loads in this paper therefore the effects of bubble loads on the overall damage characteristics of the hull girder are mainly discussed 5 1 effect of detonation distance on the overall damage characteristics of the hull girder cases shown in table 3 are taken to illustrate the effect of detonation distance on the overall damage characteristics of the hull girder the charge weight is 0 22 kg the detonation distance increases from 0 70 m to 1 30 m with the interval of 0 2 m fig 14 gives the deformation of the hull girder and the bubble shape in different cases when the water jet penetrates the bubble as shown in fig 14 the effect of the detonation distance on the dynamic response of the hull girder are very obvious comparing the interactions in the four cases there are two obvious features one is that the deformation of the hull girder decrease with detonation distance increase the other is that the bubble shapes in the process of collapse are different due to the different effect of the hull girder especially when the water jet penetrates the underwater explosion bubble according to the work of brujan et al 2001a and brujan et al 2001b depending on the initial distance between bubble and wall a liquid jet directed towards the wall would generate or the bubble with a mushroom like shape due to radial jet induced by rebound of elastic material can be observed with bubble collapse also the radial jet would lead to bubble splitting and generation of two axial jets flowing in opposing directions the situations investigated in our paper are similar to the case investigated by brujan et al 2001b where material of boundary is stiff therefore due to large elastic module the second pressure gradient induced by elastic boundary rebound is so weak that bubble are not split by radial flow fig 15 presents dynamic behaviors of the bubble in case 3 after a liquid jet penetrates the bubble the bubble begins to expand after the liquid jet penetrates the bubble with the detonation distance increase the effect between the hull girder and the underwater explosion bubble decreases in case 1 there is an obvious plastic hinge in the middle of the hull girder however there is no obvious deformation in case 3 and case 4 in order to learn more about the effect of detonation distance on deformation of the hull girder the local deformation of the hull girder and the displacement of the hull girder are further discussed fig 16 gives the local deformation forms of the middle regions of the hull girder when the hull girder displacement reaches its maximum value in sagging motion period of case 1 4 as shown in fig 16 a large deformation occurs in the deck plates and side shells of the hull girder also the deformation of the deck plates in the adjacent cabins are smaller than that in the middle cabin of the hull girder similar deformation occurs in case 2 but the magnitude of the deformation is smaller than that in case 1 as shown in fig 16 b in case 3 and case 4 the deformation of the deck plates are smaller than the two cases case 1 and 2 and the side shells have little deformation fig 16 c and d the differences of the deformation forms may result in the situation that the stress and strain at the same observation point in different cases have different evolution trends however the local difference have little effect on the global dynamic response of the hull girder fig 17 a gives the global displacement evolutions of the middle of the hull girder in case 1 4 the displacement distributions along the longitudinal direction of the hull girder are shown in fig 17 b when the displacement reaches its extreme values in the process of hogging and sagging in the four cases the evolution trends of the displacement are similar because the bubble dynamic behaviors are similar however the magnitudes of the displacement in different cases are different the increase rate or decrease rate of the displacement increase with decrease of the detonation distance shown in fig 17 a as shown in fig 17 b displacement differences are mainly concentrated on the middle of the hull girder and displacements of both ends have a few differences in the process of hogging in the process of sagging there are plastic hinges in the first two cases case 1 and 2 and the displacement difference of both ends in different cases are obvious table 4 presents the comparison of displacements in different cases δp i is calculated by using the displacement of case 1 as a baseline in the same process the maximum displacement of the mid hull girder in the process of sagging decreases faster than that in the process of hogging with detonation distance increase which indicates that the detonation distance have more influence on the displacement in sagging process as shown in table 5 deformation angles of the hull girder described in fig 17 b in the four cases are stated and δα is calculated by using the angle value of case 1 as a baseline the difference angle between case 1 and case 4 which has little deformation is 14 24 and it is relatively large for the deformation of the hull girder fig 18 gives the bending moment evolutions of middle of the hull girder section in different cases because of the difference in detonation distance the load evolutions acted on the hull girder are difference therefore the bending moments generated in the hull girder have different magnitudes and action times which result in different dynamic response of the hull girder as shown in fig 18 the bending moment evolutions are similar in different cases the moment increases and keeping in a state at relatively high bending moment for a period of time in the process of hogging with bubble collapsing the motion of the hull girder converts to sagging so the bending moment decrease until the direction changed in the sagging motion process the bending moment increase firstly and then decrease due to bubble dynamic behaviors and motion of the hull girder however the phenomenon that bending moment decrease at 10 m s does not occurs in case 3 and case 4 because with detonation distance increase the rebounding motion of the ends parts becomes weaker and the deformation rate becomes smaller table 6 presents the action time in different cases when the bending moment beyond a critical value is described and the variable γ is calculated by using the action time of the bending moment in case 1 as a baseline in the corresponding motion process as shown in table 6 with detonation distance increase the magnitude and action time of the bending moment decrease which reduce the effect of the underwater explosion loads on the hull girder considering the displacement of the middle of the hull girder and the action time when bending moment beyond the critical bending moment the displacement percent reduce to 53 33 from case 1 to case 4 when the action time percent reduce to 33 47 in the hogging process however the displacement percent reduce to 29 24 from case 1 to case 4 when the action time percent reduce to 72 85 in the sagging process the phenomenon indicates the action time of higher bending moment in hogging motion are important to the sagging process in general the action time of critical bending moment have an significant effect on the dynamic response of the hull girder and the bending moment in hogging process have an effect on the response of the hull girder in the sagging process fig 19 presents the comparison of bending moment distributions at different time and the results agree well with the conclusion mentioned above as shown in fig 19 a d because the interactions between the bubble and the hull girder in different cases are difference the bending moment distributions in different cases at the same time are different moreover the differences are obvious in fig 19 d due to water jet load because of the existence of the hull girder the water jet load points toward the bottom plate of the hull girder and acts on the plate directly case 1 case 2 however for longer detonation distance case 3 case 4 the load could not act on the bottom plate directly therefore the hull girder in different conditions has different responses and the rapidly decrease of the bending moment in the mid hull girder in case 1 is reduced by the water jet load as shown in fig 20 principal logarithmic strain evolutions of some observation points in the four cases are compared from the discussion stated above the larger detonation distance the smaller effect on the hull girder the results described in fig 20 are consistence with the conclusion in general the increase rate value and the magnitude of the strain in the observation point p10 in case 2 are larger than that in case 3 which in turn are larger than that in case 4 while both the increase rate value and the magnitude of the strain in case 2 and case 3 are smaller than that in case 1 that situation also can be observed in fig 20 b c and d there are some situations should be illustrated clearly the evolutions of the strain have similar trend in the whole however there are some slight differences in different cases especially for strain in p10 the difference is induced by the different deformation form of the deck plates illustrated in fig 16 another situation should be paid more attention is that the strain in different cases are approximate to each other for parts near the ends of the hull shown in fig 20 c in total the smaller detonation distance the larger strain in structures 5 2 effect of charge weight on the overall damage characteristics of the hull girder the effects of charge weight for same dimensionless detonation distance on the overall damage characteristics of the hull girder will be investigated in this section cases shown in table 7 are taken to illustrate the effect of charge weight on the overall damage characteristics of the hull girder the charge weights in the simulation are from 0 18 kg to 0 26 kg and different detonation distances are used to obtain same initial dimensionless detonation distance in addition the buoyancy parameter in different cases is estimated fig 21 presents the interactions between underwater explosion bubble and the hull girder in case 5 the evolutions of the interactions in other four cases are similar to case 5 the interactions in case 3 are presented in fig 10 when the charge is detonated a bubble generates and expands at the same time the hull girder has hogging motion and the stress in the deck plate are larger than other parts due to the existence of the hull girder and small detonation distance the bubble is influenced and not spherical any more after the bubble reaches its maximum volume the bubble begins to collapse and the hull girder has sagging motions because the bending moment in the hull girder beyond the critical bending moment there is a plastic hinge generated in the middle of the hull girder and the plastic deformation continues with bubble collapsing when the bubble reaches its minimum volume a water jet occurs and acts on the bottom plate of the hull girder from the results a conclusion can be drawn that the bubble dynamic and response of the hull girder are similar for different charge weights with the same initial dimensionless detonation distance in a certain range the deformation of the hull girder and the bubble form evolution in case 1 case 2 case 4 and case 5 when the water jet penetrates the bubble are presented in fig 22 the result of case 3 has been described in section 4 2 the morphological characteristics of the bubble and the hull girder are almost similar global behaviors of the hull girder in different cases investigated above are consistence with each other and plastic hinges generate in the sagging process of the hull girder in order to learn more about the plastic hinge the local plastic deformation in the four cases will be investigated in next part as shown in fig 23 local deformation of the middle regions of the hull girder are presented when displacement of the mid hull girder reaches maximum value in the process of sagging although global behaviors of the hull girder are similar local deformation in different cases have relatively large difference on deformation form of the plate which are marked in fig 23 the difference of the local deformation is induced by vibrations of the plate generated by bubble dynamic loads and response of the hull girder the difference have little influence on the global response of the hull girder but the strain at the same location in different cases may be different fig 24 presents the displacement evolutions of the middle section of the hull girder and displacement distributions along the longitudinal directions of the hull girder as shown in fig 24 a the increase rate reduced by shock wave and bubble expanding increase with charge weight increase when the mid hull girder reaches its maximum displacement in hogging process the hull girder begins to sag after the mid hull girder reaches its maximum displacement in sagging process the hull girder begins to restore its initial shape for different charge weights the period of the bubble pulsation in different cases are different which lead to different action time of the bubble dynamic loads comparisons of the maximum displacements in the five cases in the hogging and sagging process are stated in table 8 and parameters such as p 1 δp 1 p 2 δp 2 are calculated by using the corresponding values of case 3 as a baseline the displacement differences between different cases in the hogging process are larger than that in sagging process furthermore the displacements of case 3 5 in sagging process are close to each other for the plastic hinge angles generated in the cases the difference values between different cases are stated in table 9 and parameter δα is calculated by using the angle in case 3 as a baseline from fig 24 b and table 9 there are plastic hinges in the middle of the hull girder in all cases and the plastic hinge angles are close to each other therefore the hull girder has similar dynamic response for various charge weights with same initial dimensionless detonation distance if the charge weight beyond a critical value which can lead to a situation that a plastic hinge generates in the middle of the hull girder the bending moment evolutions and distributions are presented in fig 25 and fig 26 respectively as shown in fig 25 the evolutions of bending moment in the five cases are consistent except at the moment when the bending moment decrease reduced by water jet load the reason for the difference is that different charge weights make different bubble pulsation periods which result in different water jet acting times the similar evolution of the bending moment in same structures indicates that the interactions between the hull girder and the loads are similar which is consistence with the conclusion mentioned above however bending moment distributions at the specific time moments may be affected by the difference of the bubble pulsation periods as shown in fig 26 the distributions of the bending moment for different cases are similar at t 25 m s and 80 m s fig 26 a and c when t 43 m s fig 26 b the bending moment values in the hull girder are difference obviously because the hull girders in the cases are in a period that hogging motion converts to sagging motion and the time that bubble needed to reach its maximum volume is different due to different charge weights fig 26 d presents the bending moment distributions of the hull girder when the displacement of the hull girder is approximate to its maximum displacement in sagging process the local decrease of the bending moment are reduced by water jet load and the bending moments in other parts are similar in general the influences which are induced by difference in bubble pulsation period and local loads are finite in the conditions investigated in this section fig 27 gives comparisons of the strain evolutions of different observation points in different cases as shown in fig 27 a c the strain in the middle of the hull girder p10 are larger than other parts p8 and p6 which agree well with the results discussed in section 4 2 moreover the magnitudes and evolutions of the strain in the five cases are similar which indicates the deformation generated in the deck plate of the hull girder are similar in addition the strain evolutions shown in fig 27 d indicate that dynamic behaviors are similar in the bottom plate of the hull girder and the strain reduced by water jet load in the five cases is not presented in order to observe the evolutions clearly the difference of strain evolution in p10 between case 1 case 3 and the other cases are caused by the uncertainty of the plate local deformation mentioned above in total the hull girder has similar dynamic behaviors for different charge weights with same dimensionless detonation distance when the charge weight beyond a critical value the dynamic responses of the hull girder for different charge weights with same dimensionless detonation distance have been studied in this section in the cases studied in this subsection the charge weights are in a certain range where underwater explosions can lead to plastic deformation of the hull girder and the dynamic behaviors of the hull girder are similar except for some differences on the magnitude of some variables this phenomenon indicates that it is possible to make serious damage on a structure for small charge weight 6 conclusions this study has investigated the dynamic response of a hull girder model experimentally and numerically based on coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method numerical research has been conducted to avoid expensive and complex experiments and obtain more information which is difficult to obtain in the experiment the validation of the cel method is conducted firstly and the simulation results can capture essential features of underwater explosion with structures which agree well with experimental results in this study an experiment was conducted to study the overall damage mechanism of the hull girder from the pictures captured by a high speed camera and the final damage form of the hull girder the hull girder has hogging motion firstly and then sagging when subjected to underwater explosion and there is a plastic hinge in the middle part of the hull girder meanwhile the deck plates of the hull girder lost their stability and has plastic deformation the parts with free boundaries should be paid more attention which have significant effect on the local and global structural strength especially in the middle of the slender structures in order to learn more about deformation mechanism of the hull girder induced by underwater explosion numerical investigations were conducted the deformation mechanism of the hull girder is discussed in detail by analyzing bending moments and displacements of the hull girder in our research the overall damage of the hull girder is mainly reduced by explosion bubble loads in addition the dynamic response of the hull girder in the process of hogging have significant effect on the overall damage of the hull girder induced by bubble collapse in sagging process due to the effect of structures the water jet points the structure which is different from the situations that bubble collapse near the free surface or under structures whose size is so small that the effect of free surface is dominated the effects of variables such as charge weight and detonation distance on interactions between underwater explosion loads and a hull girder are discussed with detonation distances decrease for same charge weight the motion of a hull girder converts rigid body motion to whipping motion and a plastic hinge generates when the charge weights are in a certain range the deformation features are similar to each other another deformation feature is that the local deformation form for different cases are different due to the bubble dynamic behaviors especially for the deck plates which have free boundaries acknowledgement this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 51779056 
22579,in this paper the bifurcation characteristics and perturbation response in vortex induced vibration of cylinder with two degrees of freedom is investigated aiming to study the law and mechanism of the influence of perturbation on the bifurcation of vortex induced vibration and to give some engineering suggestions the main content of this paper is to observe the variation of the amplitude frequency lift and drag coefficients of the vortex induced vibration response of the cylinder after suddenly perturbing the cylinder displacement to investigate the influence of displacement perturbations on bifurcation characteristics then through vorticity map analysis the mechanism is further analyzed from the point of view of flow field the results show that when the displacement perturbation is applied the motion state of the cylinder will change which will cause the change of the shedding mode and the wake mode of the vortex resulting in the instability of the flow field then under the coupling action of disturbed flow field and cylinder motion the flow field and the vibration state of the cylinder finally stabilize to the corresponding state of the upper branch or the lower branch depending on the direction and magnitude of the perturbation it can be concluded that in the velocity range near the branch jump points upper and lower branches the cylinder s vortex induced vibration may have two relatively stable states and can be transformed to each other under appropriate excitation of perturbations finally some suggestions are given based on the above results keywords vortex induced vibration viv bifurcation perturbation 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv continues to receive much attention due to its frequent occurrence in marine engineering practice from an engineering perspective a practical and reliable forecast method is required for the economic and safe design of such structures for estimating the amplitudes frequencies and forces in the in line and transverse directions as well as the vortices shedding from these structures kang et al 2017a numerical simulation is one of the most commonly used methods to forecast the vortex induced vibration although gigantic progress using direct numerical simulation dns and large eddy simulations les has already been achieved in numerical simulation of unsteady separated flows at low reynolds number dong and karniadakis 2005 prsic et al 2016 the application as tools for engineering predictions has been restricted due to the high cost inherent in being limited by the necessity to use very fine grids and small size of time steps to simulate a significant portion of the turbulence energy spectrum sagaut and deck 2014 rans is still considered to be the practical approach for engineering problem however previous studies have shown that reynolds averaging method often fails to obtain satisfactory prediction results of cylinder s vortex induced vibration celik and shaffer 1995 calculated the long time averaged flow past a circular cylinder using the standard k ε model and got poor agreement with experimental data franke franke and rodi 1993 simulated the vortex shedding flow past a square cylinder at re 22000 with the k ε eddy viscocity model and a reynolds stress equation model he found that vortex shedding was ultimately suppressed and a steady state solution obtained instead atlar ünal et al 2010 evaluated four well known rans based turbulence models on the computation of the near wake flow of a circular cylinder pointed out that sst turbulence model appears to be rather encouraging to produce more realistic results but till not satisfying enough stringer stringer et al 2014 also reported poor agreement with circular cylinder data when using sst turbulence model numerical simulation results of vortex induced vibration seem to be worse according to jauvtis and williamson s experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 when the mass ratio is 2 6 the maximum transverse amplitude of the cylinder reaches 1 5d which has been seldom captured in numerical simulation pan pan et al 2007 failed to capture the upper branch in simulating the response of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder at low mass damping constrained to oscillate transversely to a free stream with the sst k ω turbulence model similarly the upper branch is also not observed in sanchis report sanchis et al 2008 srinil srinil et al 2013 carried out an experimental and numerical investigation of a two degree of freedom viv of a flexibly mounted circular cylinder with variable in line to cross flow natural frequency ratio and the lateral amplitude of the numerical simulation is obviously smaller than the experimental value it is usually considered that the error of the reynolds mean method is derived from the reynolds stress term in reynolds averaging method it is necessary to assume the reynolds stress but the reynolds stress is closely related to large scale fluctuations and the characteristics of large scale fluctuations are closely related to the boundary strips of the flow field therefore there is no universal reynolds stress closure mode in other words no unified closure mode can be suitable for all complex flows orszag 1977 medic 1999 found that the standard turbulence closure has shortcomings in the prediction of unsteady separated flows due to their origins in the use of dissipative discretization schemes which leads to numerical diffusion errors that are sufficiently large as to suppress the vortex shedding process aiming at the shortcomings of the reynolds average method many scholars have put forward some improved schemes for example younis younis and przulj 2006 pointed out that turbulence model should take into account the effects of the interactions between the large scale organized periodicity of the mean flow and the random small scale high frequency motions that characterize turbulence which is reflected in none of the standard form of rans based turbulence models in the previous study the author also improved the rans based sst turbulence model according to the characteristics of vortex induced vibration of a cylinder under subcritical reynolds number kang et al 2017b however although these improved schemes can improve the accuracy of numerical simulation of vortex induced vibration to a certain extent they are still not able to predict the response of vortex induced vibration accurately enough especially in the velocity intervals near the branch jump points that is the vibration state in numerical simulation always jump prematurely from the upper branch to the lower branch according to the above review for the numerical simulation of cylinder s vortex induced vibration by reynolds averaging method errors are mainly reflected in the inaccurate capture of branch jump points as we know as a numerical simulation method reynolds average method inevitably has some calculation errors which cannot be eliminated completely no matter how the turbulence model is improved the effects of these errors in other regions are within acceptable limits but are particularly significant near branch jump points previous studies have shown that the response of vortex induced vibration with low mass damping ratio has strong bifurcation characteristics near branch jump points and it is well known that two branches can be reached by different initial conditions i e accelerating or decelerating the flow velocity till the final value hysteresis phenomenon jauvtis and williamson 2004 kang et al 2016 2017b since two branches can be reached by different initial velocity conditions other boundary conditions or disturbances may also have similar effects i e some computational errors unavoidable in the numerical simulation process may also cause bifurcation of viv response near the branch jump point which has seldom been studied at present therefore the main purpose of this paper is to study the bifurcation characteristics of vortex induced vibration of cylinders under the influence of other parameters other than initial velocity conditions especially under perturbation excitation 2

surface on the right exit boundary the hydrostatic pressure is set to 0 the inflow velocity is controlled by self script the rest are symmetric boundaries the numerical simulation in this paper is

branches can be reached by different initial conditions i e accelerating or decelerating the flow velocity till the final value in this chapter hysteresis in vortex induced vibration is studied providing a basis for the research in the follow up chapters 4 1 numerical simulation condition in this numerical simulation the basic parameters of the cylinder agree with jauvtis willamson s experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 the specific parameters are set as follows the diameter d 0 0381m mass ratio m 2 6 the damping ratio ξ 0 05 mass damping ratio m ξ 0 013 and the natural frequency f n 0 4 hz both for the in line and cross flow motions the range of inflow reduced velocity is u r 2 14 re 1161 8129 during the numerical simulation the diameter of the cylinder remains constant and the reynolds number changes with inflow velocity according to the experimental conditions in order to study the hysteresis phenomenon the following two inlet velocity loading forms are adopted in this paper a acceleration condition b deceleration condition the details are as follows a acceleration condition the reduced velocity of the inlet velocity keeps increasing uniformly from 0 with the dimensionless acceleration is a 0 015 until the inlet velocity reaches the target value then the inlet velocity remains constant and lasts for about 20 vibration periods b deceleration condition the reduced velocity of the inlet velocity keeps decreasing uniformly from 16 with the dimensionless acceleration is a 0 015 until the inlet velocity reaches the target value then the inlet velocity remains constant and lasts for about 20 vibration periods for the vortex induced vibration of a cylinder with low mass damping ratio the hysteresis characteristics are mainly reflected in the response curves of amplitude and frequency therefore this chapter mainly focuses on the analysis of the cylinder s amplitude and frequency responses under different inlet velocity loading forms 5 results and analysis the schematic diagram of typical wake modes is shown in fig 2 and the response of maximum transverse amplitudes and the typical wake modes versus reduced velocity are shown in fig 3 referring to the velocity range taken in the experiment the range of reduced velocity is u r 2 14 re 1161 8129 under acceleration and deceleration inlet velocity loading conditions in the numerical simulation and the data of stable stage are taken for analysis the corresponding experimental results are also plotted for comparison notice that in the wake mode diagram in fig 3 the experimental results are shown above and the numerical simulation results are shown below the notations 1 2 and 3 in the figure represent three wake vortices released in each half cycle of the 2t wake model williamson and jauvtis 2004 as shown in fig 3 the maximum transverse amplitude curves have obvious branching and hysteresis phenomena under different inlet velocity loading conditions there is a sudden jump between upper branch and lower branch in acceleration condition the jumping point from upper branch to lower branch is about u r 7 and the corresponding maximum amplitude is about 1 4d the amplitude response curve in the deceleration condition is not returned along the trajectory in acceleration condition in this condition the jumping point appears near u r 5 8 and the maximum transverse amplitude is about 1 1d observe the wake mode in fig 3 when the inlet velocity is small two vortices are generated in each oscillation period and fall off the cylinder alternately showing the wake pattern of 2s mode with the increase of u r when the vibration response reaches the top of the upper branch the 2t wake mode is successfully captured in the numerical simulation at this point in each period there are two pairs of vortices behind the cylinder and each pair consists of three vortices as indicated in the diagram and the rotation direction of the vortices is not the same in the lower branch it can be clearly observed that in each period two vortex pairs are formed behind the cylinder in each vortex pair the two vortices rotate in opposite directions and extend longer than the 2s mode which corresponds to the 2p mode the reynolds averaged method successfully captured the typical wake mode in three branches which is consistent with experiments however although the numerical simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results on the whole there are relatively large errors in the prediction of the velocity corresponding to the jump points between the upper branch and the lower branch in these two conditions leading to a large error in the numerical results of amplitude in the velocity range near the maximum amplitude the main frequency of the transverse vibration of the cylinder is shown in fig 4 under acceleration and deceleration inlet velocity loading conditions as shown in fig 4 there are obvious branches in the frequency response which correspond to the branches in the amplitude response in the initial branch the vibration frequency increases with the increase of velocity in the upper branch the vibration frequency is locked near the natural frequency in the lower branch the vibration frequency ratio of the cylinder is stable at about 1 2 when u r is greater than 13 the vibration frequency suddenly jumps out of the locked region and approaches the vortex release frequency of the stationary cylinder f st the above hysteresis analysis proves that two branches can be reached by different initial velocity conditions i e accelerating or decelerating the flow velocity till the final value however there are some errors in the prediction of the branch jump point in numerical simulation it is known that as a numerical simulation method reynolds average method inevitably has calculation errors which cannot be eliminated completely no matter how the turbulence model is improved the effects of these errors in other regions are within acceptable limits but are particularly significant near bifurcation points indicating that near the bifurcation point the bifurcation property of vortex induced vibration is sensitive to boundary conditions 6 bifurcation under perturbation according to the analysis of the previous chapter the relatively large error of numerical simulation near the branch jump points may be related to the sensitivity of the bifurcation property of vortex induced vibration to boundary conditions in addition to different velocity loading forms other boundary conditions may also affect the bifurcation of vortex induced vibration which has rarely been studied in existing literatures considering that the flow field and boundary conditions are mostly in the ideal case in numerical simulation while disturbing factors inevitably exist in practical engineering in order to study whether the disturbing factors may affect the bifurcation of vortex induced vibration in this chapter sudden perturbations are applied to the cylinder in stable vibration state and the follow up responses are observed the specific form of the perturbation is to impose a pulse displacement to the cylinder and the specific process is as follows 1 choose a certain time point in the stable vibration stage and apply a pulse displacement to the cylinder it should be noted that the stable stage here means calculating until stable according to the inflow velocity loading forms introduced in section 4 1 calculation conditions in hysteresis analysis 2 taking the time point at which the pulse displacement is applied as the initial time keeping other parameters unchanged and continue to calculate until stable again the pulse displacement is represented by δ and the range of which in this paper is 0 2d δ 0 2d where represents the direction of the applied pulse displacement in the same direction as the original motion direction of the cylinder and represents the direction of the applied pulse displacement in the opposite direction 6 1 perturbation response in acceleration inlet velocity loading condition in this section the perturbation responses under typical working conditions are investigated by analyzing the vibration frequency and time history curves of lift resistance and displacement firstly the perturbation response under acceleration inlet velocity loading condition is analyzed take the typical working condition of u r 6 5 corresponding to the transition stage between upper and lower branches as an example the vibration frequency and time history curves of lift coefficient drag coefficient and displacement response after perturbations are shown in fig 5 fig 5 a shows the drag lift coefficient and amplitude response when the reduced velocity reaches about u r 6 5 in regular acceleration inlet velocity loading condition without perturbations fig 5 b e are time history curves of lift coefficient drag coefficient and displacement response after the perturbation is applied in these figures the 0 moment is the time when the pulse displacement is applied in addition the frequency response represents the vibration frequency of the cylinder at the steady stage after the perturbation is applied where f is the frequency ratio which represents the ratio of transverse vibration frequency to the natural frequency fig 5 a shows that with the increase of the inlet velocity the lift coefficient drag coefficient and amplitude response increase suddenly when the reduction velocity reaches about 5 indicating that the vibration state reaches the upper branch when u r 6 5 it is still in the upper branch and the maximum amplitude is about 1 2d at this time the frequency ratio of the cylinder in stable stage is about 1 close to the natural frequency which is in line with the characteristics of the frequency response in upper branch corresponding to the amplitude and frequency responses shown in figs 3 and 4 fig 5 b shows the response with the perturbation δ 0 1d after the perturbation is applied at the beginning the lift coefficient the drag coefficient and the maximum amplitude all increased slightly and the maximum amplitude increased to about 1 3d however then the amplitude decreased rapidly after about t 20 the lift coefficient the drag coefficient and the amplitude response return to the initial value and the final vibration frequency remains unchanged fig 5 c shows the response with the perturbation δ 0 1d at beginning the lift coefficient the drag coefficient and the maximum amplitude attenuate slightly the maximum amplitude decreases to about 1 1 d but then increase rapidly after about t 20 the lift coefficient the drag coefficient and the amplitude return to the initial value and the final vibration frequency is also remained unchanged fig 5 d and fig 5 e show the responses with larger perturbations when the perturbation δ 0 2d the lift coefficient drag coefficient and amplitude increase significantly at beginning and the maximum amplitude reaches about 1 4d after that a large attenuation occurs when the vibration state reaches stable the maximum amplitude is only about 0 8d less than the initial value the displacement curve shows that the phase between the lift and the displacement changes rapidly from in phase to opposite phase after perturbations at this time the lift force hinders the displacement and restrains the amplitude in addition the frequency ratio changes from about 1 to 1 25 which is consistent with the characteristics of the lower branch when the perturbation δ 0 2d the amplitude decreases at beginning then the phase between the lift and displacement also changes from in phase to opposite phase finally the amplitude stabilizes at about 0 8d and the final frequency ratio is about 1 25 it is indicated that after applying the perturbations of δ 0 2d or δ 0 2d the cylinder s vibration response will jump from the upper branch to the lower branch 6 2 perturbation response in deceleration inlet velocity loading condition similar with the analysis method used above the perturbation responses in deceleration inlet velocity loading conditions are analyzed in this section take the typical working condition of u r 6 corresponding to the transition stage between upper and lower branches as an example the lift coefficient drag coefficient displacement time history curves and vibration frequency responses after applied with perturbations are shown in fig 6 fig 6 a shows the drag lift coefficient and amplitude responses when the reduction velocity reaches about u r 6 in deceleration inlet velocity loading condition without perturbations as can be seen from fig 6 a when the reduced velocity of the flow field is near u r 6 the amplitude is small the phase between lift force and displacement are opposite and the frequency ratio is about 1 25 which is consistent with the characteristics of the lower branch as shown in fig 6 b and fig 6 c when the perturbation δ 0 05d or δ 0 05d the perturbation displacement is relatively small at this time the lift coefficient drag coefficient and displacement response do not change significantly and quickly return to the initial value after a short time fluctuation the final frequency of vibration has not changed either when the perturbation is larger the perturbation responses are obviously different and is related to the direction of perturbations fig 6 d and fig 6 e show that when δ 0 1d the lift coefficient drag coefficient and amplitude increase rapidly in the first vibration period after the perturbation is applied but the phase between lift force and displacement does not change neither does the vibration frequency then the vibration response quickly returns to the initial state however when δ 0 1d the lift coefficient drag coefficient and amplitude decrease slightly at beginning but the phase between the lift and displacement quickly changes from opposite phase to in phase then the lift force promotes the vibration and then makes the amplitude increase at this time the maximum amplitude in the final stable stage is about 1 1d and the final frequency ratio changes from about 1 25 to 1 locked in natural frequency indicating that the vibration response changes from the lower branch to the upper branch using the same method to analyze the perturbation responses in the velocity range u r 0 14 it can be found that within the range of about u r 5 5 6 1 in deceleration inlet velocity loading conditions and 6 3 7 in acceleration inlet velocity loading conditions the vibration state of the cylinder s vortex induced vibration may jump between the upper branch and the lower branch under appropriate excitation of perturbations and the bifurcation characteristics are more obvious near the branch jump points in other velocity ranges the perturbations applied in this paper will not change the cylinder s final vibration state combining with fig 3 the velocity interval in which the perturbation applied by the method in this paper can affect the bifurcation of the cylinder s vortex induced vibration is shown in fig 7 as can be seen from fig 7 that the velocity range in which the state mutation may occur within the form and magnitude of perturbations applied in this paper is about u r 5 5 6 1 and 6 3 7 which belongs to the velocity interval corresponding to the crossing area between upper and lower branches it can be inferred that in the crossing area between upper and lower branches the cylinder s vortex induced vibration may have two relatively stable states and can be transformed to each other under appropriate excitation of perturbations 6 3 analysis of wake field vorticity map from the analysis in the previous section it can be concluded that near the branch jump points the displacement perturbations may make the vibration state of the cylinder jump between branches in this section in order to further study the mechanism the vorticity map of wake field is analyzed in which the contour levels represent the value of vorticity 6 3 1 upper branch to lower branch in the case of u r 6 5 in acceleration inlet velocity loading condition as shown in fig 5 the vibration state of the cylinder jumps from the upper branch to the lower branch after the perturbation of δ 0 2d is applied in order to study the variation of wake field after perturbation u r 6 5 is selected as a typical working condition and the relevant vorticity maps are analyzed fig 8 is a vorticity map for perturbation δ 0 2d the displacement perturbation is in the same direction of the original motion trend the first frame shows the vorticity map when the displacement perturbation is applied which reflects the initial flow field information before the perturbation and the subsequent frames show the vorticity maps after the perturbation is applied the time interval is 0 5s δt 1 3 before the perturbation is applied as shown in the first frame t 0 in fig 8 1 6 vortices shed alternately the intensity of 2 blue vortex is relatively small and is not obvious in the frame in one cycle and the wake mode appears as 2t mode then a large displacement occurs along the original motion trend after the perturbation is applied which promotes the vortex shedding therefore in the next cycle t 2 6 6 5 the 1 vortex corresponding to 1 3 vortices in the first cycle no longer shed separately as 1 3 vortices in the first cycle but sheds as one vortex 1 at this time the lower side flow field shows the feature of 2s mode while the upper side flow field still shows the feature of 2t mode which is unstable then under the coupling action of disturbed flow field and cylinder motion in the next few cycles t 6 5 11 7 four vortices 1 4 shed alternately the wake mode is between 2s and 2p modes and the feature of the 2p mode becomes gradually obvious until t 13 0 the wake mode presents to be a standard 2p mode see 1 4 vortices at t 13 0 18 2 thereafter the flow field remains stable meanwhile in the process of the above changes in the flow field the vibration state of the cylinder changes from upper branch to lower branch and finally remains stable in the new vibration state fig 9 is a vorticity map for perturbation δ 0 2d the displacement perturbation is opposite to the original motion trend the first frame shows the vorticity map when the perturbation is applied which reflects the flow field information before the perturbation and the subsequent frames show the flow field vorticity maps after the perturbation is applied the time interval is 0 5s δt 1 3 as shown in the first frame t 0 in fig 9 before the perturbation is applied 1 6 vortices shed alternately the intensity of 2 blue vortex is relatively small and is not obvious in the frame in one cycle and the wake mode appears as 2t mode then the amplitude of the cylinder is suppressed after the perturbation opposite to the original motion trend is applied which suppresses the vortex shedding therefore in the next cycle t 2 6 6 5 only four vortices 1 4 shed alternately and the wake field shows the feature of 2p mode nevertheless compared with the typical 2p wake the intensity of vortices 1 and 3 is too small therefore the 2p wake at this stage is unstable and changes to 2s soon at t 7 8 10 4 in which two vortices 1 and 2 shed alternately in one cycle but at this velocity u r 6 5 the 2s mode cannot exist stably then under the coupling action of disturbed flow field and cylinder motion in the next few cycles t 10 4 16 9 the wake vortex mode begins to change from 2s to 2p gradually until t 18 2 the wake mode is completely changed to standard 2p mode see 1 4 vortices at t 18 2 20 8 thereafter the flow field remains stable meanwhile in the process of the above changes in the flow field the vibration state of the cylinder changes from upper branch to lower branch and finally remains stable in the new vibration state 6 3 2 lower branch to upper branch as shown in fig 6 in the deceleration inlet velocity loading condition with u r 6 the vibration response will change from the lower branch to the upper branch after applying the perturbations of δ 0 1d while the vibration response will not change when applying the perturbations of δ 0 1d in order to study the variation of wake field after perturbation u r 6 is selected as a typical working condition and the relevant vorticity maps are analyzed fig 10 is a vorticity map for perturbation δ 0 1d the displacement perturbation is in the same direction as the original motion trend the first frame shows the vorticity map when the displacement perturbation is applied which reflects the flow field information before the perturbation and the subsequent frames show the flow field vorticity maps after the perturbations after the perturbation is applied the time interval is 0 4s δt 0 96 as shown in the first frame t 0 in fig 10 before the perturbation is applied 1 4 vortices shed alternately the intensity of 2 blue vortex is relatively small and is not obvious in the frame in one cycle and the wake mode appears as 2p mode then a large displacement occurs along the original motion trend after the perturbation is applied which promotes the vortex shedding leading to the intensity of 2 vortex in the next cycle being a little larger than that of 2 vortex in the first cycle comparing the frames at t 0 and t 4 8 however the variation of 2 vortex intensity does not change the wake mode nor does it have a great influence on the flow field finally under the coupling action of disturbed flow field and cylinder motion the flow field state and the vibration state of the cylinder return to the initial condition fig 11 is a vorticity map for perturbation δ 0 1d the displacement perturbations is opposite to the original motion trend the first frame shows the vorticity map when the displacement perturbation is applied which reflects the flow field information before the perturbation and the subsequent frames show the vorticity maps after the perturbation is applied the time interval is 0 4s δt 0 96 as shown in the first frame t 0 in fig 11 before the perturbation is applied 1 4 vortices shed alternately the intensity of 2 blue vortex is relatively small and is not obvious in the frame in one cycle and the wake mode appears as 2p mode then the perturbation opposite to the original motion trend is applied which is greater than the critical value and changed the motion direction of the cylinder as a result in the subsequent cycle three vortices 3 5 vortices shed into the upper side flow field as shown in the frame at t 5 76 and t 6 72 at this time the flow field on the upper side shows the feature of the 2t mode see 3 5 vortices shown in the frame at t 5 76 while the flow field on the lower side shows the feature of the 2p mode see 1 and 2 vortices shown in the frame at t 5 76 in which the intensity of 2 blue vortex is relatively small and is not obvious in the frame in this case the flow field is unstable so that under the coupling action of disturbed flow field and cylinder motion in the next few cycles t 6 72 10 56 the features of the 2t model are becoming more and more obvious until t 11 52 the wake mode is completely changed to standard 2t mode see 1 6 vortices at t 8 64 11 52 thereafter the flow field remains stable meanwhile in the process of the above changes in the flow field the vibration state of the cylinder changes from lower branch to upper branch and finally remains stable 6 3 3 comprehensive analysis from the above analysis it can be concluded that in the velocity interval corresponding to the crossing area between upper and lower branches the vortex induced vibration state of the cylinder may jump between the upper and lower branches under the appropriate perturbations when the displacement perturbation is applied the motion state of the cylinder will change which will cause the change of the shedding mode and the wake mode of the vortex resulting in the instability of the flow field then under the coupling action of disturbed flow field and cylinder motion the flow field and the vibration state of the cylinder finally stabilize to the corresponding state of the upper branch or the lower branch depending on the direction and magnitude of the perturbation 7 conclusion in this paper the bifurcation characteristics in vortex induced vibration of cylinder with low mass damping ratio is studied by numerical simulation sudden perturbations are applied to the cylinder in stable vibration state and the follow up responses are analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 in the velocity range near the branch jump points upper and lower branches the cylinder s vortex induced vibration may have two relatively stable states and can be transformed to each other under appropriate excitation of perturbations 2 from the point of view of flow field when the displacement perturbation is applied the motion state of the cylinder will change which will cause the change of the shedding mode and the wake mode of the vortex resulting in the instability of the flow field then under the coupling action of disturbed flow field and cylinder motion the flow field and the vibration state of the cylinder finally stabilize to the corresponding state of the upper branch or the lower branch depending on the direction and magnitude of the perturbation based on the above results the following suggestions are given firstly the sensitivity of the bifurcation characteristic to the boundary conditions near the branch jump points may lead to a certain degree of uncertainty in predicting the maximum amplitude of cylinder s vortex induced vibration thus in order to capture the maximum amplitude that may occur in real situations multiple boundary conditions and appropriate perturbations are suggested to be applied in numerical simulation or experiment and repeated experiments are also suggested secondly a new idea for suppressing vortex induced vibration is proposed appropriate perturbations are likely to drive the cylinder s vortex induced vibration state jump from the upper branch to the lower branch therefore in order to suppress the vortex induced vibration of cylindrical structures in marine engineering appropriate perturbations can be applied to the structure when it produces a large amplitude acknowledgements this work was jointly supported by the national natural science foundation of china project no 5160090381 and the

22579,in this paper the bifurcation characteristics and perturbation response in vortex induced vibration of cylinder with two degrees of freedom is investigated aiming to study the law and mechanism of the influence of perturbation on the bifurcation of vortex induced vibration and to give some engineering suggestions the main content of this paper is to observe the variation of the amplitude frequency lift and drag coefficients of the vortex induced vibration response of the cylinder after suddenly perturbing the cylinder displacement to investigate the influence of displacement perturbations on bifurcation characteristics then through vorticity map analysis the mechanism is further analyzed from the point of view of flow field the results show that when the displacement perturbation is applied the motion state of the cylinder will change which will cause the change of the shedding mode and the wake mode of the vortex resulting in the instability of the flow field then under the coupling action of disturbed flow field and cylinder motion the flow field and the vibration state of the cylinder finally stabilize to the corresponding state of the upper branch or the lower branch depending on the direction and magnitude of the perturbation it can be concluded that in the velocity range near the branch jump points upper and lower branches the cylinder s vortex induced vibration may have two relatively stable states and can be transformed to each other under appropriate excitation of perturbations finally some suggestions are given based on the above results keywords vortex induced vibration viv bifurcation perturbation 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv continues to receive much attention due to its frequent occurrence in marine engineering practice from an engineering perspective a practical and reliable forecast method is required for the economic and safe design of such structures for estimating the amplitudes frequencies and forces in the in line and transverse directions as well as the vortices shedding from these structures kang et al 2017a numerical simulation is one of the most commonly used methods to forecast the vortex induced vibration although gigantic progress using direct numerical simulation dns and large eddy simulations les has already been achieved in numerical simulation of unsteady separated flows at low reynolds number dong and karniadakis 2005 prsic et al 2016 the application as tools for engineering predictions has been restricted due to the high cost inherent in being limited by the necessity to use very fine grids and small size of time steps to simulate a significant portion of the turbulence energy spectrum sagaut and deck 2014 rans is still considered to be the practical approach for engineering problem however previous studies have shown that reynolds averaging method often fails to obtain satisfactory prediction results of cylinder s vortex induced vibration celik and shaffer 1995 calculated the long time averaged flow past a circular cylinder using the standard k ε model and got poor agreement with experimental data franke franke and rodi 1993 simulated the vortex shedding flow past a square cylinder at re 22000 with the k ε eddy viscocity model and a reynolds stress equation model he found that vortex shedding was ultimately suppressed and a steady state solution obtained instead atlar ünal et al 2010 evaluated four well known rans based turbulence models on the computation of the near wake flow of a circular cylinder pointed out that sst turbulence model appears to be rather encouraging to produce more realistic results but till not satisfying enough stringer stringer et al 2014 also reported poor agreement with circular cylinder data when using sst turbulence model numerical simulation results of vortex induced vibration seem to be worse according to jauvtis and williamson s experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 when the mass ratio is 2 6 the maximum transverse amplitude of the cylinder reaches 1 5d which has been seldom captured in numerical simulation pan pan et al 2007 failed to capture the upper branch in simulating the response of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder at low mass damping constrained to oscillate transversely to a free stream with the sst k ω turbulence model similarly the upper branch is also not observed in sanchis report sanchis et al 2008 srinil srinil et al 2013 carried out an experimental and numerical investigation of a two degree of freedom viv of a flexibly mounted circular cylinder with variable in line to cross flow natural frequency ratio and the lateral amplitude of the numerical simulation is obviously smaller than the experimental value it is usually considered that the error of the reynolds mean method is derived from the reynolds stress term in reynolds averaging method it is necessary to assume the reynolds stress but the reynolds stress is closely related to large scale fluctuations and the characteristics of large scale fluctuations are closely related to the boundary strips of the flow field therefore there is no universal reynolds stress closure mode in other words no unified closure mode can be suitable for all complex flows orszag 1977 medic 1999 found that the standard turbulence closure has shortcomings in the prediction of unsteady separated flows due to their origins in the use of dissipative discretization schemes which leads to numerical diffusion errors that are sufficiently large as to suppress the vortex shedding process aiming at the shortcomings of the reynolds average method many scholars have put forward some improved schemes for example younis younis and przulj 2006 pointed out that turbulence model should take into account the effects of the interactions between the large scale organized periodicity of the mean flow and the random small scale high frequency motions that characterize turbulence which is reflected in none of the standard form of rans based turbulence models in the previous study the author also improved the rans based sst turbulence model according to the characteristics of vortex induced vibration of a cylinder under subcritical reynolds number kang et al 2017b however although these improved schemes can improve the accuracy of numerical simulation of vortex induced vibration to a certain extent they are still not able to predict the response of vortex induced vibration accurately enough especially in the velocity intervals near the branch jump points that is the vibration state in numerical simulation always jump prematurely from the upper branch to the lower branch according to the above review for the numerical simulation of cylinder s vortex induced vibration by reynolds averaging method errors are mainly reflected in the inaccurate capture of branch jump points as we know as a numerical simulation method reynolds average method inevitably has some calculation errors which cannot be eliminated completely no matter how the turbulence model is improved the effects of these errors in other regions are within acceptable limits but are particularly significant near branch jump points previous studies have shown that the response of vortex induced vibration with low mass damping ratio has strong bifurcation characteristics near branch jump points and it is well known that two branches can be reached by different initial conditions i e accelerating or decelerating the flow velocity till the final value hysteresis phenomenon jauvtis and williamson 2004 kang et al 2016 2017b since two branches can be reached by different initial velocity conditions other boundary conditions or disturbances may also have similar effects i e some computational errors unavoidable in the numerical simulation process may also cause bifurcation of viv response near the branch jump point which has seldom been studied at present therefore the main purpose of this paper is to study the bifurcation characteristics of vortex induced vibration of cylinders under the influence of other parameters other than initial velocity conditions especially under perturbation excitation 2

direction of the cylinder range of computational domain according to jauvtis willamson s experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 set d 0 0381m the range of computational domain is 12d x 25d 12d y 12d and 0 z 0 1d grid division the o type grids are generated around the cylinder which is set as the overset grid as well hexahedral grids are generated in other areas the thickness of the first layer on the surface of the cylinder is adjusted with the inflow velocity to insure y 1 blazek 2005 in order to adapt to different flow velocities three sets of grids are used the details of the girds are shown in table 1 grid independence has been considered in the following way some typical working conditions are calculated with these three sets of grids and the results are same time step the time step is determined according to the courant number venkatachari et al 2008 which can be expressed as 20 c o u r a n t n u m b e r u δ t δ x where u is the flow velocity δ t is the time step δ x is the grid size in the numerical simulation the time step is adjusted according to u to ensure the maximum courant number is about 0 2 boundary conditions the no slip condition is employed on the cylinder surface on the right exit boundary the hydrostatic pressure is set to 0 the inflow velocity is controlled by self script the rest are symmetric boundaries the numerical simulation in this paper is based on openfoam the discrete methods are adopted as follows time terms are discretized by two order backward implicit euler scheme convection terms are discretized by using linear difference tvd scheme diffusion terms are discretized by gauss linear conservation scheme the solving method is pimple 4 hysteresis analysis hysteresis is a well known phenomenon in vortex induced vibration two branches can be reached by different initial conditions i e accelerating or decelerating the flow velocity till the final value in this chapter hysteresis in vortex induced vibration is studied providing a basis for the research in the follow up chapters 4 1 numerical simulation condition in this numerical simulation the basic parameters of the cylinder agree with jauvtis willamson s experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 the specific parameters are set as follows the diameter d 0 0381m mass ratio m 2 6 the damping ratio ξ 0 05 mass damping ratio m ξ 0 013 and the natural frequency f n 0 4 hz both for the in line and cross flow motions the range of inflow reduced velocity is u r 2 14 re 1161 8129 during the numerical simulation the diameter of the cylinder remains constant and the reynolds number changes with inflow velocity according to the experimental conditions in order to study the hysteresis phenomenon the following two inlet velocity loading forms are adopted in this paper a acceleration condition b deceleration condition the details are as follows a acceleration condition the reduced velocity of the inlet velocity keeps increasing uniformly from 0 with the dimensionless acceleration is a 0 015 until the inlet velocity reaches the target value then the inlet velocity remains constant and lasts for about 20 vibration periods b deceleration condition the reduced velocity of the inlet velocity keeps decreasing uniformly from 16 with the dimensionless acceleration is a 0 015 until the inlet velocity reaches the target value then the inlet velocity remains constant and lasts for about 20 vibration periods for the vortex induced vibration of a cylinder with low mass damping ratio the hysteresis characteristics are mainly reflected in the response curves of amplitude and frequency therefore this chapter mainly focuses on the analysis of the cylinder s amplitude and frequency responses under different inlet velocity loading forms 5 results and analysis the schematic diagram of typical wake modes is shown in fig 2 and the response of maximum transverse amplitudes and the typical wake modes versus reduced velocity are shown in fig 3 referring to the velocity range taken in the experiment the range of reduced velocity is u r 2 14 re 1161 8129 under acceleration and deceleration inlet velocity loading conditions in the numerical simulation and the data of stable stage are taken for analysis the corresponding experimental results are also plotted for comparison notice that in the wake mode diagram in fig 3 the experimental results are shown above and the numerical simulation results are shown below the notations 1 2 and 3 in the figure represent three wake vortices released in each half cycle of the 2t wake model williamson and jauvtis 2004 as shown in fig 3 the maximum transverse amplitude curves have obvious branching and hysteresis phenomena under different inlet velocity loading conditions there is a sudden jump between upper branch and lower branch in acceleration condition the jumping point from upper branch to lower branch is about u r 7 and the corresponding maximum amplitude is about 1 4d the amplitude response curve in the deceleration condition is not returned along the trajectory in acceleration condition in this condition the jumping point appears near u r 5 8 and the maximum transverse amplitude is about 1 1d observe the wake mode in fig 3 when the inlet velocity is small two vortices are generated in each oscillation period and fall off the cylinder alternately showing the wake pattern of 2s mode with the increase of u r when the vibration response reaches the top of the upper branch the 2t wake mode is successfully captured in the numerical simulation at this point in each period there are two pairs of vortices behind the cylinder and each pair consists of three vortices as indicated in the diagram and the rotation direction of the vortices is not the same in the lower branch it can be clearly observed that in each period two vortex pairs are formed behind the cylinder in each vortex pair the two vortices rotate in opposite directions and extend longer than the 2s mode which corresponds to the 2p mode the reynolds averaged method successfully captured the typical wake mode in three branches which is consistent with experiments however although the numerical simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results on the whole there are relatively large errors in the prediction of the velocity corresponding to the jump points between the upper branch and the lower branch in these two conditions leading to a large error in the numerical results of amplitude in the velocity range near the maximum amplitude the main frequency of the transverse vibration of the cylinder is shown in fig 4 under acceleration and deceleration inlet velocity loading conditions as shown in fig 4 there are obvious branches in the frequency response which correspond to the branches in the amplitude response in the initial branch the vibration frequency increases with the increase of velocity in the upper branch the vibration frequency is locked near the natural frequency in the lower branch the vibration frequency ratio of the cylinder is stable at about 1 2 when u r is greater than 13 the vibration frequency suddenly jumps out of the locked region and approaches the vortex release frequency of the stationary cylinder f st the above hysteresis analysis proves that two branches can be reached by different initial velocity conditions i e accelerating or decelerating the flow velocity till the final value however there are some errors in the prediction of the branch jump point in numerical simulation it is known that as a numerical simulation method reynolds average method inevitably has calculation errors which cannot be eliminated completely no matter how the turbulence model is improved the effects of these errors in other regions are within acceptable limits but are particularly significant near bifurcation points indicating that near the bifurcation point the bifurcation property of vortex induced vibration is sensitive to boundary conditions 6 bifurcation under perturbation according to the analysis of the previous chapter the relatively large error of numerical simulation near the branch jump points may be related to the sensitivity of the bifurcation property of vortex induced vibration to boundary conditions in addition to different velocity loading forms other boundary conditions may also affect the bifurcation of vortex induced vibration which has rarely been studied in existing literatures considering that the flow field and boundary conditions are mostly in the ideal case in numerical simulation while disturbing factors inevitably exist in practical engineering in order to study whether the disturbing factors may affect the bifurcation of vortex induced vibration in this chapter sudden perturbations are applied to the cylinder in stable vibration state and the follow up responses are observed the specific form of the perturbation is to impose a pulse displacement to the cylinder and the specific process is as follows 1 choose a certain time point in the stable vibration stage and apply a pulse displacement to the cylinder it should be noted that the stable stage here means calculating until stable according to the inflow velocity loading forms introduced in section 4 1 calculation conditions in hysteresis analysis 2 taking the time point at which the pulse displacement is applied as the initial time keeping other parameters unchanged and continue to calculate until stable again the pulse displacement is represented by δ and the range of which in this paper is 0 2d δ 0 2d where represents the direction of the applied pulse displacement in the same direction as the original motion direction of the cylinder and represents the direction of the applied pulse displacement in the opposite direction 6 1 perturbation response in acceleration inlet velocity loading condition in this section the perturbation responses under typical working conditions are investigated by analyzing the vibration frequency and time history curves of lift resistance and displacement firstly the perturbation response under acceleration inlet velocity loading condition is analyzed take the typical working condition of u r 6 5 corresponding to the transition stage between upper and lower branches as an example the vibration frequency and time history curves of lift coefficient drag coefficient and displacement response after perturbations are shown in fig 5 fig 5 a shows the drag lift coefficient and amplitude response when the reduced velocity reaches about u r 6 5 in regular acceleration inlet velocity loading condition without perturbations fig 5 b e are time history curves of lift coefficient drag coefficient and displacement response after the perturbation is applied in these figures the 0 moment is the time when the pulse displacement is applied in addition the frequency response represents the vibration frequency of the cylinder at the steady stage after the perturbation is applied where f is the frequency ratio which represents the ratio of transverse vibration frequency to the natural frequency fig 5 a shows that with the increase of the inlet velocity the lift coefficient drag coefficient and amplitude response increase suddenly when the reduction velocity reaches about 5 indicating that the vibration state reaches the upper branch when u r 6 5 it is still in the upper branch and the maximum amplitude is about 1 2d at this time the frequency ratio of the cylinder in stable stage is about 1 close to the natural frequency which is in line with the characteristics of the frequency response in upper branch corresponding to the amplitude and frequency responses shown in figs 3 and 4 fig 5 b shows the response with the perturbation δ 0 1d after the perturbation is applied at the beginning the lift coefficient the drag coefficient and the maximum amplitude all increased slightly and the maximum amplitude increased to about 1 3d however then the amplitude decreased rapidly after about t 20 the lift coefficient the drag coefficient and the amplitude response return to the initial value and the final vibration frequency remains unchanged fig 5 c shows the response with the perturbation δ 0 1d at beginning the lift coefficient the drag coefficient and the maximum amplitude attenuate slightly the maximum amplitude decreases to about 1 1 d but then increase rapidly after about t 20 the lift coefficient the drag coefficient and the amplitude return to the initial value and the final vibration frequency is also remained unchanged fig 5 d and fig 5 e show the responses with larger perturbations when the perturbation δ 0 2d the lift coefficient drag coefficient and amplitude increase significantly at beginning and the maximum amplitude reaches about 1 4d after that a large attenuation occurs when the vibration state reaches stable the maximum amplitude is only about 0 8d less than the initial value the displacement curve shows that the phase between the lift and the displacement changes rapidly from in phase to opposite phase after perturbations at this time the lift force hinders the displacement and restrains the amplitude in addition the frequency ratio changes from about 1 to 1 25 which is consistent with the characteristics of the lower branch when the perturbation δ 0 2d the amplitude decreases at beginning then the phase between the lift and displacement also changes from in phase to opposite phase finally the amplitude stabilizes at about 0 8d and the final frequency ratio is about 1 25 it is indicated that after applying the perturbations of δ 0 2d or δ 0 2d the cylinder s vibration response will jump from the upper branch to the lower branch 6 2 perturbation response in deceleration inlet velocity loading condition similar with the analysis method used above the perturbation responses in deceleration inlet velocity loading conditions are analyzed in this section take the typical working condition of u r 6 corresponding to the transition stage between upper and lower branches as an example the lift coefficient drag coefficient displacement time history curves and vibration frequency responses after applied with perturbations are shown in fig 6 fig 6 a shows the drag lift coefficient and amplitude responses when the reduction velocity reaches about u r 6 in deceleration inlet velocity loading condition without perturbations as can be seen from fig 6 a when the reduced velocity of the flow field is near u r 6 the amplitude is small the phase between lift force and displacement are opposite and the frequency ratio is about 1 25 which is consistent with the characteristics of the lower branch as shown in fig 6 b and fig 6 c when the perturbation δ 0 05d or δ 0 05d the perturbation displacement is relatively small at this time the lift coefficient drag coefficient and displacement response do not change significantly and quickly return to the initial value after a short time fluctuation the final frequency of vibration has not changed either when the perturbation is larger the perturbation responses are obviously different and is related to the direction of perturbations fig 6 d and fig 6 e show that when δ 0 1d the lift coefficient drag coefficient and amplitude increase rapidly in the first vibration period after the perturbation is applied but the phase between lift force and displacement does not change neither does the vibration frequency then the vibration response quickly returns to the initial state however when δ 0 1d the lift coefficient drag coefficient and amplitude decrease slightly at beginning but the phase between the lift and displacement quickly changes from opposite phase to in phase then the lift force promotes the vibration and then makes the amplitude increase at this time the maximum amplitude in the final stable stage is about 1 1d and the final frequency ratio changes from about 1 25 to 1 locked in natural frequency indicating that the vibration response changes from the lower branch to the upper branch using the same method to analyze the perturbation responses in the velocity range u r 0 14 it can be found that within the range of about u r 5 5 6 1 in deceleration inlet velocity loading conditions and 6 3 7 in acceleration inlet velocity loading conditions the vibration state of the cylinder s vortex induced vibration may jump between the upper branch and the lower branch under appropriate excitation of perturbations and the bifurcation characteristics are more obvious near the branch jump points in other velocity ranges the perturbations applied in this paper will not change the cylinder s final vibration state combining with fig 3 the velocity interval in which the perturbation applied by the method in this paper can affect the bifurcation of the cylinder s vortex induced vibration is shown in fig 7 as can be seen from fig 7 that the velocity range in which the state mutation may occur within the form and magnitude of perturbations applied in this paper is about u r 5 5 6 1 and 6 3 7 which belongs to the velocity interval corresponding to the crossing area between upper and lower branches it can be inferred that in the crossing area between upper and lower branches the cylinder s vortex induced vibration may have two relatively stable states and can be transformed to each other under appropriate excitation of perturbations 6 3 analysis of wake field vorticity map from the analysis in the previous section it can be concluded that near the branch jump points the displacement perturbations may make the vibration state of the cylinder jump between branches in this section in order to further study the mechanism the vorticity map of wake field is analyzed in which the contour levels represent the value of vorticity 6 3 1 upper branch to lower branch in the case of u r 6 5 in acceleration inlet velocity loading condition as shown in fig 5 the vibration state of the cylinder jumps from the upper branch to the lower branch after the perturbation of δ 0 2d is applied in order to study the variation of wake field after perturbation u r 6 5 is selected as a typical working condition and the relevant vorticity maps are analyzed fig 8 is a vorticity map for perturbation δ 0 2d the displacement perturbation is in the same direction of the original motion trend the first frame shows the vorticity map when the displacement perturbation is applied which reflects the initial flow field information before the perturbation and the subsequent frames show the vorticity maps after the perturbation is applied the time interval is 0 5s δt 1 3 before the perturbation is applied as shown in the first frame t 0 in fig 8 1 6 vortices shed alternately the intensity of 2 blue vortex is relatively small and is not obvious in the frame in one cycle and the wake mode appears as 2t mode then a large displacement occurs along the original motion trend after the perturbation is applied which promotes the vortex shedding therefore in the next cycle t 2 6 6 5 the 1 vortex corresponding to 1 3 vortices in the first cycle no longer shed separately as 1 3 vortices in the first cycle but sheds as one vortex 1 at this time the lower side flow field shows the feature of 2s mode while the upper side flow field still shows the feature of 2t mode which is unstable then under the coupling action of disturbed flow field and cylinder motion in the next few cycles t 6 5 11 7 four vortices 1 4 shed alternately the wake mode is between 2s and 2p modes and the feature of the 2p mode becomes gradually obvious until t 13 0 the wake mode presents to be a standard 2p mode see 1 4 vortices at t 13 0 18 2 thereafter the flow field remains stable meanwhile in the process of the above changes in the flow field the vibration state of the cylinder changes from upper branch to lower branch and finally remains stable in the new vibration state fig 9 is a vorticity map for perturbation δ 0 2d the displacement perturbation is opposite to the original motion trend the first frame shows the vorticity map when the perturbation is applied which reflects the flow field information before the perturbation and the subsequent frames show the flow field vorticity maps after the perturbation is applied the time interval is 0 5s δt 1 3 as shown in the first frame t 0 in fig 9 before the perturbation is applied 1 6 vortices shed alternately the intensity of 2 blue vortex is relatively small and is not obvious in the frame in one cycle and the wake mode appears as 2t mode then the amplitude of the cylinder is suppressed after the perturbation opposite to the original motion trend is applied which suppresses the vortex shedding therefore in the next cycle t 2 6 6 5 only four vortices 1 4 shed alternately and the wake field shows the feature of 2p mode nevertheless compared with the typical 2p wake the intensity of vortices 1 and 3 is too small therefore the 2p wake at this stage is unstable and changes to 2s soon at t 7 8 10 4 in which two vortices 1 and 2 shed alternately in one cycle but at this velocity u r 6 5 the 2s mode cannot exist stably then under the coupling action of disturbed flow field and cylinder motion in the next few cycles t 10 4 16 9 the wake vortex mode begins to change from 2s to 2p gradually until t 18 2 the wake mode is completely changed to standard 2p mode see 1 4 vortices at t 18 2 20 8 thereafter the flow field remains stable meanwhile in the process of the above changes in the flow field the vibration state of the cylinder changes from upper branch to lower branch and finally remains stable in the new vibration state 6 3 2 lower branch to upper branch as shown in fig 6 in the deceleration inlet velocity loading condition with u r 6 the vibration response will change from the lower branch to the upper branch after applying the perturbations of δ 0 1d while the vibration response will not change when applying the perturbations of δ 0 1d in order to study the variation of wake field after perturbation u r 6 is selected as a typical working condition and the relevant vorticity maps are analyzed fig 10 is a vorticity map for perturbation δ 0 1d the displacement perturbation is in the same direction as the original motion trend the first frame shows the vorticity map when the displacement perturbation is applied which reflects the flow field information before the perturbation and the subsequent frames show the flow field vorticity maps after the perturbations after the perturbation is applied the time interval is 0 4s δt 0 96 as shown in the first frame t 0 in fig 10 before the perturbation is applied 1 4 vortices shed alternately the intensity of 2 blue vortex is relatively small and is not obvious in the frame in one cycle and the wake mode appears as 2p mode then a large displacement occurs along the original motion trend after the perturbation is applied which promotes the vortex shedding leading to the intensity of 2 vortex in the next cycle being a little larger than that of 2 vortex in the first cycle comparing the frames at t 0 and t 4 8 however the variation of 2 vortex intensity does not change the wake mode nor does it have a great influence on the flow field finally under the coupling action of disturbed flow field and cylinder motion the flow field state and the vibration state of the cylinder return to the initial condition fig 11 is a vorticity map for perturbation δ 0 1d the displacement perturbations is opposite to the original motion trend the first frame shows the vorticity map when the displacement perturbation is applied which reflects the flow field information before the perturbation and the subsequent frames show the vorticity maps after the perturbation is applied the time interval is 0 4s δt 0 96 as shown in the first frame t 0 in fig 11 before the perturbation is applied 1 4 vortices shed alternately the intensity of 2 blue vortex is relatively small and is not obvious in the frame in one cycle and the wake mode appears as 2p mode then the perturbation opposite to the original motion trend is applied which is greater than the critical value and changed the motion direction of the cylinder as a result in the subsequent cycle three vortices 3 5 vortices shed into the upper side flow field as shown in the frame at t 5 76 and t 6 72 at this time the flow field on the upper side shows the feature of the 2t mode see 3 5 vortices shown in the frame at t 5 76 while the flow field on the lower side shows the feature of the 2p mode see 1 and 2 vortices shown in the frame at t 5 76 in which the intensity of 2 blue vortex is relatively small and is not obvious in the frame in this case the flow field is unstable so that under the coupling action of disturbed flow field and cylinder motion in the next few cycles t 6 72 10 56 the features of the 2t model are becoming more and more obvious until t 11 52 the wake mode is completely changed to standard 2t mode see 1 6 vortices at t 8 64 11 52 thereafter the flow field remains stable meanwhile in the process of the above changes in the flow field the vibration state of the cylinder changes from lower branch to upper branch and finally remains stable 6 3 3 comprehensive analysis from the above analysis it can be concluded that in the velocity interval corresponding to the crossing area between upper and lower branches the vortex induced vibration state of the cylinder may jump between the upper and lower branches under the appropriate perturbations when the displacement perturbation is applied the motion state of the cylinder will change which will cause the change of the shedding mode and the wake mode of the vortex resulting in the instability of the flow field then under the coupling action of disturbed flow field and cylinder motion the flow field and the vibration state of the cylinder finally stabilize to the corresponding state of the upper branch or the lower branch depending on the direction and magnitude of the perturbation 7 conclusion in this paper the bifurcation characteristics in vortex induced vibration of cylinder with low mass damping ratio is studied by numerical simulation sudden perturbations are applied to the cylinder in stable vibration state and the follow up responses are analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 in the velocity range near the branch jump points upper and lower branches the cylinder s vortex induced vibration may have two relatively stable states and can be transformed to each other under appropriate excitation of perturbations 2 from the point of view of flow field when the displacement perturbation is applied the motion state of the cylinder will change which will cause the change of the shedding mode and the wake mode of the vortex resulting in the instability of the flow field then under the coupling action of disturbed flow field and cylinder motion the flow field and the vibration state of the cylinder finally stabilize to the corresponding state of the upper branch or the lower branch depending on the direction and magnitude of the perturbation based on the above results the following suggestions are given firstly the sensitivity of the bifurcation characteristic to the boundary conditions near the branch jump points may lead to a certain degree of uncertainty in predicting the maximum amplitude of cylinder s vortex induced vibration thus in order to capture the maximum amplitude that may occur in real situations multiple boundary conditions and appropriate perturbations are suggested to be applied in numerical simulation or experiment and repeated experiments are also suggested secondly a new idea for suppressing vortex induced vibration is proposed appropriate perturbations are likely to drive the cylinder s vortex induced vibration state jump from the upper branch to the lower branch therefore in order to suppress the vortex induced vibration of cylindrical structures in marine engineering appropriate perturbations can be applied to the structure when it produces a large amplitude acknowledgements this work was jointly supported by the national natural science foundation of china project no 5160090381 and the
