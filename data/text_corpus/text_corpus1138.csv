5690,the 2016 2017 seismic sequence in central italy caused the reactivation of a complex nnw sse trending wsw dipping normal fault system associated with relevant coseismic ruptures the seismic sequence significantly affected the groundwater circulation hosted in limestone aquifers based on the data available in may 2019 this work aims to contribute to understanding how the reactivation of the seismogenic faults has influenced the hydrological system of the upper nera river basin it appears that the seismic sequence changed the recession processes of the nera river post seismic recession curves are described by straight lines non darcian flow while the pre seismic ones follow the exponential function darcian flow after the earthquake the system empties i e the storage decreases at a faster rate than before this effect persists after more than two years from the 2016 earthquake according to some geological cross sections the analysis of coseismic deformations and recession curves a presumable increase in aquifer permeability seems to be the main factor affecting the post earthquake river discharge if the non darcian recession process continues in the future the river flow will be more variable than in the past causing significant problems to water using productive activities this because during prolonged drought periods the fast decrease of the dynamic water storage would produce discharges lower than in the past the results here reported can contribute to the understanding of the medium long term evolution of this particular hydrological system as well as of other similar ones and could be useful to better managing the groundwater resources keywords groundwater seismic sequence central italy recession curve aquifer permeability nera river 1 introduction the decrease or increase in river flow spring discharge and groundwater level are relatively common effects following earthquakes of medium to high magnitude due to the recurrence of hydrogeological events related to earthquakes the topic is more and more investigated e g rojstaczer and wolf 1992 king and muir wood 1993 manga 2001 wang and manga 2015 he and singh 2019 as reported by mohr et al 2017 near surface hydro seismological processes may provide important insights into the regional hydrological cycle in italy some studies regarded the response of hydrogeological systems following the main historical seismic events which affected the apennine area e g oddone 1915 celico 1981 esposito et al 2001 carro et al 2005 amoruso et al 2011 adinolfi falcone et al 2012 la vigna 2013 de luca et al 2018 barberio et al 2017 petitta et al 2018 valigi et al 2019 the dynamic of hydrogeological systems after earthquakes cannot be generalized causes and effects differ from case to case based on the literature regarding global earthquakes manga and wang 2007 summarized the main causes of changes in water flow rates of systems in response to earthquakes among these very important are the release of crustal fluids following elastic coseismic deformations e g muir wood and king 1993 the increase in water pressure following the rise in the hydraulic gradient in the aquifer cf nur 1974 king and muir wood 1993 the changes in permeability on the rocks near the surface due to microcracks unblocking of pre existing fractures and fracture cleaning tokunaga 1999 sato et al 2000 adinolfi falcone et al 2012 in general permeability at a regional scale tends to recover over time close to that before the earthquake manga et al 2012 this process occurs from a few minutes geballe et al 2011 to several years manga and rowland 2009 in some case hydrological changes persist several years after the earthquake indicating that earthquake induced enhancements of permeability in the shallow crust are persistent and widespread rojstaczer et al 1995 in addition to the causes listed above according to wang and manga 2015 earthquakes can breach the seals between neighbouring compartmented aquifers coseismic dislocation and spatial variation of the volumetric deformation affect the hydrological regime and groundwater pattern cf pece and tranfaglia 2012 there is a possibility that even very low energy earthquakes may produce noticeable effects gosar and brenčič 2013 report the enigmatic case of a watercourse in a karst area that dried up for two days in conjunction with a flood followed by an earthquake of magnitude ml 0 6 the earthquake with the hypocenter around one hundred meters deep would have been caused by an increase in interstitial pressures during the flood in the apennine area central italy some rivers and springs are fed by compartmented aquifers or by hydraulically connected aquifers hosted in limestone rocks boni et al 1986 cencetti et al 1989 di matteo et al 2013 di matteo et al 2017 the earthquake occurred in central italy on october 26 30 2016 produced several coseismic effects including dynamic changes on groundwater and surface water systems referring to fig 1 for location a few months after the main shock the following hydrogeological effects have been recognized the decrease of the discharge of some rivers and springs in the eastern part of the apennine ridge bocchino 2019 giacopetti et al 2019 the rise of the water table in the norcia plain valigi et al 2019 the disappearance or the reduction of the discharge of perched springs giacopetti et al 2019 the reappearance of torbidone spring which was without natural outflow since the 1979 norcia earthquake cf console et al 2017 valigi et al 2019 the increase of the discharge of the nera river including the main tributaries and that of some springs located in the upper part of the catchment cf checcucci et al 2017 petitta et al 2018 the observed hydrogeological changes following the 2016 earthquake in central italy are still in evolution the nera river represents a tangible example of groundwater surface waters interaction in an area with medium high seismicity the flow of the nera river even during the dry season or prolonged droughts decreases slowly and the river is an essential and reliable regional water resource for multipurpose water supply most of the course of the nera river runs in a deep valley trough limestone formations these constitute huge aquifers that feed the river in practice the nera is a set of permanent linear springs fed by large limestone aquifers boni et al 1986 the study of recession curves can give some information on key hydrogeological parameters such as the hydraulic conductivity the effective porosity and the water stored in the aquifer in this framework the present study aims to contribute to the knowledge of the effects of earthquakes on limestone groundwater systems the main goal is to study the regional pattern of streamflow taking into account pre and post seismic river recession curves geological structural setting and coseismic dislocations and deformations produced by the 2016 earthquake in the highest part of nera river catchment 2 geological setting and seismicity 2 1 geological setting the study area is located in central italy along the umbria marche apennines the umbria marche fold and thrust belt was formed during the late miocene early pliocene compressional phase lavecchia et al 1988 and was followed by late pliocene quaternary extension e g pauselli et al 2006 cosentino et al 2010 the stratigraphic succession of the investigated part of the apennines can be divided mainly into two main geological domains the umbria marche carbonate and pelagic domain at the hanging wall of the regional m sibillini thrust hereafter mst fig 2 and the laga foredeep domain at the footwall of the mst fig 2 we have grouped the main stratigraphic formations fms in nine hydrogeological complexes as reported in fig 3 the umbria marche domain is composed of upper triassic evaporites anhydrites and dolomites evaporites complex up to 2000 m thick anidriti di burano fm and raethavicula contorta beds this complex is not exposed in the external sector of the chain and it ischaracterized by low permeability for the anydrites and moderate permeability for dolostones fig 3 the sequence continues with shallow water carbonates calcare massiccio fm lower jurassic upwards through a pelagic domain characterized by condensed and complete successions with variable lithologies and thicknesses santantonio 1994 bigi et al 2011 the corniola fm deposited in structural lows overlapping the calcare massiccio fm composes the complete sequence it consists of grey or dark brown micritic limestones arranged in medium thick beds with chert the calcare massiccio and corniola formations are characterized by high relative permeability and represent the basal aquifer of the region basal limestones complex fig 3 the basal aquifer reaches a maximum thickness of about 900 m at m vettore and m bove upward the succession continues with the marly siliceous limestones complex which includes rosso ammonitico marne del serrone calcari a posidonia and calcari diasprigni formations marly limestones and siliceous limestones having low relative permeability characterize these formations the high bathymetric relief of the jurassic paleomorphology of the pelagic basins was leveled during the deposition of the maiolica fm maiolica complex fig 3 this complexoutcrops over large areas and due to high permeability for fracturation represents the middle aquifer the thickness of this complex is variable ranging from 150 200 m for the structural high maiolica to 350 400 m above the complete jurassic succession pierantoni et al 2013 on top of the maiolica complex there is the marne a fucoidi fm it is composed of grey green and red marls clayey marls and marly limestones for an average thickness of 80 m having low relative permeability marne a fucoidi complex fig 3 above the marne a fucoidi the scaglia complex scaglia bianca and scaglia rossa fms has an average thickness of about 400 m it is characterized by a moderate relative permeability above the scaglia complex there are the scaglia variegata and scaglia cinerea fms made up bymarly calcareous rocks having low relative permeability marly calcareous complex miocene marly units and the laga fm close the complete succession miocene marly units are characterized by prevalent marly formations with an average thickness of 250 m bisciaro schlier marne con cerrogna and marne a pteropodi fms bigi et al 2011 laga fm outcrops in the laga domain at the footwall of the mst fig 2 most of these formations are characterized by moderate or low permeability sandstones and marls fig 3 the stratigraphic setting described above was deformed in the miocene compressional phase producing the umbria marche fold and thrust belt the compressive structures show thrust belt morphologies the geometries of which are simple and well documented in the literature koopman 1983 lavecchia 1985 calamita and deiana 1988 centamore et al 1991 calamita et al 1994a mazzoli et al 2005 pierantoni et al 2005 tavani et al 2008 pierantoni et al 2013 porreca et al 2018 in the study area the umbria marche sequence overthrusts the laga sequence through arc shaped major thrusts namely the mst koopman 1983 lavecchia 1985 with eastward convexity the main detachment is localized at the base of the triassic evaporites sequence and involves the whole sedimentary sequence deformed in ne verging anticlines these anticlines are characterized by overturned forelimbs and gently west dipping backlimbs associated with thrusts the subsequent extensional tectonics was superimposed on the compressional structures since the late pliocene nw se trending normal faults have been responsible for the formation of large intermontane basins in which late pliocene quaternary continental sediments are deposited the strong link between topography and displacements along the principal normal faults gives evidence of activity in the last 2 my calamita et al 1994b cavinato and celles 1999 roberts and michetti 2004 according to aringoli et al 2007 catchment processes during the last 80 years the observation period considered in our work have been less substantial than those that occurred during previous centuries finally the main dam in the area c le preci hydroelectric bypass was built in 1929 before the construction of the oldest stream gauges located about 500 m upstream of the dam fig 4 b this issue is discussed later overall morphological and anthropic changes over the last 80 years did not cause any relevant role in the hydrogeological processes occurring in the upper nera river 2 2 historical seismicity numerous bibliographic sources testify that the studied area is affected by medium high seismicity monachesi 1987 bertolaso and boschi 2007 rovida et al 2016 in fig 1 and table 1 we report the main historical events of the area in the following we describe the principal earthquakes occurred in the area since 14th century among the oldest earthquakes of which we have written memory there is a very strong one occurred on december 4 1328 that affected norcia and several valnerina s centers in the same area from 5 november 1599 to 19 january 1600 numerous earthquakes of similar intensity occurred between norcia and cascia also felt in the surrounding areas the major shock occurred on the night of 5 6 november and caused the collapsing of more than forty houses in the cascia village and serious damage to all the other buildings numerous strong replicas but which did not cause further significant damages occurred until january 1600 a very strong seismic event occurred on october 7 1639 near amatrice in the upper tronto valley the shock lasted a quarter of an hour and caused about 500 deaths on october 14 1639 at about the same time as the earthquake of the previous week there was probably a second shock the seismic sequence of january february 1703 located in umbria and abruzzo was one of the most significant of the last millennium for central italy the greatest events took place on 14 and 16 january and on 2 february 1703 the event of 14 january involved a vast area of umbria and lazio roughly between norcia and amatrice the norcia and cascia area were struck on the morning of june 27 1719 by an earthquake which produced large cracks on new buildings built after the events of 1703 the earthquake of 12 may 1730 was very violent causing damage not only to cascia and norcia where the bell tower of the church of san benedetto fell but also throughout the surrounding territory on september 3 1815 there was a seismic crisis in the area of norcia which was its epicenter the event started in the night and interested norcia and many other countries on the morning of february 14 1838 greatest damages occurred as a consequence of an earthquake located west of norcia various replicas were felt in foligno during the following day and night and on 17 february a few days before august 22nd of 1859 in norcia various earthquakes of a medium intensity began to be felt and at 1 32 in the afternoon a violent event of duration of 6 7 s occurred the event was devastating and the replicas continued almost daily for about a year in mid november 1859 and in may 1860 two very strong events occurred in the same area on the evening of the 23rd february 1879 at 7 30 pm a shock lasting 10 s interested norcia on september 12 1898 an earthquake struck small towns near visso the earthquake of november 16 1916 occurred in the territory of rieti but involved some umbrian cities including cascia and its territory the earthquake of september 19 1979 severely affected some small mountain villages in the valnerina for some of these seismic events a relation with the activity of torbidone spring has been found console et al 2017 the torbidone spring is mentioned since 1350 highlighting its periodicity of about seven years after the strong earthquake of 1859 a few authors reported how the waters ceased to flow but reappeared after a short time turbid and earthy pointing out that after this phenomena earthquake the waters remained intermittent but no longer periodic console et al 2017 the intermittence of torbidone has continued until 1979 when following the seismic event of september 19 the springs disappeared completely console et al 2017 and references therein 2 3 the 2016 seismic sequence of central italy the seismic sequence started on 24 august 2016 with the mw 6 0 mainshock located close to the amatrice village tinti et al 2016 lavecchia et al 2016 the mainshock nucleated along a sw dipping normal fault belonging to the northern segment of the mt gorzano fault gf with an epicenter located within the turbiditic laga basin lavecchia et al 2016 during this event primary coseismic ruptures were observed along the mt vettore fault system vf in the carbonate domain above the mst pucci et al 2017 brozzetti et al 2019 differently along the well known active gf evidence of coseismic ruptures was discontinuous or absent livio et al 2016 pucci et al 2016 on october 26th a mw 5 9 an earthquake nucleated north of the m vettore m bove faults vf close to the town of visso the seismic sequence culminated on october 30th with the mw 6 5 mainshock close to the norcia town this event is due to the reactivation of the vf located in the hangingwall of the mst it produced significant primary coseismic ruptures chiaraluce et al 2017 ferrario and livio 2018 iezzi et al 2018 villani et al 2018 brozzetti et al 2019 coseismic displacements an average of about 0 44 m and peak of about 2 1 m were observed for a total length of about 27 km with n135 160 striking surface ruptures these ruptures show a prevalent dip slip kinematics denoting an extension axis trend of n233 villani et al 2018 brozzetti et al 2019 according to the database of national institute of geophysics and volcanology of italy ingv http cnt rm ingv it en the two main shocks occurred at the end of october 2016 at a depth of about 10 km 3 material and methods 3 1 geological model and vertical displacement the construction of the geological model was firstly based on a revision of the existing cartography of the area subsequently using the geological map of the sibillini mountains pierantoni et al 2013 we have created a grid of 10 geological sections all the geological maps and the cross sections were elaborated using the software move midland 2017 the geological reconstruction comprises the main structural elements such as sibillini thrust and the seismogenic faults reactivated by the seismic sequence i e mt bove vettore fault system and the main hydrogeological elements top maiolica fm and top corniola fm surfaces representing the top of the main aquifers particularly important is the top of corniola fm considering that it represents the top of basal limestones complex composed by corniola and calcare massiccio fms on the reconstructed geological sections we report the distribution of seismic events and related coseismic ruptures as well as the vertical displacement profiles as inferred by valerio et al 2018 and bignami et al 2019 using insar data collected from 24 august 2016 to 30 november 2016 3 2 hydrological and climate data daily stream levels of the nera river and of the main tributary ussita river as well as thermo pluviometric data were collected from the sirmip on line monitoring network civil protection agency of marche region central italy rating curves of stream gauges managed by sirmip are available from january 2015 these rating curves have been used to transform river levels h into stream discharge data q the sirmip data do not correspond to the actual total water yield of the aquifer feeding the nera river upstream of the gauging station there is the san chiodo spring fig 4a from which a variable quantity of water is taken for drinking water purposes in this framework to obtain the actual discharges of the nera river the withdrawals from san chiodo spring were added to the sirmip stream discharges measured at section i1 see fig 4a for the location according to information reported in d r 35 2018 et seq 0 150 m3 s were added to the data from january 2015 to february 2018 and 0 200 m3 s from march 2018 up today in addition to recent monitoring data historical discharges from servizio idrografico e mareografico nazionale simn monitoring network working during 1928 1943 period have been used these monitoring stations i3 and i4 in fig 4a nowadays are not operating despite being located in key hydrological sections confluence between ussita and nera rivers fig 4a regarding the discharge data of the 1930s we did not use the rating curves we considered the discharges published at the time in the official yearly reports by simn according to those publications the discharge data from 1933 forwards are reliable simn published a validated rating curve in 1933 and we found four recession periods in the summers of years 1933 1935 1936 1938 the historic stream level data were manually acquired from a staff gauge one reading per day despite the efforts to obtain accurate hydrometric measurements the accuracy of readings by contact gauges such as staff gauges and non contact gauges such as ultrasonic gauges diminishes as velocity and surge increase due to standing waves both instruments collect water level data with the same precision which is not better than 5 mm cf hamilton and moore 2013 according to léonard et al 2000 and schmidt 2002 any river discharge measurement used to calibrate a rating curve is affected by an uncertainty of about 5 as shown in next sections in order to investigate how historic as well as more recent discharge data are comparable each other the hydrograph visual inspection during recession periods coupled with some statistical analysis have been used for validating streamflow data as for the case of nera river this approach is useful when the different data sets have not run in parallel for some period of time fig 4c shows the location and the basic information of the main hydro meteorological monitoring stations in the highest part of the nera river catchment to estimate the water surplus s before and after the earthquake sequence we analysed the available monthly rainfall and temperature data unfortunately as commonly occurs in the apennines only a few high altitude meteorological stations are present and often their data are not reliable di matteo et al 2013 as only rainfall and temperature data are available we estimated monthly evapotranspiration using the well known method by thornthwaite and mather 1955 in such situations where data concerning radiation air humidity etc necessary to apply more modern methods are not available the thornthwaite and mather approach is still useful e g shuttleworth 2007 di matteo et al 2017 the computation of actual monthly evapotranspiration etr was carried out by using software developed by čadro 2016 3 3 conceptual models for stream recession curves the analysis of river discharge data during recession periods is particularly useful in the case of hard rocks where flow is controlled by the fracture network and no specific information about hydraulic conductivity and specific yield data are available bonacci 1993 dragoni et al 2015 di matteo et al 2017 the shape of the recession curve can give information about the hydrogeological properties of the reservoir at least in terms of average or equivalent values various conceptual models of the reservoir can be used to describe the recession curves based on these models several equations have been published in the literature such as the simple exponential formula ef boussinesq 1877 maillet 1905 the hyperbolic or quadratic formula qf boussinesq 1903 and the straight line equation coutagne 1948 bonacci 1987 the ef and qf functions are based on darcian laminar flow while the straight line on non darcian turbulent flow in theory ef and qf equations are not appropriate for karstic or fractured rocks anyway if hydraulic gradients and velocity are low both equations clearly describe the recession process also in fractured rocks cf scanlon et al 2003 rehrl and birk 2010 dragoni et al 2013 often as the recession period proceeds the process is described by different equations and or by the same equation having more than one recession coefficient this case can be explained considering that as the saturated thickness inside the reservoir decreases the average hydraulic conductivity the effective porosity and the geometric properties of the reservoir size and shape may change bonacci 1987 in the years after earthquakes river discharge can show the same or a different recession coefficient compared with that before the earthquake making it a useful indicator to understand the hydro seismological processes 4 results 4 1 geological model and vertical displacement after the 2016 earthquake some surface topography changes deformations and several seismic induced rockfalls occurred in the sibillini mountains the biggest landslide occurred two kilometres downstream the visso village where about 70 000 m3 of debris produced by a rockfall dammed the nera river producing a small lake romeo et al 2017 this landslide did not affect the surface drainage patterns of the study area regarding the surface deformations fig 5 shows the three geological cross sections representative of the main structural elements thrusts and normal faults which have conditioned the geometry and the compartmentalization of the main aquifers of the area the area is characterized by complex geological structures that were formed during the late miocene compressional events successively during the quaternary extensional tectonics these structures have been dissected by normal faults the effects of these two tectonic processes are well recognisable in the sections of fig 5 above each section the distribution of the displacement along the vertical component is reported as deduced by insar data valerio et al 2018 bignami et al 2019 these data are useful to identify the sectors that were subjected to the subsidence or uplift during the seismic sequence including the mainshocks from august 24 to october 30 2016 these variations of elevation could have altered the groundwater drainage significantly the wsw ene oriented section a a and the wnw ese b b sections show that the mesozoic sequence has been involved in a thrust tectonic with a prevalent vergence toward eastern sectors this tectonic phase has promoted the formation of anticline structures on the hangingwall of the main thrusts i e the m sibillini and pizzo tre vescovi thrusts with a variable displacement ranging from hundreds of meters ptvt fig 5a b up to some kilometres mst fig 5b in particular the mst is generally considered as ano flow boundary between the fractured carbonates and the siliciclastic laga sequence the compressional structures were dissected by high angle normal faults characterized by a throw of 200 800 m promoting a juxtaposition of formations with different permeability even if a lateral continuity is preserved for the base limestones complex as shown in fig 5a b in particular we have recognized three main normal faults which were re activated in a different way during the 2016 seismic sequence and that have probably influenced the hydrogeological properties of the base aquifer these faults affect the hangingwall of the mst and intercept the ptvt in the central part of the study area fig 2 and are called f1 f2 and f3 from east to the west fig 5a b c as fig 5c shows the basal aquifer is dislocated by the normal faults with different throws but a lateral continuity of the aquifer is still preserved along the n s direction in fig 5a b the vertical displacement profiles are almost orthogonal to the main structural elements the profiles show that the sectors located to the west of the seismogenic normal faults had significant subsidence up to a value of about 0 35 m in correspondence of f2 and f3 in the eastern sectors from the ptvt to the mst there is an uplift at most of a few centimetres the n s section shows that the whole sector had a subsidence from 0 10 m in the northern part to 0 50 m in the southern part fig 5c 4 2 effect of seismic sequence on river hydrograph fig 6 a shows the daily discharge values of the nera river section i1 in fig 4b registered by sirmip and the main earthquakes occurred during the 2016 2017 sequences in central italy the seismic sequence of august 24 2016 was followed by an increase of the river discharge of about 1 m3 s events 1 2 in fig 6a it lasted up to the seismic sequences occurred at the end of october 2016 events 3 4 and 5 in fig 6a and their aftershocks in detail after the visso and norcia earthquakes respectively mw 5 9 and 6 5 an increase of the river discharge from about 4 8 m3 s october 25 2016 to 9 5 m3 s november 11 2016 occurred the discharge of the nera river at section i1 doubled in a few weeks reaching the highest value among the available data in the same period most of the discharge increase was supplied by the base aquifer feeding the nera river in the castelsantangelo sul nera area fig 2 in fact duringthe weeks after the norcia earthquake the discharge of san chiodo spring cf figs 2 and 4 for the location increased of 2 34 m3 s petitta et al 2018 this discharge corresponds to about the 50 of the flow increase registered at section i1 the torre orsina data confirm the exceptionality of discharges this stream gauging is located about 50 km downstream of station i1 where the catchment area is 1442 km2 and the discharge data set begins in 1926 cencetti et al 1989 in spite of the low rainfall during november 2016 the average discharge was around 31 m3 s checcucci et al 2017 about 25 higher than the average value of november in the first months after the mainshocks the increase of the discharge is not linked to the groundwater recharge the water surplus s during october december 2016 period was about 100 mm 3 months 36 lower than the mean surplus calculated on the 2007 2018 period ispra 2017 valigi et al 2019 and bocchino 2019 also highlighted low rainfall and low recharge during the post earthquake period the seismic sequence of january 18 2017 earthquakes 6 9 in fig 6a did not cause any further discharge variation this behaviour is probably due to the distance of the earthquakes epicentres about 55 km south from visso and to the low amount of energy released compared to the norcia earthquake the streamflow increase persisted several months after the mainshock the epicentre of which was very close to the nera river catchment after the rising limb discharges decreased during the first post earthquake recession period summer 2017 thanks to the stream gauge i2 starting from july 2017 cf fig 4 it has been possible to reconstruct the discharge data of nera river alone by subtracting the flow data from i1 and i2 stream gauges the reliability of this synthetic hydrograph was checked by carrying out a few instantaneous flow measurements using an electromagnetic current meter ott mf pro the instrument accuracy is 2 of the measured value range of velocity 0 3 m s and 4 of the measured value velocity from 3 5 m s as fig 6b shows the instantaneous measurements fall on the synthetic hydrograph confirming the quality of the reconstructed series 4 3 pre and post earthquake recession curves to investigate hydrogeological changes induced by earthquakes on the groundwater system feeding the nera river pre and post seismic river recession curves have been analysed having in mind to build a master recession curve mrc as long as possible the use of individual recession curves derived from limited time periods in most cases may describe the recession process only partially cf for instance tallaksen 1995 gregor and malik 2012 in this framework we collected five pre seismic river recession curves years 1933 1935 1936 1938 and 2016 and two post seismic 2017 and 2018 unfortunately due to the sporadic functioning of the stations no other recession periods are available the recession curves were identified initially by visual inspection of the measured hydrographs fig 6b subsequently to be sure that the periods of recession had nil or negligible recharge the recession periods were compared to the months during which the water surplus according to thornthwaite mather method was zero fig 6b the comparison has shown that all the recessions detected by visual inspection were part of the months without water surplus fig 6b shows that both in 2017 and 2018 the duration of the recession curves of the nera river is shorter than that of its tributary the ussita river this fact indicates that the nera catchment received some rain and some recharge ahead of the ussita for this reason in our analysis we considered only the shorter periods when both nera and ussita had no recharge based on visual inspection of the available hydrographs in numerical and semilogarithmic scale the recession periods were analyzed by fitting both the simple exponential ef and straight line models to the discharge data of each available recession curve the root mean square error rmse was the best fit selection criterion used to assign each curve to one of the two models the best fit analysis showed that the pre earthquake recessions follow the ef model while the post earthquake ones follow the straight line model after sorting the recession periods from the highest discharge to the lowest the mrcs of the pre and post recessions have been assembled according to the strip method singh 1989 tallaksen 1995 posavec et al 2006 the overlapping of the single recession curves was done time step by time step and the chosen time shifting values of the curves correspond to the best results according to the rmse criterion fig 7 shows clearly that the pre and post seismic mrcs of the nera river differ notably considering the hydrogeological system upstream of section i1 as a whole the main differences between the pre and post recession curves are the following the units for time and discharge are respectively days d and m3 d a the pre earthquake mrc is described by the ef formula eq 1 this equation corresponds to a linear reservoir where at any time t the discharge is proportional to the volume of water wt stored in the reservoir above the exit point eq 2 cf coutagne 1948 1 q t q o e α e t 4 94640 e 0 0025 t rmse 4752 m 3 d 2 q t α e w t where qt and qo discharge at time t d and at the beginning of recession period αe maillet recession coefficient 1 d wt water stored in the reservoir at time t m3 as previously discussed the uncertainty of modern and historical discharge data is about 5 léonard et al 2000 schmidt 2002 in the framework of these uncertainties it is interesting to point out that the 2016 pre seismic recession data fall on the mrc obtained with the data of the 1930s eq 1 this fact provides a useful consistency check of the available discharge values moreover this behaviour confirms that the hydrogeological system feeding the nera river has not been influenced by anthropogenic changes that occurred over the years e g fluent hydroelectric plant d1 in fig 4a b b the post earthquake mrc is described by a straight line eq 3 similar to that produced by a tank following the torricelli law cf just for example coutagne 1948 or the more recent review paper by fiorillo 2014 this emptying modality of the reservoir is not present in the data available before the seismic sequence it is appropriate to remark that there is a notable difference between a reservoir following the torricelli law stricto sensu and a real hydrological system in the former the loss of energy during the flow is nil or negligible in the latter the loss of energy is high and cannot be neglected this point obvious on a theoretical basis has been discussed by a few researchers as e g bonacci 1987 for this reason we named eq 3 torricelli like function tlf and αtl the corresponding recession coefficient eq 3 corresponds to a reservoir where at any time t the discharge is proportional to the square root of the water stored in the reservoir eq 4 3 q t q o α tl t 563328 14 2300 85 t rmse 11145 6 m 3 d 4 q t 2 α tl w t where qt and qo discharge at time t d and at the beginning of recession period αtl torricelli like recession coefficient m3 d2 wt water stored in the reservoir at time t m3 5 discussion despite the hydrogeological system feeding the nera river is complex and has probably not reached a new equilibrium after the 2016 seismic sequence some considerations can be made by analyzing pre and post seismic mrcs after the earthquake during no recharge periods the system empties i e the storage decreases at a rate faster than prior to the seismic sequence fig 7 the first derivative of eqs 1 and 3 gives the rate of change of the discharge rcd during the recession phase eqs 5 and 6 describe the rcd for both pre and post seismic recession periods 5 rc d e α e q o e α e t α e q t 0 0025 t m 3 d 2 6 rc d tl α tl 2300 85 m 3 d 2 applying the eqs 5 and 6 at the intersection of the ef and tlf master curves i e when both curves have the same discharge qt 494640 m3 d fig 7 we can quantify the rcd of both processes for that discharge the post earthquake rcd is 2300 85 m3 d2 about twice as fast as the pre earthquake value 1236 6 m3 d2 from another point of view the time necessary to halve the flow rates and the theoretical reservoir dynamic storage is a good indicator of how fast the two emptying processes are let us consider the discharge where the two mrcs cross qt 494640 m3 d cf fig 7 applying eqs 1 and 2 for the ef process the halving time for both discharge and dynamic water storage is 278 days applying eqs 3 and 4 at the same discharge for tlf process the halving time of the river flow is about 107 days while for the dynamic storage the halving time is about 63 days note that the halving time in the case of ef is constant in time while in the case of tlf it decreases as time passes this situation implies that if the tlf recession persists in the future the river flow will be more variable than in the past and the hydropower plants and fisheries located along the river will have not negligible problems during prolonged drought periods considering the different equations describing pre and post recession periods we have to conclude that in some way the seismic events changed the hydrogeological properties of the reservoir feeding the nera river upstream of the gauging station a possible explanation for the change from ef to tlf i e from darcian flow to non darcian flow could be that the earthquake caused an increase of water pressure into the aquifer and thus an increase of the hydraulic gradient there is a general agreement that a recession phase described by a straight line tlf equation is due to turbulent flow cf only for example bögli 1980 fiorillo 2014 in our case the turbulent flow occurred for the high pressure developed during the earthquake sequence in general in fractured and karst systems high pressures corresponding to high piezometric heads are dissipated through an increase in discharge which rapidly empties the karstic voids and cavities where turbulent flow prevails the emptying of these cavities goes in parallel to the decrease of the discharge the latter phenomena are due to the rapid decline of the head and to the contribution to discharge of the thinner fractures and matrix where the darcian flow prevails cf ford and williams 2013 kresic and bonacci 2010 therefore a rapid transition occurs from turbulent to darcian flow described respectively by eqs 3 and 1 in the case of the nera river as the recession process proceeds the post earthquake mrc eq 1 and fig 7 does not evolve to the pre earthquake mrc turbulent discharge continues below the pre earthquake mrc fig 7 this behavior suggests that the seismic sequence caused a rapid pressure increase and a permanent or semi permanent variation of the hydrogeological properties in our opinion the earthquake could have caused an increase of the base aquifer permeability so that the flow velocity remains for a longer time in the turbulent regime referring to the geological map in fig 2 and assuming that the ptvt is a no flow boundary of the aquifer feeding the nera river the groundwater flows from south east to north west along the direct faults the same interpretation is given by tarragoni 2006 boni et al 2010 and banzato 2015 litho structural setting governs groundwater flow directions which are parallel to the most important structural features as shown in fig 2 the base aquifer feeding the nera river was deeply affected by coseismic ruptures which have re activated the direct faults producing an uplift of few centimetres in the eastern part of the apennine ridge and a subsidence of about 0 20 m in the western part of it castelsantangelo sul nera area fig 5b in this framework microcracks unblocking of pre existing faults and fractures and new fracturing are responsible for surface and sub surface deformations which could have caused the permeability increase proposed above this hypothesis to prove more robustly is supported by the fact that the changes persisted for at least two years after the main shock fig 7 while the effects of the pressure increase during the earthquake should have disappeared much earlier 6 conclusions the 2016 seismic sequence affected the discharge of some rivers in central italy which are very important for hydroelectric energy production and drinking water purposes following the main conclusions drawn from the research the nera river experienced the highest discharges among the available historical observations which were followed by a rapid decrease i e rapid emptying of the reservoir during the 2017 and 2018 recession periods the post earthquake rate of change of the discharge rcd was about twice as fast as the pre earthquake value groundwater is an essential component of the nera river discharge cf for example boni et al 1986 di matteo et al 2017 this fact implies that the mechanisms of the groundwater release act not only during the recession periods when the effects of the described changes are easily visible fig 7 but also during the recharge periods i e during the high discharge seasons according to some geological cross section the analysis of coseismic deformations and river recession curves a presumable increase in aquifer permeability seems to be the main factor affecting the post earthquake river discharge the effect of which still persists after more than two years from the 2016 earthquake the river regime appears changed after the earthquake fig 7 shows that considering pre and post earthquake mrcs around the time 30 days the pre and post earthquake recession curves have the same value in the point where they cross after 30 days from that point around time t 60 days the post earthquake curve shows a discharge of about 10 smaller than that of the pre earthquake recession fig 7 the rapid 2017 and 2018 recession processes have been interrupted by the effect of late summer early autumn recharge preventing to see how the two recessions would have continued if the 2017 and 2018 recession processes persistin the future the data reported in fig 7 suggest that the river flow will be more variable than in the past i e during prolonged recessions the discharge will be smaller than in the past in such a case prolonged drought periods would cause significant problems for water using productive activities these findings are in some way a following up of a few recent papers regarding the post seismic hydrologic changes mohr et al 2017 presented the pre and post recession coefficient based on nathan and mcmahon 1990 in that study recession analysis did not support post seismic hydraulic conductivity changes recession process remained the same with no relevant changes of recession coefficients more recently ingebritsen and manga 2019 stated that controls on the magnitude of changes and subsequent evolution of permeability remain poorly documented and even the mechanisms are uncertain our results document an abrupt change of the discharge and presumably of the mechanism driving the recession we think that both phenomena probably are due to a permeability change which could have caused an increase of groundwater velocity shifting the flow from darcian to turbulent at present it is not known if these changes will be permanent or not and how they will evolve the discharge monitoring should continue in the next years and investigations should be extended to springs fed by base aquifers in both western and eastern part of the apennine ridge a larger scale study has to be carried out in the next future which can be useful to investigate the groundwater flow regime linked to geomechanical processes and to investigate the possible re activation of water bearing features indeed in the neighboring of our study area some additional discharge from groundwater reserves stored in the eastern base aquifers towards the western aquifers was recently hypothesized by valigi et al 2019 considering the complexity of the phenomenon studied and the scarcity of data in particular the small number of recession periods available we are aware that the interpretation advanced here is not the only one possible however beyond our uncertainties the fact remains that after the 2016 earthquakes the hydrogeological system has generated recession curves steeper than the pre earthquakes ones this change corresponds to a variation in the river regime especially important during drought periods when there is no recharge of the aquifers if the changes here documented will persist in the next years the local management of water resources will have to be reviewed after properly finalized researches this kind of study requires extensive data regarding rivers and springs unfortunately at present most of this information is not available or not made available by some of the companies in charge of the local water management it is to be hoped that the severity of the emerging problems related to water in the upper nera river not limited to the one here discussed cf just for example green et al 2011 la jeunesse et al 2019 will convince public and private agencies of the need to implement other hydro meteorological stations and to make environmental data public

5690,the 2016 2017 seismic sequence in central italy caused the reactivation of a complex nnw sse trending wsw dipping normal fault system associated with relevant coseismic ruptures the seismic sequence significantly affected the groundwater circulation hosted in limestone aquifers based on the data available in may 2019 this work aims to contribute to understanding how the reactivation of the seismogenic faults has influenced the hydrological system of the upper nera river basin it appears that the seismic sequence changed the recession processes of the nera river post seismic recession curves are described by straight lines non darcian flow while the pre seismic ones follow the exponential function darcian flow after the earthquake the system empties i e the storage decreases at a faster rate than before this effect persists after more than two years from the 2016 earthquake according to some geological cross sections the analysis of coseismic deformations and recession curves a presumable increase in aquifer permeability seems to be the main factor affecting the post earthquake river discharge if the non darcian recession process continues in the future the river flow will be more variable than in the past causing significant problems to water using productive activities this because during prolonged drought periods the fast decrease of the dynamic water storage would produce discharges lower than in the past the results here reported can contribute to the understanding of the medium long term evolution of this particular hydrological system as well as of other similar ones and could be useful to better managing the groundwater resources keywords groundwater seismic sequence central italy recession curve aquifer permeability nera river 1 introduction the decrease or increase in river flow spring discharge and groundwater level are relatively common effects following earthquakes of medium to high magnitude due to the recurrence of hydrogeological events related to earthquakes the topic is more and more investigated e g rojstaczer and wolf 1992 king and muir wood 1993 manga 2001 wang and manga 2015 he and singh 2019 as reported by mohr et al 2017 near surface hydro seismological processes may provide important insights into the regional hydrological cycle in italy some studies regarded the response of hydrogeological systems following the main historical seismic events which affected the apennine area e g oddone 1915 celico 1981 esposito et al 2001 carro et al 2005 amoruso et al 2011 adinolfi falcone et al 2012 la vigna 2013 de luca et al 2018 barberio et al 2017 petitta et al 2018 valigi et al 2019 the dynamic of hydrogeological systems after earthquakes cannot be generalized causes and effects differ from case to case based on the literature regarding global earthquakes manga and wang 2007 summarized the main causes of changes in water flow rates of systems in response to earthquakes among these very important are the release of crustal fluids following elastic coseismic deformations e g muir wood and king 1993 the increase in water pressure following the rise in the hydraulic gradient in the aquifer cf nur 1974 king and muir wood 1993 the changes in permeability on the rocks near the surface due to microcracks unblocking of pre existing fractures and fracture cleaning tokunaga 1999 sato et al 2000 adinolfi falcone et al 2012 in general permeability at a regional scale tends to recover over time close to that before the earthquake manga et al 2012 this process occurs from a few minutes geballe et al 2011 to several years manga and rowland 2009 in some case hydrological changes persist several years after the earthquake indicating that earthquake induced enhancements of permeability in the shallow crust are persistent and widespread rojstaczer et al 1995 in addition to the causes listed above according to wang and manga 2015 earthquakes can breach the seals between neighbouring compartmented aquifers coseismic dislocation and spatial variation of the volumetric deformation affect the hydrological regime and groundwater pattern cf pece and tranfaglia 2012 there is a possibility that even very low energy earthquakes may produce noticeable effects gosar and brenčič 2013 report the enigmatic case of a watercourse in a karst area that dried up for two days in conjunction with a flood followed by an earthquake of magnitude ml 0 6 the earthquake with the hypocenter around one hundred meters deep would have been caused by an increase in interstitial pressures during the flood in the apennine area central italy some rivers and springs are fed by compartmented aquifers or by hydraulically connected aquifers hosted in limestone rocks boni et al 1986 cencetti et al 1989 di matteo et al 2013 di matteo et al 2017 the earthquake occurred in central italy on october 26 30 2016 produced several coseismic effects including dynamic changes on groundwater and surface water systems referring to fig 1 for location a few months after the main shock the following hydrogeological effects have been recognized the decrease of the discharge of some rivers and springs in the eastern part of the apennine ridge bocchino 2019 giacopetti et al 2019 the rise of the water table in the norcia plain valigi et al 2019 the disappearance or the reduction of the discharge of perched springs giacopetti et al 2019 the reappearance of torbidone spring which was without natural outflow since the 1979 norcia earthquake cf console et al 2017 valigi et al 2019 the increase of the discharge of the nera river including the main tributaries and that of some springs located in the upper part of the catchment cf checcucci et al 2017 petitta et al 2018 the observed hydrogeological changes following the 2016 earthquake in central italy are still in evolution the nera river represents a tangible example of groundwater surface waters interaction in an area with medium high seismicity the flow of the nera river even during the dry season or prolonged droughts decreases slowly and the river is an essential and reliable regional water resource for multipurpose water supply most of the course of the nera river runs in a deep valley trough limestone formations these constitute huge aquifers that feed the river in practice the nera is a set of permanent linear springs fed by large limestone aquifers boni et al 1986 the study of recession curves can give some information on key hydrogeological parameters such as the hydraulic conductivity the effective porosity and the water stored in the aquifer in this framework the present study aims to contribute to the knowledge of the effects of earthquakes on limestone groundwater systems the main goal is to study the regional pattern of streamflow taking into account pre and post seismic river recession curves geological structural setting and coseismic dislocations and deformations produced by the 2016 earthquake in the highest part of nera river catchment 2 geological setting and seismicity 2 1 geological setting the study area is located in central italy along the umbria marche apennines the umbria marche fold and thrust belt was formed during the late miocene early pliocene compressional phase lavecchia et al 1988 and was followed by late pliocene quaternary extension e g pauselli et al 2006 cosentino et al 2010 the stratigraphic succession of the investigated part of the apennines can be divided mainly into two main geological domains the umbria marche carbonate and pelagic domain at the hanging wall of the regional m sibillini thrust hereafter mst fig 2 and the laga foredeep domain at the footwall of the mst fig 2 we have grouped the main stratigraphic formations fms in nine hydrogeological complexes as reported in fig 3 the umbria marche domain is composed of upper triassic evaporites anhydrites and dolomites evaporites complex up to 2000 m thick anidriti di burano fm and raethavicula contorta beds this complex is not exposed in the external sector of the chain and it ischaracterized by low permeability for the anydrites and moderate permeability for dolostones fig 3 the sequence continues with shallow water carbonates calcare massiccio fm lower jurassic upwards through a pelagic domain characterized by condensed and complete successions with variable lithologies and thicknesses santantonio 1994 bigi et al 2011 the corniola fm deposited in structural lows overlapping the calcare massiccio fm composes the complete sequence it consists of grey or dark brown micritic limestones arranged in medium thick beds with chert the calcare massiccio and corniola formations are characterized by high relative permeability and represent the basal aquifer of the region basal limestones complex fig 3 the basal aquifer reaches a maximum thickness of about 900 m at m vettore and m bove upward the succession continues with the marly siliceous limestones complex which includes rosso ammonitico marne del serrone calcari a posidonia and calcari diasprigni formations marly limestones and siliceous limestones having low relative permeability characterize these formations the high bathymetric relief of the jurassic paleomorphology of the pelagic basins was leveled during the deposition of the maiolica fm maiolica complex fig 3 this complexoutcrops over large areas and due to high permeability for fracturation represents the middle aquifer the thickness of this complex is variable ranging from 150 200 m for the structural high maiolica to 350 400 m above the complete jurassic succession pierantoni et al 2013 on top of the maiolica complex there is the marne a fucoidi fm it is composed of grey green and red marls clayey marls and marly limestones for an average thickness of 80 m having low relative permeability marne a fucoidi complex fig 3 above the marne a fucoidi the scaglia complex scaglia bianca and scaglia rossa fms has an average thickness of about 400 m it is characterized by a moderate relative permeability above the scaglia complex there are the scaglia variegata and scaglia cinerea fms made up bymarly calcareous rocks having low relative permeability marly calcareous complex miocene marly units and the laga fm close the complete succession miocene marly units are characterized by prevalent marly formations with an average thickness of 250 m bisciaro schlier marne con cerrogna and marne a pteropodi fms bigi et al 2011 laga fm outcrops in the laga domain at the footwall of the mst fig 2 most of these formations are characterized by moderate or low permeability sandstones and marls fig 3 the stratigraphic setting described above was deformed in the miocene compressional phase producing the umbria marche fold and thrust belt the compressive structures show thrust belt morphologies the geometries of which are simple and well documented in the literature koopman 1983 lavecchia 1985 calamita and deiana 1988 centamore et al 1991 calamita et al 1994a mazzoli et al 2005 pierantoni et al 2005 tavani et al 2008 pierantoni et al 2013 porreca et al 2018 in the study area the umbria marche sequence overthrusts the laga sequence through arc shaped major thrusts namely the mst koopman 1983 lavecchia 1985 with eastward convexity the main detachment is localized at the base of the triassic evaporites sequence and involves the whole sedimentary sequence deformed in ne verging anticlines these anticlines are characterized by overturned forelimbs and gently west dipping backlimbs associated with thrusts the subsequent extensional tectonics was superimposed on the compressional structures since the late pliocene nw se trending normal faults have been responsible for the formation of large intermontane basins in which late pliocene quaternary continental sediments are deposited the strong link between topography and displacements along the principal normal faults gives evidence of activity in the last 2 my calamita et al 1994b cavinato and celles 1999 roberts and michetti 2004 according to aringoli et al 2007 catchment processes during the last 80 years the observation period considered in our work have been less substantial than those that occurred during previous centuries finally the main dam in the area c le preci hydroelectric bypass was built in 1929 before the construction of the oldest stream gauges located about 500 m upstream of the dam fig 4 b this issue is discussed later overall morphological and anthropic changes over the last 80 years did not cause any relevant role in the hydrogeological processes occurring in the upper nera river 2 2 historical seismicity numerous bibliographic sources testify that the studied area is affected by medium high seismicity monachesi 1987 bertolaso and boschi 2007 rovida et al 2016 in fig 1 and table 1 we report the main historical events of the area in the following we describe the principal earthquakes occurred in the area since 14th century among the oldest earthquakes of which we have written memory there is a very strong one occurred on december 4 1328 that affected norcia and several valnerina s centers in the same area from 5 november 1599 to 19 january 1600 numerous earthquakes of similar intensity occurred between norcia and cascia also felt in the surrounding areas the major shock occurred on the night of 5 6 november and caused the collapsing of more than forty houses in the cascia village and serious damage to all the other buildings numerous strong replicas but which did not cause further significant damages occurred until january 1600 a very strong seismic event occurred on october 7 1639 near amatrice in the upper tronto valley the shock lasted a quarter of an hour and caused about 500 deaths on october 14 1639 at about the same time as the earthquake of the previous week there was probably a second shock the seismic sequence of january february 1703 located in umbria and abruzzo was one of the most significant of the last millennium for central italy the greatest events took place on 14 and 16 january and on 2 february 1703 the event of 14 january involved a vast area of umbria and lazio roughly between norcia and amatrice the norcia and cascia area were struck on the morning of june 27 1719 by an earthquake which produced large cracks on new buildings built after the events of 1703 the earthquake of 12 may 1730 was very violent causing damage not only to cascia and norcia where the bell tower of the church of san benedetto fell but also throughout the surrounding territory on september 3 1815 there was a seismic crisis in the area of norcia which was its epicenter the event started in the night and interested norcia and many other countries on the morning of february 14 1838 greatest damages occurred as a consequence of an earthquake located west of norcia various replicas were felt in foligno during the following day and night and on 17 february a few days before august 22nd of 1859 in norcia various earthquakes of a medium intensity began to be felt and at 1 32 in the afternoon a violent event of duration of 6 7 s occurred the event was devastating and the replicas continued almost daily for about a year in mid november 1859 and in may 1860 two very strong events occurred in the same area on the evening of the 23rd february 1879 at 7 30 pm a shock lasting 10 s interested norcia on september 12 1898 an earthquake struck small towns near visso the earthquake of november 16 1916 occurred in the territory of rieti but involved some umbrian cities including cascia and its territory the earthquake of september 19 1979 severely affected some small mountain villages in the valnerina for some of these seismic events a relation with the activity of torbidone spring has been found console et al 2017 the torbidone spring is mentioned since 1350 highlighting its periodicity of about seven years after the strong earthquake of 1859 a few authors reported how the waters ceased to flow but reappeared after a short time turbid and earthy pointing out that after this phenomena earthquake the waters remained intermittent but no longer periodic console et al 2017 the intermittence of torbidone has continued until 1979 when following the seismic event of september 19 the springs disappeared completely console et al 2017 and references therein 2 3 the 2016 seismic sequence of central italy the seismic sequence started on 24 august 2016 with the mw 6 0 mainshock located close to the amatrice village tinti et al 2016 lavecchia et al 2016 the mainshock nucleated along a sw dipping normal fault belonging to the northern segment of the mt gorzano fault gf with an epicenter located within the turbiditic laga basin lavecchia et al 2016 during this event primary coseismic ruptures were observed along the mt vettore fault system vf in the carbonate domain above the mst pucci et al 2017 brozzetti et al 2019 differently along the well known active gf evidence of coseismic ruptures was discontinuous or absent livio et al 2016 pucci et al 2016 on october 26th a mw 5 9 an earthquake nucleated north of the m vettore m bove faults vf close to the town of visso the seismic sequence culminated on october 30th with the mw 6 5 mainshock close to the norcia town this event is due to the reactivation of the vf located in the hangingwall of the mst it produced significant primary coseismic ruptures chiaraluce et al 2017 ferrario and livio 2018 iezzi et al 2018 villani et al 2018 brozzetti et al 2019 coseismic displacements an average of about 0 44 m and peak of about 2 1 m were observed for a total length of about 27 km with n135 160 striking surface ruptures these ruptures show a prevalent dip slip kinematics denoting an extension axis trend of n233 villani et al 2018 brozzetti et al 2019 according to the database of national institute of geophysics and volcanology of italy ingv http cnt rm ingv it en the two main shocks occurred at the end of october 2016 at a depth of about 10 km 3 material and methods 3 1 geological model and vertical displacement the construction of the geological model was firstly based on a revision of the existing cartography of the area subsequently using the geological map of the sibillini mountains pierantoni et al 2013 we have created a grid of 10 geological sections all the geological maps and the cross sections were elaborated using the software move midland 2017 the geological reconstruction comprises the main structural elements such as sibillini thrust and the seismogenic faults reactivated by the seismic sequence i e mt bove vettore fault system and the main hydrogeological elements top maiolica fm and top corniola fm surfaces representing the top of the main aquifers particularly important is the top of corniola fm considering that it represents the top of basal limestones complex composed by corniola and calcare massiccio fms on the reconstructed geological sections we report the distribution of seismic events and related coseismic ruptures as well as the vertical displacement profiles as inferred by valerio et al 2018 and bignami et al 2019 using insar data collected from 24 august 2016 to 30 november 2016 3 2 hydrological and climate data daily stream levels of the nera river and of the main tributary ussita river as well as thermo pluviometric data were collected from the sirmip on line monitoring network civil protection agency of marche region central italy rating curves of stream gauges managed by sirmip are available from january 2015 these rating curves have been used to transform river levels h into stream discharge data q the sirmip data do not correspond to the actual total water yield of the aquifer feeding the nera river upstream of the gauging station there is the san chiodo spring fig 4a from which a variable quantity of water is taken for drinking water purposes in this framework to obtain the actual discharges of the nera river the withdrawals from san chiodo spring were added to the sirmip stream discharges measured at section i1 see fig 4a for the location according to information reported in d r 35 2018 et seq 0 150 m3 s were added to the data from january 2015 to february 2018 and 0 200 m3 s from march 2018 up today in addition to recent monitoring data historical discharges from servizio idrografico e mareografico nazionale simn monitoring network working during 1928 1943 period have been used these monitoring stations i3 and i4 in fig 4a nowadays are not operating despite being located in key hydrological sections confluence between ussita and nera rivers fig 4a regarding the discharge data of the 1930s we did not use the rating curves we considered the discharges published at the time in the official yearly reports by simn according to those publications the discharge data from 1933 forwards are reliable simn published a validated rating curve in 1933 and we found four recession periods in the summers of years 1933 1935 1936 1938 the historic stream level data were manually acquired from a staff gauge one reading per day despite the efforts to obtain accurate hydrometric measurements the accuracy of readings by contact gauges such as staff gauges and non contact gauges such as ultrasonic gauges diminishes as velocity and surge increase due to standing waves both instruments collect water level data with the same precision which is not better than 5 mm cf hamilton and moore 2013 according to léonard et al 2000 and schmidt 2002 any river discharge measurement used to calibrate a rating curve is affected by an uncertainty of about 5 as shown in next sections in order to investigate how historic as well as more recent discharge data are comparable each other the hydrograph visual inspection during recession periods coupled with some statistical analysis have been used for validating streamflow data as for the case of nera river this approach is useful when the different data sets have not run in parallel for some period of time fig 4c shows the location and the basic information of the main hydro meteorological monitoring stations in the highest part of the nera river catchment to estimate the water surplus s before and after the earthquake sequence we analysed the available monthly rainfall and temperature data unfortunately as commonly occurs in the apennines only a few high altitude meteorological stations are present and often their data are not reliable di matteo et al 2013 as only rainfall and temperature data are available we estimated monthly evapotranspiration using the well known method by thornthwaite and mather 1955 in such situations where data concerning radiation air humidity etc necessary to apply more modern methods are not available the thornthwaite and mather approach is still useful e g shuttleworth 2007 di matteo et al 2017 the computation of actual monthly evapotranspiration etr was carried out by using software developed by čadro 2016 3 3 conceptual models for stream recession curves the analysis of river discharge data during recession periods is particularly useful in the case of hard rocks where flow is controlled by the fracture network and no specific information about hydraulic conductivity and specific yield data are available bonacci 1993 dragoni et al 2015 di matteo et al 2017 the shape of the recession curve can give information about the hydrogeological properties of the reservoir at least in terms of average or equivalent values various conceptual models of the reservoir can be used to describe the recession curves based on these models several equations have been published in the literature such as the simple exponential formula ef boussinesq 1877 maillet 1905 the hyperbolic or quadratic formula qf boussinesq 1903 and the straight line equation coutagne 1948 bonacci 1987 the ef and qf functions are based on darcian laminar flow while the straight line on non darcian turbulent flow in theory ef and qf equations are not appropriate for karstic or fractured rocks anyway if hydraulic gradients and velocity are low both equations clearly describe the recession process also in fractured rocks cf scanlon et al 2003 rehrl and birk 2010 dragoni et al 2013 often as the recession period proceeds the process is described by different equations and or by the same equation having more than one recession coefficient this case can be explained considering that as the saturated thickness inside the reservoir decreases the average hydraulic conductivity the effective porosity and the geometric properties of the reservoir size and shape may change bonacci 1987 in the years after earthquakes river discharge can show the same or a different recession coefficient compared with that before the earthquake making it a useful indicator to understand the hydro seismological processes 4 results 4 1 geological model and vertical displacement after the 2016 earthquake some surface topography changes deformations and several seismic induced rockfalls occurred in the sibillini mountains the biggest landslide occurred two kilometres downstream the visso village where about 70 000 m3 of debris produced by a rockfall dammed the nera river producing a small lake romeo et al 2017 this landslide did not affect the surface drainage patterns of the study area regarding the surface deformations fig 5 shows the three geological cross sections representative of the main structural elements thrusts and normal faults which have conditioned the geometry and the compartmentalization of the main aquifers of the area the area is characterized by complex geological structures that were formed during the late miocene compressional events successively during the quaternary extensional tectonics these structures have been dissected by normal faults the effects of these two tectonic processes are well recognisable in the sections of fig 5 above each section the distribution of the displacement along the vertical component is reported as deduced by insar data valerio et al 2018 bignami et al 2019 these data are useful to identify the sectors that were subjected to the subsidence or uplift during the seismic sequence including the mainshocks from august 24 to october 30 2016 these variations of elevation could have altered the groundwater drainage significantly the wsw ene oriented section a a and the wnw ese b b sections show that the mesozoic sequence has been involved in a thrust tectonic with a prevalent vergence toward eastern sectors this tectonic phase has promoted the formation of anticline structures on the hangingwall of the main thrusts i e the m sibillini and pizzo tre vescovi thrusts with a variable displacement ranging from hundreds of meters ptvt fig 5a b up to some kilometres mst fig 5b in particular the mst is generally considered as ano flow boundary between the fractured carbonates and the siliciclastic laga sequence the compressional structures were dissected by high angle normal faults characterized by a throw of 200 800 m promoting a juxtaposition of formations with different permeability even if a lateral continuity is preserved for the base limestones complex as shown in fig 5a b in particular we have recognized three main normal faults which were re activated in a different way during the 2016 seismic sequence and that have probably influenced the hydrogeological properties of the base aquifer these faults affect the hangingwall of the mst and intercept the ptvt in the central part of the study area fig 2 and are called f1 f2 and f3 from east to the west fig 5a b c as fig 5c shows the basal aquifer is dislocated by the normal faults with different throws but a lateral continuity of the aquifer is still preserved along the n s direction in fig 5a b the vertical displacement profiles are almost orthogonal to the main structural elements the profiles show that the sectors located to the west of the seismogenic normal faults had significant subsidence up to a value of about 0 35 m in correspondence of f2 and f3 in the eastern sectors from the ptvt to the mst there is an uplift at most of a few centimetres the n s section shows that the whole sector had a subsidence from 0 10 m in the northern part to 0 50 m in the southern part fig 5c 4 2 effect of seismic sequence on river hydrograph fig 6 a shows the daily discharge values of the nera river section i1 in fig 4b registered by sirmip and the main earthquakes occurred during the 2016 2017 sequences in central italy the seismic sequence of august 24 2016 was followed by an increase of the river discharge of about 1 m3 s events 1 2 in fig 6a it lasted up to the seismic sequences occurred at the end of october 2016 events 3 4 and 5 in fig 6a and their aftershocks in detail after the visso and norcia earthquakes respectively mw 5 9 and 6 5 an increase of the river discharge from about 4 8 m3 s october 25 2016 to 9 5 m3 s november 11 2016 occurred the discharge of the nera river at section i1 doubled in a few weeks reaching the highest value among the available data in the same period most of the discharge increase was supplied by the base aquifer feeding the nera river in the castelsantangelo sul nera area fig 2 in fact duringthe weeks after the norcia earthquake the discharge of san chiodo spring cf figs 2 and 4 for the location increased of 2 34 m3 s petitta et al 2018 this discharge corresponds to about the 50 of the flow increase registered at section i1 the torre orsina data confirm the exceptionality of discharges this stream gauging is located about 50 km downstream of station i1 where the catchment area is 1442 km2 and the discharge data set begins in 1926 cencetti et al 1989 in spite of the low rainfall during november 2016 the average discharge was around 31 m3 s checcucci et al 2017 about 25 higher than the average value of november in the first months after the mainshocks the increase of the discharge is not linked to the groundwater recharge the water surplus s during october december 2016 period was about 100 mm 3 months 36 lower than the mean surplus calculated on the 2007 2018 period ispra 2017 valigi et al 2019 and bocchino 2019 also highlighted low rainfall and low recharge during the post earthquake period the seismic sequence of january 18 2017 earthquakes 6 9 in fig 6a did not cause any further discharge variation this behaviour is probably due to the distance of the earthquakes epicentres about 55 km south from visso and to the low amount of energy released compared to the norcia earthquake the streamflow increase persisted several months after the mainshock the epicentre of which was very close to the nera river catchment after the rising limb discharges decreased during the first post earthquake recession period summer 2017 thanks to the stream gauge i2 starting from july 2017 cf fig 4 it has been possible to reconstruct the discharge data of nera river alone by subtracting the flow data from i1 and i2 stream gauges the reliability of this synthetic hydrograph was checked by carrying out a few instantaneous flow measurements using an electromagnetic current meter ott mf pro the instrument accuracy is 2 of the measured value range of velocity 0 3 m s and 4 of the measured value velocity from 3 5 m s as fig 6b shows the instantaneous measurements fall on the synthetic hydrograph confirming the quality of the reconstructed series 4 3 pre and post earthquake recession curves to investigate hydrogeological changes induced by earthquakes on the groundwater system feeding the nera river pre and post seismic river recession curves have been analysed having in mind to build a master recession curve mrc as long as possible the use of individual recession curves derived from limited time periods in most cases may describe the recession process only partially cf for instance tallaksen 1995 gregor and malik 2012 in this framework we collected five pre seismic river recession curves years 1933 1935 1936 1938 and 2016 and two post seismic 2017 and 2018 unfortunately due to the sporadic functioning of the stations no other recession periods are available the recession curves were identified initially by visual inspection of the measured hydrographs fig 6b subsequently to be sure that the periods of recession had nil or negligible recharge the recession periods were compared to the months during which the water surplus according to thornthwaite mather method was zero fig 6b the comparison has shown that all the recessions detected by visual inspection were part of the months without water surplus fig 6b shows that both in 2017 and 2018 the duration of the recession curves of the nera river is shorter than that of its tributary the ussita river this fact indicates that the nera catchment received some rain and some recharge ahead of the ussita for this reason in our analysis we considered only the shorter periods when both nera and ussita had no recharge based on visual inspection of the available hydrographs in numerical and semilogarithmic scale the recession periods were analyzed by fitting both the simple exponential ef and straight line models to the discharge data of each available recession curve the root mean square error rmse was the best fit selection criterion used to assign each curve to one of the two models the best fit analysis showed that the pre earthquake recessions follow the ef model while the post earthquake ones follow the straight line model after sorting the recession periods from the highest discharge to the lowest the mrcs of the pre and post recessions have been assembled according to the strip method singh 1989 tallaksen 1995 posavec et al 2006 the overlapping of the single recession curves was done time step by time step and the chosen time shifting values of the curves correspond to the best results according to the rmse criterion fig 7 shows clearly that the pre and post seismic mrcs of the nera river differ notably considering the hydrogeological system upstream of section i1 as a whole the main differences between the pre and post recession curves are the following the units for time and discharge are respectively days d and m3 d a the pre earthquake mrc is described by the ef formula eq 1 this equation corresponds to a linear reservoir where at any time t the discharge is proportional to the volume of water wt stored in the reservoir above the exit point eq 2 cf coutagne 1948 1 q t q o e α e t 4 94640 e 0 0025 t rmse 4752 m 3 d 2 q t α e w t where qt and qo discharge at time t d and at the beginning of recession period αe maillet recession coefficient 1 d wt water stored in the reservoir at time t m3 as previously discussed the uncertainty of modern and historical discharge data is about 5 léonard et al 2000 schmidt 2002 in the framework of these uncertainties it is interesting to point out that the 2016 pre seismic recession data fall on the mrc obtained with the data of the 1930s eq 1 this fact provides a useful consistency check of the available discharge values moreover this behaviour confirms that the hydrogeological system feeding the nera river has not been influenced by anthropogenic changes that occurred over the years e g fluent hydroelectric plant d1 in fig 4a b b the post earthquake mrc is described by a straight line eq 3 similar to that produced by a tank following the torricelli law cf just for example coutagne 1948 or the more recent review paper by fiorillo 2014 this emptying modality of the reservoir is not present in the data available before the seismic sequence it is appropriate to remark that there is a notable difference between a reservoir following the torricelli law stricto sensu and a real hydrological system in the former the loss of energy during the flow is nil or negligible in the latter the loss of energy is high and cannot be neglected this point obvious on a theoretical basis has been discussed by a few researchers as e g bonacci 1987 for this reason we named eq 3 torricelli like function tlf and αtl the corresponding recession coefficient eq 3 corresponds to a reservoir where at any time t the discharge is proportional to the square root of the water stored in the reservoir eq 4 3 q t q o α tl t 563328 14 2300 85 t rmse 11145 6 m 3 d 4 q t 2 α tl w t where qt and qo discharge at time t d and at the beginning of recession period αtl torricelli like recession coefficient m3 d2 wt water stored in the reservoir at time t m3 5 discussion despite the hydrogeological system feeding the nera river is complex and has probably not reached a new equilibrium after the 2016 seismic sequence some considerations can be made by analyzing pre and post seismic mrcs after the earthquake during no recharge periods the system empties i e the storage decreases at a rate faster than prior to the seismic sequence fig 7 the first derivative of eqs 1 and 3 gives the rate of change of the discharge rcd during the recession phase eqs 5 and 6 describe the rcd for both pre and post seismic recession periods 5 rc d e α e q o e α e t α e q t 0 0025 t m 3 d 2 6 rc d tl α tl 2300 85 m 3 d 2 applying the eqs 5 and 6 at the intersection of the ef and tlf master curves i e when both curves have the same discharge qt 494640 m3 d fig 7 we can quantify the rcd of both processes for that discharge the post earthquake rcd is 2300 85 m3 d2 about twice as fast as the pre earthquake value 1236 6 m3 d2 from another point of view the time necessary to halve the flow rates and the theoretical reservoir dynamic storage is a good indicator of how fast the two emptying processes are let us consider the discharge where the two mrcs cross qt 494640 m3 d cf fig 7 applying eqs 1 and 2 for the ef process the halving time for both discharge and dynamic water storage is 278 days applying eqs 3 and 4 at the same discharge for tlf process the halving time of the river flow is about 107 days while for the dynamic storage the halving time is about 63 days note that the halving time in the case of ef is constant in time while in the case of tlf it decreases as time passes this situation implies that if the tlf recession persists in the future the river flow will be more variable than in the past and the hydropower plants and fisheries located along the river will have not negligible problems during prolonged drought periods considering the different equations describing pre and post recession periods we have to conclude that in some way the seismic events changed the hydrogeological properties of the reservoir feeding the nera river upstream of the gauging station a possible explanation for the change from ef to tlf i e from darcian flow to non darcian flow could be that the earthquake caused an increase of water pressure into the aquifer and thus an increase of the hydraulic gradient there is a general agreement that a recession phase described by a straight line tlf equation is due to turbulent flow cf only for example bögli 1980 fiorillo 2014 in our case the turbulent flow occurred for the high pressure developed during the earthquake sequence in general in fractured and karst systems high pressures corresponding to high piezometric heads are dissipated through an increase in discharge which rapidly empties the karstic voids and cavities where turbulent flow prevails the emptying of these cavities goes in parallel to the decrease of the discharge the latter phenomena are due to the rapid decline of the head and to the contribution to discharge of the thinner fractures and matrix where the darcian flow prevails cf ford and williams 2013 kresic and bonacci 2010 therefore a rapid transition occurs from turbulent to darcian flow described respectively by eqs 3 and 1 in the case of the nera river as the recession process proceeds the post earthquake mrc eq 1 and fig 7 does not evolve to the pre earthquake mrc turbulent discharge continues below the pre earthquake mrc fig 7 this behavior suggests that the seismic sequence caused a rapid pressure increase and a permanent or semi permanent variation of the hydrogeological properties in our opinion the earthquake could have caused an increase of the base aquifer permeability so that the flow velocity remains for a longer time in the turbulent regime referring to the geological map in fig 2 and assuming that the ptvt is a no flow boundary of the aquifer feeding the nera river the groundwater flows from south east to north west along the direct faults the same interpretation is given by tarragoni 2006 boni et al 2010 and banzato 2015 litho structural setting governs groundwater flow directions which are parallel to the most important structural features as shown in fig 2 the base aquifer feeding the nera river was deeply affected by coseismic ruptures which have re activated the direct faults producing an uplift of few centimetres in the eastern part of the apennine ridge and a subsidence of about 0 20 m in the western part of it castelsantangelo sul nera area fig 5b in this framework microcracks unblocking of pre existing faults and fractures and new fracturing are responsible for surface and sub surface deformations which could have caused the permeability increase proposed above this hypothesis to prove more robustly is supported by the fact that the changes persisted for at least two years after the main shock fig 7 while the effects of the pressure increase during the earthquake should have disappeared much earlier 6 conclusions the 2016 seismic sequence affected the discharge of some rivers in central italy which are very important for hydroelectric energy production and drinking water purposes following the main conclusions drawn from the research the nera river experienced the highest discharges among the available historical observations which were followed by a rapid decrease i e rapid emptying of the reservoir during the 2017 and 2018 recession periods the post earthquake rate of change of the discharge rcd was about twice as fast as the pre earthquake value groundwater is an essential component of the nera river discharge cf for example boni et al 1986 di matteo et al 2017 this fact implies that the mechanisms of the groundwater release act not only during the recession periods when the effects of the described changes are easily visible fig 7 but also during the recharge periods i e during the high discharge seasons according to some geological cross section the analysis of coseismic deformations and river recession curves a presumable increase in aquifer permeability seems to be the main factor affecting the post earthquake river discharge the effect of which still persists after more than two years from the 2016 earthquake the river regime appears changed after the earthquake fig 7 shows that considering pre and post earthquake mrcs around the time 30 days the pre and post earthquake recession curves have the same value in the point where they cross after 30 days from that point around time t 60 days the post earthquake curve shows a discharge of about 10 smaller than that of the pre earthquake recession fig 7 the rapid 2017 and 2018 recession processes have been interrupted by the effect of late summer early autumn recharge preventing to see how the two recessions would have continued if the 2017 and 2018 recession processes persistin the future the data reported in fig 7 suggest that the river flow will be more variable than in the past i e during prolonged recessions the discharge will be smaller than in the past in such a case prolonged drought periods would cause significant problems for water using productive activities these findings are in some way a following up of a few recent papers regarding the post seismic hydrologic changes mohr et al 2017 presented the pre and post recession coefficient based on nathan and mcmahon 1990 in that study recession analysis did not support post seismic hydraulic conductivity changes recession process remained the same with no relevant changes of recession coefficients more recently ingebritsen and manga 2019 stated that controls on the magnitude of changes and subsequent evolution of permeability remain poorly documented and even the mechanisms are uncertain our results document an abrupt change of the discharge and presumably of the mechanism driving the recession we think that both phenomena probably are due to a permeability change which could have caused an increase of groundwater velocity shifting the flow from darcian to turbulent at present it is not known if these changes will be permanent or not and how they will evolve the discharge monitoring should continue in the next years and investigations should be extended to springs fed by base aquifers in both western and eastern part of the apennine ridge a larger scale study has to be carried out in the next future which can be useful to investigate the groundwater flow regime linked to geomechanical processes and to investigate the possible re activation of water bearing features indeed in the neighboring of our study area some additional discharge from groundwater reserves stored in the eastern base aquifers towards the western aquifers was recently hypothesized by valigi et al 2019 considering the complexity of the phenomenon studied and the scarcity of data in particular the small number of recession periods available we are aware that the interpretation advanced here is not the only one possible however beyond our uncertainties the fact remains that after the 2016 earthquakes the hydrogeological system has generated recession curves steeper than the pre earthquakes ones this change corresponds to a variation in the river regime especially important during drought periods when there is no recharge of the aquifers if the changes here documented will persist in the next years the local management of water resources will have to be reviewed after properly finalized researches this kind of study requires extensive data regarding rivers and springs unfortunately at present most of this information is not available or not made available by some of the companies in charge of the local water management it is to be hoped that the severity of the emerging problems related to water in the upper nera river not limited to the one here discussed cf just for example green et al 2011 la jeunesse et al 2019 will convince public and private agencies of the need to implement other hydro meteorological stations and to make environmental data public

5691,the impacts of glacier mass and area loss are assumed to affect stream hydrology and related ecosystems we applied wavelet analysis to high frequency time series of discharge conductivity turbidity air and water temperature in mountain streams influenced by a gradient of diverse glacier catchment coverages from 0 to 28 all parameters were recorded during 200 250 day period in 24 mountain streams in switzerland and ecuador we interpreted the range of glacier coverage as a proxy of glacier melt effect linked to modification in glacier cover based on a space for time substitution approach we used the diurnal variation power and frequency as hydrological parameters to quantify the intensity and occurrence of significant diurnal variations in the different mountain catchments our results show that the reduction in glacier cover would reduce the intensity and occurrence of diurnal variations in discharge turbidity and conductivity and the intensity of diurnal variations in water temperature discharge and conductivity were affected in a similar way while the impact on turbidity was less significant furthermore due to their different climatic regimes the diurnal discharge in the tropical andes was more impacted than in the alps indicating that the impacts of global change on glacier streams would be stronger in the tropical andes than in the alps keywords wavelet analysis space for time substitution hydrological parameters stream hydrology glacier retreat diurnal glacial flood 1 introduction glaciers represent important water reservoirs for downstream ecosystems where glacier melt contributes to regulate the runoff during the dry season kaser et al 2010 jansson et al 2003 glacier fed streams are characterized by high diurnal variations during the annual peak in discharge corresponding to the snow and glacier melt season hock 2005 while in snow fed mountain streams these variations occur generally earlier and for a shorter period due to the snow melt and the hydrological regime is more variable and precipitation dependent afterwards climate change triggers a global increase in mountain glacier shrinkage throughout the world including the alps and the tropical andes zemp et al 2019 recent geodetic mass balance observations showed that between 1980 and 2010 the glaciers of the swiss alps lost on average 0 62 m w e yr 1 fischer et al 2015 during the same period in the tropical andes rabatel et al 2013 reported that glaciers lost on average between 0 6 and 1 2 m w e yr 1 this considerable glacier mass loss will influence the downstream hydrology thus there is a need for focused studies on water availability and runoff and not only sea level rise milner et al 2017 warmer air temperatures are predicted to modify the timing of glacier shrinkage and the intensity of diurnal runoff oscillations milner et al 2017 jansson et al 2003 at the catchment scale glacial meltwater runoff will first increase as a result of higher ice melt then decrease until the disappearance of the glaciers thereby triggering changes in the hydrological regime of mountain meltwater characterized by higher variability due to precipitation and snowmelt as well as a higher sensitivity to droughts jost et al 2012 ragettli et al 2016 such changes will likely affect biogeochemical fluxes hood et al 2015 biodiversity cauvy

hydropower schaefli et al 2007 vergara et al 2007 fisheries shugar et al 2017 and water quality bizzotto et al 2009 to study the impacts of glacier melt effect on glacier fed streams several methods of time series analysis could be applied to stream hydrographs water turbidity temperature or electrical conductivity time series a fundamental approach is the study of the time series frequency spectrum using fourier decomposition as the spectrum describes the contribution of periodic signals of different frequencies to the time series and thus allows identifying periodicities cazelles et al 2008 however fourier decomposition assumes time series are stationary which is rarely the case with stream hydrographs for which periodicity changes depending on the time of the year and the presence of diurnal melt water variations lafreniere and sharp 2003 schaefli et al 2007 when analyzing non stationary time series wavelet analysis is often preferred in environmental sciences as it decomposes a time series in time frequency space and gives the evolution of the frequency spectrum of the signal as well as its changes of periodicity as a function of time torrence and compo 1998 wavelet analysis can also be used to examine the relationship between two signals and assess the phase shift between the signals at every frequency grinsted et al 2004 in this study we aimed to estimate the effect of reduction in glacier cover on the evolution of different hydrological parameters of mountain streams for this we performed wavelet analysis on time series of stream water depth discharge turbidity conductivity and temperature as well as air temperature in four catchments within the swiss alps the study catchments covered a wide range of gcc ranging from 0 to 28 which we used in a space for time substitution approach blois et al 2013 hood and berner 2009 currie 2001 to better understand and predict potential impacts of the reduction in glacier cover linked to climate change on the natural flow regime of mountain streams our aim was to assess the correlation between the hydrological quantities and estimate their evolution trends with glacier area loss we expected lower frequency and intensity of the diurnal variations of streamwater discharge electrical conductivity turbidity and possibly water temperature as gcc decreased in addition we compared our stream flow data with data previously published from streams in the ecuadorian andes to account for different climatic regimes and seasonalities cauvy fraunié et al 2013 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites we analyzed time series recorded in 11 streams in the swiss alps and 13 streams in the ecuadorian andes gcc of the study catchments ranged from 0 to 23 in ecuador and 0 to 28 in switzerland and the catchment area ranged between 0 05 and 23 km2 tables s 1 and s 2 all streams drained high alpine catchments with steep slopes and rocky terrain the sparse vegetation was dominated by low productive grassland and shrubs forest 15 coverage was only present in some of the swiss catchments 4 10 and 11 in fig 1 in switzerland we used data from 11 streams 1200 2200 m a s l in the cantons of vaud and valais fig 1 discharge in these catchments increases globally in may and june and decreases in august and september we analyzed data from march to october 2017 glacier coverage was measured using the 2012 corine land cover inventory büttner 2014 and ranged from 0 to 28 there were five sites with no gcc four sites with low 10 gcc no sites with medium gcc 10 gcc 20 and two sites with high 20 gcc fig

per month for our catchments to highlight the seasonality fig s 2 all the catchments were entirely snow covered in april 90 in may and june snow melted and no snow was left in champery the lowest site

glaciers and small patches of permanent snow above 2500 m a s l with close to constant area remained to contribute to the melt while the elevation of the glacier terminus for the swiss catchments ranges between 2200 vallon de nant and 2500 m a s l val ferret and valsorey in november 2017 the entire catchments were covered by snow again we used published data february to november 2010 from 13

accumulation and ablation occur all year round on inner tropical glaciers and there is no permanent or seasonal snow cover outside the glaciers favier et al 2004 francou et al 2004 rabatel et al 2013

located in the glacier foreland the comparison of the wavelet analysis outputs for discharge and streamwater depth at site 7 of antisana showed that the results were very similar cauvy fraunié et al 2013 therefore we used depth as an approximation for discharge for the ecuador streams we also compared the hydrological parameters of depth and discharge for the swiss streams and found very similar values which comforted this approach fig s 3 2 3 data analysis wavelet analysis is a time dependent spectral analysis where a time series is decomposed in time frequency space therefore the wavelet transform expresses a time series in a three dimensional space time x scale frequency y and power z cauvy fraunié et al 2013 the wavelet transform decomposes a signal over a mother wavelet function that is localized in time and frequency and can have its width adapted to the features to be analyzed daubechies 1990 cazelles et al 2008 decomposing a time series into time frequency space enables determination of both the dominant modes of variability and how those modes vary in time daubechies 1990 torrence and compo 1998 cazelles et al 2008 we applied the wavelet decomposition to our time series following torrence and compo 1998 time series were centered on zero and reduced by normalizing to their standard deviation so that they can be compared 1 g t g obs t μ σ where μ is the mean of the time series g obs t and σ its standard deviation a mother wavelet is a function of two parameters the time position τ and the scale a it can be expressed as ϕ a τ t 1 a ϕ t τ a the wavelet transform of a time series g obs t with respect to a chosen mother wavelet is performed as follows cazelles et al 2008 2 w g a τ 1 a g t ϕ a τ t d t where denotes the complex conjugate form the wavelet coefficients w g a τ represent the contributions of the scales the a values to the signal at different time positions the τ values the mother wavelet φ t has a unitary variance φ t 2 dt 1 and it verifies ϕ t d t 0 daubechies 1990 cazelles et al 2008 here we chose the morlet wavelet a non orthogonal continuous and complex wavelet function as it was particularly well adapted for hydrological time series analyses lafreniere and sharp 2003 cauvy fraunié et al 2013 it had a high resolution in frequency compared to other continuous wavelets cazelles et al 2008 which was relevant for our study as we intended to detect repeated water level variations at a diurnal scale cauvy fraunié et al 2013 the morlet wavelet consists of a plane wave modulated by a gaussian distribution 3 ϕ t π 1 4 e i 2 ω 0 t e t 2 2 where ω0 3 in analogy to fourier analysis the local wavelet power spectrum can be defined as the squared absolute value of the wavelet transform and calculated as 4 w g a τ 2 w g a τ w g a τ the main periodicity found in our time series occurred at 24 h fig 2 thus we were mainly interested in the daily variations of the power and thus we focused on scales corresponding to the 20 28 h period for this purpose we calculated the scale averaged wavelet power spectrum w g 2 defined as the weighted sum of the wavelet power spectrum over the wanted range of scales sj1 sj2 over the whole measurement period 5 w g 2 δ j δ t c j j 1 j j 2 w g s j 2 s j where δ j is the spacing between discrete scales δ t the time step of the time series and c the reconstruction factor specific to the mother wavelet it can be shown that for the morlet wavelet there is a direct relationship between the period or fourier wavelength λ and the scale s given by 6 λ 4 π s ω 0 2 ω 0 2 thus the following results were all given as a function of period the cone of influence coi is the region of the wavelet spectrum in which edge effects become important and is defined as the e folding time for the autocorrelation of wavelet power at each scale for the morlet wavelet this e folding time is equal to 2 s it is chosen so that the edge effects are negligible beyond this point fig 2 some of our time series also included gaps mostly due to issues with the sensors in this case we also used the e folding time to define the zone where the edge effects due to the padding are non negligible these zones were ignored in the quantitative study of our results to determine which diurnal variations were significant or not in the power spectrum we compared it with a red noise power spectrum using lag 1 autocorrelation which defines a 95 significance level above which the values of the power were considered significant further information on lag 1 autocorrelation and red noise background power spectra can be found in the work by torrence and compo 1998 wavelet analysis can also be used to compare the power spectra of two time series previously normalized and centered on zero to be comparable for this purpose we use the wavelet transform coherence defined as grinsted et al 2004 7 r 2 s s s 1 w xy s 2 s s 1 w x s 2 s s 1 w y s 2 where s is a smoothing operator given by torrence and webster 1999 and w xy w x w y this definition of the wavelet coherence makes it similar to a localized correlation coefficient in time frequency space grinsted et al 2004 however when applying the wavelet transform coherence to the raw time series only the larger scales remained significant in order to exploit the signal over all scales including at 24 h we normalized the wavelet power of the time series before calculating the wavelet transform coherence and the phase shift thus giving the same weight to all scales we then inverted the wavelet transform the resulting signal was the same as the initial one but the oscillations with smaller period including in the 24 h range were amplified we re applied the wavelet analysis and calculated the wavelet transform coherence the significance level was then estimated using monte carlo methods grinsted et al 2004 the significant diurnal variations correspond to high coherence between the two time series at the corresponding time and frequency the phase shift between the two signals could also be obtained from the wavelet transform coherence at each point of the time frequency space when it was significant fig 2 phase shift can be interpreted as the time between diurnal variations of the two studied variables when looking at 24 h oscillations there is a direct relationship between time and phase difference π 2 corresponding to a 6 hour and π to a 12 h time lag the results of the phase shift could be confirmed each time by comparing them with the raw signals to quantify the variations in the scale averaged wavelet power spectrum around 24 h we calculated two hydrological parameters hp cauvy fraunié et al 2013 1 the diurnal variation power dvp which is the area delimited by the scale averaged power curve divided by the significance level and 1 every day it can only be positive if the value is negative the diurnal power is brought to 0 this represents the daily amplitude of the 24 h period oscillations it can be expressed as 8 d v p t p o w e r t 20 28 s i g n i f i c a n c e l e v e l 20 28 1 i f power t 20 28 significancelevel 20 28 1 d v p t 0 i f power t 20 28 significancelevel 20 28 1 where t is the time and 20 28 the range of time scales over which the power and the significance level are averaged the significance level does not depend on time 2 the diurnal variation frequency which is the number of days when the averaged power curve at the 24 h scale is significant divided by the total number of days of the period of interest it gives the amount of days with significant diurnal variations during the period of interest in all what follows we measured this diurnal variation frequency over a sliding 30 day period to get a monthly value these two parameters were calculated every day for each variable and each stream they informed at each time of a time series on the proportion of days with significant 24 h oscillations as well as the intensity of these diurnal variations the diurnal variation power was not calculated for days without data the diurnal variation frequency ignored the days with gaps and it was not calculated if there was more than 50 of gaps within the 30 day period to avoid singularities we chose to group our streams in four categories non glacierized catchments gcc 0 catchments with a low glacier coverage 0 gcc 10 catchments with a medium glacier coverage 10 gcc 20 and catchments with a high glacier coverage gcc 20 no swiss site had a drainage area with a gcc between 10 and 20 therefore we only used the three other categories for switzerland for each group we took the average gcc and average diurnal variation power or frequency we analyzed the relationship between the hydrological parameters and gcc by applying a linear regression given by 9 hp b g c c c where b and c are the parameters of the linear regression a positive slope means higher intensity and or frequency of significant diurnal variations as gcc increases high slope values mean a higher contribution of gcc in these diurnal variations and thus a stronger impact on the parameter as glaciers lose area fig 3 3 results 3 1 influence of rain annual precipitation was similar in the swiss and ecuadorian catchments during the respective study periods table 1 rain events differently influenced the dynamics of the various parameters during or following a rain event the wavelet power of streamwater discharge electrical conductivity and turbidity was usually significant within the 20 28 h period but also at shorter periods fig 4 here we focus on the 20 28 h period unaffected by minor rain events as suggested by no immediate influence on the main daily discharge major rain events could affect the wavelet analysis at the 24 h scale cauvy fraunié et al 2013 by increasing the significant power at 24 h 5 to 15 of all rain events during the respective study periods were classified as significant i e more than 10 mm of rain per day the total number of days with precipitation ranged from 40 in some of the swiss catchments to 70 in ecuador the average daily rainfall for each catchment ranged within 2 1 and 3 9 mm day each of our study catchments had a similar proportion of days with significant rain 10 mm day close to 10 of the study period thus we assumed that the effects of rainfall were limited as the occurrence of significant rain events remained low and similarly affected the study catchments 3 2 relationships between hydrological variables in switzerland we observed similar increase in the diurnal variation power and frequency slopes of both discharge and conductivity from end of may to early july fig 5 in july slope values were close to their maximum the diurnal power slopes were at 40 for the discharge and 80 for electrical conductivity while the diurnal frequency slopes were at 0 04 for discharge and 0 04 for electrical conductivity slope values for electrical conductivity remained high during the melt season and started to decrease at mid august for streamwater turbidity slopes were positive from end of may to end of july up to 4 for power and 0 02 for frequency with several peaks recorded during the melt season from june to end of august fig 5 we calculated the wavelet transform coherence and the phase difference between discharge and conductivity from march 15 to october 5 2017 fig 6 when the phase difference has real values this means that the two time series are correlated at 24 h periods while gaps in the phase difference correspond to periods when the time series are not coherent furthermore the timing of the peaks of discharge and conductivity is given by the angle a positive angle means that the discharge peak comes before the conductivity peak and it is the contrary when the angle is negative the correlation between electrical conductivity and discharge was generally higher for catchments with glacier coverage when the coherence between discharge and electrical conductivity was significant the phase difference was mostly close to π or π corresponding to a phase opposition there is an exception for stream 8 in the val ferret catchment where electrical conductivity peaks between 6 and 12 h before discharge peaks π 2 in switzerland the patterns of the slopes of both hydrological parameters for air and streamwater temperature differed from the trend observed for discharge fig 7 the diurnal power slope for air temperature decreased from its maximum value of 220 in early april to nearly zero in june and then increased to 100 in august september the diurnal power slope for streamwater temperature increased from 200 in april to 600 in june decreased to 0 end of july and increased again to 300 mid september the pattern of the diurnal frequency slopes of air and streamwater temperature was similar and values were relatively low with a maximum of 0 01 for air temperature and 0 03 for water temperature due to significant 24 h oscillations recorded for all stream these patterns showed that streamwater temperature was dependent on air temperature for the frequency slope but was not related to discharge wavelet transform coherence applied to air temperature and discharge fig 8 for the swiss streams showed that when correlated no gaps in the phase peaks in air temperature occurred a few hours before discharge peaks this time shift tended to decrease during the melt season when applying the same approach to streamwater temperature and discharge patterns were exactly the same while for all catchments and for the whole period air and streamwater temperature were completely correlated and in phase fig 9 3 3 swiss alps versus inner tropical andes fig 10 shows the comparison between the slope values of the diurnal variation power and frequency as a function of gcc for streamwater depth in both swiss and ecuadorian catchments in the antisana catchment the slope was always positive with high values between february and early may and close to zero from june to mid september in switzerland in may most catchments were still almost entirely covered by snow similar values for power and frequency for diurnal variation suggest that there was no detectable change for the streamwater discharge across the various streams from mid june the snow retreated and disappeared in the lower non glacierized catchments while only glaciers and permanent snow remained in the glacierized catchments the slope of the hydrological parameters then increased from mid june to august the slopes of the linear regression of diurnal variation power were more variable in the inner tropical 0 200 than in the swiss 0 50 streams fig 10a the slopes of the linear regression of diurnal variation frequency for the swiss and the ecuadorian streams spanned a similar range 0 0 04 fig 10b therefore over the respective study periods streams in ecuador and switzerland exhibited similar diurnal frequency slope maxima while the amplitude of the diurnal variation power slope was higher in ecuador 4 discussion based on similar and low 10 of the study period significant rainfall occurrence at all our sites we assumed the impact of rainfall to be negligible cauvy fraunié et al 2013 the results of wavelet analysis indeed showed that for all variables rainfall had an impact on the 24 h period signal only when there was more than 10 mm day which happens rarely and in similar amounts at all our sites this might be different for other sites such as the eastern slopes of antisana where precipitation rate is higher even though the rain signals might not be diurnal in the swiss catchments discharge and streamwater conductivity variability were highly correlated wavelet coherence with a 24 h phase opposition fig 6 for streams with a high 20 gcc the diurnal variation power and frequency of both discharge and conductivity increased with increasing glacial influence suggesting that both discharge and conductivity were highly dependent on the diurnal glacial runoff occurring during the melt season lafreniere and sharp 2003 indeed in alpine catchments snow and ice meltwater characterized by very low conductivity increase stream discharge and decrease conductivity by diluting the groundwater base flow weijs et al 2013 gurnell and fenn 1985 this correlation was thus lower for streams with lower gcc 10 with the exception of stream 8 linked to lower diurnal variations in stream with more groundwater influence stream 8 showed a shifted phase relationship which could imply a more complex link between the two quantities we expected the discharge and turbidity to be related during the melt season as glacier fed streams usually exhibit high turbidity values due to the release of sediment particles located sub glacially and pro glacially delaney et al 2018 milner and petts 1994 in addition diurnal peaks in discharge would often remobilize fine material within the riverbed hood and berner 2009 milner and petts 1994 however low slope values for turbidity indicated no link or more complex link between turbidity pattern and glacial influence contrary to discharge and conductivity this lack of significant correlation might be due to gaps in the turbidity data of the snow fed catchments leading to uncertainties in the results there was a high correlation between air and water temperature for periods close to 24 h fig 9 thus air temperature impacted directly water temperature as they followed the same pattern for the diurnal frequency fig 7b which led to the observation that all streams whatever their gcc recorded significant oscillations with a period of 24 h blaen et al 2013 the peaks in water temperature in phase with the peaks in air temperature fig 9 occurred before the peaks in discharge showing that water temperature responded more rapidly to air temperature variations than changes in discharge for all streams blaen et al 2013 however the higher values of the diurnal power slope of water temperature during the melt periods showed that diurnal water temperature oscillations were enhanced by glacier or snowmelt which led to higher values of the diurnal power for higher gcc no relationship with the distance of the site from the glacier terminus was found as would have been expected fellman et al 2014 blaen et al 2013 probably due to too few sites covering a too little range of distances from glacier thus water temperature was predominantly affected by air temperature but also by meltwater williamson et al 2019 following a space for time substitution approach the slopes of the hydrological parameters provided a benchmark of the evolution of the hydrological variables in time when gcc decreased blois et al 2013 hood and berner 2009 in the swiss catchments the diurnal hydrological parameters of discharge and conductivity were similarly affected by the glacier melt effect with high slopes in july and august the slopes were lower during the melt for turbidity especially for the diurnal variation power suggesting a lower impact of glacier melt effect on turbidity several peaks were recorded during the melt season which corresponded to significant rainfall events resulting in very significant peaks in turbidity but over very short periods which could explain that the diurnal frequency slope was less affected this could be a consequence of unstable substrate on mountain slopes not affected by erosion from the glacier flow turbidity should depend on the geomorphology of the catchment indeed as the glaciers lose area they should also leave unstable moraine with a high erosion potential which could favor an increase in the diurnal turbidity peaks at least in the short term depending on the new catchment configuration milner et al 2017 geilhausen et al 2011 this lack of correlation could also partly be explained by the uncertainties on the turbidity data for snow fed catchments water temperature proved to be more sensitive to air temperature daily oscillations although the impact of discharge could also be seen as a result there should always be significant 24 h oscillations in water temperature of alpine streams due to air temperature even as glaciers lose area however the intensity of these diurnal variations should decrease when glaciers lose area the evolution of the diurnal power and frequency slopes as a function of time depended on the climatic zone in which the catchment was located from our comparison between the ecuadorian and swiss catchments it appeared that in terms of discharge slope values were higher in ecuadorian streams suggesting they would be more affected by changes in glacier cover during the melt season for switzerland glacier melt period occurred between june and october while snowmelt occurred between april and may by affecting all mountain catchments equally low slope values for ecuador higher slope values corresponded to the october may season with slightly more precipitation but most importantly increased melting vuille et al 2000 favier et al 2004 enhanced by warm episode of el niño event in 2010 rabatel et al 2013 the seasonality was different for the two regions but in both cases then higher slopes of the hydrological parameters during the main ablation season showed that the hydrology of the catchments would be more affected by glacier melt effect at this time of the year 5 conclusion the results of this analysis provided us with a first insight into the hydrological future of mountain streams in both the tropical andes and the alps in which diurnal power and frequency of variations in discharge conductivity and to a lesser degree turbidity decrease with glacier melt effect and diurnal power of variations in water temperature is also impacted we found that the impact of the reduction in glacier cover on stream hydrology would be greater in the andes than in the alps however our conclusions result from a space for time substitution approach that has captured differences in the hydrology of catchments with varying gcc making it a predictive tool to study the changes that the catchments will undergo as the glaciers lose area now that the methodology has been proven reliable the next steps would be to apply the wavelet analysis to longer time series including several years to assess whether these predictive results would be

5691,the impacts of glacier mass and area loss are assumed to affect stream hydrology and related ecosystems we applied wavelet analysis to high frequency time series of discharge conductivity turbidity air and water temperature in mountain streams influenced by a gradient of diverse glacier catchment coverages from 0 to 28 all parameters were recorded during 200 250 day period in 24 mountain streams in switzerland and ecuador we interpreted the range of glacier coverage as a proxy of glacier melt effect linked to modification in glacier cover based on a space for time substitution approach we used the diurnal variation power and frequency as hydrological parameters to quantify the intensity and occurrence of significant diurnal variations in the different mountain catchments our results show that the reduction in glacier cover would reduce the intensity and occurrence of diurnal variations in discharge turbidity and conductivity and the intensity of diurnal variations in water temperature discharge and conductivity were affected in a similar way while the impact on turbidity was less significant furthermore due to their different climatic regimes the diurnal discharge in the tropical andes was more impacted than in the alps indicating that the impacts of global change on glacier streams would be stronger in the tropical andes than in the alps keywords wavelet analysis space for time substitution hydrological parameters stream hydrology glacier retreat diurnal glacial flood 1 introduction glaciers represent important water reservoirs for downstream ecosystems where glacier melt contributes to regulate the runoff during the dry season kaser et al 2010 jansson et al 2003 glacier fed streams are characterized by high diurnal variations during the annual peak in discharge corresponding to the snow and glacier melt season hock 2005 while in snow fed mountain streams these variations occur generally earlier and for a shorter period due to the snow melt and the hydrological regime is more variable and precipitation dependent afterwards climate change triggers a global increase in mountain glacier shrinkage throughout the world including the alps and the tropical andes zemp et al 2019 recent geodetic mass balance observations showed that between 1980 and 2010 the glaciers of the swiss alps lost on average 0 62 m w e yr 1 fischer et al 2015 during the same period in the tropical andes rabatel et al 2013 reported that glaciers lost on average between 0 6 and 1 2 m w e yr 1 this considerable glacier mass loss will influence the downstream hydrology thus there is a need for focused studies on water availability and runoff and not only sea level rise milner et al 2017 warmer air temperatures are predicted to modify the timing of glacier shrinkage and the intensity of diurnal runoff oscillations milner et al 2017 jansson et al 2003 at the catchment scale glacial meltwater runoff will first increase as a result of higher ice melt then decrease until the disappearance of the glaciers thereby triggering changes in the hydrological regime of mountain meltwater characterized by higher variability due to precipitation and snowmelt as well as a higher sensitivity to droughts jost et al 2012 ragettli et al 2016 such changes will likely affect biogeochemical fluxes hood et al 2015 biodiversity cauvy fraunié and dangles 2019 and food web milner et al 2009 as well as human activities including water supply rabatel et al 2013 chevallier et al 2011 irrigation cheesbrough et al 2009 wang et al 2014 hydropower schaefli et al 2007 vergara et al 2007 fisheries shugar et al 2017 and water quality bizzotto et al 2009 to study the impacts of glacier melt effect on glacier fed streams several methods of time series analysis could be applied to stream hydrographs water turbidity temperature or electrical conductivity time series a fundamental approach is the study of the time series frequency spectrum using fourier decomposition as the spectrum describes the contribution of periodic signals of different frequencies to the time series and thus allows identifying periodicities cazelles et al 2008 however fourier decomposition assumes time series are stationary which is rarely the case with stream hydrographs for which periodicity changes depending on the time of the year and the presence of diurnal melt water variations lafreniere and sharp 2003 schaefli et al 2007 when analyzing non stationary time series wavelet analysis is often preferred in environmental sciences as it decomposes a time series in time frequency space and gives the evolution of the frequency spectrum of the signal as well as its changes of periodicity as a function of time torrence and compo 1998 wavelet analysis can also be used to examine the relationship between two signals and assess the phase shift between the signals at every frequency grinsted et al 2004 in this study we aimed to estimate the effect of reduction in glacier cover on the evolution of different hydrological parameters of mountain streams for this we performed wavelet analysis on time series of stream water depth discharge turbidity conductivity and temperature as well as air temperature in four catchments within the swiss alps the study catchments covered a wide range of gcc ranging from 0 to 28 which we used in a space for time substitution approach blois et al 2013 hood and berner 2009 currie 2001 to better understand and predict potential impacts of the reduction in glacier cover linked to climate change on the natural flow regime of mountain streams our aim was to assess the correlation between the hydrological quantities and estimate their evolution trends with glacier area loss we expected lower frequency and intensity of the diurnal variations of streamwater discharge electrical conductivity turbidity and possibly water temperature as gcc decreased in addition we compared our stream flow data with data previously published from streams in the ecuadorian andes to account for different climatic regimes and seasonalities cauvy fraunié et al 2013 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites we analyzed time series recorded in 11 streams in the swiss alps and 13 streams in the ecuadorian andes gcc of the study catchments ranged from 0 to 23 in ecuador and 0 to 28 in switzerland and the catchment area ranged between 0 05 and 23 km2 tables s 1 and s 2 all streams drained high alpine catchments with steep slopes and rocky terrain the sparse vegetation was dominated by low productive grassland and shrubs forest 15 coverage was only present in some of the swiss catchments 4 10 and 11 in fig 1 in switzerland we used data from 11 streams 1200 2200 m a s l in the cantons of vaud and valais fig 1 discharge in these catchments increases globally in may and june and decreases in august and september we analyzed data from march to october 2017 glacier coverage was measured using the 2012 corine land cover inventory büttner 2014 and ranged from 0 to 28 there were five sites with no gcc four sites with low 10 gcc no sites with medium gcc 10 gcc 20 and two sites with high 20 gcc fig 1 and supplementary material table s 1 we also conducted a temporal analysis of snow cover using satellite images taken by copernicus sentinel 2 in 2017 with at least one cloud free image available per month for our catchments to highlight the seasonality fig s 2 all the catchments were entirely snow covered in april 90 in may and june snow melted and no snow was left in champery the lowest site fig 1 by mid june snow kept retreating more slowly in the other catchments until it reached its minimum between mid july and beginning of august from july to october only snow and ice reservoirs of glaciers and small patches of permanent snow above 2500 m a s l with close to constant area remained to contribute to the melt while the elevation of the glacier terminus for the swiss catchments ranges between 2200 vallon de nant and 2500 m a s l val ferret and valsorey in november 2017 the entire catchments were covered by snow again we used published data february to november 2010 from 13 streams in two catchments located on the western slopes of antisana volcano ecuador fig s 1 cauvy fraunié et al 2013 streams were located between 4000 and 4200 m above sea level m a s l and fed by the los crespos and antisana glaciers except two streams with no gcc six streams had low 10 gcc four streams displayed a medium gcc 10 gcc 20 while one stream had a high gcc 20 glacier extent was automatically derived from landsat images from 2010 cauvy fraunié et al 2013 the antisana volcano is located in the inner tropics with homogeneous air temperature and substantial precipitation throughout the year precipitation is globally higher between february and june and between september and november contrary to the swiss catchments where there is a high seasonality in glacier ablation accumulation and ablation occur all year round on inner tropical glaciers and there is no permanent or seasonal snow cover outside the glaciers favier et al 2004 francou et al 2004 rabatel et al 2013 in the studied catchments discharge increases globally between october and may and diminishes between june and august favier et al 2004 further information on the antisana catchments is available in the supplementary material table s 2 and in cauvy fraunié et al 2013 2 2 hydrological measurements in the swiss streams we measured every 10 min streamwater depth odyssey capacitance water level

track it lb logger monarch instrument daily precipitation data were extracted from the database of the automatic monitoring network of meteoswiss federal office of meteorology and climatology 2017 as recorded within 3 8 km from the streams rating curves between streamwater depth and discharge were established from discharge measurements using repeated at least 4 for each stream slug additions of chloride gordon et al 2004 gaps in the hydrographs were interpolated using power law functions the ecuador gauging stations were measuring streamwater depth every 30 min using hobo water pressure loggers onset computer corp usa another identical logger was used to measure air temperature and pressure every 30 min at 4100 m a s l precipitation was recorded every 30 min at the weather station located in the glacier foreland the comparison of the wavelet analysis outputs for discharge and streamwater depth at site 7 of antisana showed that the results were very similar cauvy fraunié et al 2013 therefore we used depth as an approximation for discharge for the ecuador streams we also compared the hydrological parameters of depth and discharge for the swiss streams and found very similar values which comforted this approach fig s 3 2 3 data analysis wavelet analysis is a time dependent spectral analysis where a time series is decomposed in time frequency space therefore the wavelet transform expresses a time series in a three dimensional space time x scale frequency y and power z cauvy fraunié et al 2013 the wavelet transform decomposes a signal over a mother wavelet function that is localized in time and frequency and can have its width adapted to the features to be analyzed daubechies 1990 cazelles et al 2008 decomposing a time series into time frequency space enables determination of both the dominant modes of variability and how those modes vary in time daubechies 1990 torrence and compo 1998 cazelles et al 2008 we applied the wavelet decomposition to our time series following torrence and compo 1998 time series were centered on zero and reduced by normalizing to their standard deviation so that they can be compared 1 g t g obs t μ σ where μ is the mean of the time series g obs t and σ its standard deviation a mother wavelet is a function of two parameters the time position τ and the scale a it can be expressed as ϕ a τ t 1 a ϕ t τ a the wavelet transform of a time series g obs t with respect to a chosen mother wavelet is performed as follows cazelles et al 2008 2 w g a τ 1 a g t ϕ a τ t d t where denotes the complex conjugate form the wavelet coefficients w g a τ represent the contributions of the scales the a values to the signal at different time positions the τ values the mother wavelet φ t has a unitary variance φ t 2 dt 1 and it verifies ϕ t d t 0 daubechies 1990 cazelles et al 2008 here we chose the morlet wavelet a non orthogonal continuous and complex wavelet function as it was particularly well adapted for hydrological time series analyses lafreniere and sharp 2003 cauvy fraunié et al 2013 it had a high resolution in frequency compared to other continuous wavelets cazelles et al 2008 which was relevant for our study as we intended to detect repeated water level variations at a diurnal scale cauvy fraunié et al 2013 the morlet wavelet consists of a plane wave modulated by a gaussian distribution 3 ϕ t π 1 4 e i 2 ω 0 t e t 2 2 where ω0 3 in analogy to fourier analysis the local wavelet power spectrum can be defined as the squared absolute value of the wavelet transform and calculated as 4 w g a τ 2 w g a τ w g a τ the main periodicity found in our time series occurred at 24 h fig 2 thus we were mainly interested in the daily variations of the power and thus we focused on scales corresponding to the 20 28 h period for this purpose we calculated the scale averaged wavelet power spectrum w g 2 defined as the weighted sum of the wavelet power spectrum over the wanted range of scales sj1 sj2 over the whole measurement period 5 w g 2 δ j δ t c j j 1 j j 2 w g s j 2 s j where δ j is the spacing between discrete scales δ t the time step of the time series and c the reconstruction factor specific to the mother wavelet it can be shown that for the morlet wavelet there is a direct relationship between the period or fourier wavelength λ and the scale s given by 6 λ 4 π s ω 0 2 ω 0 2 thus the following results were all given as a function of period the cone of influence coi is the region of the wavelet spectrum in which edge effects become important and is defined as the e folding time for the autocorrelation of wavelet power at each scale for the morlet wavelet this e folding time is equal to 2 s it is chosen so that the edge effects are negligible beyond this point fig 2 some of our time series also included gaps mostly due to issues with the sensors in this case we also used the e folding time to define the zone where the edge effects due to the padding are non negligible these zones were ignored in the quantitative study of our results to determine which diurnal variations were significant or not in the power spectrum we compared it with a red noise power spectrum using lag 1 autocorrelation which defines a 95 significance level above which the values of the power were considered significant further information on lag 1 autocorrelation and red noise background power spectra can be found in the work by torrence and compo 1998 wavelet analysis can also be used to compare the power spectra of two time series previously normalized and centered on zero to be comparable for this purpose we use the wavelet transform coherence defined as grinsted et al 2004 7 r 2 s s s 1 w xy s 2 s s 1 w x s 2 s s 1 w y s 2 where s is a smoothing operator given by torrence and webster 1999 and w xy w x w y this definition of the wavelet coherence makes it similar to a localized correlation coefficient in time frequency space grinsted et al 2004 however when applying the wavelet transform coherence to the raw time series only the larger scales remained significant in order to exploit the signal over all scales including at 24 h we normalized the wavelet power of the time series before calculating the wavelet transform coherence and the phase shift thus giving the same weight to all scales we then inverted the wavelet transform the resulting signal was the same as the initial one but the oscillations with smaller period including in the 24 h range were amplified we re applied the wavelet analysis and calculated the wavelet transform coherence the significance level was then estimated using monte carlo methods grinsted et al 2004 the significant diurnal variations correspond to high coherence between the two time series at the corresponding time and frequency the phase shift between the two signals could also be obtained from the wavelet transform coherence at each point of the time frequency space when it was significant fig 2 phase shift can be interpreted as the time between diurnal variations of the two studied variables when looking at 24 h oscillations there is a direct relationship between time and phase difference π 2 corresponding to a 6 hour and π to a 12 h time lag the results of the phase shift could be confirmed each time by comparing them with the raw signals to quantify the variations in the scale averaged wavelet power spectrum around 24 h we calculated two hydrological parameters hp cauvy fraunié et al 2013 1 the diurnal variation power dvp which is the area delimited by the scale averaged power curve divided by the significance level and 1 every day it can only be positive if the value is negative the diurnal power is brought to 0 this represents the daily amplitude of the 24 h period oscillations it can be expressed as 8 d v p t p o w e r t 20 28 s i g n i f i c a n c e l e v e l 20 28 1 i f power t 20 28 significancelevel 20 28 1 d v p t 0 i f power t 20 28 significancelevel 20 28 1 where t is the time and 20 28 the range of time scales over which the power and the significance level are averaged the significance level does not depend on time 2 the diurnal variation frequency which is the number of days when the averaged power curve at the 24 h scale is significant divided by the total number of days of the period of interest it gives the amount of days with significant diurnal variations during the period of interest in all what follows we measured this diurnal variation frequency over a sliding 30 day period to get a monthly value these two parameters were calculated every day for each variable and each stream they informed at each time of a time series on the proportion of days with significant 24 h oscillations as well as the intensity of these diurnal variations the diurnal variation power was not calculated for days without data the diurnal variation frequency ignored the days with gaps and it was not calculated if there was more than 50 of gaps within the 30 day period to avoid singularities we chose to group our streams in four categories non glacierized catchments gcc 0 catchments with a low glacier coverage 0 gcc 10 catchments with a medium glacier coverage 10 gcc 20 and catchments with a high glacier coverage gcc 20 no swiss site had a drainage area with a gcc between 10 and 20 therefore we only used the three other categories for switzerland for each group we took the average gcc and average diurnal variation power or frequency we analyzed the relationship between the hydrological parameters and gcc by applying a linear regression given by 9 hp b g c c c where b and c are the parameters of the linear regression a positive slope means higher intensity and or frequency of significant diurnal variations as gcc increases high slope values mean a higher contribution of gcc in these diurnal variations and thus a stronger impact on the parameter as glaciers lose area fig 3 3 results 3 1 influence of rain annual precipitation was similar in the swiss and ecuadorian catchments during the respective study periods table 1 rain events differently influenced the dynamics of the various parameters during or following a rain event the wavelet power of streamwater discharge electrical conductivity and turbidity was usually significant within the 20 28 h period but also at shorter periods fig 4 here we focus on the 20 28 h period unaffected by minor rain events as suggested by no immediate influence on the main daily discharge major rain events could affect the wavelet analysis at the 24 h scale cauvy fraunié et al 2013 by increasing the significant power at 24 h 5 to 15 of all rain events during the respective study periods were classified as significant i e more than 10 mm of rain per day the total number of days with precipitation ranged from 40 in some of the swiss catchments to 70 in ecuador the average daily rainfall for each catchment ranged within 2 1 and 3 9 mm day each of our study catchments had a similar proportion of days with significant rain 10 mm day close to 10 of the study period thus we assumed that the effects of rainfall were limited as the occurrence of significant rain events remained low and similarly affected the study catchments 3 2 relationships between hydrological variables in switzerland we observed similar increase in the diurnal variation power and frequency slopes of both discharge and conductivity from end of may to early july fig 5 in july slope values were close to their maximum the diurnal power slopes were at 40 for the discharge and 80 for electrical conductivity while the diurnal frequency slopes were at 0 04 for discharge and 0 04 for electrical conductivity slope values for electrical conductivity remained high during the melt season and started to decrease at mid august for streamwater turbidity slopes were positive from end of may to end of july up to 4 for power and 0 02 for frequency with several peaks recorded during the melt season from june to end of august fig 5 we calculated the wavelet transform coherence and the phase difference between discharge and conductivity from march 15 to october 5 2017 fig 6 when the phase difference has real values this means that the two time series are correlated at 24 h periods while gaps in the phase difference correspond to periods when the time series are not coherent furthermore the timing of the peaks of discharge and conductivity is given by the angle a positive angle means that the discharge peak comes before the conductivity peak and it is the contrary when the angle is negative the correlation between electrical conductivity and discharge was generally higher for catchments with glacier coverage when the coherence between discharge and electrical conductivity was significant the phase difference was mostly close to π or π corresponding to a phase opposition there is an exception for stream 8 in the val ferret catchment where electrical conductivity peaks between 6 and 12 h before discharge peaks π 2 in switzerland the patterns of the slopes of both hydrological parameters for air and streamwater temperature differed from the trend observed for discharge fig 7 the diurnal power slope for air temperature decreased from its maximum value of 220 in early april to nearly zero in june and then increased to 100 in august september the diurnal power slope for streamwater temperature increased from 200 in april to 600 in june decreased to 0 end of july and increased again to 300 mid september the pattern of the diurnal frequency slopes of air and streamwater temperature was similar and values were relatively low with a maximum of 0 01 for air temperature and 0 03 for water temperature due to significant 24 h oscillations recorded for all stream these patterns showed that streamwater temperature was dependent on air temperature for the frequency slope but was not related to discharge wavelet transform coherence applied to air temperature and discharge fig 8 for the swiss streams showed that when correlated no gaps in the phase peaks in air temperature occurred a few hours before discharge peaks this time shift tended to decrease during the melt season when applying the same approach to streamwater temperature and discharge patterns were exactly the same while for all catchments and for the whole period air and streamwater temperature were completely correlated and in phase fig 9 3 3 swiss alps versus inner tropical andes fig 10 shows the comparison between the slope values of the diurnal variation power and frequency as a function of gcc for streamwater depth in both swiss and ecuadorian catchments in the antisana catchment the slope was always positive with high values between february and early may and close to zero from june to mid september in switzerland in may most catchments were still almost entirely covered by snow similar values for power and frequency for diurnal variation suggest that there was no detectable change for the streamwater discharge across the various streams from mid june the snow retreated and disappeared in the lower non glacierized catchments while only glaciers and permanent snow remained in the glacierized catchments the slope of the hydrological parameters then increased from mid june to august the slopes of the linear regression of diurnal variation power were more variable in the inner tropical 0 200 than in the swiss 0 50 streams fig 10a the slopes of the linear regression of diurnal variation frequency for the swiss and the ecuadorian streams spanned a similar range 0 0 04 fig 10b therefore over the respective study periods streams in ecuador and switzerland exhibited similar diurnal frequency slope maxima while the amplitude of the diurnal variation power slope was higher in ecuador 4 discussion based on similar and low 10 of the study period significant rainfall occurrence at all our sites we assumed the impact of rainfall to be negligible cauvy fraunié et al 2013 the results of wavelet analysis indeed showed that for all variables rainfall had an impact on the 24 h period signal only when there was more than 10 mm day which happens rarely and in similar amounts at all our sites this might be different for other sites such as the eastern slopes of antisana where precipitation rate is higher even though the rain signals might not be diurnal in the swiss catchments discharge and streamwater conductivity variability were highly correlated wavelet coherence with a 24 h phase opposition fig 6 for streams with a high 20 gcc the diurnal variation power and frequency of both discharge and conductivity increased with increasing glacial influence suggesting that both discharge and conductivity were highly dependent on the diurnal glacial runoff occurring during the melt season lafreniere and sharp 2003 indeed in alpine catchments snow and ice meltwater characterized by very low conductivity increase stream discharge and decrease conductivity by diluting the groundwater base flow weijs et al 2013 gurnell and fenn 1985 this correlation was thus lower for streams with lower gcc 10 with the exception of stream 8 linked to lower diurnal variations in stream with more groundwater influence stream 8 showed a shifted phase relationship which could imply a more complex link between the two quantities we expected the discharge and turbidity to be related during the melt season as glacier fed streams usually exhibit high turbidity values due to the release of sediment particles located sub glacially and pro glacially delaney et al 2018 milner and petts 1994 in addition diurnal peaks in discharge would often remobilize fine material within the riverbed hood and berner 2009 milner and petts 1994 however low slope values for turbidity indicated no link or more complex link between turbidity pattern and glacial influence contrary to discharge and conductivity this lack of significant correlation might be due to gaps in the turbidity data of the snow fed catchments leading to uncertainties in the results there was a high correlation between air and water temperature for periods close to 24 h fig 9 thus air temperature impacted directly water temperature as they followed the same pattern for the diurnal frequency fig 7b which led to the observation that all streams whatever their gcc recorded significant oscillations with a period of 24 h blaen et al 2013 the peaks in water temperature in phase with the peaks in air temperature fig 9 occurred before the peaks in discharge showing that water temperature responded more rapidly to air temperature variations than changes in discharge for all streams blaen et al 2013 however the higher values of the diurnal power slope of water temperature during the melt periods showed that diurnal water temperature oscillations were enhanced by glacier or snowmelt which led to higher values of the diurnal power for higher gcc no relationship with the distance of the site from the glacier terminus was found as would have been expected fellman et al 2014 blaen et al 2013 probably due to too few sites covering a too little range of distances from glacier thus water temperature was predominantly affected by air temperature but also by meltwater williamson et al 2019 following a space for time substitution approach the slopes of the hydrological parameters provided a benchmark of the evolution of the hydrological variables in time when gcc decreased blois et al 2013 hood and berner 2009 in the swiss catchments the diurnal hydrological parameters of discharge and conductivity were similarly affected by the glacier melt effect with high slopes in july and august the slopes were lower during the melt for turbidity especially for the diurnal variation power suggesting a lower impact of glacier melt effect on turbidity several peaks were recorded during the melt season which corresponded to significant rainfall events resulting in very significant peaks in turbidity but over very short periods which could explain that the diurnal frequency slope was less affected this could be a consequence of unstable substrate on mountain slopes not affected by erosion from the glacier flow turbidity should depend on the geomorphology of the catchment indeed as the glaciers lose area they should also leave unstable moraine with a high erosion potential which could favor an increase in the diurnal turbidity peaks at least in the short term depending on the new catchment configuration milner et al 2017 geilhausen et al 2011 this lack of correlation could also partly be explained by the uncertainties on the turbidity data for snow fed catchments water temperature proved to be more sensitive to air temperature daily oscillations although the impact of discharge could also be seen as a result there should always be significant 24 h oscillations in water temperature of alpine streams due to air temperature even as glaciers lose area however the intensity of these diurnal variations should decrease when glaciers lose area the evolution of the diurnal power and frequency slopes as a function of time depended on the climatic zone in which the catchment was located from our comparison between the ecuadorian and swiss catchments it appeared that in terms of discharge slope values were higher in ecuadorian streams suggesting they would be more affected by changes in glacier cover during the melt season for switzerland glacier melt period occurred between june and october while snowmelt occurred between april and may by affecting all mountain catchments equally low slope values for ecuador higher slope values corresponded to the october may season with slightly more precipitation but most importantly increased melting vuille et al 2000 favier et al 2004 enhanced by warm episode of el niño event in 2010 rabatel et al 2013 the seasonality was different for the two regions but in both cases then higher slopes of the hydrological parameters during the main ablation season showed that the hydrology of the catchments would be more affected by glacier melt effect at this time of the year 5 conclusion the results of this analysis provided us with a first insight into the hydrological future of mountain streams in both the tropical andes and the alps in which diurnal power and frequency of variations in discharge conductivity and to a lesser degree turbidity decrease with glacier melt effect and diurnal power of variations in water temperature is also impacted we found that the impact of the reduction in glacier cover on stream hydrology would be greater in the andes than in the alps however our conclusions result from a space for time substitution approach that has captured differences in the hydrology of catchments with varying gcc making it a predictive tool to study the changes that the catchments will undergo as the glaciers lose area now that the methodology has been proven reliable the next steps would be to apply the wavelet analysis to longer time series including several years to assess whether these predictive results would be

5692,extensometers provide long term records of deformation over a depth interval of interest an overconsolidated aquitard usually undergoes elastic deformation if the hydraulic head within adjacent aquifers remains higher than the preconsolidation head within the aquitard the vertical hydraulic conductivity k v and elastic skeletal specific storage s ske are two critical parameters that control the deformation behavior of an overconsolidated aquitard and they could be interpreted from valuable extensometer data an analytical solution for the elastic aquitard deformation caused by periodic hydraulic head variations phhv within adjacent aquifers is derived using the separation of variables method based on euler s formula the phase difference in phhv between adjacent aquifers is found to reduce the amplitude of periodic aquitard deformation meanwhile the phase difference is found to cause no influence on the growth pattern of the phase shift which is between the periodic aquitard deformation and phhv versus the period a new parameter estimation method is further proposed to interpret aquitard k v and s ske from periodic aquitard deformation data this new method yields robust k v and s ske estimates of a moderately thick aquitard whose deformation history has been recorded by an extensometer located in shanghai china the field study confirms that the phase difference in phhv

aquitards usually consist of fine grained sediments e g silts and clays that have lower hydraulic conductivity k while the specific storage ss is typically larger leake 1990 than sandy aquifers many studies have found that aquitards play a key role in land subsidence e g luo et al 2016 zapata norberto et al 2018 zhuang et al 2017b zhuang et al 2019 recently aquitards have been found to be a non negligible component of groundwater depletion konikow and kendy 2005 konikow and neuzil 2007 smith et al 2017 and play a significant role in groundwater contamination e g bonte et al 2015 cherry et al 2004 li et al 2019 yang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 however the identification of aquitard parameters remains challenging neuzil 2015 hydraulic head variations within adjacent aquifers cause the aquitard to deform due to the low k and non negligible ss hydraulic head responses within the aquitard always lag behind that in adjacent aquifers resulting in delayed aquitard deformation e g helm 1975 helm 1976 poland 1984 leake 1990 and shearer 1998 pointed out that delayed deformation must be considered for accurately simulating aquitard deformation this is mainly because the delayed aquitard deformation may result in the masking of elastic effects yan and burbey 2008 when the hydraulic head in adjacent aquifers recovers causing large errors during the subsequent simulation and prediction of land subsidence fortunately an extensometer is a powerful tool that can be used to record long term deformation of a specific depth interval particularly if the deformation process of an investigated aquitard is recorded by extensometers that are placed at the top and bottom of the aquitard the time lag in the aquitard deformation can be easily identified from the extensometer data e g riley 1969 riley 1984 as a consequence extensometer data can provide valuable information about aquitard properties for example riley 1969 and cleveland et al 1992 proposed a stress strain diagram method using extensometer and hydrograph data to simultaneously estimate the vertical hydraulic conductivity k v elastic skeletal specific storage s ske and inelastic skeletal specific storage s skv of aquitards burbey 2003 developed a graphical approach which took advantage of time subsidence data during a pumping test to estimate k v and s skv zhuang et al 2015 proposed a type curve method to estimate k v and s skv of a normally consolidated aquitard in response to piecewise linear declines in hydraulic heads within adjacent aquifers some multi layered aquifer systems may encounter periodic hydraulic head variations phhv phhv are frequently encountered in coastal aquifers caused by tidal fluctuations e g guo and li 2015 jiao and tang 1999 li and jiao 2001 and in an aquifer system where groundwater is seasonally extracted such as the alluvial shanghai aquifer system shi et al 2008a xue et al 2008 zhang et al 2007 in a multi layered aquifer system experiencing phhv an aquitard subjected to periodic signals may also exhibit periodic deformation liu and helm 2008b ye and xue 2005 under this scenario the time lag in the aquitard deformation can be manifested as a phase shift between the deformation and phhv within adjacent aquifers based on the time lag of the deformation of an aquifer system liu and helm 2008a proposed a graphic analytic method to obtain the estimates of k v s ske s skv and initial preconsolidation effective stress of aquitards consisting of lenticular interbeds as well as the skeletal specific storage of the aquifer liu and helm 2008b and luo et al 2016 respectively employed this method to several extensometer sites in shanghai china to obtain the initial estimates for their numerical inversion models however the formula utilized in this graphic analytic method lacked theoretical basis and may not be suitable for aquitards with thicknesses of tens to hundreds of meters zhuang et al 2017a events such as high intensity groundwater extraction over long periods or glacial loading could cause aquitards to become overconsolidated overconsolidated refers to sediments that have experienced a higher overburden load in the past konikow and neuzil 2007 as long as the investigated aquitard stays overconsolidated i e the aquifer hydraulic head is higher than the preconsolidation head an aquitard undergoes elastic deformation konikow and neuzil 2007 for an aquifer system experiencing seasonal pumping seasonal phhv within aquifers may be recorded meanwhile periodic deformation of an overconsolidated aquitard may also be visible from extensometer data after revisiting the elastic deformation of an overconsolidated aquitard subjected to phhv within adjacent aquifers through a dimensionless analytical solution zhuang et al 2017a proposed an analytic method to identify k v and s ske however they ignored the influence of phase difference in phhv between adjacent aquifers on the parameter estimates the objective of this study is to explore the influences of phase difference between aquifer phhv on the periodic deformation behaviors of an overconsolidated aquitard and to develop a parameter estimation method to obtain k v and s ske from long term extensometer data we first construct a one dimensional hydraulic response model for the overconsolidated aquitard and further derive the analytical solution for elastic aquitard deformation secondly the characteristics of periodic aquitard deformation will be revisited thirdly a parameter estimation method utilizing the developed model will be investigated lastly the newly proposed method will be applied to an aquitard at an extensometer site in shanghai china 2 model setup and analytical solution a simple one dimensional system with an aquitard confined by two aquifers is constructed as shown in fig 1 the system is subjected to the following assumptions a the aquitard is vertically homogeneous and the hydraulic parameters are constant with time b the kv of the aquitard is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than adjacent aquifers for ensuring that flow and deformation only occur in the vertical direction c the aquitard is overconsolidated and subjected to phhv within adjacent aquifers and d the aquitard remains saturated with vertical flow taking place that obeys darcy s law let the z axis be vertical positive upward with its origin at the contact surface between the aquitard and the underlying aquifer fig 1 it is assumed that the overconsolidated aquitard is subjected to long term stable phhv within adjacent aquifers under this assumption the overconsolidated aquitard only undergoes elastic deformation it is also assumed that water expansion is negligible thus k v lt 1 and s ske l 1 are two key hydraulic parameters that control flow and deformation behaviors within the aquitard based on the above assumptions the following governing equation can be used to describe groundwater flow within the aquitard 1 k v 2 h z t z 2 s ske h z t t where h z t is the hydraulic head in the aquitard at location z l and time t t based on euler s formula phhv within the underlying and overlying aquifers can be represented in complex form as 2 h z t z 0 h u a u exp 2 π i t t i φ u 3 h z t z b h o a o exp 2 π i t t i φ u i θ where b is the aquitard thickness i 1 a u and a o denote the amplitude l of phhv within the underlying and overlying aquifers respectively t is the period t φ u is the initial phase of phhv within the underlying aquifer θ is the phase difference radian in phhv between the two aquifers h u and h o are the mean hydraulic heads of the underlying and overlying aquifers respectively note that physical aquifer heads are assured in eqs 2 and 3 by taking the real parts of complex products a u exp 2 π i t t i φ u and a o exp 2 π i t t i φ u i θ the separation of variables method has been widely employed to derive analytical solutions for coastal aquifers in response to tidal fluctuations e g guo et al 2010 jiao and tang 1999 li and jiao 2001 wang et al 2015 an advantage of the separation of variables method is that no initial condition is needed the periodic aquitard hydraulic head h z t can be represented as an exponential function based on euler s formula after employing the separation of variables method trefry 1999 4 h z t h s z h p z exp 2 π i t t i φ u where h s z and h p z represent the steady and periodic components of h z t note that the physical aquitard head is the real part of eq 4 substituting eq 4 into eq 1 yields 5 d 2 h s z 2 0 6 d 2 h p d z 2 2 π i s ske k v t h p 0 while substituting eqs 2 and 3 into eq 4 yields h s 0 h u h s b h o h p 0 a u and h p b a o exp i θ thus the analytical solutions for h s and h p are 7 h s h o h u b z h u 8 h p a u cosh α z b a o exp i θ csch α a u coth α sinh α z b where α 2 π i t d and t d k v t s ske b 2 according to the water balance concept the volume of water released from an aquitard is equal to the volume of aquitard deformation therefore the cumulative deformation of a one dimensional aquitard can be calculated as 9 f s ske 0 b h z t h z 0 d z s ske a u b f d where 10 f d f d p exp α 2 t d i φ u exp i φ u t d k v t s ske b 2 and 11 f d p 1 α 1 a d exp i θ coth α csch α where a d a o a u is the amplitude ratio of phhv within the overlying to the underlying aquifers note that f d is exactly the dimensionless form of f and f d p is a complex variable that carries the information about the amplitude and phase of f d the dimensionless amplitude a f d and radian phase shift δ τ f d of f d can be further computed as 12 a f d e r 2 e i 2 13 δ τ f d arctan e i e r where e r re f d p e i im f d p and re and im denote the real and imaginary parts of the expression respectively 3 effects of phase difference it can be found from eq 11 that the phase difference θ impacts f d p to quantitatively explore the influence of θ on a f d and δ τ f d we consider a specific case of a d 1 suggesting that adjacent aquifers have the same amplitude of phhv we use eq 12 to derive an a f d t d curve depending on different θ values as shown in fig 2 a the derivative of a f d with respect to t d i e ε d a f d d t d or the growth rate of a f d is also numerically derived as shown in fig 2b eq 13 is used to derive a δ τ f d t d curve depending on different θ values as shown in fig 3 a in addition the derivative of δ τ f d with respect to t d i e η d δ τ f d d t d or the growth rate of δ τ f d is numerically derived as shown in fig 3b fig 2a shows that a f d consistently grows with t d given a known θ π this is due to the fact that a larger period provides the aquitard more time to continuously compress or rebound thus a larger deformation amplitude occurs however we note that ε i e the growth rate of a f d consistently decreases with t d in particular when t d is larger than 1 ε almost decreases to zero fig 2b or a f d approximately reaches a steady value fig 2a this is attributed to the fact that a larger period renders the aquitard to become more capable in substantially mitigating the delayed deformation thus the growth rate decreases we also note that a f d decreases with θ for a given t d this is due to the fact that a larger θ makes phhv within the overlying aquifer offset more of the elastic deformation caused by phhv within the underlying aquifer in particular if θ π the phhv within the two aquifers demonstrate reverse periodic patterns so there is no net elastic deformation and one has a f d 0 fig 2a it should be noted that a negative θ results in the same a f d t d curve as that resulting from a positive one due to the lower kv periodic aquitard deformation is associated with a phase shift from phhv within adjacent aquifers fig 3a shows that the phase difference θ does not impact the growth pattern of δ τ f d versus t d to be specific when t d is smaller than 0 03 δ τ f d is approximately stable when t d exceeds 0 03 δ τ f d starts to slightly decrease at t d 0 2 δ τ f d reaches the minimum value when t d exceeds 0 2 δ τ f d continually grows and approaches half of the phase difference θ a very small t d value means the phhv with the aquifer can only penetrate the aquitard over a very small distance in this case the delayed aquitard drainage could be approximately proportional to t d thus δ τ f d is nearly stable at small t d values zhuang et al 2017a for a known phase difference θ the specific value of t d 0 2 which corresponds to the extreme δ τ f d value potentially means that the phhv within one aquifer is mitigating aquitard drainage within the portion that is close to another aquifer for larger t d values both aquifers mitigate the drainage within all of the investigated aquitard thus the degree of the dissipation of delayed aquitard drainage increases with t d resulting in a continually growing δ τ f d fig 3a also shows that for a positive θ δ τ f d can be equal to zero e g θ π 3 and t d 0 82 θ π 6 and t d 1 91 it should be noted that δ τ f d is given in radian so the real radian phase shift δ τ f of the periodic aquitard deformation is equal to δ τ f d as a result one may not see a phase shift between the elastic aquitard deformation and phhv within one of adjacent aquifers from long term hydrograph and extensometer data fig 3b shows that η i e the growth rate of δ τ f d has multiple zeros however we note that theoretical extremes of δ τ f d corresponding to the zeros cannot be readily recognized from fig 3a suggesting complex characteristics of periodic aquitard deformation particularly when t d is larger than 0 2 η increases first and then decreases and η reaches the maximum value of 0 574 at t d 0 483 if the period of phhv is large enough to render t d larger than 10 η is approximately equal to zero suggesting almost complete dissipation of delayed deformation in the land subsidence community subsidence mitigation and prevention remains a challenge due to the lack of full understanding of compaction mechanism of a geological formation tsai and hsu 2018 from the perspective of engineering practice the influences of phase difference between aquifer phhv on the periodic aquitard deformation behaviors as stated above does have some implications specifically this research suggests that seasonal groundwater exploitation carried out in two aquifers adjacent to an interbedded aquitard could be designed in an asynchronous pattern so that aquitard compaction can be mitigated to some extent 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is commonly used to evaluate the influence of input parameters on the output results of a model the normalized sensitivity analysis proposed by huang and yeh 2007 is carried out to analyze the influence of a d and θ on the amplitude a f d and phase shift δ τ f d of the elastic aquitard deformation f d the normalized sensitivity coefficient is defined and calculated as 14 s i j p j o i p j p j o i p j δ p j o i p j δ p j in which s i j is the normalized sensitivity value of the j th input parameter p j at the i th t d value o i represents the output of the model amplitude a f d and phase shift δ τ f d in this study and δ p j is a small increment which is selected as 10 2 p j based on the developed solutions i e eqs 11 13 the parameters used in the sensitivity study include the dimensionless amplitude ratio a d and the phase difference θ of phhv between adjacent aquifers note that figs 2b and 3b are already representative of the sensitivity analysis of a f d and δ τ f d to t d respectively in the following analysis the absolute value of s i j is employed for the sake of comparison fig 4 shows the sensitivity of deformation amplitude a f d and phase shift δ τ f d to parameters a d and θ with the base values of a d 1 and θ π 6 fig 4a shows that the sensitivity of deformation amplitude a f d to amplitude ratio a d and phase difference θ of phhv between adjacent aquifers dramatically increases with t d when t d is smaller than 1 and the sensitivity approaches a constant when t d is larger than 1 in addition the sensitivity of a f d is more sensitive to a d than to θ the higher sensitivity of a f d to a d is mainly due to the fact that the amplitude of aquifer phhv directly determines the magnitude of hydraulic head changes within the aquitard fig 4b shows that the sensitivity of the phase shift δ τ f d of aquitard deformation to a d and θ remains constant for different t d values and δ τ f d is more sensitive to θ than to δ τ f d the higher sensitivity of δ τ f d to θ is mainly because the phase difference θ in phhv between adjacent aquifers directly determines the degree of offset in the elastic aquitard deformation caused by each adjacent aquifer from the perspective of parameter estimation above sensitivity analysis suggests that the amplitude ratio a d of phhv must be carefully determined for obtaining a reliable s ske estimate meanwhile although the low kv of the aquitard mainly makes the aquitard deformation lag behind phhv within adjacent aquifers the deformation phase shift δ τ f d is also sensitive to the phase difference θ in aquifer phhv figs 3a and 4b suggesting that θ must be carefully determined for obtaining a reliable k v estimate 5 aquitard parameter estimation now we present the following four steps for estimating k v and s ske of the overconsolidated aquitard as following step 1 firstly one determines the aquitard thickness b based on a borehole log secondly one determines the period t and amplitudes a o and a u as well as the phase difference θ in phhv between the overlying and underlying aquifers based on long term hydrograph data thirdly one determines the amplitude a f of elastic aquitard deformation and the corresponding radian phase shift δ τ f after further analyzing the long term extensometer data step 2 firstly with determined a o and a u one calculates the amplitude ratio of a d a o a u secondly one uses eq 12 to draw the standard curve of a f d versus t d depending on determined a d and θ values thirdly one uses eq 13 to draw the standard curve of δ τ f d t d that depends on determined a d and θ values step 3 one determines the real t d value corresponding to δ τ f from the δ τ f d t d curve then one determines the real a f d value corresponding to the real t d value from the a f d t d curve step 4 based on eq 9 one calculates s ske as 15 s ske a f a f d a u b finally one substitutes the s ske estimate into the expression of t d to calculate k v as 16 k v t d s ske b 2 t it should be noted that the key issue associated with the new parameter estimation method is the uniqueness of t d although δ τ f d can be readily determined from long term hydrograph and extensometer data t d might be difficult to determine when t d is smaller than 0 2 or larger than 10 fig 3a it is noteworthy that t d is dependent on the period t to the first power thus if the frequency of phhv within adjacent aquifers is too high or too low the usage of this estimation method could be limited furthermore t d is dependent on the aquifer thickness b raised to the second power as a consequence from a practical point of view the newly proposed parameter estimation method may not be applicable to a very thin or very thick aquitard 6 application the proposed new method is tested using data from a field extensometer site located in shanghai china as shown in fig 5 all the hydrogeological data and information in this section are taken from zhuang et al 2017a and references therein details to hydrogeological conditions and groundwater exploitation history of the shanghai aquifer aquitard system can be found in several other studies e g shi et al 2008a b in this study we briefly introduce the hydrogeological background shanghai is underlain by a multi layered aquifer aquitard system with a thickness ranging from 200 m to 350 m and the system consists of six aquifers one unconfined and five confined and six adjoining aquitards from the top to bottom ye and xue 2005 fig 6 shows a cross section of the shanghai multi aquifer aquitard system groundwater exploitation in shanghai city began since the 1860s and the amount of withdrawal increased yearly until the 1960s due to groundwater withdrawal aquifer hydraulic head declined over the years resulting in severe land subsidence at shanghai which was first observed in 1921 since 1965 aquifer hydraulic head decline and severe land subsidence have been effectively controlled by artificial groundwater recharge combined with reduced exploitation of groundwater however after late 1980s more groundwater was extracted due to the rapid development of the economy since then groundwater levels began to decline again and land subsidence resumed the second aquitard is investigated through this study the second aquitard is buried beneath the ground surface from 44 31 to 78 85 m with a thickness of b 34 54 m and it consists of grayish yellow silty clay interbedded with sandy silt shi et al 2008b ye et al 2005 the first confined aquifer overlies the second aquitard and the second confined aquifer underlies it long term hydraulic head variations in the two confined aquifers are shown in fig 7 a and b an extensometer is mostly used to monitor the vertical movement of a prescribed interface of two hydrogeological units so that the cumulative deformation of an investigated hydrogeological unit can be easily derived the extensometer f10 7 which belongs to the extensometer group f10 that is situated near cross section i i fig 5 recorded the deformation history of the second aquitard as shown in fig 7c because of the artificial control of groundwater exploitation aquifer head variations demonstrate periodic characteristics and the periods are t 1 year prior to the start of the record as shown in fig 7 the aquifer hydraulic heads and the aquitard deformation varied at a stable periodic state which is similar to the deeper hydrogeological units of the study area luo et al 2016 thus the second aquitard was overconsolidated shi et al 2008b during the 1990s the aquifer hydraulic heads however did not fluctuate in a strictly stable fashion in fact both of them exhibit an overall declining trend over the period of record fig 7a and b this is consistent with the groundwater exploitation history of shanghai because of this periodically declining pattern in aquifer hydraulic heads aquitard deformation is not perfectly elastic resulting in its net compaction fig 7c fig 7a and b shows that the periodically declining hydraulic head variations within adjacent aquifers can be approximated as the sum of a stable seasonally fluctuating component and a linearly declining hydraulic head component the apparent elastic deformation is mainly caused by a seasonally varying component while the overall compaction is mainly caused by the linearly declining component zhuang et al 2017a to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the second aquitard we approximate the observed seasonal hydraulic heads using a trigonometric function combined with a linear function fig 7a and b these data are fitted using the trust region algorithm included in the curve fitting toolbox of matlab since the regular period of hydraulic head within each aquifer is t 1 year the custom fitting equation is set as y a x 1986 b c cos 2 π x 1986 d where a b c and d are four constants estimated through the fitting algorithm fig 7a and b note that constants c and d are key values for estimating aquitard hydraulic parameters after choosing reasonable initial estimates and upper and lower bounds for the four constants the fitted results are shown in fig 7a and b the amplitudes of aquifer hydraulic heads are a o 0 908 m and a u 3 039 m for the overlying and underlying aquifers respectively thus one has a d a o a u 0 299 the phase difference in phhv between the first and second confined aquifers is then calculated to be θ 0 146 π given determined values of a d and θ two standard curves a f d t d and δ τ f d t d are derived as shown in fig 8 we adopt the same fitting algorithm to deal with the aquitard deformation data however to minimize the impact of overall declining trend in aquifer hydraulic head variations we only choose the first three periods of observed deformation data for fitting fig 7c the resulting amplitude of elastic deformation is a f 3 183 mm and the radian phase shift of the deformation referring to the periodic hydraulic head variations within the second confined aquifer is δ τ f 0 504 since δ τ f δ τ f d the real dimensionless period corresponding to determined δ τ f is read to be t d 1 1788 solid diamond point in fig 8b thus we further obtain a f d 0 5652 solid diamond in fig 8a as a consequence the elastic skeletal specific storage is calculated to be s ske 3 183 10 3 m 0 5652 3 039 m 34 54 m 5 37 10 5 m 1 according to eq 15 and the vertical hydraulic conductivity is calculated to be k v 1 1788 5 37 10 5 m 1 34 54 m 2 1 year 7 55 10 2 m year according to eq 16 a straight comparison between the simulated and observed elastic aquitard deformation during the first three periods or from 1986 to 1989 fig 7c can now be carried out at the year 1986 the phase of phhv within the underlying confined aquifer is φ u 0 1773 2 π 1 114 fig 7b and the periodic aquitard deformation is about 3 183 cos 2 π 0 0 2575 0 150 mm fig 7c thus after substituting estimated k v and s ske into eq 9 the simulated periodic component of elastic aquitard deformation from 1986 to 1989 is finally obtained as shown in fig 9 with the k v and s ske estimates the linear component of elastic aquitard deformation from 1986 to 1989 is further derived using the analytical solution of zhuang et al 2017a as also shown in fig 9 the simulated elastic aquitard deformation is the sum of linear and periodic components 7 discussion fig 9 reveals that the simulated deformation curve is quite close to the observed one with an r squared value of 0 97 which is equal to the fitting result as shown in fig 7c this is mainly due to the fact that the proposed parameter estimation is deterministic and the parameter estimates are unique furthermore the excellent fit between the simulated and observed deformation suggests that the delayed deformation caused by the linear component of hydraulic head variations within adjacent aquifers has weak effects on parameter estimates after a comparative analysis we find that the analytic method proposed by zhuang et al 2017a led to slightly under estimated parameter estimates k v 7 45 10 2 m year and s ske 5 26 10 5 m 1 this is mainly because they ignored the phase difference θ in phhv between the first and second confined aquifers fig 2 shows that ignoring the phase difference θ will result in over estimating a f d as a consequence s ske will be under estimated according to eq 15 consequently k v will be under estimated according to eq 16 for this field application case zhuang et al 2017a also conducted inverse modeling and the calibrated parameter estimates are k v 7 06 0 34 10 2 m year and s ske 5 51 0 20 10 5 m 1 which are fairly close to those obtained from the newly proposed parameter estimation method the visible difference in the parameter estimates between the new estimation method and inverse modeling can be attributed to two aspects of uncertainties firstly the reliability of parameter estimates relies on the prerequisite that the aquitard only undergoes elastic deformation during the first three periods of the extensometer record the residual non elastic deformation if it does exist during the first three periods of the deformation record could influence the accuracy of parameter estimates obtained from the new method secondly a specific practice we employ is that the periodic component of aquitard deformation is directly subtracted from the extensometer record an implicit assumption behind this practice is that there is no time lag in the elastic aquitard deformation caused by the linear component of the aquifer hydraulic head variations we admit that this practice could lead to some uncertainties in k v and s ske estimates because the linear aquifer hydraulic head variations could also produce a time lag in the elastic aquitard deformation zhuang et al 2017a however even with these limitations we think that the derived analytical solution can be used to quantitatively explain the time lag features that can be seen from the extensometer data furthermore the newly proposed parameter estimation method can be a powerful tool to derive reasonable aquitard hydraulic parameters controlling elastic deformation note that the new parameter estimation method is developed for a single overconsolidated aquitard to meet the prerequisite that the aquitard is overconsolidated one may need to refer to the long term record of groundwater level variations an aquitard is likely to be overconsolidated when the current groundwater level is higher than that in the past in addition to our knowledge many extensometers extend through multiple aquifers and aquitards in this case if one view this multi layered aquifer aquitard system as a single hydrogeological unit the average values of k v and s ske estimates of the unit might be obtained through the application of this new method one may commonly see that an aquitard undergoes simultaneous elastic and non elastic deformation subjected to periodic hydraulic head variations within adjacent aquifers and this is particularly true for a normally consolidated aquitard under this circumstance groundwater drainage within the aquitard is highly non linear for the second aquitard of interest although zhuang et al 2017a directly subtracted the elastic component of aquitard deformation from the whole record and obtained a reasonable estimate of inelastic skeletal specific storage we have to point out that their practice lacks theoretical support thus to theoretically explore the influences of non elastic deformation as well as delayed deformation caused by the linear component of aquifer hydraulic head variations on parameter estimates obtained from the new method could be a valuable research topic in the future meanwhile the simultaneous interpretation of elastic and inelastic skeletal specific storage values from long term extensometer data based on an analytical approach is particularly necessary 8 summary and conclusions the analytical solution for elastic deformation of an overconsolidated aquitard subjected to periodic hydraulic head variations phhv within adjacent aquifers has been derived using the separation of variables method based on euler s formula a new parameter estimation method has been further developed based on an analytical solution to estimate the vertical hydraulic conductivity k v and elastic skeletal specific storage s ske that control the elastic deformation behaviors the new method has been applied to a 34 54 m thick aquitard at a field extensometer site located in shanghai china the main conclusions from this study are 1 the amplitude of periodic deformation of the overconsolidated aquitard consistently grows with the period of phhv within adjacent aquifers but the growth rate consistently declines a larger phase difference in phhv results in a smaller deformation amplitude if phhv within adjacent aquifers are at the same amplitude but with a radian phase difference of π the aquitard will not deform 2 the time lag of periodic aquitard deformation is manifested as a phase shift between the periodic deformation and phhv within adjacent aquifers the phase shift reaches the minimum value at the dimensionless period of 0 2 the phase difference in phhv between the two aquifers however does not impact the growth pattern of the phase shift versus the period due to the influence of phase difference in phhv the time lag features of periodic aquitard deformation can be weakened under specific conditions periodic aquitard deformation may even become synchronous with phhv within one of adjacent aquifers 3 the new parameter estimation method involves two standard curves which are the amplitude and phase shift of the periodic aquitard deformation versus the period depending on the amplitude ratio and phase difference in phhv between the aquifers adjacent to the investigated overconsolidated aquitard in hydrogeological or engineering practice the new estimation method may not be applicable when the phhv is too high or too low in frequency and to an aquitard that is too small or too large in thickness 4 the field application of this method confirms that ignoring the phase difference can result in under estimated k v and s ske overall the derived analytical solution can be used to quantitatively explain some time lag features revealed from the long term extensometer record and the new parameter estimation method can be a powerful tool

5692,extensometers provide long term records of deformation over a depth interval of interest an overconsolidated aquitard usually undergoes elastic deformation if the hydraulic head within adjacent aquifers remains higher than the preconsolidation head within the aquitard the vertical hydraulic conductivity k v and elastic skeletal specific storage s ske are two critical parameters that control the deformation behavior of an overconsolidated aquitard and they could be interpreted from valuable extensometer data an analytical solution for the elastic aquitard deformation caused by periodic hydraulic head variations phhv within adjacent aquifers is derived using the separation of variables method based on euler s formula the phase difference in phhv between adjacent aquifers is found to reduce the amplitude of periodic aquitard deformation meanwhile the phase difference is found to cause no influence on the growth pattern of the phase shift which is between the periodic aquitard deformation and phhv versus the period a new parameter estimation method is further proposed to interpret aquitard k v and s ske from periodic aquitard deformation data this new method yields robust k v and s ske estimates of a moderately thick aquitard whose deformation history has been recorded by an extensometer located in shanghai china the field study confirms that the phase difference in phhv

aquitards usually consist of fine grained sediments e g silts and clays that have lower hydraulic conductivity k while the specific storage ss is typically larger leake 1990 than sandy aquifers many studies have found that aquitards play a key role in land subsidence e g luo et al 2016 zapata norberto et al 2018 zhuang et al 2017b zhuang et al 2019 recently aquitards have been found to be a non negligible component of groundwater depletion konikow and kendy 2005 konikow and neuzil 2007 smith et al 2017 and play a significant role in groundwater contamination e g bonte et al 2015 cherry et al 2004 li et al 2019 yang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 however the identification of aquitard parameters remains challenging neuzil 2015 hydraulic head variations within adjacent aquifers cause the aquitard to deform due to the low k and non negligible ss hydraulic head responses within the aquitard always lag behind that in adjacent aquifers resulting in delayed aquitard deformation e g helm 1975 helm 1976 poland 1984 leake 1990 and shearer 1998 pointed out that delayed deformation must be considered for accurately simulating aquitard deformation this is mainly because the delayed aquitard deformation may result in the masking of elastic effects yan and burbey 2008 when the hydraulic head in adjacent aquifers recovers causing large errors during the subsequent simulation and prediction of land subsidence fortunately an extensometer is a powerful tool that can be used to record long term deformation of a specific depth interval particularly if the deformation process of an investigated aquitard is recorded by extensometers that are placed at the top and bottom of the aquitard the time lag in the aquitard deformation can be easily identified from the extensometer data e g riley 1969 riley 1984 as a consequence extensometer data can provide valuable information about aquitard properties for example riley 1969 and cleveland et al 1992 proposed a stress strain diagram method using extensometer and hydrograph data to simultaneously estimate the vertical hydraulic conductivity k v elastic skeletal specific storage s ske and inelastic skeletal specific storage s skv of aquitards burbey 2003 developed a graphical approach which took advantage of time subsidence data during a pumping test to estimate k v and s skv zhuang et al 2015 proposed a type curve method to estimate k v and s skv of a normally consolidated aquitard in response to piecewise linear declines in hydraulic heads within adjacent aquifers some multi layered aquifer systems may encounter periodic hydraulic head variations phhv phhv are frequently encountered in coastal aquifers caused by tidal fluctuations e g guo and li 2015 jiao and tang 1999 li and jiao 2001 and in an aquifer system where groundwater is seasonally extracted such as the alluvial shanghai aquifer system shi et al 2008a xue et al 2008 zhang et al 2007 in a multi layered aquifer system experiencing phhv an aquitard subjected to periodic signals may also exhibit periodic deformation liu and helm 2008b ye and xue 2005 under this scenario the time lag in the aquitard deformation can be manifested as a phase shift between the deformation and phhv within adjacent aquifers based on the time lag of the deformation of an aquifer system liu and helm 2008a proposed a graphic analytic method to obtain the estimates of k v s ske s skv and initial preconsolidation effective stress of aquitards consisting of lenticular interbeds as well as the skeletal specific storage of the aquifer liu and helm 2008b and luo et al 2016 respectively employed this method to several extensometer sites in shanghai china to obtain the initial estimates for their numerical inversion models however the formula utilized in this graphic analytic method lacked theoretical basis and may not be suitable for aquitards with thicknesses of tens to hundreds of meters zhuang et al 2017a events such as high intensity groundwater extraction over long periods or glacial loading could cause aquitards to become overconsolidated overconsolidated refers to sediments that have experienced a higher overburden load in the past konikow and neuzil 2007 as long as the investigated aquitard stays overconsolidated i e the aquifer hydraulic head is higher than the preconsolidation head an aquitard undergoes elastic deformation konikow and neuzil 2007 for an aquifer system experiencing seasonal pumping seasonal phhv within aquifers may be recorded meanwhile periodic deformation of an overconsolidated aquitard may also be visible from extensometer data after revisiting the elastic deformation of an overconsolidated aquitard subjected to phhv within adjacent aquifers through a dimensionless analytical solution zhuang et al 2017a proposed an analytic method to identify k v and s ske however they ignored the influence of phase difference in phhv between adjacent aquifers on the parameter estimates the objective of this study is to explore the influences of phase difference between aquifer phhv on the periodic deformation behaviors of an overconsolidated aquitard and to develop a parameter estimation method to obtain k v and s ske from long term extensometer data we first construct a one dimensional hydraulic response model for the overconsolidated aquitard and further derive the analytical solution for elastic aquitard deformation secondly the characteristics of periodic aquitard deformation will be revisited thirdly a parameter estimation method utilizing the developed model will be investigated lastly the newly proposed method will be applied to an aquitard at an extensometer site in shanghai china 2 model setup and analytical solution a simple one dimensional system with an aquitard confined by two aquifers is constructed as shown in fig 1 the system is subjected to the following assumptions a the aquitard is vertically homogeneous and the hydraulic parameters are constant with time b the kv of the aquitard is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than adjacent aquifers for ensuring that flow and deformation only occur in the vertical direction c the aquitard is overconsolidated and subjected to phhv within adjacent aquifers and d the aquitard remains saturated with vertical flow taking place that obeys darcy s law let the z axis be vertical positive upward with its origin at the contact surface between the aquitard and the underlying aquifer fig 1 it is assumed that the overconsolidated aquitard is subjected to long term stable phhv within adjacent aquifers under this assumption the overconsolidated aquitard only undergoes elastic deformation it is also assumed that water expansion is negligible thus k v lt 1 and s ske l 1 are two key hydraulic parameters that control flow and deformation behaviors within the aquitard based on the above assumptions the following governing equation can be used to describe groundwater flow within the aquitard 1 k v 2 h z t z 2 s ske h z t t where h z t is the hydraulic head in the aquitard at location z l and time t t based on euler s formula phhv within the underlying and overlying aquifers can be represented in complex form as 2 h z t z 0 h u a u exp 2 π i t t i φ u 3 h z t z b h o a o exp 2 π i t t i φ u i θ where b is the aquitard thickness i 1 a u and a o denote the amplitude l of phhv within the underlying and overlying aquifers respectively t is the period t φ u is the initial phase of phhv within the underlying aquifer θ is the phase difference radian in phhv between the two aquifers h u and h o are the mean hydraulic heads of the underlying and overlying aquifers respectively note that physical aquifer heads are assured in eqs 2 and 3 by taking the real parts of complex products a u exp 2 π i t t i φ u and a o exp 2 π i t t i φ u i θ the separation of variables method has been widely employed to derive analytical solutions for coastal aquifers in response to tidal fluctuations e g guo et al 2010 jiao and tang 1999 li and jiao 2001 wang et al 2015 an advantage of the separation of variables method is that no initial condition is needed the periodic aquitard hydraulic head h z t can be represented as an exponential function based on euler s formula after employing the separation of variables method trefry 1999 4 h z t h s z h p z exp 2 π i t t i φ u where h s z and h p z represent the steady and periodic components of h z t note that the physical aquitard head is the real part of eq 4 substituting eq 4 into eq 1 yields 5 d 2 h s z 2 0 6 d 2 h p d z 2 2 π i s ske k v t h p 0 while substituting eqs 2 and 3 into eq 4 yields h s 0 h u h s b h o h p 0 a u and h p b a o exp i θ thus the analytical solutions for h s and h p are 7 h s h o h u b z h u 8 h p a u cosh α z b a o exp i θ csch α a u coth α sinh α z b where α 2 π i t d and t d k v t s ske b 2 according to the water balance concept the volume of water released from an aquitard is equal to the volume of aquitard deformation therefore the cumulative deformation of a one dimensional aquitard can be calculated as 9 f s ske 0 b h z t h z 0 d z s ske a u b f d where 10 f d f d p exp α 2 t d i φ u exp i φ u t d k v t s ske b 2 and 11 f d p 1 α 1 a d exp i θ coth α csch α where a d a o a u is the amplitude ratio of phhv within the overlying to the underlying aquifers note that f d is exactly the dimensionless form of f and f d p is a complex variable that carries the information about the amplitude and phase of f d the dimensionless amplitude a f d and radian phase shift δ τ f d of f d can be further computed as 12 a f d e r 2 e i 2 13 δ τ f d arctan e i e r where e r re f d p e i im f d p and re and im denote the real and imaginary parts of the expression respectively 3 effects of phase difference it can be found from eq 11 that the phase difference θ impacts f d p to quantitatively explore the influence of θ on a f d and δ τ f d we consider a specific case of a d 1 suggesting that adjacent aquifers have the same amplitude of phhv we use eq 12 to derive an a f d t d curve depending on different θ values as shown in fig 2 a the derivative of a f d with respect to t d i e ε d a f d d t d or the growth rate of a f d is also numerically derived as shown in fig 2b eq 13 is used to derive a δ τ f d t d curve depending on different θ values as shown in fig 3 a in addition the derivative of δ τ f d with respect to t d i e η d δ τ f d d t d or the growth rate of δ τ f d is numerically derived as shown in fig 3b fig 2a shows that a f d consistently grows with t d given a known θ π this is due to the fact that a larger period provides the aquitard more time to continuously compress or rebound thus a larger deformation amplitude occurs however we note that ε i e the growth rate of a f d consistently decreases with t d in particular when t d is larger than 1 ε almost decreases to zero fig 2b or a f d approximately reaches a steady value fig 2a this is attributed to the fact that a larger period renders the aquitard to become more capable in substantially mitigating the delayed deformation thus the growth rate decreases we also note that a f d decreases with θ for a given t d this is due to the fact that a larger θ makes phhv within the overlying aquifer offset more of the elastic deformation caused by phhv within the underlying aquifer in particular if θ π the phhv within the two aquifers demonstrate reverse periodic patterns so there is no net elastic deformation and one has a f d 0 fig 2a it should be noted that a negative θ results in the same a f d t d curve as that resulting from a positive one due to the lower kv periodic aquitard deformation is associated with a phase shift from phhv within adjacent aquifers fig 3a shows that the phase difference θ does not impact the growth pattern of δ τ f d versus t d to be specific when t d is smaller than 0 03 δ τ f d is approximately stable when t d exceeds 0 03 δ τ f d starts to slightly decrease at t d 0 2 δ τ f d reaches the minimum value when t d exceeds 0 2 δ τ f d continually grows and approaches half of the phase difference θ a very small t d value means the phhv with the aquifer can only penetrate the aquitard over a very small distance in this case the delayed aquitard drainage could be approximately proportional to t d thus δ τ f d is nearly stable at small t d values zhuang et al 2017a for a known phase difference θ the specific value of t d 0 2 which corresponds to the extreme δ τ f d value potentially means that the phhv within one aquifer is mitigating aquitard drainage within the portion that is close to another aquifer for larger t d values both aquifers mitigate the drainage within all of the investigated aquitard thus the degree of the dissipation of delayed aquitard drainage increases with t d resulting in a continually growing δ τ f d fig 3a also shows that for a positive θ δ τ f d can be equal to zero e g θ π 3 and t d 0 82 θ π 6 and t d 1 91 it should be noted that δ τ f d is given in radian so the real radian phase shift δ τ f of the periodic aquitard deformation is equal to δ τ f d as a result one may not see a phase shift between the elastic aquitard deformation and phhv within one of adjacent aquifers from long term hydrograph and extensometer data fig 3b shows that η i e the growth rate of δ τ f d has multiple zeros however we note that theoretical extremes of δ τ f d corresponding to the zeros cannot be readily recognized from fig 3a suggesting complex characteristics of periodic aquitard deformation particularly when t d is larger than 0 2 η increases first and then decreases and η reaches the maximum value of 0 574 at t d 0 483 if the period of phhv is large enough to render t d larger than 10 η is approximately equal to zero suggesting almost complete dissipation of delayed deformation in the land subsidence community subsidence mitigation and prevention remains a challenge due to the lack of full understanding of compaction mechanism of a geological formation tsai and hsu 2018 from the perspective of engineering practice the influences of phase difference between aquifer phhv on the periodic aquitard deformation behaviors as stated above does have some implications specifically this research suggests that seasonal groundwater exploitation carried out in two aquifers adjacent to an interbedded aquitard could be designed in an asynchronous pattern so that aquitard compaction can be mitigated to some extent 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is commonly used to evaluate the influence of input parameters on the output results of a model the normalized sensitivity analysis proposed by huang and yeh 2007 is carried out to analyze the influence of a d and θ on the amplitude a f d and phase shift δ τ f d of the elastic aquitard deformation f d the normalized sensitivity coefficient is defined and calculated as 14 s i j p j o i p j p j o i p j δ p j o i p j δ p j in which s i j is the normalized sensitivity value of the j th input parameter p j at the i th t d value o i represents the output of the model amplitude a f d and phase shift δ τ f d in this study and δ p j is a small increment which is selected as 10 2 p j based on the developed solutions i e eqs 11 13 the parameters used in the sensitivity study include the dimensionless amplitude ratio a d and the phase difference θ of phhv between adjacent aquifers note that figs 2b and 3b are already representative of the sensitivity analysis of a f d and δ τ f d to t d respectively in the following analysis the absolute value of s i j is employed for the sake of comparison fig 4 shows the sensitivity of deformation amplitude a f d and phase shift δ τ f d to parameters a d and θ with the base values of a d 1 and θ π 6 fig 4a shows that the sensitivity of deformation amplitude a f d to amplitude ratio a d and phase difference θ of phhv between adjacent aquifers dramatically increases with t d when t d is smaller than 1 and the sensitivity approaches a constant when t d is larger than 1 in addition the sensitivity of a f d is more sensitive to a d than to θ the higher sensitivity of a f d to a d is mainly due to the fact that the amplitude of aquifer phhv directly determines the magnitude of hydraulic head changes within the aquitard fig 4b shows that the sensitivity of the phase shift δ τ f d of aquitard deformation to a d and θ remains constant for different t d values and δ τ f d is more sensitive to θ than to δ τ f d the higher sensitivity of δ τ f d to θ is mainly because the phase difference θ in phhv between adjacent aquifers directly determines the degree of offset in the elastic aquitard deformation caused by each adjacent aquifer from the perspective of parameter estimation above sensitivity analysis suggests that the amplitude ratio a d of phhv must be carefully determined for obtaining a reliable s ske estimate meanwhile although the low kv of the aquitard mainly makes the aquitard deformation lag behind phhv within adjacent aquifers the deformation phase shift δ τ f d is also sensitive to the phase difference θ in aquifer phhv figs 3a and 4b suggesting that θ must be carefully determined for obtaining a reliable k v estimate 5 aquitard parameter estimation now we present the following four steps for estimating k v and s ske of the overconsolidated aquitard as following step 1 firstly one determines the aquitard thickness b based on a borehole log secondly one determines the period t and amplitudes a o and a u as well as the phase difference θ in phhv between the overlying and underlying aquifers based on long term hydrograph data thirdly one determines the amplitude a f of elastic aquitard deformation and the corresponding radian phase shift δ τ f after further analyzing the long term extensometer data step 2 firstly with determined a o and a u one calculates the amplitude ratio of a d a o a u secondly one uses eq 12 to draw the standard curve of a f d versus t d depending on determined a d and θ values thirdly one uses eq 13 to draw the standard curve of δ τ f d t d that depends on determined a d and θ values step 3 one determines the real t d value corresponding to δ τ f from the δ τ f d t d curve then one determines the real a f d value corresponding to the real t d value from the a f d t d curve step 4 based on eq 9 one calculates s ske as 15 s ske a f a f d a u b finally one substitutes the s ske estimate into the expression of t d to calculate k v as 16 k v t d s ske b 2 t it should be noted that the key issue associated with the new parameter estimation method is the uniqueness of t d although δ τ f d can be readily determined from long term hydrograph and extensometer data t d might be difficult to determine when t d is smaller than 0 2 or larger than 10 fig 3a it is noteworthy that t d is dependent on the period t to the first power thus if the frequency of phhv within adjacent aquifers is too high or too low the usage of this estimation method could be limited furthermore t d is dependent on the aquifer thickness b raised to the second power as a consequence from a practical point of view the newly proposed parameter estimation method may not be applicable to a very thin or very thick aquitard 6 application the proposed new method is tested using data from a field extensometer site located in shanghai china as shown in fig 5 all the hydrogeological data and information in this section are taken from zhuang et al 2017a and references therein details to hydrogeological conditions and groundwater exploitation history of the shanghai aquifer aquitard system can be found in several other studies e g shi et al 2008a b in this study we briefly introduce the hydrogeological background shanghai is underlain by a multi layered aquifer aquitard system with a thickness ranging from 200 m to 350 m and the system consists of six aquifers one unconfined and five confined and six adjoining aquitards from the top to bottom ye and xue 2005 fig 6 shows a cross section of the shanghai multi aquifer aquitard system groundwater exploitation in shanghai city began since the 1860s and the amount of withdrawal increased yearly until the 1960s due to groundwater withdrawal aquifer hydraulic head declined over the years resulting in severe land subsidence at shanghai which was first observed in 1921 since 1965 aquifer hydraulic head decline and severe land subsidence have been effectively controlled by artificial groundwater recharge combined with reduced exploitation of groundwater however after late 1980s more groundwater was extracted due to the rapid development of the economy since then groundwater levels began to decline again and land subsidence resumed the second aquitard is investigated through this study the second aquitard is buried beneath the ground surface from 44 31 to 78 85 m with a thickness of b 34 54 m and it consists of grayish yellow silty clay interbedded with sandy silt shi et al 2008b ye et al 2005 the first confined aquifer overlies the second aquitard and the second confined aquifer underlies it long term hydraulic head variations in the two confined aquifers are shown in fig 7 a and b an extensometer is mostly used to monitor the vertical movement of a prescribed interface of two hydrogeological units so that the cumulative deformation of an investigated hydrogeological unit can be easily derived the extensometer f10 7 which belongs to the extensometer group f10 that is situated near cross section i i fig 5 recorded the deformation history of the second aquitard as shown in fig 7c because of the artificial control of groundwater exploitation aquifer head variations demonstrate periodic characteristics and the periods are t 1 year prior to the start of the record as shown in fig 7 the aquifer hydraulic heads and the aquitard deformation varied at a stable periodic state which is similar to the deeper hydrogeological units of the study area luo et al 2016 thus the second aquitard was overconsolidated shi et al 2008b during the 1990s the aquifer hydraulic heads however did not fluctuate in a strictly stable fashion in fact both of them exhibit an overall declining trend over the period of record fig 7a and b this is consistent with the groundwater exploitation history of shanghai because of this periodically declining pattern in aquifer hydraulic heads aquitard deformation is not perfectly elastic resulting in its net compaction fig 7c fig 7a and b shows that the periodically declining hydraulic head variations within adjacent aquifers can be approximated as the sum of a stable seasonally fluctuating component and a linearly declining hydraulic head component the apparent elastic deformation is mainly caused by a seasonally varying component while the overall compaction is mainly caused by the linearly declining component zhuang et al 2017a to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the second aquitard we approximate the observed seasonal hydraulic heads using a trigonometric function combined with a linear function fig 7a and b these data are fitted using the trust region algorithm included in the curve fitting toolbox of matlab since the regular period of hydraulic head within each aquifer is t 1 year the custom fitting equation is set as y a x 1986 b c cos 2 π x 1986 d where a b c and d are four constants estimated through the fitting algorithm fig 7a and b note that constants c and d are key values for estimating aquitard hydraulic parameters after choosing reasonable initial estimates and upper and lower bounds for the four constants the fitted results are shown in fig 7a and b the amplitudes of aquifer hydraulic heads are a o 0 908 m and a u 3 039 m for the overlying and underlying aquifers respectively thus one has a d a o a u 0 299 the phase difference in phhv between the first and second confined aquifers is then calculated to be θ 0 146 π given determined values of a d and θ two standard curves a f d t d and δ τ f d t d are derived as shown in fig 8 we adopt the same fitting algorithm to deal with the aquitard deformation data however to minimize the impact of overall declining trend in aquifer hydraulic head variations we only choose the first three periods of observed deformation data for fitting fig 7c the resulting amplitude of elastic deformation is a f 3 183 mm and the radian phase shift of the deformation referring to the periodic hydraulic head variations within the second confined aquifer is δ τ f 0 504 since δ τ f δ τ f d the real dimensionless period corresponding to determined δ τ f is read to be t d 1 1788 solid diamond point in fig 8b thus we further obtain a f d 0 5652 solid diamond in fig 8a as a consequence the elastic skeletal specific storage is calculated to be s ske 3 183 10 3 m 0 5652 3 039 m 34 54 m 5 37 10 5 m 1 according to eq 15 and the vertical hydraulic conductivity is calculated to be k v 1 1788 5 37 10 5 m 1 34 54 m 2 1 year 7 55 10 2 m year according to eq 16 a straight comparison between the simulated and observed elastic aquitard deformation during the first three periods or from 1986 to 1989 fig 7c can now be carried out at the year 1986 the phase of phhv within the underlying confined aquifer is φ u 0 1773 2 π 1 114 fig 7b and the periodic aquitard deformation is about 3 183 cos 2 π 0 0 2575 0 150 mm fig 7c thus after substituting estimated k v and s ske into eq 9 the simulated periodic component of elastic aquitard deformation from 1986 to 1989 is finally obtained as shown in fig 9 with the k v and s ske estimates the linear component of elastic aquitard deformation from 1986 to 1989 is further derived using the analytical solution of zhuang et al 2017a as also shown in fig 9 the simulated elastic aquitard deformation is the sum of linear and periodic components 7 discussion fig 9 reveals that the simulated deformation curve is quite close to the observed one with an r squared value of 0 97 which is equal to the fitting result as shown in fig 7c this is mainly due to the fact that the proposed parameter estimation is deterministic and the parameter estimates are unique furthermore the excellent fit between the simulated and observed deformation suggests that the delayed deformation caused by the linear component of hydraulic head variations within adjacent aquifers has weak effects on parameter estimates after a comparative analysis we find that the analytic method proposed by zhuang et al 2017a led to slightly under estimated parameter estimates k v 7 45 10 2 m year and s ske 5 26 10 5 m 1 this is mainly because they ignored the phase difference θ in phhv between the first and second confined aquifers fig 2 shows that ignoring the phase difference θ will result in over estimating a f d as a consequence s ske will be under estimated according to eq 15 consequently k v will be under estimated according to eq 16 for this field application case zhuang et al 2017a also conducted inverse modeling and the calibrated parameter estimates are k v 7 06 0 34 10 2 m year and s ske 5 51 0 20 10 5 m 1 which are fairly close to those obtained from the newly proposed parameter estimation method the visible difference in the parameter estimates between the new estimation method and inverse modeling can be attributed to two aspects of uncertainties firstly the reliability of parameter estimates relies on the prerequisite that the aquitard only undergoes elastic deformation during the first three periods of the extensometer record the residual non elastic deformation if it does exist during the first three periods of the deformation record could influence the accuracy of parameter estimates obtained from the new method secondly a specific practice we employ is that the periodic component of aquitard deformation is directly subtracted from the extensometer record an implicit assumption behind this practice is that there is no time lag in the elastic aquitard deformation caused by the linear component of the aquifer hydraulic head variations we admit that this practice could lead to some uncertainties in k v and s ske estimates because the linear aquifer hydraulic head variations could also produce a time lag in the elastic aquitard deformation zhuang et al 2017a however even with these limitations we think that the derived analytical solution can be used to quantitatively explain the time lag features that can be seen from the extensometer data furthermore the newly proposed parameter estimation method can be a powerful tool to derive reasonable aquitard hydraulic parameters controlling elastic deformation note that the new parameter estimation method is developed for a single overconsolidated aquitard to meet the prerequisite that the aquitard is overconsolidated one may need to refer to the long term record of groundwater level variations an aquitard is likely to be overconsolidated when the current groundwater level is higher than that in the past in addition to our knowledge many extensometers extend through multiple aquifers and aquitards in this case if one view this multi layered aquifer aquitard system as a single hydrogeological unit the average values of k v and s ske estimates of the unit might be obtained through the application of this new method one may commonly see that an aquitard undergoes simultaneous elastic and non elastic deformation subjected to periodic hydraulic head variations within adjacent aquifers and this is particularly true for a normally consolidated aquitard under this circumstance groundwater drainage within the aquitard is highly non linear for the second aquitard of interest although zhuang et al 2017a directly subtracted the elastic component of aquitard deformation from the whole record and obtained a reasonable estimate of inelastic skeletal specific storage we have to point out that their practice lacks theoretical support thus to theoretically explore the influences of non elastic deformation as well as delayed deformation caused by the linear component of aquifer hydraulic head variations on parameter estimates obtained from the new method could be a valuable research topic in the future meanwhile the simultaneous interpretation of elastic and inelastic skeletal specific storage values from long term extensometer data based on an analytical approach is particularly necessary 8 summary and conclusions the analytical solution for elastic deformation of an overconsolidated aquitard subjected to periodic hydraulic head variations phhv within adjacent aquifers has been derived using the separation of variables method based on euler s formula a new parameter estimation method has been further developed based on an analytical solution to estimate the vertical hydraulic conductivity k v and elastic skeletal specific storage s ske that control the elastic deformation behaviors the new method has been applied to a 34 54 m thick aquitard at a field extensometer site located in shanghai china the main conclusions from this study are 1 the amplitude of periodic deformation of the overconsolidated aquitard consistently grows with the period of phhv within adjacent aquifers but the growth rate consistently declines a larger phase difference in phhv results in a smaller deformation amplitude if phhv within adjacent aquifers are at the same amplitude but with a radian phase difference of π the aquitard will not deform 2 the time lag of periodic aquitard deformation is manifested as a phase shift between the periodic deformation and phhv within adjacent aquifers the phase shift reaches the minimum value at the dimensionless period of 0 2 the phase difference in phhv between the two aquifers however does not impact the growth pattern of the phase shift versus the period due to the influence of phase difference in phhv the time lag features of periodic aquitard deformation can be weakened under specific conditions periodic aquitard deformation may even become synchronous with phhv within one of adjacent aquifers 3 the new parameter estimation method involves two standard curves which are the amplitude and phase shift of the periodic aquitard deformation versus the period depending on the amplitude ratio and phase difference in phhv between the aquifers adjacent to the investigated overconsolidated aquitard in hydrogeological or engineering practice the new estimation method may not be applicable when the phhv is too high or too low in frequency and to an aquitard that is too small or too large in thickness 4 the field application of this method confirms that ignoring the phase difference can result in under estimated k v and s ske overall the derived analytical solution can be used to quantitatively explain some time lag features revealed from the long term extensometer record and the new parameter estimation method can be a powerful tool

5693,hydrometeorologic monitoring networks are ubiquitous in contemporary earth system science network stakeholders often inquire about the importance of sites and their locations when discussing funding and monitoring design support vector machines svms can be useful by their assigning each monitoring site as either a support or nonsupport vector a potentiometric surface was created from synthetic data and 800 random observation locations sites as an analog to a groundwater level network using generalized additive models for potentiometric surface prediction simulations show that a subsample of support vectors from the 800 sites will out perform random samples of sample size equaling the support vector count support vector percentages from simulation quantify the recurrence that svms assign each site as a support vector and these percentages in turn measure site importance an example application of support vector percentages identifies important monitoring sites needed to regionalize the 0 1 annual exceedance probability peak streamflow the results indicate that 152 of 283 streamgages with support vector percentages equalling 100 percent have not operated since about 2000 and generally have much smaller drainage areas than the greater streamgage network in texas the drainage area disparity is an indication of historical imbalance in peak streamflow data

texas 1 introduction hydrometeorologic monitoring observation networks are ubiquitous in contemporary earth system science the networks usually collect water resources data such as groundwater levels surface water streamflow and precipitation networks collect data in multi dimensional domains of covariates including space horizontal and vertical dimensions along with time somewhat less obvious covariates exist for example groundwater level responses in wells are affected by the given hydrogeologic framework aquifer geometry and properties type of well completion construction local and regional pumping histories and contexts of seasonal recharge and discharge streamflow responses conversely are produced by precipitation inputs on a watershed characterized by a drainage area channel slope land use patterns soil horizons and geologic substrata one of many science objectives of hydrometeorologic networks especially surface water and meteorology is the collection of data from which computed statistics e g annual minimum water levels 0 1 and 0 01 annual exceedance probability peak streamflows or mean annual precipitation can be used with predictor variables covariates to make estimates at unmonitored locations statistical techniques used range across a broad class of prediction methods from multi linear regression e g asquith and roussel 2009 williams sether 2015 to sophisticated machine learning e g carlisle et al 2016 1 1 reasons for network analyses network analyses include understanding the information content produced by a monitoring network and how the network has evolved over time such understanding constitutes just a part of overall network analysis and evaluation network analyses are important not only for scientific and statistical purposes but are crucial to the various stakeholders investing funds in and or planning the design of a given network groundwater monitoring networks have been widely studied and remain of great interest to researchers and local stakeholders andricevic 1989 1990 esquivel et al 2015 fisher 2013 kollat et al 2011 van greer et al 1991 wood 2004 precipitation networks e g putthividhya and tanaka 2012 also have been widely studied and concepts such as entropy and information theory are useful e g chen et al 2007 streamgage networks at regional state and national scales also have been widely studied chebbi et al 2017 kiang et al 2013 markus et al 2003 medina 1987 national research council 2004 in particular markus et al 2003 assessed information transfer amongst the streamflows in the context of various hydrologic regimes data regimes low average and high flow conditions the study also demonstrated an additional complexity in network analyses often the characteristic statistic of interest for statistical transfer requires selection which means that the statistic under study can influence network analysis itself stakeholder interests generally have scientific or statistical concerns about networks which include questions such as is the our their network designed to collect 1 data sufficiently in space 2 data sufficiently in time sampling intervals 3 data in a cost effective scientifically justified manner and or 4 data at a price of some information gaps further interests could include asking whether redundant data are being collected challenges in quantitative answers to these questions further predicate what type of objective function is to be maximized or minimized and whether a universal quantitative objective for all stakeholders even exists some issues to consider are financial constraints or prediction uncertainties of statistical estimates projected for unmonitored locations of interest 1 2 study purpose design and organization this study investigates a novel use of support vector machines svms bishop 2006 steinwart and christmann 2008 to support hydrometeorologic monitoring network analyses a hypothetical observational groundwater well network and statistical methods are used to predict a known 2 dimensional potentiometric surface the study is oriented around simulations to pinpoint the most and least informative sites in a network through their identification as support vectors by the svm two specific objectives are 1 to show that sites in a network identified as svm support vectors contain more information than random sites in the network and 2 to show that large prediction differences from svms and regression like methods could be used to identify information gaps in the network mathematics and implementation overview of statistical methods are presented in section 2 and include gams section 2 1 and svms section 2 2 the primary data for this study are synthetic and are described in section 3 a 1 dimensional prediction example in section 4 communicates several geometrical nuances of these methods sets up a more thorough study of surface estimation section 5 using the synthetic data section 5 1 formally frames a question as to how support vectors could be useful for network analyses experiments with gams and svms using all the data are conducted section 5 2 which are followed by study of support vector subsamples section 5 3 further experiments based on simulation of svms are presented in section 5 4 followed by closing discussion section 5 5 an example application section 6 for a

statistical prediction surface estimation methods often include multi linear regression faraway 2005 faraway 2006 inverse distance weighting brunsdon comber 2015 davis 2002 geostatistical methods of kriging and its variants chebbi et al 2017 davis 2002 olea 1999 tonkin and larson 2002 and machine learning kuhn and johnson 2016 in this study gams stasinopoulos et al 2017 wood 2017 were chosen for spatial prediction because they offer sufficient flexibility are fast and are readily extendable into higher covariate dimensions because they are analogous to regression gams in contrast to svms offer familiar diagnostics including adjusted r squared residual standard errors standard errors of prediction and p values svms were also used in a regression mode a general feature of svms is that certain observations are retained by the model whereas other observations are not the in and out binary classification of individual data points by svms is of interest to this study 2 1 generalized additive models gams gams are flexible and capable of mimicking complex and curvilinear patterns in data harwell and tibshirani 1990 hastie et al 2008 wood 2017 gams model a response variable using an additive combination of various parametric terms and smooth terms smooth functions of predictor variables the incorporation of smooth functions is an advantage of a gam over simpler multi linear least squares regression and similar methods because appropriately configured smooth functions can adapt to nonlinear relations a general form of a gam is 1 z i β o x i θ f q i i where z i is the response variable that is the i th observation β o is an intercept x i is a vector for strictly parametric and suitably transformed predictor variables θ is a one column parameter matrix of length equaling the number of parametric predictors f is a smooth function that has arguments estimated automatically for the predictor variable q i the three dots represent additional smooth terms as needed and i are errors residuals taken as independent and identically distributed i i d with zero mean a distribution family such as gaussian binomial or poisson can be chosen as needed for the model of these errors specifically for this study z i is an observation of the synthetic data for a given location the x i θ term is the multi linear parametric regression faraway 2005 component of a gam and is not considered further in this study a gam is fit by the defaults provided in wood 2019 using penalized iterative re weighted least squares pirls p 180 182 wood 2017 and a generalized cross validation gcv a type of leave one out score for the smoothness controls on the smooth functions p 171 wood 2017 for this study the gam formulation is 2 z i β o f x i y i i where z i again is the response variable for the ith observation β o is an intercept x i is an easting horizontal coordinate y i is a northing horizontal coordinate and f x i y i is a 2 dimensional smooth the gam function from wood 2019 was used for this study the error distribution family was gaussian normal default and the f x i y i used a thin plate regression spline gams by their nature have some capacity to reasonably extrapolate somewhat away from the data in contrast to svms 2 2 support vector machines svms svms are a type of machine learning approach to prediction in which complex linear combinations of specific data points the support vectors and attendant weights are used to define a hyperplane through the data entire data set svms kuhn and johnson 2016 hastie et al 2008 steinwart and christmann 2008 like gams also are flexible and capable of mimicking curvilinear patterns in the data but mathematically svms are very different svm description is best given as an analogy to linear regression although svms are commonly thought of as binary classifiers svms also have a history of use in novelty detection outlier identification clifton et al 2014 pimentel et al 2014 svms are also a type of robust regression in which squared residuals are not used for fitting as they are in least squares regression faraway 2005 as a result data points with large residuals have limited effects on the fitted svm kuhn and johnson 2016 p 153 a curious and distinct identifying feature of svms is that the data points residing near predictions residing in the prediction tube by the svm will actually have no effect no effect means that the weights for some data points are zero and such observations are not required to support the model some control on how large residuals can be with no effect on the svm is influenced by a so called epsilon setting it is this either in and out binary classification that is critical to this study because the binary distinction is a simple and approachable concept to describe to stakeholders with various disciplinary backgrounds the fit phase of an svm is based on minimization of an error function subject to a penalty as the model progresses towards overfitting following the description from kuhn and johnson 2016 the coefficients β j of a fitted svm minimize the f o objective function for a model having p number of predictors 3 f o y i c l c i 1 n l z i z i svm j 1 p β j 2 where c is a penalty cost parameter that is responsible for penalizing large residuals i z i z i for the n sample of z i and predictions z i the c is a multiplicative factor on an l error function a basis function to increase or decrease the importance of errors the l can be a number of so called kernels including linear kernel polynomial kernel gaussian radial basis functions rbfs and others the rbf represents a normalized euclidean distance metric bishop 2006 chap 6 and rbf use is prevalent the l has an epsilon setting svm in svm implementation karatzoglou et al 2018 that controls the width of the prediction tube which influences the inclusion of data near the svm hyperplane the regression like the method of least squares faraway 2005 large i increase the objective function being used but in contrast to least squares large β j also act to increase the objective function in the regression analogy and given that vector of predictors x i x 1 i x 2 i x pi for the i having size n svm mathematics can be shown using real world examples the vector of predictors could represent 1 the coordinates of a groundwater well and current monthly rainfall for the month of the water level measurement or 2 the drainage area channel slope mean annual precipitation and percent grassland area of a watershed for the ith mean annual streamflow observation an estimate prediction for a sample z i uses a linear combination of model parameters coefficients β j and is applied to the new sample of the p predictors u j for j 1 2 p a prediction z can be written with the intercept term β 0 as 4 z β 0 β 1 u 1 β p u p β 0 j 1 p β j u j the β j parameters are chosen such that the sum of squared errors sse is minimized 5 sse i 1 n z i z i 2 the linear svm uses these same mathematics when used for estimation but the β j estimates importantly can be written as functions of a set of additional but unknown hyperparameters α i and the sample data of size n denoted as x ij so that 6 z β 0 β 1 u 1 β p u p β 0 j 1 p β j u j β 0 j 1 p i 1 n α i x ij u j β 0 i 1 n α i j 1 p x ij u j the final form shows weighted linear combinations of training data and the new explanatory data used to make predictions the matrix algebra can be rewrite the training data and the new explanatory data as a linear kernel function p 155 kuhn and johnson 2016 with notational adjustment the function itself can be replaced with a nonlinear kernel that extends the svm into nonlinear regression there are as many α i parameters as there are data points compared to conventional regression the svm is highly over parameterized as judged by the tenet of conventional regression that the model should have vastly fewer parameters than data points p 154 kuhn and johnson 2016 but the penalty or cost used for svm fit compensates for this undesirable situation and in practice many of the α i have a value of zero those observations x i and y i with α i 0 support the model the support vectors which means that these and only these observations are required during the svm s prediction phase geometrically the values closest to the predictions have weights α i 0 and these observations are plausibly less informative to clarify a point of common confusion the support vectors are classified during the fit or training phase of the svm and are not a decision made by the human user thus the svm is known as a sparse model the origin of the sparsity of svms is succinctly stated by bishop 2006 the hyperplane is defined by the locations of the support vectors other data points the nonsupport vectors can be moved freely without changing the decision boundary in regression this means that the solution of the svm is independent of these other data points nonsupport vectors and is thus formed by those observations that are in a sense furthest away from central tendencies of the covariates conditioned on the value of the response variable in contrast with gams svms might be less utilitarian as extrapolation increases away from the training data when given new data on which to make predictions as extrapolation is encountered the svm regresses to the global mean of the training data the ksvm function from karatzoglou et al 2018 and further described by karatzoglou et al 2006 was used for this study with a default radial basis kernel as gaussian normal eight kernels are provided by karatzoglou et al 2018 but users could provide their own the sensitivity results to the choice of kernel were not assessed in this study and the default settings of c 1 and svm 0 1 were used unless otherwise stated 3 synthetic data as an analog to a groundwater level network synthetic data were created for this study to investigate the ability of svms to estimate a 2 dimensional potentiometric surface of a water table in an unconfined aquifer the synthetic data are conceptually consistent with that data collected from a common groundwater level network statistical estimation of groundwater levels at unmonitored locations in time and space could accelerate development of numerical simulation models and assist the change in paradigm thinking proposed by white 2017 the experimental surface z x y for spatial locations x and y is defined as 7 z i x i y i 20 sin 1 75 π x i y i 100 20 cos 1 50 π y i 100 0 001 x i 2 0 1 y i n i 0 2 where z i is a water level for x i as an easting horizontal coordinate and y i as a northing vertical coordinate for the ith observation the n i μ 0 σ 2 is gaussian normally distributed noise with a mean μ of zero and a standard deviation σ of 2 which was arbitrarily chosen it is desirable for the surface to have sufficient complexity to stress statistical prediction the noise component is added to provide some mimicry of real world conditions in practical applications the continuous surface is unknown and is instead observed at discrete and irregular points for this study 800 random observation locations were generated using a seed on the random number generator set to 62 set seed 62 an arbitrary value prior to prediction of the x coordinates the y coordinates and the z from the x y declaration of the seed is to foster some reproducibility of results with the code base provided in the supplementary materials that accompany this paper depictions of the potentiometric surface are made by the contour fig 1 a and image fig 1b functions by a unit incremented grid of i j 1 2 200 to become x i i and y j j easting and northing respectively no statistical prediction is intended to be represented in the figure just simple visualization the raggedness of the contour lines represents the added noise component the highest contours are near the lower right whereas the lowest contours are near the upper left in both figures the 800 locations from random values for the x and y coordinates and then the associated z x y become a set of observational data for this study where the locations are analogs to groundwater wells the x y and z are used to construct and use predictive statistical models described in sections 4 and 5 4 a one dimensional example of gam and svm geometry to assist in understanding what support vectors are it is useful to compare and contrast svm and gam performance in a 1 dimensional problem one predictor variable to this end a left to right partition in fig 1 was extracted between 50 and 100 in the northing vertical coordinates the extracted data are shown in fig 2 the gam uses all of the 800 locations shown whereas the svm uses just the support vectors as shown although all 800 locations are fed to the svm algorithms distinction is made fig 2 between the support vectors filled circles and nonsupport vectors open circles the nonsupport vectors are the data within the prediction tube defined by the svm parameter karatzoglou et al 2018 which was set at epsilon 0 3 nondefault the overall pattern and local curvature of the gam and svm predictions are similar fig 2 the gam generally shows smoother predictions than the svm however the little hooks bends in the svm solutions at the extreme far left and extreme far right are related to the svm becoming adherent to local information and then swinging back towards the global mean of the data shown to further demonstrate potential extrapolation weakness in svms the data fig 2 were then subsetted fig 3 to create a large information gap between the easting range of 100 to 150 the gam reasonably extrapolates through the gap but the svm swings toward the global mean of the data close scrutiny of the support and nonsupport vectors between figs 2 and 3 shows reclassification by the svm of some data points in the context of monitoring network analysis one topic of interest is information gap detection because the svm must regress swing towards the mean as extrapolation is progressively encountered and other methods such as the gam behave differently a range of the largest of absolute differences in predictions between a gam and an svm could be used for example consider a study domain of gaged and ungaged unmonitored streamflow sites large gam and svm differences predicted for either site type could forecast information gaps in the network stakeholders might then choose to add new monitoring or reactivate discontinued sites within those areas with gaps svms at least as implemented by karatzoglou et al 2018 have an inherent probabilistic nature this is demonstrated by one more 1 dimensional experiment the svm fit fig 3 red line and fig 4 green line and 300 repeated svm fits fig 4 transparent red lines to the data show a range of outcomes modestly different solutions do occur and are attributable in part to different combinations of support and nonsupport vectors but some trajectories seem more favorable than others an svm as it extrapolates beyond the data swings toward the global mean especially seen in fig 3 a given trajectory is influenced by the pseudo random number generator seed in force before the svm is fit by the ksvm function from karatzoglou et al 2018 5 measuring site importance using support vectors 5 1 site importance for network analyses using functions from karatzoglou et al 2018 support and nonsupport vectors can change between successive svm fits to the same dataset a hypothesis can now be stated based on support vectors containing relatively more information than nonsupport vectors in the form of a question does a sample of size n identified by the support vectors or their frequency of identification contain more information than a random sample of size n drawn from the observational network containing m sites or alternatively are support vectors though nonrandom a type of super subsample when subsetted from the original data 5 2 whole model perspective using the synthetic data section 3 a gam and svm seed set to 1 were fit to the 800 locations not accounting for the computed intercept for the gam as 800 the f x i y i smooth for the gam by the plot gam function from wood 2019 is shown in fig 5 the standard errors of the contours also are shown the figure clearly mimics some of the hills and valleys in the data fig 1 out of the 800 locations there are the 369 svm support vectors shown as red circles a comparison between the gam and svm predictions at the 800 locations fig 6 shows general overall agreement the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse and root mean square error rmse statistics of the entire sample whole model no cross validation are listed in table 1 the gam apparently is not affected prior to fitting by the seed of the random number generator the svm has systematically lower rmse than the gam which is indicative of its settings defaults for ksvm fitting tighter than the gam to the data of interest is the changing number of support vectors for the svm which ranged from 245 to 369 for the four seeds 5 3 using support vectors and nonsupport vectors as subsamples to understand the importance of support vectors as subsamples from the original data sample it is useful to fit gams to a sample comprised of the locations identified as support vectors and then again using the complement sample of the nonsupport vectors for evaluation predictions throughout the 200 200 grid fig 1b were used with the known z x y to compute 40 000 residuals because the 800 locations realistically do not exist at grid intersections the nses and rmses listed in table 2 are a form of cross validation a gam created using the 369 support vector subsample predicting on the grid out performs the gam created using 431 nonsupport vectors comparison of results for nse and rmse between two subsamples types table 2 is informative recalling the seed of 1 in table 1 a gam using the 369 support vector subsample n svm table 2 has larger nse and smaller rmse relative to a gam using the 431 nonsupport vectors n svm so although the input subsample of the nonsupport vectors is about 1 17 times larger 431 369 that larger subsample actually produces a somewhat inferior model with respect to both nse and rmse the support vectors thus are conceptualized to represent a type of super subsample conveying more information than the nonsupport vectors 5 4 simulation experiments with svms successive or looping iterations of svms that are fed the same data produce results from slightly different models and hence support vectors as an example this study uses n 369 the number of support vectors for svm as a representative number of support vectors fixing to this sampling size an experiment using 20 simulations was made the experiment was based on generating random subsamples of size n 369 from the population of 800 locations fitting a gam and making predictions throughout the 200 200 grid again these are out of sample locations the results are shown by the n rand listed in table 3 the repeated svms similar to fig 4 for clarity are the n svm listed in table 3 summary statistics of nses and rmses table 3 show that a range of these statistics occur in this experiment there are differences between the central tendency of these to those of the single gam first row of table 2 the nse for the gam in the first row of table 2 is about 0 963 which is greater than the third quartile of nse for the n rand first row of table 3 the rmse for the gam in the first row of table 2 is about 5 002 which is below the first quartile of rmse for the n rand third row of table 3 these two comparisons show that a random sample of size n produces a gam that performs worse than the gam that used the 369 support vectors as one sample using another 20 simulations the n rand 369 nse and rmse statistics listed in table 3 represent simulations in which random samples of size n 369 were generated and a gam fit after each sample generation it again is seen that the nses are generally smaller and that the rmses are generally larger for random samples than they are for the support vectors simulations also can document a potential range in support vector counts using 20 simulations successive svms were fit to all of the 800 locations and the number of support vectors recorded the number of support vectors listed in table 4 ranges between about 30 to 60 percent of the original n 800 dataset the mean is about 351 which implies that on average about 45 percent of the original dataset is identified as support vectors for at least the z x y data in this study computed using defaults of the ksvm function these percentages are termed support vector percentages and abbreviated as sv and the distribution of these is shown in fig 7 5 5 discussion support vectors are locations that reside away from the prediction tube and form a type of covariate hull the support vectors represent a nonrandom super subsample which is more informative than a random sample of equal size the karatzoglou et al 2018 svm implementation has some probabilistic feature as its algorithms progress the result is that some observations are identified more frequently than others as support vectors and sv for some locations are as high as 100 percent and other locations have sv near zero the sv distribution is inherently affected by the complexity of the surface the errors associated with it e g n 0 σ measurement errors and somewhat by the number of observation locations identification of the most and least informative sites using the sv could be useful to stakeholders and provide decision support in terms of the number of monitoring sites upgrading data collection instrumentation suites or recording intervals and rebalancing other data collection resources relevance vector machines rvms bishop 2006 tipping 2000 have an identical functional form to svms tipping 2001 but a defining characteristic of rvms is that they can be considerably more sparse in relevance vectors than an svm is in its support vectors the vectors of an rvm can be thought of as prototypical samples whereas the support vectors of an svm are outside the prediction tube rvms are computationally intensive difficult to run for sample sizes larger than a couple of thousand and are susceptible to local minima as opposed to svms that guarantee global minimization some rvm simulations data not shown suggest that isolation of only the relevance vectors is too sparse a subsample for reliable regionalization by alternative methods such as gams for example and for the 800 locations of the dataset the number of relevance vectors is often between 30 and 40 the value 0 05 40 800 means less than 5 percent of the observations are needed to define the rvm combining the relevance vectors and the support vectors would seem to identify effective subsamples however it is the author s opinion that rvm use to augment svms for the purposes here does not outweigh the algorithmic computational and documentation overhead the author formed this conclusion using the synthetic data and the defaults of the rvm function from karatzoglou et al 2018 6 example application of support vector percentages using svms a covariate space in five dimensions was studied based on retrospective analysis of u s geological survey usgs peak streamflows from an existing streamgage network in texas asquith and roussel 2009 these experimental results are restricted to the study of a single statistic the 10 year 0 1 annual exceedance probability streamflow q 0 1 the q 0 1 was chosen in part because of its highest adjusted r squared of several regional regression equations asquith and roussel 2009 the use of other streamflow statistics could lead to different insights the objectives for the example application are 1 to identify the least informative streamflow monitoring locations streamgages and 2 to identify the most informative streamgages that also have not operated since at least 2000 to the present 2019 the year 2000 is an arbitrary choice and represents a premise that a streamgage not operated in the 21st century is a firmly discontinued streamgage but yet shown as informatively critical by the svm asquith and roussel 2009 used about 640 streamgages to develop equations for estimation of peak streamflow frequency for selected annual exceedance probabilities in and near texas for the analysis in this study which list 536 streamgages with watershed properties and the corresponding q 0 1 values 536 streamgages in texas were aggregated from the original 638 streamgage network for each streamgage q 0 1 and the watershed properties of contributing drainage area a main channel slope s and mean annual precipitations p also were assembled from the asquith and roussel 2009 data files the latitudes n and longitudes e u s geological survey 2019 of the streamgages were converted to an albers equal area projection system for north american horizontal datum of 1983 using base 10 logarithmic transformations on q 0 1 a s and p and no transformation on n and e an svm of the following form was used 8 q 0 1 a s p n e further a leave one out for each of the 536 streamgages was used along with a wrapping iteration counted as a single simulation to repeat the leave one out 20 times thus 10 740 svms were constructed for each svm the support vectors actually the streamgage identification numbers were recorded and then the percent of the time each streamgage was a support vector sv support vector percentage was computed approximately half of the 536 streamgages in the texas network are support vectors about 100 percent of the time fig 8 these streamgages are branded as always support vector sites asv about 25 percent of the streamgages 100 134 536 occur as support vectors less than about 5 percent of the time for the 10 740 svm constructions and these are branded as nonsupport vector sites nsv the nsv are effectively always within the prediction tube which means that all other streamgages including the asv in the greater network could provide sufficient information to build a regional model having the capacity to make reliable estimates at the nsv locations the asv define a type of generalized hyper dimensional covariate hull of watershed properties inclusive of spatial location in texas conditional on q 0 1 these asv sites are data points deemed by the svm as critical during its machine based training process the nsv sites almost always have zero weights in the svm so it can be stated that by their very definition all asv sites are more important than nsv sites a map is shown fig 9 that separately identifies the asv and nsv sites the asv are plotted as upright triangles and nsv are plotted as inverted triangles the remaining sites are plotted as rotated squares with a red to blue color ramp prorated by sv between the asv and nsv as was similarly done for fig 8 there are 283 streamgages that are support vectors 100 percent of the time for which 152have not operated since at least the 2000 calendar year these 152streamgages are identified by the concentric circles shown fig 9 the 152 streamgages are interpreted as especially important for statistical regionalization of peak streamflow but the corresponding watersheds are currently 2019 not monitored most of these sites are located in smaller drainage areas than the greater network the overall network median contributing drainage area is about 300 square kilometers km2 whereas the median contributing drainage area for the 152streamgages is about 25 km2 table 5 these results show that many discontinued streamgages potentially are critical for regionalization of the q 0 1 peak streamflow the corresponding watersheds are quite a bit smaller in area than the overall network table 5 so by being classified as asv these streamgages generally reside near the boundaries of 5 dimensional covariate hull conditioned on the q 0 1 peak streamflows themselves a need for peak streamflow on small watersheds in texas is known and documented harwell and asquith 2011 and since about 2000 efforts have been made with stakeholders in texas to collect additional peak streamflow data on about 50 small watersheds in western texas asquith et al 2018 this example application affirms an intuitive understanding of texas streamgage history there potentially has been a data collection imbalance on peak streamflow data between small watersheds and the overall streamgage network 7 conclusions the distinction between support and nonsupport vectors by svms measures site importance for hydrometeorologic monitoring network analyses support vectors are those observations outside the prediction tube during svm training and importantly those observations close to the svm predictions have no impact on the svm itself because their weights are zero simulations of a synthetic surface 2 dimensional show that support vectors are especially important and contribute relatively more information than a random sample of equal size though svms have a nonlinear regression operational mode the use of gams was really the core estimation method using the known 200 200 grid of the surface as a cross validation tool it was found that a gam based on a random sample performs on average worse than a gam using support vector subsamples of the data the example application demonstrated sv interpretation to identify discontinued streamgages in texas that are especially informative for a regional model of peak streamflow frequency particularly data from small watersheds scientists or stakeholders interested in enhancing such regional models could potentially find these results informative in the context of network analysis four major insights are made first the sv values for sites are immediately useful for assigning quantitative relative importance to active and discontinued sites second large differences between predictions from an svm to a gam or simpler multilinear regression at monitored and unmonitored sites could represent data gaps third svms require limited data setup and are computationally fast fourth svms are complex but in simple one dimension use can be geometrically described to many audience types including lay stakeholders being that they contain more information than a random sample sites that always or very nearly so are support vectors can be interpreted as more important than sites that are infrequently to never are support vectors this is key to the use of support vectors and svms within network analyses a final remark is that the analyses here are not to be confused that the author is advocating that statistical predictions from nonsvms say from a gam be based on just the data identified as support vectors by an svm for any given statistical prediction method the use of either the whole sample with allowance for analysts to also consider leave one out or other cross validation schemes remains a general standard of practice credit authorship contribution statement w h asquith

5693,hydrometeorologic monitoring networks are ubiquitous in contemporary earth system science network stakeholders often inquire about the importance of sites and their locations when discussing funding and monitoring design support vector machines svms can be useful by their assigning each monitoring site as either a support or nonsupport vector a potentiometric surface was created from synthetic data and 800 random observation locations sites as an analog to a groundwater level network using generalized additive models for potentiometric surface prediction simulations show that a subsample of support vectors from the 800 sites will out perform random samples of sample size equaling the support vector count support vector percentages from simulation quantify the recurrence that svms assign each site as a support vector and these percentages in turn measure site importance an example application of support vector percentages identifies important monitoring sites needed to regionalize the 0 1 annual exceedance probability peak streamflow the results indicate that 152 of 283 streamgages with support vector percentages equalling 100 percent have not operated since about 2000 and generally have much smaller drainage areas than the greater streamgage network in texas the drainage area disparity is an indication of historical imbalance in peak streamflow data

texas 1 introduction hydrometeorologic monitoring observation networks are ubiquitous in contemporary earth system science the networks usually collect water resources data such as groundwater levels surface water streamflow and precipitation networks collect data in multi dimensional domains of covariates including space horizontal and vertical dimensions along with time somewhat less obvious covariates exist for example groundwater level responses in wells are affected by the given hydrogeologic framework aquifer geometry and properties type of well completion construction local and regional pumping histories and contexts of seasonal recharge and discharge streamflow responses conversely are produced by precipitation inputs on a watershed characterized by a drainage area channel slope land use patterns soil horizons and geologic substrata one of many science objectives of hydrometeorologic networks especially surface water and meteorology is the collection of data from which computed statistics e g annual minimum water levels 0 1 and 0 01 annual exceedance probability peak streamflows or mean annual precipitation can be used with predictor variables covariates to make estimates at unmonitored locations statistical techniques used range across a broad class of prediction methods from multi linear regression e g asquith and roussel 2009 williams sether 2015 to sophisticated machine learning e g carlisle et al 2016 1 1 reasons for network analyses network analyses include understanding the information content produced by a monitoring network and how the network has evolved over time such understanding constitutes just a part of overall network analysis and evaluation network analyses are important not only for scientific and statistical purposes but are crucial to the various stakeholders investing funds in and or planning the design of a given network groundwater monitoring networks have been widely studied and remain of great interest to researchers and local stakeholders andricevic 1989 1990 esquivel et al 2015 fisher 2013 kollat et al 2011 van greer et al 1991 wood 2004 precipitation networks e g putthividhya and tanaka 2012 also have been widely studied and concepts such as entropy and information theory are useful e g chen et al 2007 streamgage networks at regional state and national scales also have been widely studied chebbi et al 2017 kiang et al 2013 markus et al 2003 medina 1987 national research council 2004 in particular markus et al 2003 assessed information transfer amongst the streamflows in the context of various hydrologic regimes data regimes low average and high flow conditions the study also demonstrated an additional complexity in network analyses often the characteristic statistic of interest for statistical transfer requires selection which means that the statistic under study can influence network analysis itself stakeholder interests generally have scientific or statistical concerns about networks which include questions such as is the our their network designed to collect 1 data sufficiently in space 2 data sufficiently in time sampling intervals 3 data in a cost effective scientifically justified manner and or 4 data at a price of some information gaps further interests could include asking whether redundant data are being collected challenges in quantitative answers to these questions further predicate what type of objective function is to be maximized or minimized and whether a universal quantitative objective for all stakeholders even exists some issues to consider are financial constraints or prediction uncertainties of statistical estimates projected for unmonitored locations of interest 1 2 study purpose design and organization this study investigates a novel use of support vector machines svms bishop 2006 steinwart and christmann 2008 to support hydrometeorologic monitoring network analyses a hypothetical observational groundwater well network and statistical methods are used to predict a known 2 dimensional potentiometric surface the study is oriented around simulations to pinpoint the most and least informative sites in a network through their identification as support vectors by the svm two specific objectives are 1 to show that sites in a network identified as svm support vectors contain more information than random sites in the network and 2 to show that large prediction differences from svms and regression like methods could be used to identify information gaps in the network mathematics and implementation overview of statistical methods are presented in section 2 and include gams section 2 1 and svms section 2 2 the primary data for this study are synthetic and are described in section 3 a 1 dimensional prediction example in section 4 communicates several geometrical nuances of these methods sets up a more thorough study of surface estimation section 5 using the synthetic data section 5 1 formally frames a question as to how support vectors could be useful for network analyses experiments with gams and svms using all the data are conducted section 5 2 which are followed by study of support vector subsamples section 5 3 further experiments based on simulation of svms are presented in section 5 4 followed by closing discussion section 5 5 an example application section 6 for a surface water network analysis in texas identifies sites particularly important for the estimation of the 0 1 annual exceedance probability peak streamflow and lastly conclusions are made in section 7

statistical prediction surface estimation methods often include multi linear regression faraway 2005 faraway 2006 inverse distance weighting brunsdon comber 2015 davis 2002 geostatistical methods of kriging and its variants chebbi et al 2017 davis 2002 olea 1999 tonkin and larson 2002 and machine learning kuhn and johnson 2016 in this study gams stasinopoulos et al 2017 wood 2017 were chosen for spatial prediction because they offer sufficient flexibility are fast and are readily extendable into higher covariate dimensions because they are analogous to regression gams in contrast to svms offer familiar diagnostics including adjusted r squared residual standard errors standard errors of prediction and p values svms were also used in a regression mode a general feature of svms is that certain observations are retained by the model whereas other observations are not the in and out binary classification of individual data points by svms is of interest to this study 2 1 generalized additive models gams gams are flexible and capable of mimicking complex and curvilinear patterns in data harwell and tibshirani 1990 hastie et al 2008 wood 2017 gams model a response variable using an additive combination of various parametric terms and smooth terms smooth functions of predictor variables the incorporation of smooth functions is an advantage of a gam over simpler multi linear least squares regression and similar methods because appropriately configured smooth functions can adapt to nonlinear relations a general form of a gam is 1 z i β o x i θ f q i i where z i is the response variable that is the i th observation β o is an intercept x i is a vector for strictly parametric and suitably transformed predictor variables θ is a one column parameter matrix of length equaling the number of parametric predictors f is a smooth function that has arguments estimated automatically for the predictor variable q i the three dots represent additional smooth terms as needed and i are errors residuals taken as independent and identically distributed i i d with zero mean a distribution family such as gaussian binomial or poisson can be chosen as needed for the model of these errors specifically for this study z i is an observation of the synthetic data for a given location the x i θ term is the multi linear parametric regression faraway 2005 component of a gam and is not considered further in this study a gam is fit by the defaults provided in wood 2019 using penalized iterative re weighted least squares pirls p 180 182 wood 2017 and a generalized cross validation gcv a type of leave one out score for the smoothness controls on the smooth functions p 171 wood 2017 for this study the gam formulation is 2 z i β o f x i y i i where z i again is the response variable for the ith observation β o is an intercept x i is an easting horizontal coordinate y i is a northing horizontal coordinate and f x i y i is a 2 dimensional smooth the gam function from wood 2019 was used for this study the error distribution family was gaussian normal default and the f x i y i used a thin plate regression spline gams by their nature have some capacity to reasonably extrapolate somewhat away from the data in contrast to svms 2 2 support vector machines svms svms are a type of machine learning approach to prediction in which complex linear combinations of specific data points the support vectors and attendant weights are used to define a hyperplane through the data entire data set svms kuhn and johnson 2016 hastie et al 2008 steinwart and christmann 2008 like gams also are flexible and capable of mimicking curvilinear patterns in the data but mathematically svms are very different svm description is best given as an analogy to linear regression although svms are commonly thought of as binary classifiers svms also have a history of use in novelty detection outlier identification clifton et al 2014 pimentel et al 2014 svms are also a type of robust regression in which squared residuals are not used for fitting as they are in least squares regression faraway 2005 as a result data points with large residuals have limited effects on the fitted svm kuhn and johnson 2016 p 153 a curious and distinct identifying feature of svms is that the data points residing near predictions residing in the prediction tube by the svm will actually have no effect no effect means that the weights for some data points are zero and such observations are not required to support the model some control on how large residuals can be with no effect on the svm is influenced by a so called epsilon setting it is this either in and out binary classification that is critical to this study because the binary distinction is a simple and approachable concept to describe to stakeholders with various disciplinary backgrounds the fit phase of an svm is based on minimization of an error function subject to a penalty as the model progresses towards overfitting following the description from kuhn and johnson 2016 the coefficients β j of a fitted svm minimize the f o objective function for a model having p number of predictors 3 f o y i c l c i 1 n l z i z i svm j 1 p β j 2 where c is a penalty cost parameter that is responsible for penalizing large residuals i z i z i for the n sample of z i and predictions z i the c is a multiplicative factor on an l error function a basis function to increase or decrease the importance of errors the l can be a number of so called kernels including linear kernel polynomial kernel gaussian radial basis functions rbfs and others the rbf represents a normalized euclidean distance metric bishop 2006 chap 6 and rbf use is prevalent the l has an epsilon setting svm in svm implementation karatzoglou et al 2018 that controls the width of the prediction tube which influences the inclusion of data near the svm hyperplane the regression like the method of least squares faraway 2005 large i increase the objective function being used but in contrast to least squares large β j also act to increase the objective function in the regression analogy and given that vector of predictors x i x 1 i x 2 i x pi for the i having size n svm mathematics can be shown using real world examples the vector of predictors could represent 1 the coordinates of a groundwater well and current monthly rainfall for the month of the water level measurement or 2 the drainage area channel slope mean annual precipitation and percent grassland area of a watershed for the ith mean annual streamflow observation an estimate prediction for a sample z i uses a linear combination of model parameters coefficients β j and is applied to the new sample of the p predictors u j for j 1 2 p a prediction z can be written with the intercept term β 0 as 4 z β 0 β 1 u 1 β p u p β 0 j 1 p β j u j the β j parameters are chosen such that the sum of squared errors sse is minimized 5 sse i 1 n z i z i 2 the linear svm uses these same mathematics when used for estimation but the β j estimates importantly can be written as functions of a set of additional but unknown hyperparameters α i and the sample data of size n denoted as x ij so that 6 z β 0 β 1 u 1 β p u p β 0 j 1 p β j u j β 0 j 1 p i 1 n α i x ij u j β 0 i 1 n α i j 1 p x ij u j the final form shows weighted linear combinations of training data and the new explanatory data used to make predictions the matrix algebra can be rewrite the training data and the new explanatory data as a linear kernel function p 155 kuhn and johnson 2016 with notational adjustment the function itself can be replaced with a nonlinear kernel that extends the svm into nonlinear regression there are as many α i parameters as there are data points compared to conventional regression the svm is highly over parameterized as judged by the tenet of conventional regression that the model should have vastly fewer parameters than data points p 154 kuhn and johnson 2016 but the penalty or cost used for svm fit compensates for this undesirable situation and in practice many of the α i have a value of zero those observations x i and y i with α i 0 support the model the support vectors which means that these and only these observations are required during the svm s prediction phase geometrically the values closest to the predictions have weights α i 0 and these observations are plausibly less informative to clarify a point of common confusion the support vectors are classified during the fit or training phase of the svm and are not a decision made by the human user thus the svm is known as a sparse model the origin of the sparsity of svms is succinctly stated by bishop 2006 the hyperplane is defined by the locations of the support vectors other data points the nonsupport vectors can be moved freely without changing the decision boundary in regression this means that the solution of the svm is independent of these other data points nonsupport vectors and is thus formed by those observations that are in a sense furthest away from central tendencies of the covariates conditioned on the value of the response variable in contrast with gams svms might be less utilitarian as extrapolation increases away from the training data when given new data on which to make predictions as extrapolation is encountered the svm regresses to the global mean of the training data the ksvm function from karatzoglou et al 2018 and further described by karatzoglou et al 2006 was used for this study with a default radial basis kernel as gaussian normal eight kernels are provided by karatzoglou et al 2018 but users could provide their own the sensitivity results to the choice of kernel were not assessed in this study and the default settings of c 1 and svm 0 1 were used unless otherwise stated 3 synthetic data as an analog to a groundwater level network synthetic data were created for this study to investigate the ability of svms to estimate a 2 dimensional potentiometric surface of a water table in an unconfined aquifer the synthetic data are conceptually consistent with that data collected from a common groundwater level network statistical estimation of groundwater levels at unmonitored locations in time and space could accelerate development of numerical simulation models and assist the change in paradigm thinking proposed by white 2017 the experimental surface z x y for spatial locations x and y is defined as 7 z i x i y i 20 sin 1 75 π x i y i 100 20 cos 1 50 π y i 100 0 001 x i 2 0 1 y i n i 0 2 where z i is a water level for x i as an easting horizontal coordinate and y i as a northing vertical coordinate for the ith observation the n i μ 0 σ 2 is gaussian normally distributed noise with a mean μ of zero and a standard deviation σ of 2 which was arbitrarily chosen it is desirable for the surface to have sufficient complexity to stress statistical prediction the noise component is added to provide some mimicry of real world conditions in practical applications the continuous surface is unknown and is instead observed at discrete and irregular points for this study 800 random observation locations were generated using a seed on the random number generator set to 62 set seed 62 an arbitrary value prior to prediction of the x coordinates the y coordinates and the z from the x y declaration of the seed is to foster some reproducibility of results with the code base provided in the supplementary materials that accompany this paper depictions of the potentiometric surface are made by the contour fig 1 a and image fig 1b functions by a unit incremented grid of i j 1 2 200 to become x i i and y j j easting and northing respectively no statistical prediction is intended to be represented in the figure just simple visualization the raggedness of the contour lines represents the added noise component the highest contours are near the lower right whereas the lowest contours are near the upper left in both figures the 800 locations from random values for the x and y coordinates and then the associated z x y become a set of observational data for this study where the locations are analogs to groundwater wells the x y and z are used to construct and use predictive statistical models described in sections 4 and 5 4 a one dimensional example of gam and svm geometry to assist in understanding what support vectors are it is useful to compare and contrast svm and gam performance in a 1 dimensional problem one predictor variable to this end a left to right partition in fig 1 was extracted between 50 and 100 in the northing vertical coordinates the extracted data are shown in fig 2 the gam uses all of the 800 locations shown whereas the svm uses just the support vectors as shown although all 800 locations are fed to the svm algorithms distinction is made fig 2 between the support vectors filled circles and nonsupport vectors open circles the nonsupport vectors are the data within the prediction tube defined by the svm parameter karatzoglou et al 2018 which was set at epsilon 0 3 nondefault the overall pattern and local curvature of the gam and svm predictions are similar fig 2 the gam generally shows smoother predictions than the svm however the little hooks bends in the svm solutions at the extreme far left and extreme far right are related to the svm becoming adherent to local information and then swinging back towards the global mean of the data shown to further demonstrate potential extrapolation weakness in svms the data fig 2 were then subsetted fig 3 to create a large information gap between the easting range of 100 to 150 the gam reasonably extrapolates through the gap but the svm swings toward the global mean of the data close scrutiny of the support and nonsupport vectors between figs 2 and 3 shows reclassification by the svm of some data points in the context of monitoring network analysis one topic of interest is information gap detection because the svm must regress swing towards the mean as extrapolation is progressively encountered and other methods such as the gam behave differently a range of the largest of absolute differences in predictions between a gam and an svm could be used for example consider a study domain of gaged and ungaged unmonitored streamflow sites large gam and svm differences predicted for either site type could forecast information gaps in the network stakeholders might then choose to add new monitoring or reactivate discontinued sites within those areas with gaps svms at least as implemented by karatzoglou et al 2018 have an inherent probabilistic nature this is demonstrated by one more 1 dimensional experiment the svm fit fig 3 red line and fig 4 green line and 300 repeated svm fits fig 4 transparent red lines to the data show a range of outcomes modestly different solutions do occur and are attributable in part to different combinations of support and nonsupport vectors but some trajectories seem more favorable than others an svm as it extrapolates beyond the data swings toward the global mean especially seen in fig 3 a given trajectory is influenced by the pseudo random number generator seed in force before the svm is fit by the ksvm function from karatzoglou et al 2018 5 measuring site importance using support vectors 5 1 site importance for network analyses using functions from karatzoglou et al 2018 support and nonsupport vectors can change between successive svm fits to the same dataset a hypothesis can now be stated based on support vectors containing relatively more information than nonsupport vectors in the form of a question does a sample of size n identified by the support vectors or their frequency of identification contain more information than a random sample of size n drawn from the observational network containing m sites or alternatively are support vectors though nonrandom a type of super subsample when subsetted from the original data 5 2 whole model perspective using the synthetic data section 3 a gam and svm seed set to 1 were fit to the 800 locations not accounting for the computed intercept for the gam as 800 the f x i y i smooth for the gam by the plot gam function from wood 2019 is shown in fig 5 the standard errors of the contours also are shown the figure clearly mimics some of the hills and valleys in the data fig 1 out of the 800 locations there are the 369 svm support vectors shown as red circles a comparison between the gam and svm predictions at the 800 locations fig 6 shows general overall agreement the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse and root mean square error rmse statistics of the entire sample whole model no cross validation are listed in table 1 the gam apparently is not affected prior to fitting by the seed of the random number generator the svm has systematically lower rmse than the gam which is indicative of its settings defaults for ksvm fitting tighter than the gam to the data of interest is the changing number of support vectors for the svm which ranged from 245 to 369 for the four seeds 5 3 using support vectors and nonsupport vectors as subsamples to understand the importance of support vectors as subsamples from the original data sample it is useful to fit gams to a sample comprised of the locations identified as support vectors and then again using the complement sample of the nonsupport vectors for evaluation predictions throughout the 200 200 grid fig 1b were used with the known z x y to compute 40 000 residuals because the 800 locations realistically do not exist at grid intersections the nses and rmses listed in table 2 are a form of cross validation a gam created using the 369 support vector subsample predicting on the grid out performs the gam created using 431 nonsupport vectors comparison of results for nse and rmse between two subsamples types table 2 is informative recalling the seed of 1 in table 1 a gam using the 369 support vector subsample n svm table 2 has larger nse and smaller rmse relative to a gam using the 431 nonsupport vectors n svm so although the input subsample of the nonsupport vectors is about 1 17 times larger 431 369 that larger subsample actually produces a somewhat inferior model with respect to both nse and rmse the support vectors thus are conceptualized to represent a type of super subsample conveying more information than the nonsupport vectors 5 4 simulation experiments with svms successive or looping iterations of svms that are fed the same data produce results from slightly different models and hence support vectors as an example this study uses n 369 the number of support vectors for svm as a representative number of support vectors fixing to this sampling size an experiment using 20 simulations was made the experiment was based on generating random subsamples of size n 369 from the population of 800 locations fitting a gam and making predictions throughout the 200 200 grid again these are out of sample locations the results are shown by the n rand listed in table 3 the repeated svms similar to fig 4 for clarity are the n svm listed in table 3 summary statistics of nses and rmses table 3 show that a range of these statistics occur in this experiment there are differences between the central tendency of these to those of the single gam first row of table 2 the nse for the gam in the first row of table 2 is about 0 963 which is greater than the third quartile of nse for the n rand first row of table 3 the rmse for the gam in the first row of table 2 is about 5 002 which is below the first quartile of rmse for the n rand third row of table 3 these two comparisons show that a random sample of size n produces a gam that performs worse than the gam that used the 369 support vectors as one sample using another 20 simulations the n rand 369 nse and rmse statistics listed in table 3 represent simulations in which random samples of size n 369 were generated and a gam fit after each sample generation it again is seen that the nses are generally smaller and that the rmses are generally larger for random samples than they are for the support vectors simulations also can document a potential range in support vector counts using 20 simulations successive svms were fit to all of the 800 locations and the number of support vectors recorded the number of support vectors listed in table 4 ranges between about 30 to 60 percent of the original n 800 dataset the mean is about 351 which implies that on average about 45 percent of the original dataset is identified as support vectors for at least the z x y data in this study computed using defaults of the ksvm function these percentages are termed support vector percentages and abbreviated as sv and the distribution of these is shown in fig 7 5 5 discussion support vectors are locations that reside away from the prediction tube and form a type of covariate hull the support vectors represent a nonrandom super subsample which is more informative than a random sample of equal size the karatzoglou et al 2018 svm implementation has some probabilistic feature as its algorithms progress the result is that some observations are identified more frequently than others as support vectors and sv for some locations are as high as 100 percent and other locations have sv near zero the sv distribution is inherently affected by the complexity of the surface the errors associated with it e g n 0 σ measurement errors and somewhat by the number of observation locations identification of the most and least informative sites using the sv could be useful to stakeholders and provide decision support in terms of the number of monitoring sites upgrading data collection instrumentation suites or recording intervals and rebalancing other data collection resources relevance vector machines rvms bishop 2006 tipping 2000 have an identical functional form to svms tipping 2001 but a defining characteristic of rvms is that they can be considerably more sparse in relevance vectors than an svm is in its support vectors the vectors of an rvm can be thought of as prototypical samples whereas the support vectors of an svm are outside the prediction tube rvms are computationally intensive difficult to run for sample sizes larger than a couple of thousand and are susceptible to local minima as opposed to svms that guarantee global minimization some rvm simulations data not shown suggest that isolation of only the relevance vectors is too sparse a subsample for reliable regionalization by alternative methods such as gams for example and for the 800 locations of the dataset the number of relevance vectors is often between 30 and 40 the value 0 05 40 800 means less than 5 percent of the observations are needed to define the rvm combining the relevance vectors and the support vectors would seem to identify effective subsamples however it is the author s opinion that rvm use to augment svms for the purposes here does not outweigh the algorithmic computational and documentation overhead the author formed this conclusion using the synthetic data and the defaults of the rvm function from karatzoglou et al 2018 6 example application of support vector percentages using svms a covariate space in five dimensions was studied based on retrospective analysis of u s geological survey usgs peak streamflows from an existing streamgage network in texas asquith and roussel 2009 these experimental results are restricted to the study of a single statistic the 10 year 0 1 annual exceedance probability streamflow q 0 1 the q 0 1 was chosen in part because of its highest adjusted r squared of several regional regression equations asquith and roussel 2009 the use of other streamflow statistics could lead to different insights the objectives for the example application are 1 to identify the least informative streamflow monitoring locations streamgages and 2 to identify the most informative streamgages that also have not operated since at least 2000 to the present 2019 the year 2000 is an arbitrary choice and represents a premise that a streamgage not operated in the 21st century is a firmly discontinued streamgage but yet shown as informatively critical by the svm asquith and roussel 2009 used about 640 streamgages to develop equations for estimation of peak streamflow frequency for selected annual exceedance probabilities in and near texas for the analysis in this study which list 536 streamgages with watershed properties and the corresponding q 0 1 values 536 streamgages in texas were aggregated from the original 638 streamgage network for each streamgage q 0 1 and the watershed properties of contributing drainage area a main channel slope s and mean annual precipitations p also were assembled from the asquith and roussel 2009 data files the latitudes n and longitudes e u s geological survey 2019 of the streamgages were converted to an albers equal area projection system for north american horizontal datum of 1983 using base 10 logarithmic transformations on q 0 1 a s and p and no transformation on n and e an svm of the following form was used 8 q 0 1 a s p n e further a leave one out for each of the 536 streamgages was used along with a wrapping iteration counted as a single simulation to repeat the leave one out 20 times thus 10 740 svms were constructed for each svm the support vectors actually the streamgage identification numbers were recorded and then the percent of the time each streamgage was a support vector sv support vector percentage was computed approximately half of the 536 streamgages in the texas network are support vectors about 100 percent of the time fig 8 these streamgages are branded as always support vector sites asv about 25 percent of the streamgages 100 134 536 occur as support vectors less than about 5 percent of the time for the 10 740 svm constructions and these are branded as nonsupport vector sites nsv the nsv are effectively always within the prediction tube which means that all other streamgages including the asv in the greater network could provide sufficient information to build a regional model having the capacity to make reliable estimates at the nsv locations the asv define a type of generalized hyper dimensional covariate hull of watershed properties inclusive of spatial location in texas conditional on q 0 1 these asv sites are data points deemed by the svm as critical during its machine based training process the nsv sites almost always have zero weights in the svm so it can be stated that by their very definition all asv sites are more important than nsv sites a map is shown fig 9 that separately identifies the asv and nsv sites the asv are plotted as upright triangles and nsv are plotted as inverted triangles the remaining sites are plotted as rotated squares with a red to blue color ramp prorated by sv between the asv and nsv as was similarly done for fig 8 there are 283 streamgages that are support vectors 100 percent of the time for which 152have not operated since at least the 2000 calendar year these 152streamgages are identified by the concentric circles shown fig 9 the 152 streamgages are interpreted as especially important for statistical regionalization of peak streamflow but the corresponding watersheds are currently 2019 not monitored most of these sites are located in smaller drainage areas than the greater network the overall network median contributing drainage area is about 300 square kilometers km2 whereas the median contributing drainage area for the 152streamgages is about 25 km2 table 5 these results show that many discontinued streamgages potentially are critical for regionalization of the q 0 1 peak streamflow the corresponding watersheds are quite a bit smaller in area than the overall network table 5 so by being classified as asv these streamgages generally reside near the boundaries of 5 dimensional covariate hull conditioned on the q 0 1 peak streamflows themselves a need for peak streamflow on small watersheds in texas is known and documented harwell and asquith 2011 and since about 2000 efforts have been made with stakeholders in texas to collect additional peak streamflow data on about 50 small watersheds in western texas asquith et al 2018 this example application affirms an intuitive understanding of texas streamgage history there potentially has been a data collection imbalance on peak streamflow data between small watersheds and the overall streamgage network 7 conclusions the distinction between support and nonsupport vectors by svms measures site importance for hydrometeorologic monitoring network analyses support vectors are those observations outside the prediction tube during svm training and importantly those observations close to the svm predictions have no impact on the svm itself because their weights are zero simulations of a synthetic surface 2 dimensional show that support vectors are especially important and contribute relatively more information than a random sample of equal size though svms have a nonlinear regression operational mode the use of gams was really the core estimation method using the known 200 200 grid of the surface as a cross validation tool it was found that a gam based on a random sample performs on average worse than a gam using support vector subsamples of the data the example application demonstrated sv interpretation to identify discontinued streamgages in texas that are especially informative for a regional model of peak streamflow frequency particularly data from small watersheds scientists or stakeholders interested in enhancing such regional models could potentially find these results informative in the context of network analysis four major insights are made first the sv values for sites are immediately useful for assigning quantitative relative importance to active and discontinued sites second large differences between predictions from an svm to a gam or simpler multilinear regression at monitored and unmonitored sites could represent data gaps third svms require limited data setup and are computationally fast fourth svms are complex but in simple one dimension use can be geometrically described to many audience types including lay stakeholders being that they contain more information than a random sample sites that always or very nearly so are support vectors can be interpreted as more important than sites that are infrequently to never are support vectors this is key to the use of support vectors and svms within network analyses a final remark is that the analyses here are not to be confused that the author is advocating that statistical predictions from nonsvms say from a gam be based on just the data identified as support vectors by an svm for any given statistical prediction method the use of either the whole sample with allowance for analysts to also consider leave one out or other cross validation schemes remains a general standard of practice credit authorship contribution statement w h asquith

5694,understanding the interaction between groundwater and surface water is of great significance to the rational development and utilization of water resources and the protection of ecological environment here we present a combination of several methods radon balance method ec conservation method and flow balance method for evaluating the hydraulic exchange of groundwater and surface water in a small watershed of kui river and yunlong lake the exchange fluxes of kui river yunlong lake and groundwater were estimated by one dimensional steady state model and box model the results indicate that the lake water is mainly recharged by groundwater from the surrounding mountains and the lake renewal time is approximately 26 days meanwhile multiple transformations occur between groundwater and river water and river water leakage is dominant the existence of several tributaries complicates the hydraulic exchange and groundwater discharge is also evident furthermore the advantages and disadvantages of these three methods were analyzed this study successfully demonstrated that radon and ec as tracers can be used to estimate the exchange flux between groundwater and surface water particularly in areas lacking conventional hydrological data combining these three methods the hydraulic exchange between groundwater and surface water can be evaluated more effectively the analysis of hydraulic exchange is also crucial for xuzhou area where water resources are extraordinary scarce and polluted keywords groundwater surface water and groundwater interactions radon kui river lake china 1 introduction surface water and groundwater play an extremely important role for local communities because they not only provide directly available water resources for households and agriculture but also play a key role in maintaining healthy ecosystems bauer et al 2006 brunke and gonser 1997 chen 2007 zhou et al 2013 rivers and lakes often exchange water and solutes with adjacent aquifers surface water and groundwater were once regarded as two separate hydrological systems and investigated separately kalbus et al 2006 however thorough understanding the complex hydraulic exchange process between surface water and adjacent aquifers and quantitatively describing the interaction between surface water and groundwater play a crucial role in the conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater andreu and solera 2002 sahuquillo 2004 custodio 2007 pulido velazquez et al 2007 mccallum et al 2012 fleckenstein et al 2010 shanafield and cook 2014 ortega et al 2015 moreover quantitative hydraulic exchange is also important for the management of potential pollutants in connected fluvial and aquifer systems chapman et al 2007 mcmahon and böhlke 1996 verstraeten et al 1999 hence they should be assessed together as a unified hydrological cycle system groundwater recharge surface water via discrete springs or seepage surface water can slowly infiltrate through the topsoil and drain into adjacent aquifers in order to quantitatively evaluate the exchange flux between surface water and groundwater researchers developed numerous physical chemical and numerical methods which are classified into point scale anibas et al 2010 cranswick et al 2014 hyun et al 2011 mccallum et al 2014 shanafield et al 2010 2011 and regional scale methods bourke et al 2014 cook et al 2006 harrington et al 2014 unland et al 2013 kalbus et al 2006 have conducted a comprehensive review of the quantification technique for fluvial and aquifer flux at different scales however heterogeneity of anisotropy and scale effects remain a challenge in quantifying hydraulic exchange sophocleous 2002 mccallum et al 2012 ortega et al 2015 xie et al 2016 have analyzed the uncertainty of natural tracer methods for quantifying river aquifer interaction in a large river natural chemical tracers can provide a comprehensive view of large areas for a long time so they are well suited to identify and quantify the exchange flux between surface water and groundwater ortega et al 2015 the prerequisite for the use of chemical tracers is that the concentration of tracer between surface water and groundwater is sufficiently detectable in order to calculate the mass balance of the tracer it is necessary to accurately characterize all sources and sinks that influence the difference of tracer concentration in addition evaporation precipitation radioactive decay degassing biochemical reactions and other factors also play an important role in the spatiotemporal variation of solute concentration unland et al 2013 natural geochemical tracers that identify and estimate the interaction between surface water and groundwater include major ions stable isotopes and radioisotopes cartwright et al 2011 genereux et al 1993 jing et al 2018 lamontagne and cook 2007 mullinger et al 2009 stellato 2008 unland et al 2013 yi et al 2018 in recent years with the improvement of measurement technology the use of radon 222rn has increased gradually and it has been proved to be an excellent tracer for the interaction between surface water and groundwater burnett et al 2010 cartwright et al 2011 cook et al 2006 dulaiova and burnett 2006 jing et al 2018 peterson et al 2010 smerdon et al 2012 spizzico 2005 unland et al 2013 xie et al 2016 yi et al 2018 radon 222rn the term radon will be used throughout the paper is a naturally occurring radioactive inert gas generated by radioactive decay of radium 226ra the term radium will be used throughout the paper when radium is dissolved or suspended in an aquifer radon produced by its decay then diffused into pore water and gradually concentrated in the aqueous phase ellins et al 1990 radium is derived from the decay of uranium which is ubiquitous in sediments and sedimentary rocks therefore the activity of radon is mainly determined by the lithology and chemical composition of the aquifer cecil and green 2000 sakoda et al 2011 as well as by the length of time from production to dissolution into groundwater with the accumulation of uranium and radium in the clay sediments the radon activity will increase at aquifer scale these differences must be considered during the study of groundwater flow using radon but it is less relevant to estimate surface water and groundwater interaction ortega et al 2015 for a sufficiently long time when the production rate of radon in groundwater is equal to its decay rate a dynamic molecular equilibrium will be reached and the radon activity will be maintained in a relatively stable range however radon activity in surface water is mainly balanced by groundwater recharge or discharge decay of radium diffusion of hyporheic zone decay of itself and degassing into the atmosphere etc since radon has a short half life 3 82 days it has great potential in the study of rapid mixing processes that occur on time scales of hours to several days zheng et al 2016 decades of research have shown that the activity of radon in groundwater is 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that in surface water cook et al 2008 the interaction between groundwater and surface water yunlong lake and kui river affects the agricultural production and life of 120 000 people in southern xuzhou which is one of china s 40 regions with severe water shortages groundwater and surface water are the main sources of drinking water and agricultural irrigation for the residents in the basin zhou 2002 with the acceleration of the industrialization process and the development of agricultural modernization the regional demand for water resources is rapidly increasing however the lack of awareness of environmental protection has led to the gradual pollution of surface water in the areas particularly lake and river water in the past people paid insufficient attention to water resources and lacked unified management leading to unreasonable groundwater exploitation yang and hua 2008 subsequently the regional groundwater level declines rapidly the descending funnel increases and becomes larger karst characteristics develop and the exchange of surface water and groundwater deteriorated the groundwater quality gradually yuan et al 2013 therefore with the aim of protecting water resources and strive for better water quality the xuzhou region has committed to administration of surface water pollution and strengthen the joint management of surface water and groundwater despite several hydrogeological surveys as well as numerical simulation in the kui river watershed few studies have been focused on radioactive isotopes and hydraulic exchange of surface water and groundwater in this region wu et al 2007 in the investigation presented here we used radon and electrical conductivity ec methods to analyze the kui river and yunlong lake respectively to clarify the interaction between surface water and groundwater the quantitative evaluation of hydraulic exchange in this small watershed is crucial to the rational exploitation and protection of water resources which has significant economic and social benefits 2 site description the study area includes yunlong lake and the upstream of the kui river fig 1 yunlong lake is located in the southwest of xuzhou city which is located in the alluvial plain of north china with an elevation of 30 50 m the yunlong lake is surrounded by mountains on three sides and its surface area and land area are 5 82 and 6 3 square kilometers respectively kui river originates from yunlong lake and flows southward through xucun and huangqiao village before flowing into anhui province the length of the upper reach is 35 6 km and the basin area is 349 square kilometers the width of the river is 33 to 52 m the mean depth is 5 m and the width of the river bottom is 10 32 m the kui river was once the most polluted river in the huai river basin however in the last decade it has been restored as a landscape river the climate of study area is humid and semi humid region belonging to the temperate monsoon with the average annual rainfall of 802 mm year and the average annual temperature of 14 5 c field data were obtained from the upper reaches of the kui river and yunlong lake fig 1 water samples were taken in september of 2018 sampling points of the lake are arranged around and in the center of the lake fig 1 the sampling points of kui river are collected separately in the upstream of the river in addition the sampling was carried out on the other tributaries of the yunlong lake and the kui river these tributaries along the river have been constructed to divert water for irrigation during the growing season may to september the lithology in the study area is represented mainly by quaternary clastic and fractured carbonate rocks limestone and dolomite 3 sampling and analysis methods field radon measurement and sampling campaigns were conducted on the yunlong lake and upstream of the kui river during the period of 18 to 23 september of 2018 at 39 measurement locations fig 1 18 of them in the kui river 8 of them in the yunlong lake the remaining 13 in groundwater surface water samples were collected at intervals of about 1 to 3 km as some of them are restricted by accessibility at each sampling point the surface water of the river and lake is sampled at about 30 cm below the water surface by sampler about 3 to 5 m away from the shore groundwater samples were collected from wells denoted as g in fig 1 of residents near the river and the lake a water sample was also collected from a spring groundwater sampling was performed using a submersible pump situated at the outlet of the well that was pumping water at least 10 min before sampling to obtain fresh groundwater groundwater samples were stored in 250 ml pvc bottles which were overflowed and covered quickly to prevent contact with the air after sampling measurement of radon activity was carried out by a widely used the rad7 portable radon monitor and its accessory rad h2o durridge company usa which can measure radon in water over the activity range from 370 bq m3 to 14 800 000 bq m3 with a sensitivity that matches or exceeds those of liquid scintillation methods water sample was placed in a 40 ml for groundwater or 250 ml for surface water sample vial and a closed cycle is formed by air pump on the rad7 instrument unit and the sealed bottle containing the sample to extract the radon moist air mixed with radon is connected to the radon alpha detector through a drying device and the activity of radon is calculated by the activity of its decay products 218po and 214po considering of the half life of radon most samples were analyzed within a few hours after collection to achieve acceptable activity values radioactive decay needs to be considered for the time between sampling and analysis due to the time laps between sampling and analyzing a correction for the decay was performed the decay correction factor dcf is given by the formula dcf exp t 132 4 where t is the decay time in hours dimova et al 2013 after the radon activity was measured the collected water samples

as a sign of groundwater recharge to river when groundwater enters and mixes with river water the concentration of radon in river will increase immediately however due to its short half life and partial radon escaping into atmosphere through degassing the concentration of radon in river gradually decreases in a unit water body when the environmental conditions reach a stable state namely the sources and sinks of radon reach equilibrium it is generally considered that the radon activity in the water body does not change with time hyporheic exchange occurs during river migration the process of hyporheic exchange will increases the radon activity without increasing flow cook 2013 without considering the impact of hyporheic exchange the calculated groundwater inflow will be higher a series of complex experiments are required to estimate the contribution of hyporheic exchange to river su et al 2015 cook 2013 estimated the radon flux input to river by measuring the production rate of radon in sediments in hyporheic zone and the amount of water flux exchange between hyporheic zone and river however there are no conditions for the completion of relevant experiments in this study so we will adopt the suggestions proposed by su et al 2015 for areas with sparse datasets the hyporheic exchange in the radon one dimensional steady state model is ignored according to the mass conservation theory one dimensional 1 d mass balance model was established to describe the exchange flux between river and groundwater su et al 2015 yi et al 2018 however the effects of different tributaries on hydraulic exchange were not considered here we add the inflow and outflow tributaries to the 1 d steady state model as follows 1 q d c d q u c u e α l 0 l q g c g e α x d x δ t c u c d

tributaries of the reach bq m3 x i and x j are the distance between the confluence of no i inflow and no j outflow tributaries and the downstream sampling location m the mass balance equation of radon activity in the whole studied river reach can be expressed as formula 1 the total variation in radon is attributed to the following factors including groundwater recharge river leakage impact of inflow and outflow tributaries radioactive decay and degassing process several assumptions are considered in the model due to the complex practical hydraulic exchange process of river and groundwater groundwater tributaries and river are the sources and sinks of each other precipitation and evaporation are not considered in the model because there was no precipitation in the study area before and after the sampling period and the short term effect of very low evaporation on river water can also be ignored radon derived from radium in river water and riverbed sediments is so scarce that it is ignored we do not consider the radon contribution from hyporheic exchange in our study wu et al 2004 although this can lead to errors in the estimation of surface water and groundwater interaction cook et al 2006 it is also assumed that all sources of radon can be instantaneously mixed and reach a stable state both longitudinally and vertically and the same parcel of upstream water is collected in the downstream sample location cook 2013 water samples collected at any point in the channel can represent the average value of the section the characteristic of formula 1 is that there are three sub formulas on the right hand side corresponding to the mass balance equation of three different surface water and groundwater interactions when the flow and radon activity match the conditions a cd cu and qd qu groundwater recharge river when the flow and radon activity match the conditions b cd cu and qd qu river recharge groundwater when the flow and radon activity match the conditions c cd cu and qd qu or cd cu and qd qu rivers are affected by groundwater recharge and river leakage when solute is characterized by decay and vaporization the total solute loss due to radioactivity and gasification needs to be taken into account in formula 1 α is named total loss coefficient including radioactive decay and degassing ellins et al 1990 3 α β γ 4 β λ rn v where β is the decay coefficient related to the average velocity of the river reach m 1 λ rn is the radioactive decay coefficient of radon λ rn 2 08 10 6 s 1 v is the average flow velocity of the river reach which determines the time from upstream to downstream m s the average flow velocity is used to replace actual velocity due to lack of field data thus average flow velocity between upstream and downstream is generally taken as a constant in the river section the γ is the loss coefficient caused by degassing m 1 in this paper surface renewal model is used to describe the loss of radon activity caused by gas exchange because the section of the studied river was mainly turbulent therefore the degassing loss coefficient can be expressed as follows peng et al 1974 stellato et al 2008 5 γ d 0 5 v 0 5 h 1

order to verify the results of the mass balance model of the radon isotope ec balance method is applied here to evaluate the hydraulic exchange of river water and groundwater since ec is stable does not decay or escape into the air the verification method is simpler in a stable state there are no such terms as decay and gasification it is feasible to substitute formula α 0 into formula 1 we can also use flow balance to evaluate the river groundwater interaction the net exchange can be obtained by the following expression 7 and the hydraulic conversion direction can be judged according to whether the calculation result is positive or negative 7 q q u q d l 4 2 box model for lake a radon box model was developed to analyze the interaction between lake and groundwater by dimova and burnett 2011 the box model contains the mass balance of all sources and sinks of radon including upstream inflow downstream outflow degassing groundwater interaction and sediment diffusion the radon budget of the model is essentially a balance between groundwater and upstream inflow and loss caused by degassing decay and downstream outflow assuming that the lake is in an equilibrium state immediately under the exchange of water the lake is in a stable state and the radon box model is expressed as follows 8 q gw c g c s q in c in q out c s f degas a λ rn v c s 0 where c g and c s are the activity of radon in groundwater and lake water respectively bq m3 c in is the activity of radon of upstream inflow bq m3 q gw q in and q out are discharge of groundwater and the fluxes of upstream inflow and downstream outflow m3 s f degas is flux of radon exchange with air bq m2 d λ rn is the radioactive decay coefficient of radon a is the area of the lake surface m2 v is the volume of the lake m3 the mass conservation equation of radon is established based on several assumptions diffusion from sediment at the lake bottom and decay of radium in the surface water were omitted because the effect on the calculation result was small although the diffusion flux of radon generated by the decay of radium in the sediments can be determined by the experiment described by rodellas et al 2012 however for lakes with more recharge sources diffusion flux is relatively insignificant and is usually ignored directly unless the sediment contains a large concentration of radium dimova and burnett 2011 for dissolved radium in lake water its contribution to radon activity in lake water can be determined by various methods in addition to the direct analysis of the activity of radium in water bodies su et al 2014 the radon emanation approach described by peterson et al 2009 is also feasible in comparison the method described by corbett et al 1997 is simpler due to the short half life of radon it takes about four weeks to wait for the excess radon decay in water body with the remaining radon is in equilibrium with the dissolved radium for a one dimensional steady state model and box model of lake the radon produced by dissolving radium in water body is essentially negligible we conducted a simple experiment in the laboratory in which three water samples including lake water and river water were placed and sealed a month later we did not detect radon in three water samples proving that the dissolved radium s contributions to radon in the surface water were inconspicuous the radon exchange between air and water in the model can be evaluated using the method described by macintyre et al 1995 the degassing is related to air temperature wind speed and radon gradient between air and surface water and is calculated as follows 9 f degas k c s α c a α 0 105 0 405 exp 0 05027 where k is the gas transfer coefficient m d α is the ostwald s solubility coefficient c s and c a are the radon activity in lake and air respectively bq m3 t air is air temperature in c the gas transfer coefficient is mainly determined by turbulence kinematic viscosity and gas molecular diffusion dimova and burnett 2011 there are several empirical formulas for calculating the gas transfer coefficient macintyre et al 1995 wanninkhof et al 2009 liss and merlivat 1986 crusius et al 2005 hartman and hammond 1985 the most widely used of which is the one developed by macintyre et al 1995 where 11 k 600 0 45 u 10 1 6 sc 600 b 12 s c ν d m 13 u 10 u h 0 097 ln h 10 1 1

speed 3 6 m s and b 0 667 when wind speed 3 6 m s h is the distance between the location where the wind speed is measured and the water surface m sc is the schmidt number ν is the kinematic viscosity and dm is the molecular diffusion both ν and dm can be adjusted for the temperature relationships described by gill 2016 for the purpose of verifying the results of the box model of radon the hydraulic exchange between lake and groundwater was quantified by the ec balance method in a stable state there are no such terms as decay and gasification in formula 8 5 results and discussion the results of radon activity and ec values for all water samples are listed in table 1 combined with the field measurement data the radon mass balance model the ec balance model and the water flow balance model are respectively analyzed to estimate the hydraulic exchange between groundwater and surface water as can be seen from fig 2 the radon activity of groundwater is obviously greater than that of surface water and spring water has the highest radon activity furthermore the radon activity in t1 tributary is significantly higher than that in the kui river in addition fig 3 indicates that ec in groundwater is generally higher than that in surface water compared with surface water ec distribution in groundwater is more irregular there are some high values of ec near to the rivers such as g7 g8 g12 etc the heterogeneity of ec distribution may be attributed to the local heterogeneity of soluble salts in aquifers 5 1 tracers in river and groundwater radon and ec the variation characteristics of radon isotope and ec at sampling points along the kui river in the study area are shown in fig 4 which can be used to identify abnormal exchange between groundwater and river water according to the variation of radon activity shown on fig 4 the whole river can be divided into three sections the first section from sampling point r1 to r5 has a total length of about 7047 m the radon activity gradually decreases from 2857 bq m3 to 583 bq m3 along the river the second section is 2036 m long and has the tributary t1 from the sampling point r5 to r6 radon activity increases rapidly from 583 bq m3 to 4680 bq m3 it can be inferred that there is groundwater inflow with high radon activity near the tributary t1 and the second section the last section from sampling point r6 to r9 has three tributaries t2 t3 and t4 with radon activity decreasing from 4680 bq m3 to 604 bq m3 the radon activity along the river changed dramatically revealing that frequent interactions may exist between groundwater and river water compared with radon activity ec values in river water are relatively stable with the changes ranging between 571 μs cm and 863 μs cm the lowest ec value occurred in the second section of the river which may be related to the tributary ti with lower ec values radon activity in groundwater is 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than that in surface water from the statistical analysis of groundwater sampling points radon activity ranges from 6212 bq m3 to 61156 bq m3 the radon activity in spring water is the highest table 1 in addition ec in groundwater varies from 846 μs cm to 1199 μs cm the radon activity of groundwater used in the radon mass balance method is 28474 bq m3 which is the average value of groundwater samples collected the temperature of water samples used to calculate the molecular diffusion coefficient d is also listed in table 1 5 2 tracers in lake water and groundwater radon and ec during the study period the radon activity in the lake water was relatively stable and the variation range was 514 bq m3 4177 bq m3 with an average of 2154 bq m3 table 1 furthermore the radon activity in groundwater used in the calculation is 37056 bq m3 which is the average value of three groundwater samples taken around the lake rather than all the sites in the study area ec variation of lake water is from 603 μs cm to 653 μs cm with an average value of 631 μs cm meanwhile the average ec for groundwater is 1056 μs cm in general there is a certain difference in tracer concentration for lake and groundwater which makes it possible for the tracer to identify hydraulic exchange yunlong lake is connected with two major rivers one is the source and the other is the sink field measurement data of these two rivers are shown in table 2 r1 and r18 represent sampling points at the cross section of the boundary between the lake and the river respectively 5 3 estimation of river groundwater interaction the parameters for river sections and tributaries are shown on table 3 for the three sections that we ve been working on the flow balance method the radon balance method and the ec balance method have been used to evaluate the hydraulic exchange of groundwater and river water the results of calculations are shown in table 4 the net exchange between groundwater and river can be obtained by flow balance method but we cannot obtain the specific process that takes place in each section however the use of tracer methods radon balance and ec balance for the estimation of river groundwater interaction can clarify specific hydraulic exchange processes between groundwater and river water at each section in order to make a preliminary judgment on the net exchange in each section flow balance is first applied to calculate the exchange flux between the river and the groundwater of the kui river the results in table 4 show that the net fluxes of the three sections are 2 17 10 4 m3 s m 8 38 10 3 m3 s m and 1 75 10 4 m3 s m respectively meanwhile the calculation results reflect that the exchange process for the three sections is mainly river water leakage for the purpose of estimating the specific interaction process we have made assumptions for each section by considering changes of river flow and the tracer concentration in upstream and downstream in the first section of kui river the radon activity and river flow at the downstream sampling point r5 were lower than that at the upstream sampling point r1 therefore it is assumed that the first section is dominated by water leakage radon data were substituted into sub formula b of formula 1 and the results are shown in table 4 the flux of river water leakage is 7 29 10 4 m3 s m while using the ec balance validation the ec of downstream site s5 is slightly lower than that of upstream site s1 by substituting the ec data of section 1 into sub formula b of formula 1 the results show that the flux of river water leakage is about 2 42 10 4 m3 s m the result is similar to the radon balance model the calculated net exchange of the ec balance is closer to the calculated result of the flow balance and the result of the radon balance is slightly larger than the others in the middle section the radon activity of upstream site s5 is lower than that of downstream site s6 while the flow of upstream site s5 is higher than that of downstream site s6 it is assumed that groundwater discharge and river water leakage occur simultaneously by substituting the data of section 2 into sub formula c of formula 1 the results show that the flux of groundwater discharge is about 4 05 10 4 m3 s m and the river water leakage is 1 02 10 3 m3 s m the results show that there are two possible interactions between groundwater and river water and river leakage plays an important role in second section of kui river while using the ec balance validation the ec of upstream site s5 is also higher than that of downstream site s6 by substituting the data of section 2 into sub formula b of formula 1 the results show that the flux of river water leakage is 1 72 10 3 m3 s m the result is similar to the radon balance model it is shown that the net exchanges determined by radon balance model and ec conservation model are similar to the result of flow model in the third section both of radon activity and flow of upstream site s6 are higher than that of downstream site s9 the third section is dominated by river water leakage by substituting the data of section 3 into sub formula b of formula 1 the results show that the flux of river water leakage is 2 32 10 4 m3 s m when using ec to verify the results we found that the ec of upstream site s6 is lower than that of downstream site s9 this is in accordance with the condition c of the formula 1 by substituting the ec data of section 3 into sub formula c of formula 1 we can obtain that qr is 4 71 10 4 m3 s m and qg is 3 03 10 4 m3 s m the evaluation results for the three methods are similar compared with the results calculated by three different methods for the three sections of kui river table 4 the net exchange obtained by the radon balance method and ec balance method are close to that obtained by the flow balance method therefore the results of the calculation are considered reasonable 5 4 estimation of lake groundwater interaction in order to estimate the hydraulic exchange between groundwater and yunlong lake the model assumes that wind velocity 10 m above the water surface is 3 03 m s and the average water temperature is 24 3 c the average depth of the lake is 5 67 m and the surface area is 5 82 106 m2 table 5 the radon activity in yunlong lake is the mean value of l1 to l8 cs 2154 bq m3 since there are three groundwater sampling points near yunlong lake it is assumed that the radon activity of groundwater is equal to the average value of g1 g3 and g4 cg 37056 bq m3 the lake data has been substituted into eq 8 to solve the radon box model and the groundwater recharge rate is 1269213 m3 d groundwater supply accounts for 3 85 of the lake s storage capacity and the lake s renewal time is about 4 weeks table 6 the uncertainty of using radon isotope to build up the box model mainly comes from wind speed and the radon activity of groundwater wind speed has a significant influence on the radon degassing process which leads to a large gradient at air water surface however high precision wind speed can be obtained by sampling points distribution and instrument precision which can reduce part of uncertainty radon activity in groundwater is a sensitive parameter in order to reduce the uncertainty methods such as avoiding the radon escape in the sampling process increasing the measuring time and increasing the sampling points can be adopted ec balance method is also applicable to the box model the flux of groundwater and lake water estimated by ec data is 1250171 m3 d groundwater supply accounts for 3 85 of the lake s storage capacity and the lake s renewal time is about 26 days table 6 the comparison results of lake groundwater interaction are shown in table 6 in general the calculation results of radon isotope and ec box models are similar the recharge rate of groundwater in yunlong lake is about 1250171 m3 d 1269213 m3 d and the lake renewal time is about 26 days in general the hydro exchange process throughout the small catchment can be obtained by estimating the interaction between yunlong lake kui river and groundwater the geographical location of yunlong park is situated in the mountains embrace due to low lying terrain groundwater from the surrounding mountains is the main recharge source of yunlong lake and the interaction is frequent and close many conversions occur between the groundwater and kui river despite three sections of kui river are also in the upstream zone the existence of several tributaries makes the interaction of groundwater and river water complex the interaction between river reach and groundwater is dominated by river leakage furthermore the results determined by the radon balance method and the ec conservation method reflect the possible groundwater discharge in the second and third sections of the river water 5 5 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis a series of assumptions and simplifications were made during the establishment of the radon box model and the one dimensional steady flow model for instance the steady state model can only reflect the hydraulic exchange state of surface water and groundwater during the sampling period because precipitation would affect the accuracy of radon measurement in short term therefore it is necessary to avoid precipitation period when sampling and the influence of precipitation is ignored in the calculation process these assumptions and generalizations may not be consistent with the actual situation resulting in the deviation of the model calculation results meanwhile the temporal and spatial variation of river flow and the abrupt change of river topography will make it difficult to obtain accurate data average values of some parameters are used to calculate the model and thus the use of constant river flow in research may lead to deviations due to uncertainty sensitivity analysis of parameters is an important step in quantifying the uncertainty of a model it is essential to fully consider the errors caused by sensitive parameters under the existing model and practical conditions it will help to analyze the influence of various parameters on the accuracy of the model better understand the model and reduce the uncertainty of the model lenhart et al 2002 it is suggested that researchers should pay more attention to the highly sensitive parameters from sampling testing and calculation in future research work the following equation can be used to represent the relative error of calculation results caused by the uncertainty of parameters used in the study 14 δ y x 0 δ x y x 0 y x 0 100 where δ is the relative error x is a sensitive parameter and y is the calculated result here we set the assumed errors δ x as 1 5 10 20 35 and 50 to calculate the parameter uncertainty during the calculation of one dimensional steady state model the relative errors of different river sections are averaged and the relative errors of different sensitive parameters to the model are obtained as shown in table 7 and fig 5 as described in table 7 and fig 5 when the measurement errors are 1 and 5 the relative errors of calculation results are less than 10 when the measurement error is 10 the relative error caused by most parameters is less than 10 except the relative error caused by the measurement error of river flow and length of river however the maximum relative error is still less than 20 when the measurement error varies between 10 and 50 the relative error increases sharply compared with other parameters the relative error caused by river flow increases more rapidly when the measurement error is 20 the relative error is mostly less than 15 when the measurement error reaches 35 and 50 the maximum relative error is between 60 and 80 it can be concluded from fig 5 that the upstream flow qu and downstream flow qd are particularly sensitive parameters this is consistent with the parameter sensitivity analysis results of su et al 2015 on the radon one dimensional model of river meanwhile length of reach l and downstream radon activity cd are sensitive parameters the calculation results of other parameters are insensitive to measurement errors when the parameter errors reach 50 the calculated relative errors are less than 10 when the measurement errors are less than 20 most of the relative errors are acceptable in water resources management except those caused by river flow and length of reach the large relative errors are mainly caused by high sensitivity parameters qu and qd are important indicators for calculating the change of radon flux in the reach their accuracy directly determines the model s error therefore in the field sampling accurate measurement of river flow is of great significance to the radon one dimensional steady flow model the results of parameter sensitivity analysis for the lake radon box model are shown in table 8 and fig 6 when the measurement errors of all parameters are 1 and 5 the calculated relative errors are all less than 10 when the parameter errors reach 10 the relative errors obtained by other parameters are still less than 10 except the measured wind speed u and radon activity in the lake cs however when the parameter errors continue to increase to 20 35 and 50 respectively and the relative error of calculation results highly increases fig 6 shows that the measured wind speed u is a particularly sensitive parameter when the parameter error reaches 50 the calculated error is 74 4 radon activity in the lake cs lake area a water temperature t and groundwater radon activity cg are relatively sensitive parameters when the parameter errors reach 50 the calculated errors are 55 1 48 3 48 8 34 7 respectively the remaining parameters are insensitive because the calculated errors are less than 10 when the parameter errors reach 50 in this study the measured wind speed u is the most sensitive parameter of the box model and it is an important index to calculate the radon gasification rate on the lake surface when the measurement error of wind speed reaches 20 the relative error of the result is more than 20 and increases sharply with the increase of measurement error as a result the accurate measurement of wind speed in the field is an important part in the establishment of box model in addition we found from fig 6 that the radon activity of lake water is the second most sensitive parameter of the model the measurement errors of parameters can be reduced by adding more sampling points to reduce the uncertainty of box model 6 conclusions the purpose of this study is to use three different methods the radon balance method ec conservation method and flow balance method to quantitatively evaluate the hydraulic linkage between groundwater and rivers lakes in a watershed meanwhile the detailed interaction process within the reach of the river was determined by one dimensional stability model and the exchange flux between yunlong lake and groundwater is calculated by box model furthermore flow balance and ec conservation were used to verify the calculation results of radon balance model the results indicate that multiple transformations occur between groundwater and river that river water leakage is the dominant process the existence of several tributaries complicates the hydraulic exchange and groundwater discharge in some places is also evident based on the model results and field measurements lake water is mainly recharged by groundwater originating in the surrounding mountains and the lake renewal time is about 26 days based on the calculations from several models among of the three methods the flow balance method can accurately estimate the net exchange but it cannot specify the detailed exchange processes which can be used as a reference for the other two methods radon balance method can quantitatively evaluate the interaction between groundwater and surface water and it can effectively analyze the interaction between each section the advantage of radon is the large difference between surface water and groundwater which is more sensitive to the exchange process in the river on the contrary the disadvantage is that there are many environmental interference factors impacting the process of quantitative analysis and the sensitivity and uncertainty of parameters should be considered in practical application the same effect can be achieved by the ec conservation method which is relatively insensitive to the radon balance method but the stability of the calculation results is better through the analysis of parameter sensitivity it is concluded that the flow of upstream and downstream sections is the most sensitive parameter in the one dimensional steady state model of radon similarly the measured wind speed is a very sensitive parameter in the application of the box model in order to reduce the uncertainty of models improving the precision of field measurement is an important way to obtain more accurate parameter data this study successfully demonstrated the use of radon and ec as tracers in estimating the relationship between groundwater and surface water especially in small basins such as kui river and yunlong lake watershed where conventional hydrological data are scarce moreover with the combination of the three methods the hydraulic exchange between groundwater and surface water in small watershed can be evaluated more effectively and perfectly declaration of competing interest the authors

5694,understanding the interaction between groundwater and surface water is of great significance to the rational development and utilization of water resources and the protection of ecological environment here we present a combination of several methods radon balance method ec conservation method and flow balance method for evaluating the hydraulic exchange of groundwater and surface water in a small watershed of kui river and yunlong lake the exchange fluxes of kui river yunlong lake and groundwater were estimated by one dimensional steady state model and box model the results indicate that the lake water is mainly recharged by groundwater from the surrounding mountains and the lake renewal time is approximately 26 days meanwhile multiple transformations occur between groundwater and river water and river water leakage is dominant the existence of several tributaries complicates the hydraulic exchange and groundwater discharge is also evident furthermore the advantages and disadvantages of these three methods were analyzed this study successfully demonstrated that radon and ec as tracers can be used to estimate the exchange flux between groundwater and surface water particularly in areas lacking conventional hydrological data combining these three methods the hydraulic exchange between groundwater and surface water can be evaluated more effectively the analysis of hydraulic exchange is also crucial for xuzhou area where water resources are extraordinary scarce and polluted keywords groundwater surface water and groundwater interactions radon kui river lake china 1 introduction surface water and groundwater play an extremely important role for local communities because they not only provide directly available water resources for households and agriculture but also play a key role in maintaining healthy ecosystems bauer et al 2006 brunke and gonser 1997 chen 2007 zhou et al 2013 rivers and lakes often exchange water and solutes with adjacent aquifers surface water and groundwater were once regarded as two separate hydrological systems and investigated separately kalbus et al 2006 however thorough understanding the complex hydraulic exchange process between surface water and adjacent aquifers and quantitatively describing the interaction between surface water and groundwater play a crucial role in the conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater andreu and solera 2002 sahuquillo 2004 custodio 2007 pulido velazquez et al 2007 mccallum et al 2012 fleckenstein et al 2010 shanafield and cook 2014 ortega et al 2015 moreover quantitative hydraulic exchange is also important for the management of potential pollutants in connected fluvial and aquifer systems chapman et al 2007 mcmahon and böhlke 1996 verstraeten et al 1999 hence they should be assessed together as a unified hydrological cycle system groundwater recharge surface water via discrete springs or seepage surface water can slowly infiltrate through the topsoil and drain into adjacent aquifers in order to quantitatively evaluate the exchange flux between surface water and groundwater researchers developed numerous physical chemical and numerical methods which are classified into point scale anibas et al 2010 cranswick et al 2014 hyun et al 2011 mccallum et al 2014 shanafield et al 2010 2011 and regional scale methods bourke et al 2014 cook et al 2006 harrington et al 2014 unland et al 2013 kalbus et al 2006 have conducted a comprehensive review of the quantification technique for fluvial and aquifer flux at different scales however heterogeneity of anisotropy and scale effects remain a challenge in quantifying hydraulic exchange sophocleous 2002 mccallum et al 2012 ortega et al 2015 xie et al 2016 have analyzed the uncertainty of natural tracer methods for quantifying river aquifer interaction in a large river natural chemical tracers can provide a comprehensive view of large areas for a long time so they are well suited to identify and quantify the exchange flux between surface water and groundwater ortega et al 2015 the prerequisite for the use of chemical tracers is that the concentration of tracer between surface water and groundwater is sufficiently detectable in order to calculate the mass balance of the tracer it is necessary to accurately characterize all sources and sinks that influence the difference of tracer concentration in addition evaporation precipitation radioactive decay degassing biochemical reactions and other factors also play an important role in the spatiotemporal variation of solute concentration unland et al 2013 natural geochemical tracers that identify and estimate the interaction between surface water and groundwater include major ions stable isotopes and radioisotopes cartwright et al 2011 genereux et al 1993 jing et al 2018 lamontagne and cook 2007 mullinger et al 2009 stellato 2008 unland et al 2013 yi et al 2018 in recent years with the improvement of measurement technology the use of radon 222rn has increased gradually and it has been proved to be an excellent tracer for the interaction between surface water and groundwater burnett et al 2010 cartwright et al 2011 cook et al 2006 dulaiova and burnett 2006 jing et al 2018 peterson et al 2010 smerdon et al 2012 spizzico 2005 unland et al 2013 xie et al 2016 yi et al 2018 radon 222rn the term radon will be used throughout the paper is a naturally occurring radioactive inert gas generated by radioactive decay of radium 226ra the term radium will be used throughout the paper when radium is dissolved or suspended in an aquifer radon produced by its decay then diffused into pore water and gradually concentrated in the aqueous phase ellins et al 1990 radium is derived from the decay of uranium which is ubiquitous in sediments and sedimentary rocks therefore the activity of radon is mainly determined by the lithology and chemical composition of the aquifer cecil and green 2000 sakoda et al 2011 as well as by the length of time from production to dissolution into groundwater with the accumulation of uranium and radium in the clay sediments the radon activity will increase at aquifer scale these differences must be considered during the study of groundwater flow using radon but it is less relevant to estimate surface water and groundwater interaction ortega et al 2015 for a sufficiently long time when the production rate of radon in groundwater is equal to its decay rate a dynamic molecular equilibrium will be reached and the radon activity will be maintained in a relatively stable range however radon activity in surface water is mainly balanced by groundwater recharge or discharge decay of radium diffusion of hyporheic zone decay of itself and degassing into the atmosphere etc since radon has a short half life 3 82 days it has great potential in the study of rapid mixing processes that occur on time scales of hours to several days zheng et al 2016 decades of research have shown that the activity of radon in groundwater is 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that in surface water cook et al 2008 the interaction between groundwater and surface water yunlong lake and kui river affects the agricultural production and life of 120 000 people in southern xuzhou which is one of china s 40 regions with severe water shortages groundwater and surface water are the main sources of drinking water and agricultural irrigation for the residents in the basin zhou 2002 with the acceleration of the industrialization process and the development of agricultural modernization the regional demand for water resources is rapidly increasing however the lack of awareness of environmental protection has led to the gradual pollution of surface water in the areas particularly lake and river water in the past people paid insufficient attention to water resources and lacked unified management leading to unreasonable groundwater exploitation yang and hua 2008 subsequently the regional groundwater level declines rapidly the descending funnel increases and becomes larger karst characteristics develop and the exchange of surface water and groundwater deteriorated the groundwater quality gradually yuan et al 2013 therefore with the aim of protecting water resources and strive for better water quality the xuzhou region has committed to administration of surface water pollution and strengthen the joint management of surface water and groundwater despite several hydrogeological surveys as well as numerical simulation in the kui river watershed few studies have been focused on radioactive isotopes and hydraulic exchange of surface water and groundwater in this region wu et al 2007 in the investigation presented here we used radon and electrical conductivity ec methods to analyze the kui river and yunlong lake respectively to clarify the interaction between surface water and groundwater the quantitative evaluation of hydraulic exchange in this small watershed is crucial to the rational exploitation and protection of water resources which has significant economic and social benefits 2 site description the study area includes yunlong lake and the upstream of the kui river fig 1 yunlong lake is located in the southwest of xuzhou city which is located in the alluvial plain of north china with an elevation of 30 50 m the yunlong lake is surrounded by mountains on three sides and its surface area and land area are 5 82 and 6 3 square kilometers respectively kui river originates from yunlong lake and flows southward through xucun and huangqiao village before flowing into anhui province the length of the upper reach is 35 6 km and the basin area is 349 square kilometers the width of the river is 33 to 52 m the mean depth is 5 m and the width of the river bottom is 10 32 m the kui river was once the most polluted river in the huai river basin however in the last decade it has been restored as a landscape river the climate of study area is humid and semi humid region belonging to the temperate monsoon with the average annual rainfall of 802 mm year and the average annual temperature of 14 5 c field data were obtained from the upper reaches of the kui river and yunlong lake fig 1 water samples were taken in september of 2018 sampling points of the lake are arranged around and in the center of the lake fig 1 the sampling points of kui river are collected separately in the upstream of the river in addition the sampling was carried out on the other tributaries of the yunlong lake and the kui river these tributaries along the river have been constructed to divert water for irrigation during the growing season may to september the lithology in the study area is represented mainly by quaternary clastic and fractured carbonate rocks limestone and dolomite 3 sampling and analysis methods field radon measurement and sampling campaigns were conducted on the yunlong lake and upstream of the kui river during the period of 18 to 23 september of 2018 at 39 measurement locations fig 1 18 of them in the kui river 8 of them in the yunlong lake the remaining 13 in groundwater surface water samples were collected at intervals of about 1 to 3 km as some of them are restricted by accessibility at each sampling point the surface water of the river and lake is sampled at about 30 cm below the water surface by sampler about 3 to 5 m away from the shore groundwater samples were collected from wells denoted as g in fig 1 of residents near the river and the lake a water sample was also collected from a spring groundwater sampling was performed using a submersible pump situated at the outlet of the well that was pumping water at least 10 min before sampling to obtain fresh groundwater groundwater samples were stored in 250 ml pvc bottles which were overflowed and covered quickly to prevent contact with the air after sampling measurement of radon activity was carried out by a widely used the rad7 portable radon monitor and its accessory rad h2o durridge company usa which can measure radon in water over the activity range from 370 bq m3 to 14 800 000 bq m3 with a sensitivity that matches or exceeds those of liquid scintillation methods water sample was placed in a 40 ml for groundwater or 250 ml for surface water sample vial and a closed cycle is formed by air pump on the rad7 instrument unit and the sealed bottle containing the sample to extract the radon moist air mixed with radon is connected to the radon alpha detector through a drying device and the activity of radon is calculated by the activity of its decay products 218po and 214po considering of the half life of radon most samples were analyzed within a few hours after collection to achieve acceptable activity values radioactive decay needs to be considered for the time between sampling and analysis due to the time laps between sampling and analyzing a correction for the decay was performed the decay correction factor dcf is given by the formula dcf exp t 132 4 where t is the decay time in hours dimova et al 2013 after the radon activity was measured the collected water samples

of water was measured by a hydrographic echo sounder syqwest inc usa 4 modelling methods 4 1 1 d steady state model for river in addition to upstream inflow radon sources in river water are also derived from groundwater recharge daughter of radium decay in water bodies and hyporheic exchange of riverbed sediments the abnormally high radon activity detected in river water is generally regarded as a sign of groundwater recharge to river when groundwater enters and mixes with river water the concentration of radon in river will increase immediately however due to its short half life and partial radon escaping into atmosphere through degassing the concentration of radon in river gradually decreases in a unit water body when the environmental conditions reach a stable state namely the sources and sinks of radon reach equilibrium it is generally considered that the radon activity in the water body does not change with time hyporheic exchange occurs during river migration the process of hyporheic exchange will increases the radon activity without increasing flow cook 2013 without considering the impact of hyporheic exchange the calculated groundwater inflow will be higher a series of complex experiments are required to estimate the contribution of hyporheic exchange to river su et al 2015 cook 2013 estimated the radon flux input to river by measuring the production rate of radon in sediments in hyporheic zone and the amount of water flux exchange between hyporheic zone and river however there are no conditions for the completion of relevant experiments in this study so we will adopt the suggestions proposed by su et al 2015 for areas with sparse datasets the hyporheic exchange in the radon one dimensional steady state model is ignored according to the mass conservation theory one dimensional 1 d mass balance model was established to describe the exchange flux between river and groundwater su et al 2015 yi et al 2018 however the effects of different tributaries on hydraulic exchange were not considered here we add the inflow and outflow tributaries to the 1 d steady state model as follows 1 q d c d q u c u e α l 0 l q g c g e α x d x δ t c u c d

tributaries of the reach bq m3 x i and x j are the distance between the confluence of no i inflow and no j outflow tributaries and the downstream sampling location m the mass balance equation of radon activity in the whole studied river reach can be expressed as formula 1 the total variation in radon is attributed to the following factors including groundwater recharge river leakage impact of inflow and outflow tributaries radioactive decay and degassing process several assumptions are considered in the model due to the complex practical hydraulic exchange process of river and groundwater groundwater tributaries and river are the sources and sinks of each other precipitation and evaporation are not considered in the model because there was no precipitation in the study area before and after the sampling period and the short term effect of very low evaporation on river water can also be ignored radon derived from radium in river water and riverbed sediments is so scarce that it is ignored we do not consider the radon contribution from hyporheic exchange in our study wu et al 2004 although this can lead to errors in the estimation of surface water and groundwater interaction cook et al 2006 it is also assumed that all sources of radon can be instantaneously mixed and reach a stable state both longitudinally and vertically and the same parcel of upstream water is collected in the downstream sample location cook 2013 water samples collected at any point in the channel can represent the average value of the section the characteristic of formula 1 is that there are three sub formulas on the right hand side corresponding to the mass balance equation of three different surface water and groundwater interactions when the flow and radon activity match the conditions a cd cu and qd qu groundwater recharge river when the flow and radon activity match the conditions b cd cu and qd qu river recharge groundwater when the flow and radon activity match the conditions c cd cu and qd qu or cd cu and qd qu rivers are affected by groundwater recharge and river leakage when solute is characterized by decay and vaporization the total solute loss due to radioactivity and gasification needs to be taken into account in formula 1 α is named total loss coefficient including radioactive decay and degassing ellins et al 1990 3 α β γ 4 β λ rn v where β is the decay coefficient related to the average velocity of the river reach m 1 λ rn is the radioactive decay coefficient of radon λ rn 2 08 10 6 s 1 v is the average flow velocity of the river reach which determines the time from upstream to downstream m s the average flow velocity is used to replace actual velocity due to lack of field data thus average flow velocity between upstream and downstream is generally taken as a constant in the river section the γ is the loss coefficient caused by degassing m 1 in this paper surface renewal model is used to describe the loss of radon activity caused by gas exchange because the section of the studied river was mainly turbulent therefore the degassing loss coefficient can be expressed as follows peng et al 1974 stellato et al 2008 5 γ d 0 5 v 0 5 h 1

order to verify the results of the mass balance model of the radon isotope ec balance method is applied here to evaluate the hydraulic exchange of river water and groundwater since ec is stable does not decay or escape into the air the verification method is simpler in a stable state there are no such terms as decay and gasification it is feasible to substitute formula α 0 into formula 1 we can also use flow balance to evaluate the river groundwater interaction the net exchange can be obtained by the following expression 7 and the hydraulic conversion direction can be judged according to whether the calculation result is positive or negative 7 q q u q d l 4 2 box model for lake a radon box model was developed to analyze the interaction between lake and groundwater by dimova and burnett 2011 the box model contains the mass balance of all sources and sinks of radon including upstream inflow downstream outflow degassing groundwater interaction and sediment diffusion the radon budget of the model is essentially a balance between groundwater and upstream inflow and loss caused by degassing decay and downstream outflow assuming that the lake is in an equilibrium state immediately under the exchange of water the lake is in a stable state and the radon box model is expressed as follows 8 q gw c g c s q in c in q out c s f degas a λ rn v c s 0 where c g and c s are the activity of radon in groundwater and lake water respectively bq m3 c in is the activity of radon of upstream inflow bq m3 q gw q in and q out are discharge of groundwater and the fluxes of upstream inflow and downstream outflow m3 s f degas is flux of radon exchange with air bq m2 d λ rn is the radioactive decay coefficient of radon a is the area of the lake surface m2 v is the volume of the lake m3 the mass conservation equation of radon is established based on several assumptions diffusion from sediment at the lake bottom and decay of radium in the surface water were omitted because the effect on the calculation result was small although the diffusion flux of radon generated by the decay of radium in the sediments can be determined by the experiment described by rodellas et al 2012 however for lakes with more recharge sources diffusion flux is relatively insignificant and is usually ignored directly unless the sediment contains a large concentration of radium dimova and burnett 2011 for dissolved radium in lake water its contribution to radon activity in lake water can be determined by various methods in addition to the direct analysis of the activity of radium in water bodies su et al 2014 the radon emanation approach described by peterson et al 2009 is also feasible in comparison the method described by corbett et al 1997 is simpler due to the short half life of radon it takes about four weeks to wait for the excess radon decay in water body with the remaining radon is in equilibrium with the dissolved radium for a one dimensional steady state model and box model of lake the radon produced by dissolving radium in water body is essentially negligible we conducted a simple experiment in the laboratory in which three water samples including lake water and river water were placed and sealed a month later we did not detect radon in three water samples proving that the dissolved radium s contributions to radon in the surface water were inconspicuous the radon exchange between air and water in the model can be evaluated using the method described by macintyre et al 1995 the degassing is related to air temperature wind speed and radon gradient between air and surface water and is calculated as follows 9 f degas k c s α c a α 0 105 0 405 exp 0 05027 where k is the gas transfer coefficient m d α is the ostwald s solubility coefficient c s and c a are the radon activity in lake and air respectively bq m3 t air is air temperature in c the gas transfer coefficient is mainly determined by turbulence kinematic viscosity and gas molecular diffusion dimova and burnett 2011 there are several empirical formulas for calculating the gas transfer coefficient macintyre et al 1995 wanninkhof et al 2009 liss and merlivat 1986 crusius et al 2005 hartman and hammond 1985 the most widely used of which is the one developed by macintyre et al 1995 where 11 k 600 0 45 u 10 1 6 sc 600 b 12 s c ν d m 13 u 10 u h 0 097 ln h 10 1 1

and dm is the molecular diffusion both ν and dm can be adjusted for the temperature relationships described by gill 2016 for the purpose of verifying the results of the box model of radon the hydraulic exchange between lake and groundwater was quantified by the ec balance method in a stable state there are no such terms as decay and gasification in formula 8 5 results and discussion the results of radon activity and ec values for all water samples are listed in table 1 combined with the field measurement data the radon mass balance model the ec balance model and the water flow balance model are respectively analyzed to estimate the hydraulic exchange between groundwater and surface water as can be seen from fig 2 the radon activity of groundwater is obviously greater than that of surface water and spring water has the highest radon activity furthermore the radon activity in t1 tributary is significantly higher than that in the kui river in addition fig 3 indicates that ec in groundwater is generally higher than that in surface water compared with surface water ec distribution in groundwater is more irregular there are some high values of ec near to the rivers such as g7 g8 g12 etc the heterogeneity of ec distribution may be attributed to the local heterogeneity of soluble salts in aquifers 5 1 tracers in river and groundwater radon and ec the variation characteristics of radon isotope and ec at sampling points along the kui river in the study area are shown in fig 4 which can be used to identify abnormal exchange between groundwater and river water according to the variation of radon activity shown on fig 4 the whole river can be divided into three sections the first section from sampling point r1 to r5 has a total length of about 7047 m the radon activity gradually decreases from 2857 bq m3 to 583 bq m3 along the river the second section is 2036 m long and has the tributary t1 from the sampling point r5 to r6 radon activity increases rapidly from 583 bq m3 to 4680 bq m3 it can be inferred that there is groundwater inflow with high radon activity near the tributary t1 and the second section the last section from sampling point r6 to r9 has three tributaries t2 t3 and t4 with radon activity decreasing from 4680 bq m3 to 604 bq m3 the radon activity along the river changed dramatically revealing that frequent interactions may exist between groundwater and river water compared with radon activity ec values in river water are relatively stable with the changes ranging between 571 μs cm and 863 μs cm the lowest ec value occurred in the second section of the river which may be related to the tributary ti with lower ec values radon activity in groundwater is 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than that in surface water from the statistical analysis of groundwater sampling points radon activity ranges from 6212 bq m3 to 61156 bq m3 the radon activity in spring water is the highest table 1 in addition ec in groundwater varies from 846 μs cm to 1199 μs cm the radon activity of groundwater used in the radon mass balance method is 28474 bq m3 which is the average value of groundwater samples collected the temperature of water samples used to calculate the molecular diffusion coefficient d is also listed in table 1 5 2 tracers in lake water and groundwater radon and ec during the study period the radon activity in the lake water was relatively stable and the variation range was 514 bq m3 4177 bq m3 with an average of 2154 bq m3 table 1 furthermore the radon activity in groundwater used in the calculation is 37056 bq m3 which is the average value of three groundwater samples taken around the lake rather than all the sites in the study area ec variation of lake water is from 603 μs cm to 653 μs cm with an average value of 631 μs cm meanwhile the average ec for groundwater is 1056 μs cm in general there is a certain difference in tracer concentration for lake and groundwater which makes it possible for the tracer to identify hydraulic exchange yunlong lake is connected with two major rivers one is the source and the other is the sink field measurement data of these two rivers are shown in table 2 r1 and r18 represent sampling points at the cross section of the boundary between the lake and the river respectively 5 3 estimation of river groundwater interaction the parameters for river sections and tributaries are shown on table 3 for the three sections that we ve been working on the flow balance method the radon balance method and the ec balance method have been used to evaluate the hydraulic exchange of groundwater and river water the results of calculations are shown in table 4 the net exchange between groundwater and river can be obtained by flow balance method but we cannot obtain the specific process that takes place in each section however the use of tracer methods radon balance and ec balance for the estimation of river groundwater interaction can clarify specific hydraulic exchange processes between groundwater and river water at each section in order to make a preliminary judgment on the net exchange in each section flow balance is first applied to calculate the exchange flux between the river and the groundwater of the kui river the results in table 4 show that the net fluxes of the three sections are 2 17 10 4 m3 s m 8 38 10 3 m3 s m and 1 75 10 4 m3 s m respectively meanwhile the calculation results reflect that the exchange process for the three sections is mainly river water leakage for the purpose of estimating the specific interaction process we have made assumptions for each section by considering changes of river flow and the tracer concentration in upstream and downstream in the first section of kui river the radon activity and river flow at the downstream sampling point r5 were lower than that at the upstream sampling point r1 therefore it is assumed that the first section is dominated by water leakage radon data were substituted into sub formula b of formula 1 and the results are shown in table 4 the flux of river water leakage is 7 29 10 4 m3 s m while using the ec balance validation the ec of downstream site s5 is slightly lower than that of upstream site s1 by substituting the ec data of section 1 into sub formula b of formula 1 the results show that the flux of river water leakage is about 2 42 10 4 m3 s m the result is similar to the radon balance model the calculated net exchange of the ec balance is closer to the calculated result of the flow balance and the result of the radon balance is slightly larger than the others in the middle section the radon activity of upstream site s5 is lower than that of downstream site s6 while the flow of upstream site s5 is higher than that of downstream site s6 it is assumed that groundwater discharge and river water leakage occur simultaneously by substituting the data of section 2 into sub formula c of formula 1 the results show that the flux of groundwater discharge is about 4 05 10 4 m3 s m and the river water leakage is 1 02 10 3 m3 s m the results show that there are two possible interactions between groundwater and river water and river leakage plays an important role in second section of kui river while using the ec balance validation the ec of upstream site s5 is also higher than that of downstream site s6 by substituting the data of section 2 into sub formula b of formula 1 the results show that the flux of river water leakage is 1 72 10 3 m3 s m the result is similar to the radon balance model it is shown that the net exchanges determined by radon balance model and ec conservation model are similar to the result of flow model in the third section both of radon activity and flow of upstream site s6 are higher than that of downstream site s9 the third section is dominated by river water leakage by substituting the data of section 3 into sub formula b of formula 1 the results show that the flux of river water leakage is 2 32 10 4 m3 s m when using ec to verify the results we found that the ec of upstream site s6 is lower than that of downstream site s9 this is in accordance with the condition c of the formula 1 by substituting the ec data of section 3 into sub formula c of formula 1 we can obtain that qr is 4 71 10 4 m3 s m and qg is 3 03 10 4 m3 s m the evaluation results for the three methods are similar compared with the results calculated by three different methods for the three sections of kui river table 4 the net exchange obtained by the radon balance method and ec balance method are close to that obtained by the flow balance method therefore the results of the calculation are considered reasonable 5 4 estimation of lake groundwater interaction in order to estimate the hydraulic exchange between groundwater and yunlong lake the model assumes that wind velocity 10 m above the water surface is 3 03 m s and the average water temperature is 24 3 c the average depth of the lake is 5 67 m and the surface area is 5 82 106 m2 table 5 the radon activity in yunlong lake is the mean value of l1 to l8 cs 2154 bq m3 since there are three groundwater sampling points near yunlong lake it is assumed that the radon activity of groundwater is equal to the average value of g1 g3 and g4 cg 37056 bq m3 the lake data has been substituted into eq 8 to solve the radon box model and the groundwater recharge rate is 1269213 m3 d groundwater supply accounts for 3 85 of the lake s storage capacity and the lake s renewal time is about 4 weeks table 6 the uncertainty of using radon isotope to build up the box model mainly comes from wind speed and the radon activity of groundwater wind speed has a significant influence on the radon degassing process which leads to a large gradient at air water surface however high precision wind speed can be obtained by sampling points distribution and instrument precision which can reduce part of uncertainty radon activity in groundwater is a sensitive parameter in order to reduce the uncertainty methods such as avoiding the radon escape in the sampling process increasing the measuring time and increasing the sampling points can be adopted ec balance method is also applicable to the box model the flux of groundwater and lake water estimated by ec data is 1250171 m3 d groundwater supply accounts for 3 85 of the lake s storage capacity and the lake s renewal time is about 26 days table 6 the comparison results of lake groundwater interaction are shown in table 6 in general the calculation results of radon isotope and ec box models are similar the recharge rate of groundwater in yunlong lake is about 1250171 m3 d 1269213 m3 d and the lake renewal time is about 26 days in general the hydro exchange process throughout the small catchment can be obtained by estimating the interaction between yunlong lake kui river and groundwater the geographical location of yunlong park is situated in the mountains embrace due to low lying terrain groundwater from the surrounding mountains is the main recharge source of yunlong lake and the interaction is frequent and close many conversions occur between the groundwater and kui river despite three sections of kui river are also in the upstream zone the existence of several tributaries makes the interaction of groundwater and river water complex the interaction between river reach and groundwater is dominated by river leakage furthermore the results determined by the radon balance method and the ec conservation method reflect the possible groundwater discharge in the second and third sections of the river water 5 5 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis a series of assumptions and simplifications were made during the establishment of the radon box model and the one dimensional steady flow model for instance the steady state model can only reflect the hydraulic exchange state of surface water and groundwater during the sampling period because precipitation would affect the accuracy of radon measurement in short term therefore it is necessary to avoid precipitation period when sampling and the influence of precipitation is ignored in the calculation process these assumptions and generalizations may not be consistent with the actual situation resulting in the deviation of the model calculation results meanwhile the temporal and spatial variation of river flow and the abrupt change of river topography will make it difficult to obtain accurate data average values of some parameters are used to calculate the model and thus the use of constant river flow in research may lead to deviations due to uncertainty sensitivity analysis of parameters is an important step in quantifying the uncertainty of a model it is essential to fully consider the errors caused by sensitive parameters under the existing model and practical conditions it will help to analyze the influence of various parameters on the accuracy of the model better understand the model and reduce the uncertainty of the model lenhart et al 2002 it is suggested that researchers should pay more attention to the highly sensitive parameters from sampling testing and calculation in future research work the following equation can be used to represent the relative error of calculation results caused by the uncertainty of parameters used in the study 14 δ y x 0 δ x y x 0 y x 0 100 where δ is the relative error x is a sensitive parameter and y is the calculated result here we set the assumed errors δ x as 1 5 10 20 35 and 50 to calculate the parameter uncertainty during the calculation of one dimensional steady state model the relative errors of different river sections are averaged and the relative errors of different sensitive parameters to the model are obtained as shown in table 7 and fig 5 as described in table 7 and fig 5 when the measurement errors are 1 and 5 the relative errors of calculation results are less than 10 when the measurement error is 10 the relative error caused by most parameters is less than 10 except the relative error caused by the measurement error of river flow and length of river however the maximum relative error is still less than 20 when the measurement error varies between 10 and 50 the relative error increases sharply compared with other parameters the relative error caused by river flow increases more rapidly when the measurement error is 20 the relative error is mostly less than 15 when the measurement error reaches 35 and 50 the maximum relative error is between 60 and 80 it can be concluded from fig 5 that the upstream flow qu and downstream flow qd are particularly sensitive parameters this is consistent with the parameter sensitivity analysis results of su et al 2015 on the radon one dimensional model of river meanwhile length of reach l and downstream radon activity cd are sensitive parameters the calculation results of other parameters are insensitive to measurement errors when the parameter errors reach 50 the calculated relative errors are less than 10 when the measurement errors are less than 20 most of the relative errors are acceptable in water resources management except those caused by river flow and length of reach the large relative errors are mainly caused by high sensitivity parameters qu and qd are important indicators for calculating the change of radon flux in the reach their accuracy directly determines the model s error therefore in the field sampling accurate measurement of river flow is of great significance to the radon one dimensional steady flow model the results of parameter sensitivity analysis for the lake radon box model are shown in table 8 and fig 6 when the measurement errors of all parameters are 1 and 5 the calculated relative errors are all less than 10 when the parameter errors reach 10 the relative errors obtained by other parameters are still less than 10 except the measured wind speed u and radon activity in the lake cs however when the parameter errors continue to increase to 20 35 and 50 respectively and the relative error of calculation results highly increases fig 6 shows that the measured wind speed u is a particularly sensitive parameter when the parameter error reaches 50 the calculated error is 74 4 radon activity in the lake cs lake area a water temperature t and groundwater radon activity cg are relatively sensitive parameters when the parameter errors reach 50 the calculated errors are 55 1 48 3 48 8 34 7 respectively the remaining parameters are insensitive because the calculated errors are less than 10 when the parameter errors reach 50 in this study the measured wind speed u is the most sensitive parameter of the box model and it is an important index to calculate the radon gasification rate on the lake surface when the measurement error of wind speed reaches 20 the relative error of the result is more than 20 and increases sharply with the increase of measurement error as a result the accurate measurement of wind speed in the field is an important part in the establishment of box model in addition we found from fig 6 that the radon activity of lake water is the second most sensitive parameter of the model the measurement errors of parameters can be reduced by adding more sampling points to reduce the uncertainty of box model 6 conclusions the purpose of this study is to use three different methods the radon balance method ec conservation method and flow balance method to quantitatively evaluate the hydraulic linkage between groundwater and rivers lakes in a watershed meanwhile the detailed interaction process within the reach of the river was determined by one dimensional stability model and the exchange flux between yunlong lake and groundwater is calculated by box model furthermore flow balance and ec conservation were used to verify the calculation results of radon balance model the results indicate that multiple transformations occur between groundwater and river that river water leakage is the dominant process the existence of several tributaries complicates the hydraulic exchange and groundwater discharge in some places is also evident based on the model results and field measurements lake water is mainly recharged by groundwater originating in the surrounding mountains and the lake renewal time is about 26 days based on the calculations from several models among of the three methods the flow balance method can accurately estimate the net exchange but it cannot specify the detailed exchange processes which can be used as a reference for the other two methods radon balance method can quantitatively evaluate the interaction between groundwater and surface water and it can effectively analyze the interaction between each section the advantage of radon is the large difference between surface water and groundwater which is more sensitive to the exchange process in the river on the contrary the disadvantage is that there are many environmental interference factors impacting the process of quantitative analysis and the sensitivity and uncertainty of parameters should be considered in practical application the same effect can be achieved by the ec conservation method which is relatively insensitive to the radon balance method but the stability of the calculation results is better through the analysis of parameter sensitivity it is concluded that the flow of upstream and downstream sections is the most sensitive parameter in the one dimensional steady state model of radon similarly the measured wind speed is a very sensitive parameter in the application of the box model in order to reduce the uncertainty of models improving the precision of field measurement is an important way to obtain more accurate parameter data this study successfully demonstrated the use of radon and ec as tracers in estimating the relationship between groundwater and surface water especially in small basins such as kui river and yunlong lake watershed where conventional hydrological data are scarce moreover with the combination of the three methods the hydraulic exchange between groundwater and surface water in small watershed can be evaluated more effectively and perfectly declaration of competing interest the authors
