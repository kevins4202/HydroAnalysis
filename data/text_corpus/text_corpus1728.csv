8640,water provides many important and some essential services the quality of the piped water entering a household impacts the value generated by these services household response options include treating the piped water using water from an alternative source and selecting a community with different piped water quality this intersection between location choice and community piped water quality may manifest as a house price effect we adapt a residential sorting model to identify variables that characterize the relationship between piped water quality and house price many studies explore the impact of locational and structural attributes on house prices but very few include piped water quality in our model households in a given community produce water services using piped water materials and capital or purchase water from an alternate source a housing rental price equilibrium emerges after households sort themselves among communities varying in piped water quality and alternate source water cost the presence direction and size of the relationship between house price and community piped water quality depends on that piped water quality the cost of treating it and the quality and cost of substitutes absent accounting for these community level characteristics both measuring and interpreting a relationship between property prices and piped water quality will be questionable our model results also suggest that if households know their piped water quality and can afford to invest in treatment or purchase of the substitute they may adequately avert the impacts of poor quality piped water keywords household production function drinking water quality housing rental price sorting equilibrium data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the development of the technology to deliver safe drinking water to humans is one of the most important advances in protecting human health today everyone expects to have safe potable drinking water coming from their taps however this is not always the case around the world there are many communities where the piped water delivered to community residences is not considered safe to drink for most canadians access to safe piped drinking water is taken for granted drinking water management in canada dramatically shifted in the early 2000s in may 2000 improper testing and treatment allowed water contaminated with e coli o157 h7 to enter the distribution system seven people died and many suffered long term health impacts 1 3 ten months later in north battleford saskatchewan a malfunction of the community water treatment plant following maintenance of a filter lead to a cryptosporidium outbreak in the community 4 following these events canadians have consistently ranked drinking water protection as an important policy priority 5 and governments have responded by imposing stricter regulations this research originated with the perception by provincial health authority staff in british columbia that an estimate of the economic benefits of community water system improvements could motivate communities to undertake such improvements following a scathing report by the office of the ombudsman 6 7 these authorities were under substantial pressure to bring about improvements in piped water quality for small communities around the province water suppliers purveyors have the first level of responsibility to their consumers to notify them of any water quality or safety concerns and are legally required to do this independently or under order from drinking water officers 7 9 drinking water advisories dwas boil before use do not consume and do not use are issued when testing source or system conditions suggest an elevated risk to those that would consume the water boil water advisories bwas are by far the most common type of advisory 7 8 with the other advisories issued when this treatment is insufficient to address risks drinking water quality is difficult to define for health authorities it generally pertains to some assessment of acceptable health risk 10 assessing this risk involves measuring multiple factors related to the water source and the technologies being applied to address any risks inherent in the source some of these risk factors are constant such as background levels of chemicals like arsenic other risks microbial contamination etc occur when unintended contamination of sources or failures of treatment occur some of these risk factors such as turbidity are perceptible others are odorless tasteless and colorless ensuring piped water quality in small rural communities is a continuing challenge 11 in canada various public and private local entities provide piped water to households with provincial agencies health environment etc responsible for monitoring and enforcement activities required to ensure drinking water meets public health standards 12 13 among responses to a 2011 survey of drinking water plants by statistics canada almost 1 600 of the more than 2 000 participating plants served between 300 and 5 000 persons 14 while there have been no major waterborne disease outbreaks in canada since 2001 the number of bwas issued nationally from 2010 to 2015 has remained constant 15 in 2018 more than 98 of all these bwas occurred in small drinking water systems sdwss serving less than 5 000 people with 77 occurring in systems serving less than 500 people this highlights a major problem in canadian drinking water systems 15 according to the public health agency of canada over a thousand advisories recommend against drinking water directly from the tap most occurring in small and rural communities 7 16 19 evidence suggests that a relatively high proportion of water borne disease outbreak occurred in small drinking water systems serving populations of 5 000 people or less 20 each province s classification system is unique and in bc all water systems that serve fewer than 500 people in a 24 hour period are termed small water systems 6 as of 2017 the provincial health officer pho stated that b c had approximately 4 800 drinking water systems on record and about 90 of these systems are small 9 in bc bwas are issued by water suppliers or health authority officials such as medical health officers or drinking water officers to alert residents that consumption of tap water may involve health risks 6 8 presently bc has among the highest per capita rate of boil water advisories 0 04 1000 in canada 9 21 governments have recognized this issue and have made promises to deal with it provincial policy 22 dictates independent water utilities as in many small communities must be self financed the interior health authority iha which serves the southern and eastern interior of the province reports that 80 of bc sdwss in iha s jurisdiction had an average of about 100 days of bwas over a five year period with the remainder on an advisory for almost 97 of this period 23 of the 1 454 small systems 241 were on a bwa for the entire five year period small water systems often experience challenges because of aging infrastructure limited budgets limited operational capacity and requirements for more formal education and technical knowledge than exists in the community 24 iha struggles to convince rural communities that they are facing health risks from their drinking water risks which could be reduced if they collectively invest in system upgrades however scarce funds and competing priorities mean that progress has been slow an overarching question is whether the benefits provided by upgrading a system is greater than the cost while the cost of the system upgrade is typically easy to estimate the benefits are more elusive purchasing a house in a particular community includes accepting the quality of the water piped into a house houses can be thought of as bundles of structural characteristics internal attributes and locational and environmental amenities or disamenities external attributes 25 27 the market value of a house can be thought of as the aggregate value of the internal and external attributes values have been estimated for numerous external attributes such as school quality 28 30 water quality 31 air quality 32 33 noise pollution 33 34 and many more attributes 30 35 37 poor piped water quality is an external attribute associated with the location of the house which may reduce the price of the house the size of this effect may reflect much of the economic cost of poor water quality a reasonable estimate of the benefit of improving piped water quality can help determine the net benefit of investing in a centralized treatment system such knowledge may convince some communities to undertake system upgrades while for others it may demonstrate that attaining a uniform standard for piped water quality across communities may not occur without outside financial assistance a first step in measuring this value is carefully characterizing the relationship between piped water quality and the residential location choice in this paper we develop a utility maximization model that integrates adaptation and community choice we divide the adaptation problem in a given community into two steps in the first step the household chooses its optimal consumption and treatment strategy conditional on choice of source in the second step the household chooses to use either the piped water or water from an alternate source available in that community finally households sort themselves among the available communities on the basis of the utility generated by their optimal adaptation choice should the household be resident in each community a sorting like equilibrium emerges when house prices adjust to equalize the utility between the communities so that all the houses available in each community are occupied this work provides a theoretical perspective on a thinly studied area of how drinking water quality can affect housing prices it is one of a few papers that use a household production function approach to the household water use decision it extends this earlier literature by considering the water quality effects mediated through a household water services production function on residential location choices in this way it occupies the intersection between the averting behavior literature and that examining the capitalization of neighborhood amenities into housing prices in our model the amenity is produced by the household using local inputs and the conditions on its production bound the capitalization into the housing price the rest of the paper is organized as follows in the next section a selection of literature related to locational sorting models is surveyed in section 3 a theoretical model is developed subsequently a numerical example is used to illustrate the key results which are discussed in section 4 the final section provides some concluding points 2 previous literature housing is a heterogeneous good with buyers and sellers having heterogeneous preferences over housing characteristics an extensive body of research has been devoted to exploring how housing characteristics affect market prices over recent years researchers have explored behavioral responses mediated by property market decisions 35 36 38 generally people are assumed to make a residential location choice to maximize utility as heterogeneous households sort themselves across the communities their collective location choices may influence housing prices to better understand this two way interaction between people and their surrounding environment economists have developed equilibrium sorting models esms or locational equilibrium models 39 42 a location sorting equilibrium arises when the housing market clears and no household can improve their utility given their available resources by moving to any other of the available locations the basic structure of esms includes a property market where households choose a residential location from a finite set of neighborhoods that differ by their level of provision of public goods usually empirical models are used to examine the properties of a locational equilibrium to relate consumers observable choices to their unobserved demand for public goods the esms explicitly model the household preferences and provide a framework to consider the welfare impacts of interventions that result in localized changes in public good provision 35 36 38 41 43 in this choice process households care about specific characteristics of location including locally provided public goods and make location choices based on these characteristics the house price being the integrated value of such characteristics plays a key role in defining locational equilibrium models the value of services provided by these neighborhood conditions and local amenities is implicitly included to the house price how large a premium a household would be willing to pay for a house with better piped water quality will depend on how much it will cost the household to adapt to the lower water quality of the comparison house this adaptation may take the form of treating the piped water entering the house acquiring water from an alternate higher quality source or spending more on other goods that compensate for the lower utility contribution from the piped water a number of studies 44 46 have shown that individuals have a significant willingness to pay for improved water quality whether in developing or developed countries 47 a piped water network is a fixed neighborhood attribute which may affect household location choice if the household derives utility from consuming that piped water households also have a range of averting options to deal with poor drinking water quality these options can be divided into two broad categories point of entry poe and point of use pou treatment systems poe systems are installed where the pipe enters the house treating all the water that comes into the home e g water softeners disinfection systems etc pou systems are installed directly into any of the water use locations typically taps existing at home and treat the water intended for direct consumption reverse osmosis active carbon filter etc 48 many researchers 32 49 56 have examined the household averting behavior by using a household production and or utility maximization framework such analyses typically take the housing location as fixed the model developed below relaxes this assumption we explore how the cost of averting behaviors affects house prices when households can choose the amount of these averting behaviors undertaken by choosing the community to live in the importance of location choices based on neighborhood characteristics was first empirically explored using hedonic pricing estimations that included structural and neighborhood characteristics 25 57 58 the literature on hedonic and discrete choice models of differentiated product markets have served as the intellectual foundation of sorting models they combine the information provided by an equilibrium hedonic price function 25 59 60 with a formal description for the choice process of heterogeneous agents this equilibrium sorting framework can depict a mixture of discrete and continuous choices made by a population of heterogeneous agents while recognizing that characteristics of the objects of choice may be determined endogenously 61 63 59 explains that in a non linear hedonic price equation the implicit price depends on the quantity of an attribute consumed by the household and therefore is endogenous and a solution to this problem is provided in their later study 64 most of the theoretical work on sorting has focused on characterizing restrictions on preferences that support the existence of a locational equilibrium 65 initiated this line of work to characterize a locational equilibrium a series of theoretical studies 61 66 70 demonstrates equilibrium models for residential sorting and provides the framework to analyze the provision of local public goods that are difficult to trace otherwise all the empirical sorting models are motivated by a single long standing question how can we estimate the demand for public goods that are not explicitly traded in the formal market the sorting process that generates the underlying market equilibrium led to subsequent research on characterizing the properties of equilibria that result from heterogeneous households sorting themselves across differentiated communities traditional models of the sorting process were developed using the characteristics approach to consumer theory 71 61 provides the first illustration of this logic in their analysis households choose where to live based on their exogenous income and their preferences for bundles of local public goods that are unique to each urban community they 61 64 72 incorporated this equilibrium concept into an empirical procedure these studies estimate a general equilibrium model in which the households sort themselves across communities that meet the conditions of boundary indifference stratification and ascending bundles 72 households are assumed to maximize utility a function of household and community characteristics only some of which are observable to the researcher households are assumed to have full information to be freely mobile and to make location choices within a discrimination free environment under these assumptions a sorting equilibrium is achieved when every household lives in its utility maximizing community and nobody wants to move given housing prices and the level of local public goods heterogeneity in preferences and or endowments are typically reflected in the composition of the groups that households are sorted into theoretical models investigate the existence and uniqueness of equilibria housing prices measure the implicit costs of consuming public goods 65 and 39 provide the conditions that guarantee the existence of sorting equilibrium for these types of models moreover locational equilibrium theory predicts that there is strong relationship between housing prices and public goods any equilibrium allocation for communities that differ in housing prices and public goods must satisfy the following sufficient assumptions to ensure the existence of equilibria 39 boundary indifference the set of border individuals between any two adjacent communities are indifferent between the two communities ordered bundles consider two communities j and k and local amenity with level s q if households care about the local amenity then p j h p k h if q j q k p j h p k h if q j q k all households choose a community and conditional on that choice select a quantity and quality of housing services derived from physical and neighborhood characteristics of the house equilibrium housing prices for each community enter utility as a separate sub function and reflect the equilibrium by community specific public goods housing markets provided a convenient testing ground for equilibrium sorting models contingent on some possibly strong assumptions like exogeneity of income perfect information perfect mobility etc these models provide a powerful approach for modeling the two way interaction between people and their surrounding environment the techniques developed in this context have been used to study behavior in a wide range of differentiated product markets the use of sorting models allow valuation of public goods such as air quality 32 36 38 73 74 open space 35 43 and school quality 75 76 and crime 76 among others also recent applications have considered network effects 77 78 location choices of firms 79 markets for education 80 and social interactions in labor markets 81 these models have tremendous potential to influence policy making and evaluation the clean air act the clean water act and the superfund program are examples of major public policies designed to produce large scale changes in the spatial distribution of non market amenities the relationship between water quality and property values focused on surface water quality is well documented 52 54 these studies show people do sort themselves into different locations based on personal characteristics proximity to lakes 55 and recreational sites 56 studies on the influence of piped water quality are less common seldom considering the relationship between housing choice and the quality of the water piped into the house we therefore turn our attention to understanding this relationship in further depth 3 model consider an urban landscape consisting of a finite set of households living in a geographic region partitioned into a set of spatially discrete communities each with its own water provider that delivers piped water of a quality unique to that provider we recognize that many impacts of poor water quality are health risks rather than health impacts and that other aspects of water quality vary seasonally and or with weather events over the short run households may adjust their adaptation decisions based on changes in water quality switching to an alternate source turning treatment systems on and off boiling water etc however over longer durations more consistent with housing choice we expect households to maximize an expected utility based on their expectation of these random events as our focus is on understanding where and how piped water quality may affect housing prices we do not focus on the short run responses but rather consider water quality as a longer run phenomenon that impacts the long run expected utility experienced by a household in a particular location in order to link a household s location choice to its demand for an individual public good we propose a novel residential location choice equilibrium model based on lancaster s consumer theory characteristics approach 71 82 and becker s household production function theory 83 based on these approaches the utility the household obtains from each location is a function of the characteristics of that location this keeps the dimensionality of the problem manageable and allows locations to be treated as a differentiated product in general communities differ in their residential desirability according to differences in the levels of local public goods and amenities such as school quality air quality water quality and access to open space etc in our model we focus on one local public good piped drinking water quality the household s utility u x w depends on the consumption of a purchased composite numeraire good x and a household produced water services good w standard assumptions hold so utility is strictly increasing twice continuously differentiable and strictly concave in both arguments x and w water services would include drinking cooking etc services where the quality and quantity of water both matter to the service provided households produce these water services by combining a quantity of water piped into the house s with capital k and materials m subject to an exogenously determined water quality 0 q 1 where perfect water quality corresponds to q 1 along the lines of 84 these components of water services production enter a household s utility u only through the production function w s k m q we assume that w is twice differentiable with more treatment inputs increasing water services w k 0 and w m 0 better quality water input increasing water services w q 0 and a unit of piped water generating no more than a unit of water services 0 w s 1 the household solves its utility maximization problem subject to a budget constraint 1 y x r h p s s p m m r k where y is total income which is divided among the composite good x with price normalized to one annualized housing rental price r h we expect r h r h p h where r h is the discount rate appropriate for housing and p h is the price of housing expenditures on water used in the house p s s expenditures on materials to treat water in the house p m m and the annualized or rental cost of the capital used for in house water treatment r k we solve the model using backward induction where the last choice made and first solved is the adaptation choice if the household uses piped water then they are choosing the treatment of the piped water and how much to use if they are using the alternative source then they are choosing how much water from this alternative to use the preceding choice and second solved is whether to use the optimally treated piped water or alternative the first choice and final one evaluated is which community to settle in where households know the utility they will earn from the optimal choices they will make in each community 3 1 3 stages of the model assume the urban landscape consists a set of households indexed i 1 n living in a geographic region partitioned into a set of spatially discrete communities j 1 2 j each served by a unique water provider we simplify our analysis by supposing that all houses are occupied by rental tenants abstracting away from the dynamic housing investment decision to focus on the connection between piped water quality and housing rental prices we assume all households are identical deriving the same utility within a community communities differ in a collectively provided public good piped water quality with q j as the quality of piped water in the j th community household i maximizes their utility u i j x w j by utilizing the numeraire good x and their respective water services w j subject to eq 1 the household optimization problem can be divided into three stages as shown in fig 1 in the first stage the household has chosen a community to live in and the source for the water used if they have chosen to use piped water the household maximizes utility by choosing how much piped water capital and materials to use if they have chosen to use water from an alternate source assumed to have perfect quality then they maximize utility by choosing how much water to use in the second stage the household chooses between piped water and water from an alternative source where the optimal choices for each source would be made finally in the third stage the household selects a community knowing the optimizing choice they would make in each community in the model we develop we in effect assume that after the household chooses a community it commits to a water source and then given that source chooses a treatment level one way to incorporate risk in a more detailed way would be to reverse source and treatment decisions repeating the source choice at a frequency consistent with water quality information availability households would switch between the alternate source and treated pipe water based on their expected utility given their perception of the risks over a longer interval consistent with the usable life of the treatment technology the household would choose a treatment technology investment that maximizes expected utility the housing location choice would occur at a yet longer interval we have collapsed this dynamic process into a simple pair of decisions that are made after the household has chosen a community 3 1 1 stage 1 water use the final choice solved first is the water use decision conditional on the chosen source and the chosen community if the household has chosen to use the water piped into the house then household i s utility maximization problem in community j is 2 max x j w j u i j x j w j 3 subject to y x j r j h p j s s j p j m m j r j k j 4 w j w j s j k j m j q j p w which if we assume an interior solution is equivalent to the following 5 max s j k j m j u i j y r j h p j s s j p j m m j r j k j w s j k j m j q j p w at this stage piped water quality is exogenous to the household the first order conditions foc evaluate as 6 s p j s u w w s u x 7 k r u w w k u x 8 m p j m u w w m u x yielding the usual solutions that prices equate to the relevant marginal utility impacts since we assume that the foc equations are continuously differentiable and that solutions exist then by the implicit function theorem the demand functions k s m will each be continuously differentiable functions of p s p m q and r we therefore have a demand functions for each household of the form s j s j r j p j s p j m q j p w k j k j r j p j s p j m q j p w m j m j r j p j s p j m q j p w the conditional demands for piped water and the composite good can be substituted into the utility function to obtain the household s conditional indirect utility 9 v i j p w u i j y p j s s j p j m m j r j k j r j h w s j k j m j p j s r j p j m q j p w in many communities the household will have access to an alternative source for water such as drilling a private well collecting water from a natural spring or purchasing water from a bottled water delivery company the cost of using the alternative will differ between communities some of the cost differences will reflect cost of accessing the alternative whether that be to transport the water or for well installation and maintenance in many cases the substitute water will require treatment an additional cost for simplicity we consider only one alternate source bottled water and assume its quality is perfect q b w 1 households will not invest in treating this water the quality of bottled water remains same in all the communities its volumetric price p j b w differs between communities with k j m j 0 the optimization problem becomes 10 max s u i j y r j h p j b w s j w s j 0 0 1 which is choosing the amount of bottled water to consume solving through the first order condition will yield a bottled water demand s j s j p j b w 0 0 1 which when substituted into the utility function yields the conditional indirect utility 11 v i j b w u i j y p j b w s j r j h w s j 0 0 p j b w 1 in a richer model one could imagine a menu of alternative water sources in each community with the menu items characterized by prices and qualities the household would then be assessing the relative cost of producing water services from all of these sources choosing that source which most cost effectively delivers the utility maximizing level of water services 3 1 2 stage 2 water source in the second decision stage households compare their optimized utility from using piped water with that they would receive using bottled water the choice that the household makes if they have chosen community j is y i j arg max y p w b w v i j y r j h θ j where the vector θ j p j b w p j p w p j m r j represents the parameters excluding the rental house price r h unique to community j and where v i j y is defined as in eqs 9 and 11 the resulting indirect utility from this community becomes v i j r j h θ j max y p w b w v i j y r j h θ j this is the utility that will be used in the community choice 3 1 3 stage 3 community choice the final decision stage is the unconditional choice of community this choice is j i arg max j 1 j v i j r h θ j and results in an indirect utility to the household of v i p h θ max j 1 j v i j r h θ j where now θ θ 1 θ j and r h r 1 h r j h for a given parameter vector θ households will seek to move to that community which provides the highest utility 3 2 sorting equilibrium the equilibrium concept for this model is inspired by residential sorting equilibria for simplicity we have abstracted away from heterogeneity in preferences or income and heterogeneity in the housing stock available in each community sorting here is based only on variation in the quality of the local public good piped water quality and on differences between communities in the price of the piped water substitute bottled water adding preference income and housing stock heterogeneity would enhance the realism of the model but not change the overall substance of our results sorting equilibria sort individuals based on their characteristics for example wealthier households will be able to offer more for housing where water quality is better on its own this effect could magnify the impact of water quality on housing prices in contrast heterogeneity in preferences for high water quality can reduce the effect as only a subset is willing to offer more to live in communities with better water quality in both cases we would expect sorting to result in communities that are more common along these dimensions than the overall population while effects like this will affect the magnitude of the relationship between water quality and housing price it will not change the direction of that effect for simplicity we therefore abstract away from this heterogeneity with identical households identical housing stock identical piped water quality bottled water quality and all prices across a community the boundary indifference condition for a sorting equilibrium holds for all residences in each community the equilibrium is as if each household is a boundary household to all communities therefore in equilibrium the utility of all households must be equal the question of interest is the form of the ordered bundles condition specifically how does the relationship between two communities where q j q k map onto the relationship between r j h r k h the conditions for a sorting equilibrium in this context is a vector of rental house prices r h such that given θ v i j r j h θ j v i k r k h θ k for all j 1 j and all i 1 n all households have identical utility and are therefore indifferent as to which community they live in consequently if the number of housing units across all the communities is equal to n then all of those housing units will be occupied reflection on the second stage choice the water source choice suggests that the ordered bundles condition on the water quality public good need not be satisfied in relation to the piped water amenity if there are two communities j and k where household source choice is y j y k b w then these are communities that do not care about the piped water quality amenity consequently for these communities there is no requirement that q j q k r j h r k h the driver for differences in utility and therefore differences in rental house prices will here be p j b w p k b w for communities where y j p w and y k b w the difference in rental house prices will be driven by the difference between r k b w s k and p j p w s j p j m m j r k j and further for communities that both use the piped water if p j p w is sufficiently small relative to p k p w then q j q k will be associated with r j h r k h there may be a subset of communities between which the ordered bundles condition holds for the single amenity piped water quality the relationship need not hold for the complementary set of communities these possibilities are illustrated using a numerical example shown graphically in fig 7 this is a consequence of the fact that piped water quality does not itself directly enter the household utility function but its influence is mediated through the household production function for water services the challenge of identifying empirically a relationship between tap water quality and rental residential property price is identifying which sets the households in a particular community belong to the next section provides a numerical example of these results 4 numerical example 39 rely on a cobb douglas specification for utility and use a numerical example to demonstrate that a sorting equilibrium exists to illustrate the household s location choice behavior we consider a strictly concave quasi linear utility function for household i who chooses community j as follows 12 u i j x j w j x j c ln w j 13 w j s j 1 q q j q 1 k j a m j 1 a b 14 y x j r j h p j s s j p j m m j r j k j where q is perfect water quality where a unit of piped water generates a unit of water services and a and b are parameters defining the influence of capital and materials on the transformation of piped water into household services and the price of the numeraire good x j is normalized to unity consistent with assumptions outline above the water services production function w j is increasing and concave in water quality material input and capital invested on in home treatment while it is linear in the quantity of water used the concavity of the utility contribution of water services ensures an interior solution to illustrate results we choose parameter values for four hypothetical communities table 1 each community has different piped water quality but the same water rates for illustration purposes our bottled water alternative is priced below tap water in two communities while bottled water is generally far more expensive per unit volume than tap water bottled water in our model is a generic alternative to piped water our example illustrates the important role that the price of this alternative plays in the households adaptation decision and through that on the observed relationship between piped water quality and housing prices the water services w can be improved to a desired level by investing capital on in home treatment or if the piped water quality is improved by the water provider the relationship between the water services generated by one unit of piped water and capital investment on in home treatment can be seen in fig 2 holding all other variables and parameters constant water services equal water quality when there is no capital and materials invested in treating the piped water the water services production function asymptotes towards perfect water quality as the investment in capital increases fig 2 highlights the fact that if there is a target level of water services that a unit of piped water is to provide then the lower the quality of that piped water the more costly it will be for the household to treat the incoming piped water to achieve that target 4 1 water use 4 1 1 piped water solving for the demand functions using the example details in eqs 12 14 yields s j c p j s k j m j a 1 a p j m r j x j y r j h p j s s j r j k j p j m m j the amount of piped water used is inversely related to the price and independent of the water services production function parameters the ratio of the capital to materials used is proportional to the inverse of the price of materials and the rental cost of capital scaled by the relative production elasticities the demand for the numeraire good is of course the residual of the expenditures on piped water treatment see the appendix for derivation of implicit functions representing the demands for capital and materials for which closed form solutions do not exist one interesting result follows from solving for the marginal impact of piped water quality on the indirect utility given the function definitions it resolves to 15 v q j p w c q k j a m j 1 a b q j p w 0 the implication of this is that the marginal indirect utility of an increase in piped water quality is increasing in the quality of that piped water this is a consequence of the diminishing marginal productivity of capital and materials in the water services production function when piped water has low quality the optimizing household that is using piped water is investing enough that the marginal value of an increase in piped water quality mediated through the water services production function is lower than it is for the household in a community with high piped water quality with the price of the numeraire normalized and a quasilinear utility the marginal utility is the willingness to pay and as such households in communities with higher piped water quality would be willing to pay more for a marginal increase in the piped water quality note that in most situations communities are not asked to pay for marginal increases in the quality of their piped water rather they are asked to support an infrastructure investment that will result in a larger step change in the piped water quality the obtained maximum utility and respective maximum water services for four communities are represented in fig 3 by solid points the slope of each line through the point is the marginal indirect utility of a change in water quality the optimized water services and indirect utility increases as piped water quality improves holding all other parameters constant panel 3 a shows the piped water quality to water services relationship where households are optimizing their investment in generating water services with the piped water the communities with good piped water quality have steep curves as a little improvement in piped water quality increases the water services by a greater amount than households with lower piped water quality panel 3 b shows the relationship between indirect utility and piped water quality the slope of the indirect utility function in each community follows from the slope of the water services function in each community in this figure community 4 has very good piped water quality and therefore little investment in treating the piped water a small increase in piped water quality both increases indirect utility through the water services and results in a relatively large release of expenditures on treating piped water that is then used to purchase more of the numeraire good the consequence of these influences is the slope of the indirect utility function the marginal indirect utility decreases as the piped water quality decreases the wtp for that marginal increase therefore also decreases with decreasing piped water quality fig 4 focuses more closely on the relationship between piped water quality and water services the zoomed panel shows that the level of water services enjoyed by the household is increasing in the piped water quality to this panel is added a line representing the level of water services that would occur with no capital or materials applied to treating the piped water q j p w w j 1 s 0 0 w j projecting horizontally from the obtained level of water services to this line allows us to identify the equivalent piped water quality that would attain the same level of water services if there was no treatment note that with the quasilinear specification household expenditure on piped water is independent of water quality or other prices and as such setting k i m i 0 does not change s if the local health authority desires that all households have access to piped water with a quality of at least q p w then only households in community 1 are failing to treat their piped water to a level of water services consistent with this target in constructing our model we are assuming that households are aware of the quality of the piped water entering their home are aware of the treatment options available and have sufficiently large incomes that they are not constrained in choosing their own optimal level of water treatment for community 1 the piped water quality is low enough that investing in treating it to the health authority desired level results in a marginal indirect utility impact of such expenditures that is lower than spending more on the numeraire good given the model assumptions it would not be optimal to require the households in community 1 to invest more in treating the incoming piped water households that face an income constraint will not be able to attain the unconstrained optimal level of water services and may therefore be below the public health authority target even if a household with sufficient means would be able to afford to treat to the target level externalities resulting from households consuming water not meeting the health authority target may also justify interventions that either require the household to treat their piped water to a particular level or to subsidize their ability to do so further if there are scale economies in water treatment such that the cost of improving the piped water quality in a community is less than the total reduced treatment cost by households in the community investing in improved treatment would be welfare improving that this may not be occurring would be a governance issue and or a reflection of heterogeneity between households not considered in this analysis exploring such extensions is left for future work 4 1 2 bottled water we assume that households have available a substitute for piped water bottled water at price p j b w we further assume that this bottled water has perfect water quality so that households will not treat it note that with perfect water quality the demand for water treatment capital and materials is zero confirming this result therefore the demand for bottled water is given by s j c p j s which is identical to the demand for piped water thus as modeled households that choose bottled water purchase the same amount of water as those that choose to use the piped water households using bottled water do not incur the costs for treating this water thus for a household to choose to use piped water when there is a substitute present the price charged for the piped water must be sufficiently below that of the bottled water to make it optimal to invest in that treatment it also implies that for any given piped water quality there will be a threshold bottled water price where bottled water prices above this threshold will lead the household to choose to use the piped water and incur expenditures to treat it the fig 5 represents the demand curve of bottled water for all the communities as expected it is downward sloping the horizontal line at p represents a threshold price that would apply to a community with a particular water quality bottled water prices below this threshold will lead households to choose bottled water while those above will lead the household to treat and use their piped water the threshold will vary from community to community 4 2 source and community the source selection consists of comparing the calculated indirect utility for each of the two sources in each community with that providing the highest utility being the source selected the household s community preference will be for that community that provides the greatest utility variation in rental prices across communities will serve to generate a sorting like equilibrium where no household can increase their utility by moving to a different community fig 6 plots the indirect utility for a household in each of the four communities for each of the two available sources as a function of the quality of the piped water since the utility received from bottled water is independent of the quality of the piped water its utility is represented by a horizontal line the position of this line is a function of the price of the bottled water with higher prices shifting down the utility generated by choosing bottled water the utility from bottled water is represented by a downward sloping line which reflects the changing utility with changing piped water quality holding all other choices by the household constant these lines are the same as in fig 3 b any particular community has only one quality of piped water and is therefore represented by the vertical line with the intersection of this vertical line with the two indirect utility lines identifying the utility corresponding to the choice given the parameters used for this example households in communities 1 and 2 receive greater utility from using bottled water for these example communities the price of bottled water falls and water quality increases moving from community 1 to community 2 however it is clear that there is ample scope to choose other prices for bottled water that will not change the choice but will change the utility in communities 3 and 4 households receive their highest utility from choosing to use and treat their piped water graphically changing the price of piped water shifts the piped water indirect utility curves vertically in the same way that it does for the bottled water this is a consequence of the independence of the quantity of water consumed and any parameters other than the price and that the demands for water treatment inputs are independent of the amount of water consumed see appendix thus it is visually clear that if the price of piped water was dropped enough in community 3 its utility could be raised to be above that a household in community 4 receives there are ranges of parameter values that will result in the same source choices across the four communities while changing the utility rankings of the communities 4 3 sorting equilibrium in this section we demonstrate finding a sorting like equilibrium where rental prices are adjusted so that no household can enhance their utility by changing communities fig 7 illustrates the adjustments to the indirect utility achieved by adjusting the rental price to find an equilibrium where no household desires to move to another community in the figure the greatest utility is earned by the household in community 1 this is the community with the lowest water quality but also with the lowest cost bottled water substitute since households in this community are choosing bottled water they earn the highest utility overall for the purpose of adjusting the rental property prices across these four communities community 1 is used as a reference for community 2 the rental price needs to be low enough to offset the reduction in utility that comes from consuming less water recall that with the current specification all households expend the same amount on water purchases therefore when the water price is higher the amount consumed and the resulting utility is lower reducing the rental price frees up funds to purchase more of the numeraire good and thereby increase utility in communities 3 and 4 households are using piped water in these communities expenditures on water are the same as in the communities choosing bottled water however they are also spending some of their income on inputs for treating the water in these communities the rental price needs to be reduced to offset both the water price effect and the water treatment cost effect so that households do not wish to move in this example community 3 has the lowest utility and therefore the largest decrease in rental price to eliminate the incentive to relocate this numerical illustration demonstrates how the household production of water services results in the ordered bundle condition of the sorting equilibrium not aligning with water quality as the relevant amenity as described in section 3 2 if we compare communities 3 and 4 we see that the rental property price is higher in community 4 which has the higher piped water quality however the highest rental price is in community 1 which has the worst piped water quality these results highlight that the appropriate amenity along which the ordered bundle condition is to hold is the household produced water services not the piped water quality even without heterogeneity in preferences endowments and household specific water services production capacities the household produced water services amenity will depend on endogenous household choices 5 discussion we have constructed a simple household production function model where households can use material capital and piped water or bottled water to produce water services that enter their utility function we use the model to show the following results 1 that the willingness to pay for marginal water quality improvements may increase with water quality 2 that averting actions by households may move the quality of the water effectively consumed by households above some desired quality target 3 that while the quality of the piped water in a community is effectively a local public good when this water is translated into utility through a household production function the ordered bundles property of a sorting equilibrium need not hold for piped water quality and 4 empirical measurement of the relationship between piped water quality and rental property prices requires information about prices for the piped water for available substitutes and any differences in costs for treating the piped water across communities we see our results linking the literature examining averting behaviors with that exploring the capitalization of amenity values into home prices the former has seen extensive application to drinking water quality typically the amount households spend to avert the impacts of consuming their piped water supply is measured either in response to an event impacting that quality more typical of developed nation studies or of consistently poor water quality or delivery quality the households location is taken as fixed the amenity capitalization literature examines the impact of an dis amenity on the market price for houses that have access to that dis amenity parks schools shopping destinations airports etc have been valued based on the assumption that households bid based on the value generated received from the amenity the amenity is typically not a function of household choices in the model we develop households choose their averting behavior conditional on the community they live in while being able to choose their community knowing the averting behavior they will undertake as a consequence of that choice it is the availability of options to avert the impacts of poor piped water quality that bounds the extent to which differences in piped water quality across communities will be capitalized into housing prices the model has been solved for a sorting like equilibrium with households modeled as identical there is no preference heterogeneity to support the households sorting into communities where they have higher utility in the community they occupy than in any other effectively all households are boundary households of all communities our interest lies with the ordered bundles condition where in a sorting equilibrium we expect to see residential property rental prices ordered in proportion to the level of community amenities that households derive utility from our results suggest that some composite amenity or multidimensional bundle involving substitute sources and piped water quality adjusted to reflect relative costs related to these alternatives may have the desired relationship with rental property prices it will not be the case for piped water quality on its own note that this result may also be true for other amenities noise air pollution etc where households have averting options available the cost of these options and their effectiveness will bound the extent to which these amenities impact house prices this modeling exercise was undertaken to provide insight into what the relationship between housing prices and piped water quality might look like we expect that much of the economic benefit of improvements in piped water quality will be capitalized into housing prices and as our results show this capitalization may be quite small if averting behaviors are not too costly empirically we suggest that following the school quality capitalization work provides the most obvious strategy for identifying a water quality effect 85 88 like school catchment areas water providers service clearly defined geographic areas residents can choose an alternative source but cannot connect to an alternative water provider we are presently collecting data to enable such an empirical investigation given that the cost of adaptation options may be small relative to the other costs associated with changing homes it is entirely possible that buyers do not consider piped water quality at time of purchase simply accepting that they will deal with whatever the quality of the water piped into their home is we have abstracted away from the time scale differences between house purchase and water treatment decisions by considering the rental price for housing we have also included both materials and capital as water treatment inputs but not considered the decision to invest in treatment capital separately from deciding the intensity of use of this capital adding this complexity would not change the results of our analysis for a steady state however these dynamic effects would play out if investments are made in upgrading a community treatment system and affect the decision to support or not an increase in the water toll to pay for such an upgrade i e owners who have recently invested in an expensive water treatment system in their home may not support an upgrade if there is no effective secondary market for their treatment system transactions costs would also play an important role in the adjustment of home prices between communities in response to a change in water quality or in the price and or availability of a substitute source as for more complex heterogeneity exploring these dynamic effects is left for future work adding income and preference heterogeneity over the population that is sorting will not change the substance of our result it will add complexity and will affect the magnitude of the relationship between housing prices and piped water quality communities in reality are mixed with some households having strong preferences for bottled water and some households having income constraints preventing them from investing in treating their piped water likewise housing stocks across communities are heterogeneous and this too would be a factor in how households actually sort while we do not expect adding this complexity to change the substance of our results the existence of this complexity further highlights how challenging it will be to identify a relationship between housing prices and piped water quality our analysis takes a marginal perspective and discusses changes in piped water quality at the margin in reality water treatment systems both those used in the home and those used to centrally treat water before it enters the distribution system are discrete technological packages investment in water treatment will therefore involve step wise changes in water quality and the more realistic question is whether the total benefits from a step change justifies the cost for the household what is the gain in switching from a container filter to a reverse osmosis system to a whole home treatment system these cannot be installed as fractional systems likewise for central treatment where one has or does not have a filtration system does or does not have chlorination etc while our results are not directly applicable to step wise investments what they do highlight is the challenge in determining what the benefit of investing in centralized treatment upgrades is for communities that have low cost substitutes for their piped water a substantial improvement in piped water quality may generate little benefit to the members of the community prioritizing support for system upgrades grants etc for those communities with the worst piped water quality may not be the best investment those communities may have the worse quality piped water in part because nobody is using the water and quite content not to use it it also suggests that the most cost effective solution to low quality piped water may be providing an affordable substitute this would of course be particularly true for communities with high numbers of seasonal residents where the net benefit to a seasonal resident of improving piped water quality may only be enjoyed for a short vacation period while the costs of the upgrade must be paid continually 89 90 although data is difficult to find there is a wide perception that seasonal residents make up a large share of the home owners in a number of rural communities in british columbia 91 we have assumed that households are fully informed about the quality of the piped water and about the treatment options available households typically do not know how to use the water quality information that is collected they are more likely to notice aesthetic factors appearance odor taste than contaminants that may have substantial health impacts but are not easy to sense 92 93 they may rely on public health notices but in some cases may even reject those if it does not conform with their own perception effective information sharing and education to help households make use of this information would be necessary if private averting activities are to make up an important part of ensuring that people are not unnecessarily exposed to the risks of low quality piped water we have treated the substitute for piped water bottled water as having perfect quality while most people do not treat bottled water they purchase alternative sources such as private wells or surface sources are used by many households there are more than 24 000 current private domestic surface water licenses in british columbia 94 registration of new domestic wells was not required until 2016 and owners of existing wells at that date were not required to register that there are over 8 000 registered wells for private domestic use in this limited database suggests actual well numbers are much greater possibly greater than domestic surface license numbers 95 these private sources may not be of a quality that the local health authority considers potable households that are aware of this would in the context of the model treat this water from the alternate source testing of water quality is required for drinking water systems supplying two or more households when a system is supplying a single household testing is not required and the cost of doing so falls on the household many households using such sources do not routinely test their tap water and many are not equipped to interpret the results and or may not be in a position financially to pay for additional treatment if there is a need to do so we have also assumed that households have sufficient income to choose their optimal level of piped water treatment or to afford to purchase their optimal amount of the substitute our example household that does not protect itself to the desired standard is optimizing and would not be made better off by being required to treat more the only reason to force or assist further treatment in this case is the presence of externalities or coordination problems that are preventing the efficient outcome however households who are income constrained may not be able to protect themselves remote communities where alternatives like bottled water are very costly and households have low income and limited capacity to know how to manage the health risks in their piped water are the most vulnerable 96 where households of different income engage in the same in home treatment the share of income spent on averting activities will be higher for lower income households 97 we have not considered either externalities or governance in this investigation public health related externalities may be an important consideration if infections originating in one community with poor piped water quality can be easily vectored to other communities governance issues coordination problems within communities that prevent collective investment in water treatment when it is efficient to do so may be important both of these themes are left to further work 6 conclusions households supplied by small drinking water utilities are relatively more likely to face drinking water quality advisories such communities often struggle to self finance system improvements using a household production approach and solving for a sorting like equilibrium we show that the capitalized benefit of system upgrades will depend on the household cost of treating the piped water the availability of substitutes and the opportunity to move away it may be rational for community members to prefer their current system to achieving a target standard that has little bearing on their utility the equilibrium relies on adjusting housing prices so that households cannot increase their utility by moving within the context of this model it is demonstrated that the relationship between housing prices and piped water quality will be impacted by costs associated with averting behaviors related to using the piped water and the availability and costs of substitute water sources the cost and effectiveness of averting behaviors to deal with piped water quality challenges bounds the capitalization that may be detected in hedonic regressions accounting for the availability of averting options is important both for assessing the value of piped water quality and by analogy to other amenities where households endogenously manage how they are impacted by that amenity in our model households are fully informed about their piped water quality treatment options available and their cost and costs and availability of substitutes and have sufficient income to choose their optimal source and optimal amount of treatment given their source choice one important role for health authorities is to help overcome any information acquisition and utilization challenges they face so that they are in a position to make their private optimal choice externalities and coordination challenges may result in the collection of private optimal choices in a community not maximizing aggregate welfare assisting communities with overcoming coordination challenges facilitation education etc can be another important role for a health authority that could increase aggregate welfare externalities and concerns about the vulnerability of those with low income and or living in remote communities may justify public expenditures to assist some communities with upgrades to their community water systems credit authorship contribution

8640,water provides many important and some essential services the quality of the piped water entering a household impacts the value generated by these services household response options include treating the piped water using water from an alternative source and selecting a community with different piped water quality this intersection between location choice and community piped water quality may manifest as a house price effect we adapt a residential sorting model to identify variables that characterize the relationship between piped water quality and house price many studies explore the impact of locational and structural attributes on house prices but very few include piped water quality in our model households in a given community produce water services using piped water materials and capital or purchase water from an alternate source a housing rental price equilibrium emerges after households sort themselves among communities varying in piped water quality and alternate source water cost the presence direction and size of the relationship between house price and community piped water quality depends on that piped water quality the cost of treating it and the quality and cost of substitutes absent accounting for these community level characteristics both measuring and interpreting a relationship between property prices and piped water quality will be questionable our model results also suggest that if households know their piped water quality and can afford to invest in treatment or purchase of the substitute they may adequately avert the impacts of poor quality piped water keywords household production function drinking water quality housing rental price sorting equilibrium data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the development of the technology to deliver safe drinking water to humans is one of the most important advances in protecting human health today everyone expects to have safe potable drinking water coming from their taps however this is not always the case around the world there are many communities where the piped water delivered to community residences is not considered safe to drink for most canadians access to safe piped drinking water is taken for granted drinking water management in canada dramatically shifted in the early 2000s in may 2000 improper testing and treatment allowed water contaminated with e coli o157 h7 to enter the distribution system seven people died and many suffered long term health impacts 1 3 ten months later in north battleford saskatchewan a malfunction of the community water treatment plant following maintenance of a filter lead to a cryptosporidium outbreak in the community 4 following these events canadians have consistently ranked drinking water protection as an important policy priority 5 and governments have responded by imposing stricter regulations this research originated with the perception by provincial health authority staff in british columbia that an estimate of the economic benefits of community water system improvements could motivate communities to undertake such improvements following a scathing report by the office of the ombudsman 6 7 these authorities were under substantial pressure to bring about improvements in piped water quality for small communities around the province water suppliers purveyors have the first level of responsibility to their consumers to notify them of any water quality or safety concerns and are legally required to do this independently or under order from drinking water officers 7 9 drinking water advisories dwas boil before use do not consume and do not use are issued when testing source or system conditions suggest an elevated risk to those that would consume the water boil water advisories bwas are by far the most common type of advisory 7 8 with the other advisories issued when this treatment is insufficient to address risks drinking water quality is difficult to define for health authorities it generally pertains to some assessment of acceptable health risk 10 assessing this risk involves measuring multiple factors related to the water source and the technologies being applied to address any risks inherent in the source some of these risk factors are constant such as background levels of chemicals like arsenic other risks microbial contamination etc occur when unintended contamination of sources or failures of treatment occur some of these risk factors such as turbidity are perceptible others are odorless tasteless and colorless ensuring piped water quality in small rural communities is a continuing challenge 11 in canada various public and private local entities provide piped water to households with provincial agencies health environment etc responsible for monitoring and enforcement activities required to ensure drinking water meets public health standards 12 13 among responses to a 2011 survey of drinking water plants by statistics canada almost 1 600 of the more than 2 000 participating plants served between 300 and 5 000 persons 14 while there have been no major waterborne disease outbreaks in canada since 2001 the number of bwas issued nationally from 2010 to 2015 has remained constant 15 in 2018 more than 98 of all these bwas occurred in small drinking water systems sdwss serving less than 5 000 people with 77 occurring in systems serving less than 500 people this highlights a major problem in canadian drinking water systems 15 according to the public health agency of canada over a thousand advisories recommend against drinking water directly from the tap most occurring in small and rural communities 7 16 19 evidence suggests that a relatively high proportion of water borne disease outbreak occurred in small drinking water systems serving populations of 5 000 people or less 20 each province s classification system is unique and in bc all water systems that serve fewer than 500 people in a 24 hour period are termed small water systems 6 as of 2017 the provincial health officer pho stated that b c had approximately 4 800 drinking water systems on record and about 90 of these systems are small 9 in bc bwas are issued by water suppliers or health authority officials such as medical health officers or drinking water officers to alert residents that consumption of tap water may involve health risks 6 8 presently bc has among the highest per capita rate of boil water advisories 0 04 1000 in canada 9 21 governments have recognized this issue and have made promises to deal with it provincial policy 22 dictates independent water utilities as in many small communities must be self financed the interior health authority iha which serves the southern and eastern interior of the province reports that 80 of bc sdwss in iha s jurisdiction had an average of about 100 days of bwas over a five year period with the remainder on an advisory for almost 97 of this period 23 of the 1 454 small systems 241 were on a bwa for the entire five year period small water systems often experience challenges because of aging infrastructure limited budgets limited operational capacity and requirements for more formal education and technical knowledge than exists in the community 24 iha struggles to convince rural communities that they are facing health risks from their drinking water risks which could be reduced if they collectively invest in system upgrades however scarce funds and competing priorities mean that progress has been slow an overarching question is whether the benefits provided by upgrading a system is greater than the cost while the cost of the system upgrade is typically easy to estimate the benefits are more elusive purchasing a house in a particular community includes accepting the quality of the water piped into a house houses can be thought of as bundles of structural characteristics internal attributes and locational and environmental amenities or disamenities external attributes 25 27 the market value of a house can be thought of as the aggregate value of the internal and external attributes values have been estimated for numerous external attributes such as school quality 28 30 water quality 31 air quality 32 33 noise pollution 33 34 and many more attributes 30 35 37 poor piped water quality is an external attribute associated with the location of the house which may reduce the price of the house the size of this effect may reflect much of the economic cost of poor water quality a reasonable estimate of the benefit of improving piped water quality can help determine the net benefit of investing in a centralized treatment system such knowledge may convince some communities to undertake system upgrades while for others it may demonstrate that attaining a uniform standard for piped water quality across communities may not occur without outside financial assistance a first step in measuring this value is carefully characterizing the relationship between piped water quality and the residential location choice in this paper we develop a utility maximization model that integrates adaptation and community choice we divide the adaptation problem in a given community into two steps in the first step the household chooses its optimal consumption and treatment strategy conditional on choice of source in the second step the household chooses to use either the piped water or water from an alternate source available in that community finally households sort themselves among the available communities on the basis of the utility generated by their optimal adaptation choice should the household be resident in each community a sorting like equilibrium emerges when house prices adjust to equalize the utility between the communities so that all the houses available in each community are occupied this work provides a theoretical perspective on a thinly studied area of how drinking water quality can affect housing prices it is one of a few papers that use a household production function approach to the household water use decision it extends this earlier literature by considering the water quality effects mediated through a household water services production function on residential location choices in this way it occupies the intersection between the averting behavior literature and that examining the capitalization of neighborhood amenities into housing prices in our model the amenity is produced by the household using local inputs and the conditions on its production bound the capitalization into the housing price the rest of the paper is organized as follows in the next section a selection of literature related to locational sorting models is surveyed in section 3 a theoretical model is developed subsequently a numerical example is used to illustrate the key results which are discussed in section 4 the final section provides some concluding points 2 previous literature housing is a heterogeneous good with buyers and sellers having heterogeneous preferences over housing characteristics an extensive body of research has been devoted to exploring how housing characteristics affect market prices over recent years researchers have explored behavioral responses mediated by property market decisions 35 36 38 generally people are assumed to make a residential location choice to maximize utility as heterogeneous households sort themselves across the communities their collective location choices may influence housing prices to better understand this two way interaction between people and their surrounding environment economists have developed equilibrium sorting models esms or locational equilibrium models 39 42 a location sorting equilibrium arises when the housing market clears and no household can improve their utility given their available resources by moving to any other of the available locations the basic structure of esms includes a property market where households choose a residential location from a finite set of neighborhoods that differ by their level of provision of public goods usually empirical models are used to examine the properties of a locational equilibrium to relate consumers observable choices to their unobserved demand for public goods the esms explicitly model the household preferences and provide a framework to consider the welfare impacts of interventions that result in localized changes in public good provision 35 36 38 41 43 in this choice process households care about specific characteristics of location including locally provided public goods and make location choices based on these characteristics the house price being the integrated value of such characteristics plays a key role in defining locational equilibrium models the value of services provided by these neighborhood conditions and local amenities is implicitly included to the house price how large a premium a household would be willing to pay for a house with better piped water quality will depend on how much it will cost the household to adapt to the lower water quality of the comparison house this adaptation may take the form of treating the piped water entering the house acquiring water from an alternate higher quality source or spending more on other goods that compensate for the lower utility contribution from the piped water a number of studies 44 46 have shown that individuals have a significant willingness to pay for improved water quality whether in developing or developed countries 47 a piped water network is a fixed neighborhood attribute which may affect household location choice if the household derives utility from consuming that piped water households also have a range of averting options to deal with poor drinking water quality these options can be divided into two broad categories point of entry poe and point of use pou treatment systems poe systems are installed where the pipe enters the house treating all the water that comes into the home e g water softeners disinfection systems etc pou systems are installed directly into any of the water use locations typically taps existing at home and treat the water intended for direct consumption reverse osmosis active carbon filter etc 48 many researchers 32 49 56 have examined the household averting behavior by using a household production and or utility maximization framework such analyses typically take the housing location as fixed the model developed below relaxes this assumption we explore how the cost of averting behaviors affects house prices when households can choose the amount of these averting behaviors undertaken by choosing the community to live in the importance of location choices based on neighborhood characteristics was first empirically explored using hedonic pricing estimations that included structural and neighborhood characteristics 25 57 58 the literature on hedonic and discrete choice models of differentiated product markets have served as the intellectual foundation of sorting models they combine the information provided by an equilibrium hedonic price function 25 59 60 with a formal description for the choice process of heterogeneous agents this equilibrium sorting framework can depict a mixture of discrete and continuous choices made by a population of heterogeneous agents while recognizing that characteristics of the objects of choice may be determined endogenously 61 63 59 explains that in a non linear hedonic price equation the implicit price depends on the quantity of an attribute consumed by the household and therefore is endogenous and a solution to this problem is provided in their later study 64 most of the theoretical work on sorting has focused on characterizing restrictions on preferences that support the existence of a locational equilibrium 65 initiated this line of work to characterize a locational equilibrium a series of theoretical studies 61 66 70 demonstrates equilibrium models for residential sorting and provides the framework to analyze the provision of local public goods that are difficult to trace otherwise all the empirical sorting models are motivated by a single long standing question how can we estimate the demand for public goods that are not explicitly traded in the formal market the sorting process that generates the underlying market equilibrium led to subsequent research on characterizing the properties of equilibria that result from heterogeneous households sorting themselves across differentiated communities traditional models of the sorting process were developed using the characteristics approach to consumer theory 71 61 provides the first illustration of this logic in their analysis households choose where to live based on their exogenous income and their preferences for bundles of local public goods that are unique to each urban community they 61 64 72 incorporated this equilibrium concept into an empirical procedure these studies estimate a general equilibrium model in which the households sort themselves across communities that meet the conditions of boundary indifference stratification and ascending bundles 72 households are assumed to maximize utility a function of household and community characteristics only some of which are observable to the researcher households are assumed to have full information to be freely mobile and to make location choices within a discrimination free environment under these assumptions a sorting equilibrium is achieved when every household lives in its utility maximizing community and nobody wants to move given housing prices and the level of local public goods heterogeneity in preferences and or endowments are typically reflected in the composition of the groups that households are sorted into theoretical models investigate the existence and uniqueness of equilibria housing prices measure the implicit costs of consuming public goods 65 and 39 provide the conditions that guarantee the existence of sorting equilibrium for these types of models moreover locational equilibrium theory predicts that there is strong relationship between housing prices and public goods any equilibrium allocation for communities that differ in housing prices and public goods must satisfy the following sufficient assumptions to ensure the existence of equilibria 39 boundary indifference the set of border individuals between any two adjacent communities are indifferent between the two communities ordered bundles consider two communities j and k and local amenity with level s q if households care about the local amenity then p j h p k h if q j q k p j h p k h if q j q k all households choose a community and conditional on that choice select a quantity and quality of housing services derived from physical and neighborhood characteristics of the house equilibrium housing prices for each community enter utility as a separate sub function and reflect the equilibrium by community specific public goods housing markets provided a convenient testing ground for equilibrium sorting models contingent on some possibly strong assumptions like exogeneity of income perfect information perfect mobility etc these models provide a powerful approach for modeling the two way interaction between people and their surrounding environment the techniques developed in this context have been used to study behavior in a wide range of differentiated product markets the use of sorting models allow valuation of public goods such as air quality 32 36 38 73 74 open space 35 43 and school quality 75 76 and crime 76 among others also recent applications have considered network effects 77 78 location choices of firms 79 markets for education 80 and social interactions in labor markets 81 these models have tremendous potential to influence policy making and evaluation the clean air act the clean water act and the superfund program are examples of major public policies designed to produce large scale changes in the spatial distribution of non market amenities the relationship between water quality and property values focused on surface water quality is well documented 52 54 these studies show people do sort themselves into different locations based on personal characteristics proximity to lakes 55 and recreational sites 56 studies on the influence of piped water quality are less common seldom considering the relationship between housing choice and the quality of the water piped into the house we therefore turn our attention to understanding this relationship in further depth 3 model consider an urban landscape consisting of a finite set of households living in a geographic region partitioned into a set of spatially discrete communities each with its own water provider that delivers piped water of a quality unique to that provider we recognize that many impacts of poor water quality are health risks rather than health impacts and that other aspects of water quality vary seasonally and or with weather events over the short run households may adjust their adaptation decisions based on changes in water quality switching to an alternate source turning treatment systems on and off boiling water etc however over longer durations more consistent with housing choice we expect households to maximize an expected utility based on their expectation of these random events as our focus is on understanding where and how piped water quality may affect housing prices we do not focus on the short run responses but rather consider water quality as a longer run phenomenon that impacts the long run expected utility experienced by a household in a particular location in order to link a household s location choice to its demand for an individual public good we propose a novel residential location choice equilibrium model based on lancaster s consumer theory characteristics approach 71 82 and becker s household production function theory 83 based on these approaches the utility the household obtains from each location is a function of the characteristics of that location this keeps the dimensionality of the problem manageable and allows locations to be treated as a differentiated product in general communities differ in their residential desirability according to differences in the levels of local public goods and amenities such as school quality air quality water quality and access to open space etc in our model we focus on one local public good piped drinking water quality the household s utility u x w depends on the consumption of a purchased composite numeraire good x and a household produced water services good w standard assumptions hold so utility is strictly increasing twice continuously differentiable and strictly concave in both arguments x and w water services would include drinking cooking etc services where the quality and quantity of water both matter to the service provided households produce these water services by combining a quantity of water piped into the house s with capital k and materials m subject to an exogenously determined water quality 0 q 1 where perfect water quality corresponds to q 1 along the lines of 84 these components of water services production enter a household s utility u only through the production function w s k m q we assume that w is twice differentiable with more treatment inputs increasing water services w k 0 and w m 0 better quality water input increasing water services w q 0 and a unit of piped water generating no more than a unit of water services 0 w s 1 the household solves its utility maximization problem subject to a budget constraint 1 y x r h p s s p m m r k where y is total income which is divided among the composite good x with price normalized to one annualized housing rental price r h we expect r h r h p h where r h is the discount rate appropriate for housing and p h is the price of housing expenditures on water used in the house p s s expenditures on materials to treat water in the house p m m and the annualized or rental cost of the capital used for in house water treatment r k we solve the model using backward induction where the last choice made and first solved is the adaptation choice if the household uses piped water then they are choosing the treatment of the piped water and how much to use if they are using the alternative source then they are choosing how much water from this alternative to use the preceding choice and second solved is whether to use the optimally treated piped water or alternative the first choice and final one evaluated is which community to settle in where households know the utility they will earn from the optimal choices they will make in each community 3 1 3 stages of the model assume the urban landscape consists a set of households indexed i 1 n living in a geographic region partitioned into a set of spatially discrete communities j 1 2 j each served by a unique water provider we simplify our analysis by supposing that all houses are occupied by rental tenants abstracting away from the dynamic housing investment decision to focus on the connection between piped water quality and housing rental prices we assume all households are identical deriving the same utility within a community communities differ in a collectively provided public good piped water quality with q j as the quality of piped water in the j th community household i maximizes their utility u i j x w j by utilizing the numeraire good x and their respective water services w j subject to eq 1 the household optimization problem can be divided into three stages as shown in fig 1 in the first stage the household has chosen a community to live in and the source for the water used if they have chosen to use piped water the household maximizes utility by choosing how much piped water capital and materials to use if they have chosen to use water from an alternate source assumed to have perfect quality then they maximize utility by choosing how much water to use in the second stage the household chooses between piped water and water from an alternative source where the optimal choices for each source would be made finally in the third stage the household selects a community knowing the optimizing choice they would make in each community in the model we develop we in effect assume that after the household chooses a community it commits to a water source and then given that source chooses a treatment level one way to incorporate risk in a more detailed way would be to reverse source and treatment decisions repeating the source choice at a frequency consistent with water quality information availability households would switch between the alternate source and treated pipe water based on their expected utility given their perception of the risks over a longer interval consistent with the usable life of the treatment technology the household would choose a treatment technology investment that maximizes expected utility the housing location choice would occur at a yet longer interval we have collapsed this dynamic process into a simple pair of decisions that are made after the household has chosen a community 3 1 1 stage 1 water use the final choice solved first is the water use decision conditional on the chosen source and the chosen community if the household has chosen to use the water piped into the house then household i s utility maximization problem in community j is 2 max x j w j u i j x j w j 3 subject to y x j r j h p j s s j p j m m j r j k j 4 w j w j s j k j m j q j p w which if we assume an interior solution is equivalent to the following 5 max s j k j m j u i j y r j h p j s s j p j m m j r j k j w s j k j m j q j p w at this stage piped water quality is exogenous to the household the first order conditions foc evaluate as 6 s p j s u w w s u x 7 k r u w w k u x 8 m p j m u w w m u x yielding the usual solutions that prices equate to the relevant marginal utility impacts since we assume that the foc equations are continuously differentiable and that solutions exist then by the implicit function theorem the demand functions k s m will each be continuously differentiable functions of p s p m q and r we therefore have a demand functions for each household of the form s j s j r j p j s p j m q j p w k j k j r j p j s p j m q j p w m j m j r j p j s p j m q j p w the conditional demands for piped water and the composite good can be substituted into the utility function to obtain the household s conditional indirect utility 9 v i j p w u i j y p j s s j p j m m j r j k j r j h w s j k j m j p j s r j p j m q j p w in many communities the household will have access to an alternative source for water such as drilling a private well collecting water from a natural spring or purchasing water from a bottled water delivery company the cost of using the alternative will differ between communities some of the cost differences will reflect cost of accessing the alternative whether that be to transport the water or for well installation and maintenance in many cases the substitute water will require treatment an additional cost for simplicity we consider only one alternate source bottled water and assume its quality is perfect q b w 1 households will not invest in treating this water the quality of bottled water remains same in all the communities its volumetric price p j b w differs between communities with k j m j 0 the optimization problem becomes 10 max s u i j y r j h p j b w s j w s j 0 0 1 which is choosing the amount of bottled water to consume solving through the first order

0 0 p j b w 1 in a richer model one could imagine a menu of alternative water sources in each community with the menu items characterized by prices and qualities the household would then be assessing the relative cost of producing water services from all of these sources choosing that source which most cost effectively delivers the utility maximizing level of water services 3 1 2 stage 2 water source in the second decision stage households compare their optimized utility from using piped water with that they would receive using bottled water the choice that the household makes if they have chosen community j is y i j arg max y p w b w v i j y r j h θ j where the vector θ j p j b w p j p w p j m r j represents the parameters excluding the rental house price r h unique to community j and where v i j y is defined as in eqs 9 and 11 the resulting indirect utility from this community becomes v i j r j h θ j max y p w b w v i j y r j h θ j this is the utility that will be used in the community choice 3 1 3 stage 3 community choice the final decision stage is the unconditional choice of community this choice is j i arg max j 1 j v i j r h θ j and results in an indirect utility to the household of v i p h θ max j 1 j v i j r h θ j where now θ θ 1 θ j and r h r 1 h r j h for a given parameter vector θ households will seek to move to that community which provides the highest utility 3 2 sorting equilibrium the equilibrium concept for this model is inspired by residential sorting equilibria for simplicity we have abstracted away from heterogeneity in preferences or income and heterogeneity in the housing stock available in each community sorting here is based only on variation in the quality of the local public good piped water quality and on differences between communities in the price of the piped water substitute bottled water adding preference income and housing stock heterogeneity would enhance the realism of the model but not change the overall substance of our results sorting equilibria sort individuals based on their characteristics for example wealthier households will be able to offer more for housing where water quality is better on its own this effect could magnify the impact of water quality on housing prices in contrast heterogeneity in preferences for high water quality can reduce the effect as only a subset is willing to offer more to live in communities with better water quality in both cases we would expect sorting to result in communities that are more common along these dimensions than the overall population while effects like this will affect the magnitude of the relationship between water quality and housing price it will not change the direction of that effect for simplicity we therefore abstract away from this heterogeneity with identical households identical housing stock identical piped water quality bottled water quality and all prices across a community the boundary indifference condition for a sorting equilibrium holds for all residences in each community the equilibrium is as if each household is a boundary household to all communities therefore in equilibrium the utility of all households must be equal the question of interest is the form of the ordered bundles condition specifically how does the relationship between two communities where q j q k map onto the relationship between r j h r k h the conditions for a sorting equilibrium in this context is a vector of rental house prices r h such that given θ v i j r j h θ j v i k r k h θ k for all j 1 j and all i 1 n all households have identical utility and are therefore indifferent as to which community they live in consequently if the number of housing units across all the communities is equal to n then all of those housing units will be occupied reflection on the second stage choice the water source choice suggests that the ordered bundles condition on the water quality public good need not be satisfied in relation to the piped water amenity if there are two communities j and k where household source choice is y j y k b w then these are communities that do not care about the piped water quality amenity consequently for these communities there is no requirement that q j q k r j h r k h the driver for differences in utility and therefore differences in rental house prices will here be p j b w p k b w for communities where y j p w and y k b w the difference in rental house prices will be driven by the difference between r k b w s k and p j p w s j p j m m j r k j and further for communities that both use the piped water if p j p w is sufficiently small relative to p k p w then q j q k will be associated with r j h r k h there may be a subset of communities between which the ordered bundles condition holds for the single amenity piped water quality the relationship need not hold for the complementary set of communities these possibilities are illustrated using a numerical example shown graphically in fig 7 this is a consequence of the fact that piped water quality does not itself directly enter the household utility function but its influence is mediated through the household production function for water services the challenge of identifying empirically a relationship between tap water quality and rental residential property price is identifying which sets the households in a particular community belong to the next section provides a numerical example of these results 4 numerical example 39 rely on a cobb douglas specification for utility and use a numerical example to demonstrate that a sorting equilibrium exists to illustrate the household s location choice behavior we consider a strictly concave quasi linear utility function for household i who chooses community j as follows 12 u i j x j w j x j c ln w j 13 w j s j 1 q q j q 1 k j a m j 1 a b 14 y x j r j h p j s s j p j m m j r j k j where q is perfect water quality where a unit of piped water generates a unit of water services and a and b are parameters defining the influence of capital and materials on the transformation of piped water into household services and the price of the numeraire good x j is normalized to unity consistent with assumptions outline above the water services production function w j is increasing and concave in water quality material input and capital invested on in home treatment while it is linear in the quantity of water used the concavity of the utility contribution of water services ensures an interior solution to illustrate results we choose parameter values for four hypothetical communities table 1 each community has different piped water quality but the same water rates for illustration purposes our bottled water alternative is priced below tap water in two communities while bottled water is generally far more expensive per unit volume than tap water bottled water in our model is a generic alternative to piped water our example illustrates the important role that the price of this alternative plays in the households adaptation decision and through that on the observed relationship between piped water quality and housing prices the water services w can be improved to a desired level by investing capital on in home treatment or if the piped water quality is improved by the water provider the relationship between the water services generated by one unit of piped water and capital investment on in home treatment can be seen in fig 2 holding all other variables and parameters constant water services equal water quality when there is no capital and materials invested in treating the piped water the water services production function asymptotes towards perfect water quality as the investment in capital increases fig 2 highlights the fact that if there is a target level of water services that a unit of piped water is to provide then the lower the quality of that piped water the more costly it will be for the household to treat the incoming piped water to achieve that target 4 1 water use 4 1 1 piped water solving for the demand functions using the example details in eqs 12 14 yields s j c p j s k j m j a 1 a p j m r j x j y r j h p j s s j r j k j p j m m j the amount of piped water used is inversely related to the price and independent of the water services production function parameters the ratio of the capital to materials used is proportional to the inverse of the price of materials and the rental cost of capital scaled by the relative production elasticities the demand for the numeraire good is of course the residual of the expenditures on piped water treatment see the appendix for derivation of implicit functions representing the demands for capital and materials for which closed form solutions do not exist one interesting result follows from solving for the marginal impact of piped water quality on the indirect utility given the function definitions it resolves to 15 v q j p w c q k j a m j 1 a b q j p w 0 the implication of this is that the marginal indirect utility of an increase in piped water quality is increasing in the quality of that piped water this is a consequence of the diminishing marginal productivity of capital and materials in the water services production function when piped water has low quality the optimizing household that is using piped water is investing enough that the marginal value of an increase in piped water quality mediated through the water services production function is lower than it is for the household in a community with high piped water quality with the price of the numeraire normalized and a quasilinear utility the marginal utility is the willingness to pay and as such households in communities with higher piped water quality would be willing to pay more for a marginal increase in the piped water quality note that in most situations communities are not asked to pay for marginal increases in the quality of their piped water rather they are asked to support an infrastructure investment that will result in a larger step change in the piped water quality the obtained maximum utility and respective maximum water services for four communities are represented in fig 3 by solid points the slope of each line through the point is the marginal indirect utility of a change in water quality the optimized water services and indirect utility increases as piped water quality improves holding all other parameters constant panel 3 a shows the piped water quality to water services relationship where households are optimizing their investment in generating water services with the piped water the communities with good piped water quality have steep curves as a little improvement in piped water quality increases the water services by a greater amount than households with lower piped water quality panel 3 b shows the relationship between indirect utility and piped water quality the slope of the indirect utility function in each community follows from the slope of the water services function in each community in this figure community 4 has very good piped water quality and therefore little investment in treating the piped water a small increase in piped water quality both increases indirect utility through the water services and results in a relatively large release of expenditures on treating piped water that is then used to purchase more of the numeraire good the consequence of these influences is the slope of the indirect utility function the marginal indirect utility decreases as the piped water quality decreases the wtp for that marginal increase therefore also decreases with decreasing piped water quality fig 4 focuses more closely on the relationship between piped water quality and water services the zoomed panel shows that the level of water services enjoyed by the household is increasing in the piped water quality to this panel is added a line representing the level of water services that would occur with no capital or materials applied to treating the piped water q j p w w j 1 s 0 0 w j projecting horizontally from the obtained level of water services to this line allows us to identify the equivalent piped water quality that would attain the same level of water services if there was no treatment note that with the quasilinear specification household expenditure on piped water is independent of water quality or other prices and as such setting k i m i 0 does not change s if the local health authority desires that all households have access to piped water with a quality of at least q p w then only households in community 1 are failing to treat their piped water to a level of water services consistent with this target in constructing our model we are assuming that households are aware of the quality of the piped water entering their home are aware of the treatment options available and have sufficiently large incomes that they are not constrained in choosing their own optimal level of water treatment for community 1 the piped water quality is low enough that investing in treating it to the health authority desired level results in a marginal indirect utility impact of such expenditures that is lower than spending more on the numeraire good given the model assumptions it would not be optimal to require the households in community 1 to invest more in treating the incoming piped water households that face an income constraint will not be able to attain the unconstrained optimal level of water services and may therefore be below the public health authority target even if a household with sufficient means would be able to afford to treat to the target level externalities resulting from households consuming water not meeting the health authority target may also justify interventions that either require the household to treat their piped water to a particular level or to subsidize their ability to do so further if there are scale economies in water treatment such that the cost of improving the piped water quality in a community is less than the total reduced treatment cost by households in the community investing in improved treatment would be welfare improving that this may not be occurring would be a governance issue and or a reflection of heterogeneity between households not considered in this analysis exploring such extensions is left for future work 4 1 2 bottled water we assume that households have available a substitute for piped water bottled water at price p j b w we further assume that this bottled water has perfect water quality so that households will not treat it note that with perfect water quality the demand for water treatment capital and materials is zero confirming this result therefore the demand for bottled water is given by s j c p j s which is identical to the demand for piped water thus as modeled households that choose bottled water purchase the same amount of water as those that choose to use the piped water households using bottled water do not incur the costs for treating this water thus for a household to choose to use piped water when there is a substitute present the price charged for the piped water must be sufficiently below that of the bottled water to make it optimal to invest in that treatment it also implies that for any given piped water quality there will be a threshold bottled water price where bottled water prices above this threshold will lead the household to choose to use the piped water and incur expenditures to treat it the fig 5 represents the demand curve of bottled water for all the communities as expected it is downward sloping the horizontal line at p represents a threshold price that would apply to a community with a particular water quality bottled water prices below this threshold will lead households to choose bottled water while those above will lead the household to treat and use their piped water the threshold will vary from community to community 4 2 source and community the source selection consists of comparing the calculated indirect utility for each of the two sources in each community with that providing the highest utility being the source selected the household s community preference will be for that community that provides the greatest utility variation in rental prices across communities will serve to generate a sorting like equilibrium where no household can increase their utility by moving to a different community fig 6 plots the indirect utility for a household in each of the four communities for each of the two available sources as a function of the quality of the piped water since the utility received from bottled water is independent of the quality of the piped water its utility is represented by a horizontal line the position of this line is a function of the price of the bottled water with higher prices shifting down the utility generated by choosing bottled water the utility from bottled water is represented by a downward sloping line which reflects the changing utility with changing piped water quality holding all other choices by the household constant these lines are the same as in fig 3 b any particular community has only one quality of piped water and is therefore represented by the vertical line with the intersection of this vertical line with the two indirect utility lines identifying the utility corresponding to the choice given the parameters used for this example households in communities 1 and 2 receive greater utility from using bottled water for these example communities the price of bottled water falls and water quality increases moving from community 1 to community 2 however it is clear that there is ample scope to choose other prices for bottled water that will not change the choice but will change the utility in communities 3 and 4 households receive their highest utility from choosing to use and treat their piped water graphically changing the price of piped water shifts the piped water indirect utility curves vertically in the same way that it does for the bottled water this is a consequence of the independence of the quantity of water consumed and any parameters other than the price and that the demands for water treatment inputs are independent of the amount of water consumed see appendix thus it is visually clear that if the price of piped water was dropped enough in community 3 its utility could be raised to be above that a household in community 4 receives there are ranges of parameter values that will result in the same source choices across the four communities while changing the utility rankings of the communities 4 3 sorting equilibrium in this section we demonstrate finding a sorting like equilibrium where rental prices are adjusted so that no household can enhance their utility by changing communities fig 7 illustrates the adjustments to the indirect utility achieved by adjusting the rental price to find an equilibrium where no household desires to move to another community in the figure the greatest utility is earned by the household in community 1 this is the community with the lowest water quality but also with the lowest cost bottled water substitute since households in this community are choosing bottled water they earn the highest utility overall for the purpose of adjusting the rental property prices across these four communities community 1 is used as a reference for community 2 the rental price needs to be low enough to offset the reduction in utility that comes from consuming less water recall that with the current specification all households expend the same amount on water purchases therefore when the water price is higher the amount consumed and the resulting utility is lower reducing the rental price frees up funds to purchase more of the numeraire good and thereby increase utility in communities 3 and 4 households are using piped water in these communities expenditures on water are the same as in the communities choosing bottled water however they are also spending some of their income on inputs for treating the water in these communities the rental price needs to be reduced to offset both the water price effect and the water treatment cost effect so that households do not wish to move in this example community 3 has the lowest utility and therefore the largest decrease in rental price to eliminate the incentive to relocate this numerical illustration demonstrates how the household production of water services results in the ordered bundle condition of the sorting equilibrium not aligning with water quality as the relevant amenity as described in section 3 2 if we compare communities 3 and 4 we see that the rental property price is higher in community 4 which has the higher piped water quality however the highest rental price is in community 1 which has the worst piped water quality these results highlight that the appropriate amenity along which the ordered bundle condition is to hold is the household produced water services not the piped water quality even without heterogeneity in preferences endowments and household specific water services production capacities the household produced water services amenity will depend on endogenous household choices 5 discussion we have constructed a simple household production function model where households can use material capital and piped water or bottled water to produce water services that enter their utility function we use the model to show the following results 1 that the willingness to pay for marginal water quality improvements may increase with water quality 2 that averting actions by households may move the quality of the water effectively consumed by households above some desired quality target 3 that while the quality of the piped water in a community is effectively a local public good when this water is translated into utility through a household production function the ordered bundles property of a sorting equilibrium need not hold for piped water quality and 4 empirical measurement of the relationship between piped water quality and rental property prices requires information about prices for the piped water for available substitutes and any differences in costs for treating the piped water across communities we see our results linking the literature examining averting behaviors with that exploring the capitalization of amenity values into home prices the former has seen extensive application to drinking water quality typically the amount households spend to avert the impacts of consuming their piped water supply is measured either in response to an event impacting that quality more typical of developed nation studies or of consistently poor water quality or delivery quality the households location is taken as fixed the amenity capitalization literature examines the impact of an dis amenity on the market price for houses that have access to that dis amenity parks schools shopping destinations airports etc have been valued based on the assumption that households bid based on the value generated received from the amenity the amenity is typically not a function of household choices in the model we develop households choose their averting behavior conditional on the community they live in while being able to choose their community knowing the averting behavior they will undertake as a consequence of that choice it is the availability of options to avert the impacts of poor piped water quality that bounds the extent to which differences in piped water quality across communities will be capitalized into housing prices the model has been solved for a sorting like equilibrium with households modeled as identical there is no preference heterogeneity to support the households sorting into communities where they have higher utility in the community they occupy than in any other effectively all households are boundary households of all communities our interest lies with the ordered bundles condition where in a sorting equilibrium we expect to see residential property rental prices ordered in proportion to the level of community amenities that households derive utility from our results suggest that some composite amenity or multidimensional bundle involving substitute sources and piped water quality adjusted to reflect relative costs related to these alternatives may have the desired relationship with rental property prices it will not be the case for piped water quality on its own note that this result may also be true for other amenities noise air pollution etc where households have averting options available the cost of these options and their effectiveness will bound the extent to which these amenities impact house prices this modeling exercise was undertaken to provide insight into what the relationship between housing prices and piped water quality might look like we expect that much of the economic benefit of improvements in piped water quality will be capitalized into housing prices and as our results show this capitalization may be quite small if averting behaviors are not too costly empirically we suggest that following the school quality capitalization work provides the most obvious strategy for identifying a water quality effect 85 88 like school catchment areas water providers service clearly defined geographic areas residents can choose an alternative source but cannot connect to an alternative water provider we are presently collecting data to enable such an empirical investigation given that the cost of adaptation options may be small relative to the other costs associated with changing homes it is entirely possible that buyers do not consider piped water quality at time of purchase simply accepting that they will deal with whatever the quality of the water piped into their home is we have abstracted away from the time scale differences between house purchase and water treatment decisions by considering the rental price for housing we have also included both materials and capital as water treatment inputs but not considered the decision to invest in treatment capital separately from deciding the intensity of use of this capital adding this complexity would not change the results of our analysis for a steady state however these dynamic effects would play out if investments are made in upgrading a community treatment system and affect the decision to support or not an increase in the water toll to pay for such an upgrade i e owners who have recently invested in an expensive water treatment system in their home may not support an upgrade if there is no effective secondary market for their treatment system transactions costs would also play an important role in the adjustment of home prices between communities in response to a change in water quality or in the price and or availability of a substitute source as for more complex heterogeneity exploring these dynamic effects is left for future work adding income and preference heterogeneity over the population that is sorting will not change the substance of our result it will add complexity and will affect the magnitude of the relationship between housing prices and piped water quality communities in reality are mixed with some households having strong preferences for bottled water and some households having income constraints preventing them from investing in treating their piped water likewise housing stocks across communities are heterogeneous and this too would be a factor in how households actually sort while we do not expect adding this complexity to change the substance of our results the existence of this complexity further highlights how challenging it will be to identify a relationship between housing prices and piped water quality our analysis takes a marginal perspective and discusses changes in piped water quality at the margin in reality water treatment systems both those used in the home and those used to centrally treat water before it enters the distribution system are discrete technological packages investment in water treatment will therefore involve step wise changes in water quality and the more realistic question is whether the total benefits from a step change justifies the cost for the household what is the gain in switching from a container filter to a reverse osmosis system to a whole home treatment system these cannot be installed as fractional systems likewise for central treatment where one has or does not have a filtration system does or does not have chlorination etc while our results are not directly applicable to step wise investments what they do highlight is the challenge in determining what the benefit of investing in centralized treatment upgrades is for communities that have low cost substitutes for their piped water a substantial improvement in piped water quality may generate little benefit to the members of the community prioritizing support for system upgrades grants etc for those communities with the worst piped water quality may not be the best investment those communities may have the worse quality piped water in part because nobody is using the water and quite content not to use it it also suggests that the most cost effective solution to low quality piped water may be providing an affordable substitute this would of course be particularly true for communities with high numbers of seasonal residents where the net benefit to a seasonal resident of improving piped water quality may only be enjoyed for a short vacation period while the costs of the upgrade must be paid continually 89 90 although data is difficult to find there is a wide perception that seasonal residents make up a large share of the home owners in a number of rural communities in british columbia 91 we have assumed that households are fully informed about the quality of the piped water and about the treatment options available households typically do not know how to use the water quality information that is collected they are more likely to notice aesthetic factors appearance odor taste than contaminants that may have substantial health impacts but are not easy to sense 92 93 they may rely on public health notices but in some cases may even reject those if it does not conform with their own perception effective information sharing and education to help households make use of this information would be necessary if private averting activities are to make up an important part of ensuring that people are not unnecessarily exposed to the risks of low quality piped water we have treated the substitute for piped water bottled water as having perfect quality while most people do not treat bottled water they purchase alternative sources such as private wells or surface sources are used by many households there are more than 24 000 current private domestic surface water licenses in british columbia 94 registration of new domestic wells was not required until 2016 and owners of existing wells at that date were not required to register that there are over 8 000 registered wells for private domestic use in this limited database suggests actual well numbers are much greater possibly greater than domestic surface license numbers 95 these private sources may not be of a quality that the local health authority considers potable households that are aware of this would in the context of the model treat this water from the alternate source testing of water quality is required for drinking water systems supplying two or more households when a system is supplying a single household testing is not required and the cost of doing so falls on the household many households using such sources do not routinely test their tap water and many are not equipped to interpret the results and or may not be in a position financially to pay for additional treatment if there is a need to do so we have also assumed that households have sufficient income to choose their optimal level of piped water treatment or to afford to purchase their optimal amount of the substitute our example household that does not protect itself to the desired standard is optimizing and would not be made better off by being required to treat more the only reason to force or assist further treatment in this case is the presence of externalities or coordination problems that are preventing the efficient outcome however households who are income constrained may not be able to protect themselves remote communities where alternatives like bottled water are very costly and households have low income and limited capacity to know how to manage the health risks in their piped water are the most vulnerable 96 where households of different income engage in the same in home treatment the share of income spent on averting activities will be higher for lower income households 97 we have not considered either externalities or governance in this investigation public health related externalities may be an important consideration if infections originating in one community with poor piped water quality can be easily vectored to other communities governance issues coordination problems within communities that prevent collective investment in water treatment when it is efficient to do so may be important both of these themes are left to further work 6 conclusions households supplied by small drinking water utilities are relatively more likely to face drinking water quality advisories such communities often struggle to self finance system improvements using a household production approach and solving for a sorting like equilibrium we show that the capitalized benefit of system upgrades will depend on the household cost of treating the piped water the availability of substitutes and the opportunity to move away it may be rational for community members to prefer their current system to achieving a target standard that has little bearing on their utility the equilibrium relies on adjusting housing prices so that households cannot increase their utility by moving within the context of this model it is demonstrated that the relationship between housing prices and piped water quality will be impacted by costs associated with averting behaviors related to using the piped water and the availability and costs of substitute water sources the cost and effectiveness of averting behaviors to deal with piped water quality challenges bounds the capitalization that may be detected in hedonic regressions accounting for the availability of averting options is important both for assessing the value of piped water quality and by analogy to other amenities where households endogenously manage how they are impacted by that amenity in our model households are fully informed about their piped water quality treatment options available and their cost and costs and availability of substitutes and have sufficient income to choose their optimal source and optimal amount of treatment given their source choice one important role for health authorities is to help overcome any information acquisition and utilization challenges they face so that they are in a position to make their private optimal choice externalities and coordination challenges may result in the collection of private optimal choices in a community not maximizing aggregate welfare assisting communities with overcoming coordination challenges facilitation education etc can be another important role for a health authority that could increase aggregate welfare externalities and concerns about the vulnerability of those with low income and or living in remote communities may justify public expenditures to assist some communities with upgrades to their community water systems credit authorship contribution

8641,by combining information on nutrient output from the soil water assessment tool swat and secondary data on local profits from different crop types we devise a profit maximization problem subject to dynamic water quality constraints which become gradually more restrictive over time the solution aims to detect the optimal allocation of land parcels by crop type that maximizes the total net present value of landowner profits throughout the watershed over a nine year time span our model construct is applied to the little river experimental watershed lrew in south georgia water quality constraints involve the landowner adhering to specific permittable limits on numeric nutrient criteria recorded at the watershed outlet under various scenarios including i no3 n constraints ii total phosphorus p constraints and iii concurrent no3 n and p constraints in the most extreme case a reduction in aggregate profits of 24 1 million and 8 1 million was observed for combined no3 n and p constraints relative to commensurate solo constraints on no3 n and p respectively the designing watersheds for integrated development dwid model could support policymaking for ascertaining trade offs

landowners numeric nutrient criteria watershed management data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction long term exposure to chemicals in the water supply are associated with a range of acute and long term chronic illnesses 1 2 nitrate overconsumption for example can cause adverse effects on the health of children e g neurodevelopment and babies e g methemoglobinemia or baby blue syndrome 3 contaminated streams also harm the surrounding aquatic ecosystem life for instance excessive phosphorus concentrations cause increased occurrences of algal blooms which deplete the water body of oxygen and can in turn potentially wreak havoc on freshwater animal communities 4 however unlike point sources such as sewage treatment plants and factories the vagueness behind non point source nps water pollution makes it difficult to manage it is the diffuse nature of contaminants often originating from fertilizer application at the surface to eventual discharge into surface and ground waters that result in contaminants being picked up by water flow over extensive areas of land nps pollution itself results from both leaching to groundwater as well as land runoff to surface waters thus the land use within a watershed can have a substantial effect on the water chemistry commonly interpreted as quality indicators of a river network forestlands for example are generally linked to better conditions in water quality health downstream 5 8 conversely positive associations between certain land uses namely modern industrial agriculture and degraded water quality have also been well documented 9 12 identifying individual land parcels linked to elevated pollution levels downstream however remains challenging indeed two interrelated themes that consistently emerge in the environmental and natural resources management literature are land allocation and water quality research concerning land allocation and water quality must also be examined in the context of specific numeric nutrient criteria guidelines the national primary drinking water standards npdws which apply to public water systems set the maximum contaminant level mcl for no3 n at 10 mg l for rivers and streams the epa s recommended total nitrogen criteria range from 0 12 to 2 18 mg l and from 0 01 to 0 08 mg l for total p across each of the nation s distinct 14 eco regions 70 while no explicit mcl associated with p currently exists the epa recommends total phosphorus concentration as phosphorus not exceeding 0 10 mg l in streams not discharging directly into reservoirs and not exceeding 0 05 mg l in streams discharging directly into reservoirs 13 such low concentrations make p monitoring particularly challenging in addition to mcl s section 303 d of the clean water act requires states to submit a list of all waters that are not supporting their designated uses and need to have a total maximum daily load tmdl developed although environmental laws designed to protect water resources largely exclude regular ongoing farming silvicultural and ranching activities several federal and state policies still apply to farmers and forest landowners activities associated with converting timberland to agricultural crop production for example are not exempt from environmental regulations in georgia water quality standards are based in part on numeric nutrient criteria nutrient criteria are established using eco regions level iii and iv which provide a spatial basis for criteria

specific landowners and the landowner fails to take remedial measures incidents are referred to the gepd for enforcement future policies must draft potential water quality regulations consistent with the usepa s method for deriving ambient water quality criteria for the protection of human health the usepa peer reviewed technical guidance for developing additional numeric nutrient criteria for rivers and streams suggests the use of predictive relationships by applying empirical and mechanistic models 15 here we apply an empirical economic model to a small watershed in south georgia we examine the interaction among competing environmental and financial pursuits on land use allocation and how they are likely to change over time our work contributes to water resource management literature in at least two aspects first we hope our relatively straightforward approach may provide indications to policymakers on where certain measures can be more effective in reducing non point sources of nutrient runoff at the watershed outlet second by ascertaining the prospect of likely land cover patterns across our considered watershed we draw on conclusions reached in this study to better identify trade offs in the context of future watershed quality programs although our analysis centers around the landowner and their combined profits we note the practical infeasibility stemming from the landowner s understandable lack of clarity in interpreting water quality improvements downstream i e watershed outlet and thus perhaps their inability to implement suggested alternative crops on their land rather our approach would seem to give more indications to policymakers as opposed to landowners before elaborating on our approach further it is necessary to consider the context of the methods we have used previous research in lrew has examined the application of the swat model with different periods and approaches 16 19 yet the relationship between water quality and land cover is intricate and requires monitoring of water bodies and land management best management practices bmps for instance have been proven to reduce nutrient loadings from agricultural areas in the case of filtration systems or vegetated systems i e biofilters the goal is to capture a portion of received runoff and in the process channel it into the soil the pollutants in that portion are thereby effectively prevented from penetrating the local river network with advances in computing power evolutionary computation and mathematical programming techniques such as genetic algorithms gas have been increasingly used in determining the optimal placement of bmps to attain water quality targets at watershed scales 20 22 in another study shoemaker et al 23 employed mixed integer linear programming alongside evolutionary computations i e scatter search and genetic algorithms to jointly determine the optimal location type and cost of stormwater bmps needed to meet water quality goals in urban watersheds genetic algorithms however can be time intensive in comparison to classical optimization solvers and require a rather intricate grasp of elaborate parameters e g crossover mutation rate fitness function limbrunner et al 24 demonstrate a linear programming algorithm analog to a nonlinear optimization model that efficiently reproduced much of the same solution structure when optimizing the watershed scale placement of bmps classical optimization techniques typically take the form of minimizing costs subject to certain pollutant load criteria 22 25 26 or in the alternative maximizing water quality under cost constraints 21 24 27 28 multi objective optimization whereby the researcher simultaneously solves multiple objective functions 20 29 has also been utilized in managing water resource problems additionally uncertainties linked to a specific parameter have been modeled using stochastic programming 27 28 30 for example jia culver 28 developed a robust optimization model that sought to minimize pollutant load reductions given various levels of reliability with respect to water quality standards in a virginia watershed likewise zhou et al 30 considered a small hypothetical watershed for which costs associated with pollutant removal were minimized subject to chance constraints describing pollutant removal efficiency the focus of our study concerns a group of private landowners in a georgia watershed who face the task of allocating land for a given set of crops over a multi period planning horizon the influences of a range of hypothetical government policies limiting specific water quality parameters on land use decisions by the landowner and its subsequent impact on land cover evolution are considered we seek to maximize aggregate landowner net profit subject to prescribed limits on water quality indicators downstream selected scenarios allow gradual reductions in permissible nutrient concentration recorded at the watershed outlet three distinct watershed mandates are considered 1 tightened restrictions in permissible no3 n concentration 2 tightened restrictions in permissible p concentration and 3 tightened restrictions in both no3 n and p concentration trade offs between environmental and economic interests are evaluated through measures of marginal changes in aggregate landowner net profit because of having to meet increasingly higher water quality criteria by attaining a better understanding of landowner behavior through the perceived trade offs between profit and environment we hope to contribute to the design of prospective environmental programs to promote improved water quality while prior work has also investigated programs of land allocation which rely on swat and optimization procedures see ref 31 our study is of relevance because of the increasing need for studies that offer guidance on farm practices or configurations to decrease the environmental deterioration of water bodies we first describe the study area the methodological framework follows outlining the assumptions and inputs that feed our modeling technique highlighted results are presented for the linear programming problem under various scenarios defining different water quality mandates the manuscript concludes with a discussion of the findings with an emphasis on policy recommendations and potential avenues for future research 2 characteristics of watershed this study was conducted on the 334 km2 lrew located in the headwaters area of the suwannee river in the coastal plain physiographic province basin near tifton ga fig 1 the watershed overlays three counties turner tift and worth in the state broad valleys supporting wide stream networks are typical of the local geography the elevation of the watershed generally increases from south to north with the highest elevations occurring in the northwest corner underlain by the coastal plain aquifer the lrew consists primarily of low gradient streams surrounded by higher gradient streams most of the soil classifies as a tifton loamy sand followed by alapaha loamy sand with a high infiltration rate 32 streamflow and water quality of the lrew have been monitored by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars since 1967 no permitted point source discharges exist in the watershed 18 climate is categorized as humid subtropical with a long growing season 33 average annual precipitation and temperature are 1208 mm and 19 1 c respectively streamflow is likely attributable to 30 of annual rainfall mainly composed of return flow from the local shallow aquifer and to a lesser extent direct surface runoff 34 although the lrew is agricultural dominated forests still occupy the landscape in a significant manner watershed land characteristics based on the 2004 national land cover database nlcd is approximately defined as 51 row crops primarily peanut corn and cotton 16 evergreen forest 2 deciduous forest and 1 hay other notable categories include woody wetland 22 which largely occurs on the borders of the stream network and urban space 6 mostly confined to a small northeast corner of the watershed 3 methodology 3 1 synopsis the swat model is initially calibrated and validated over a nine year time frame 1997 to 2005 to simulate no3 n loadings p loadings and surface runoff at the watershed outlet calibrating for crop related parameters which control plant growth produced average crop yields at the hru level in the end annual data on crop profits nutrient loadings and surface runoff feed a dynamic linear optimization program that maximizes landowner profits subject to specific water quality constraints fig 2 provides for a concise flowchart illustrating the steps involved 3 2 swat model 3 2 1 overview the swat model is a process based and semi distributed continuous time step model that can simulate hydrology crop growth nutrients and sediment loads 35 swat is one of the most broadly applied large scale watershed simulation models in total maximum daily load tmdl analyses and water resource planning its applications have included predicting the impact of land management practices on nutrient yields from agricultural land use in large complex watersheds with varying soils land use and management conditions over long periods 36 37 we used arcswat 2012 interface to set up the model using the 30 m digital elevation model dem soil survey spatial tabular ssurgo 2 2 soils data national land cover dataset nlcd and national agricultural statistics services nass land use data precipitation temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind data were obtained from global weather data for swat https globalweather tamu edu table 1 we followed liew et al 19 and chose the hargreaves method 38 for estimating potential evapotranspiration pet using topographic information the swat model divided the watershed into 198 sub basins subsequently each subbasin was divided into hydrologic response units hrus with unique combinations of land use soil and slope 39 three slope classes were used for hru classification 0 5 5 10 and above 10 the threshold of 20 10 and 5 for soil land use and the slope was applied to reduce the number of hrus total 1272 across 198 sub basins we obtained an estimate of management operations

and https www caes uga edu extension outreach html and usda nass 1997 https www nass usda gov publications national crop progress a three year peanut corn cotton rotation was applied in the model for all the peanut corn and cotton fields amounts of 134 and 65 kg n ha in the form of elemental nitrogen fertilizer were applied in corn and cotton fields respectively the amount of 50 kg p ha of phosphorus fertilizer as p2o5 was applied in both corn and cotton fields for hay land use urea 200 kg ha with two applications in may and june and elemental p 60 kg ha were applied we used harvest only operation in swat that occurred twice a year a baseflow separation technique 40 was used to initialize the value of the baseflow recession constant alpha bf we made relative adjustments of alpha bf during the model calibration 3 2 2 calibration validation the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi version 2 in the swat calibration and uncertainty programs platform 41 42 was used to calibrate and validate the model for streamflow nutrients nitrate nitrogen and total phosphorus and sediment at daily time step at the outlet of lrew the sufi 2 combines optimization with uncertainty analysis uncertainties in the parameters result in model output uncertainties quantified as the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu band between the 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution of an output variable using latin hypercube sampling 42 the observed data from the usda ars gauging station at the main watershed outlet ftp www tiftonars org database between 1997 and 2005 were used with a four year model initialization 1993 1996 followed by a five year calibration 1997 2001 and two years model validation 2002 2003 to evaluate the model performance we used two quantitative error statistics kling gupta efficiency kge 43 and the percent bias pbias the kge contains three components correlation r the ratio between the mean of the simulated values and the mean of the observed ones μ s μ o and variability ratio σ s σ o between the simulated s and observed o variable μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the variable respectively 1 k g e 1 r 1 2 μ s μ o 1 2 σ s σ o 1 2 kge ranges from to 1 with a value closer to 1 representing a relatively accurate model kge overcomes the disadvantage of nash sutcliffe efficiency 44 in underestimating peak flow prediction 43 pbias measures the average tendency of the predicted data to be larger or smaller than observed values it also measures over and underestimation of bias 45 2 p b i a s i 1 n o i s i 1 n o i 100 the optimum value for pbias is 0 where values close to zero indicate better model prediction and overestimation is signified by pbias 0 and underestimation indicates when pbias 0 46 calibration and validation of the model were conducted as one at a time calibration in addition to parameters we incorporate biophysical parameters for major crops in the lrew in our calibration process parameters controlling nutrients and sediment loads were indicated through a literature review 42 49 parameters controlling streamflow and plant growth were calibrated first followed by sediment and phosphorus and then nitrate nitrogen parameters we used average annual usda nass crop yield observed data except for forest classes after the streamflow was calibrated crop parameters were adjusted to simulate crop yields refer to table s1 in si average modeled yields for each crop were subsequently compared across the lrew with published yields for tift county retrieved from the university of georgia 56 3 3 nutrient load assignment 3 3 1 contribution modeling to account for n and p loss and transformations at each subbasin we used an approach that assesses nutrient load contributions from each subbasin over simulation periods at the watershed outlet see refs 50 52 therefore after calibrating and validating the swat model we defined a virtual rain gauge for each sub basin in the watershed the rain gauge was then switched off in successive series to find the contribution percentage of nutrient loads remaining at the watershed outlet from each sub basin the software r v 4 0 2 with extension package swatplusr 53 was employed as a part of this analysis by interacting with our swat project to help execute efficient simulation runs across all sub basins for both no3 n and p swat computes contribution percentages using a routing scheme based on the channel network that connects the outlets of sub basins to the watershed s primary outlet the exact nutrient loading to be routed for a given sub basin i was estimated accordingly we refer to this estimated amount as an adjusted nutrient loading per sub basin written as 3 b i b i a i 1 2 198 where b adjusted nutrient loading was calculated as the product of original nutrient loading amount b and nutrient loading contribution percentage a 3 3 2 land use assumptions adjusted nutrient loadings calculated at the sub basin level were further broken down by land use the model framework considers six land uses bermuda hay corn cotton peanut and forest classified as softwood and hardwood the default swat setup was used for forest management which assumes no fertilization no thinning and a maturity of 10 and 30 years for deciduous and evergreen forests respectively an additional land use category extra which is meant to capture barren land is also included crop type in our analysis is therefore composed of a total of seven classes nutrient loadings for each crop in each subbasin were calculated as the weighted average of loadings weighted by swat reported crop yields at the hru level as an initial step daily no3 n and p loadings corresponding to each hru by crop type for each year were obtained from calibrated swat output values were summed over days to arrive at annual values corresponding to each hru computing the average across all years and hru for each crop then served as the basis for constructing relative weights among crop type the created crop coefficients were subsequently multiplied by the adjusted nutrient load recorded at each sub basin i to derive specific nutrient allocation by crop type land classified as extra was assumed to produce zero nutrient loadings an analogous procedure applies to the surface runoff calculations also projected at the crop level 3 4 economic modeling adopting present value pv considerations landowner profit was discounted back to the initial period using the notation below π and π reflect respective average annual profits and pv of average annual profits 4 π t p t y t w t t 0 1 2 8 5 π t π t 1 r t where p is the annual crop price assessed in kg y is annual crop yield produced from swat output measured in kg ha and w is annual crop cost reported in ha the time is denoted by t where 0 is synonymous with the year 1997 the discount rate is captured by r set at an interest rate of 4 1 2 2 the discount rate as applied here was calculated based on the average federal funds rate during the time period 1997 to 2005 plus a spread of 50 basis points similar to nutrient loading assignments zero profits were assumed for land designated as extra a depiction of relative comparisons in profit amounts by the crop is presented in fig 3 annual price data for agricultural crops were acquired through usda nass 54 prices for forest crops softwood and hardwood were calculated using historical stumpage values sourced from timbermart south 55 average annual costs were estimated by referencing historically expected cost budgets for non irrigated land in the study area 56 hardwood and softwood forest costs were calculated as the sum of average annual costs consisting of fertilizer and herbicide application machine planting mechanical site preparation and prescribed burning 57 cost budgets as described were assumed constant across years in eq 5 replacing π with c meant to capture estimated conversion costs associated with switching from one land use class to another yields an analogous left hand side lhs value c t or the pv of incurred conversion costs for a particular year these necessary conversion costs are considered when our analysis is extended to the profit maximization problem described in the following section in this way land moving between aggregate land use classes agriculture and forestland becomes dependent on relative returns a major component in land preparation from forest to agriculture is clearing the land of stumps based on consultation with field experts academia and industry it was estimated that excavator services required to pull and pile stumps post clear cut would charge at a minimum the equivalent pv of 4942 ha for pine and 6177 ha in the case of hardwoods costs associated with having to convert bermuda to another crop potentially were also derived estimates were based on incurred costs for prepping the land with necessary fertilizer and herbicide application our average watershed corn yield of 7841 kg ha would require approximately 134 kg n ha suggesting a cost of 168 03 ha in addition the herbicide glyphosate is effective at killing green weeds assuming a common recommended application of 3 36 kg ha of herbicide further costs were calculated at 3 30 kg or 11 09 ha hence conversion costs from the bermuda crop were set equal to the pv of a total future outflow value 179 12 ha 3 5 dynamic linear optimization table 1 presents a comprehensive list of the inputs feeding the dynamic optimization model as well as input parameters for the preceding swat runs table 2 provides short descriptions of the primary notation used in our optimization model our profit maximization problem spans the following dimensions old crop type new crop type sub basin and year captured in respective j j i and t subscripts the dynamic optimization framework seeks to maximize aggregate landowner profit subject to constraints on land use and downstream water quality the sum of individual landowner net profit is interpreted as a measure of social welfare in the lrw we presume that because changes to consumer surplus would be minimized if crops were traded in the market total economic surplus becomes a function of producer surplus and thus may be roughly captured through a representation of producer surplus i e aggregate watershed profit the model was solved in ms excel with what sbest v 16 0 58 solver to find an efficient solution to the optimization problem the objective function solves for the annual land allocation l for each of 198 sub basins that result in maximum net profit z across the watershed over the nine years 1997 to 2005 3 3 using sub basins as the unit for land use configuration in this manner as opposed to finer scales such as hydrological response units hrus may result in improved optimizing efficiency by decreasing the search space of spatial optimization 59 mathematically the profit maximization problem with land area a constraints is expressed as follows 6 max z j i t π j i t x j i t j i t j c j i t j x j i t j subject to land use restrictions 7 j x j i t j x j i t j i t 8 x j i t l j i t j i t 9 j l j i t a i t i t 10 j l j i t j x j i t 1 j j j x j i t 1 j j j j j x j i t 1 j i t j e x t r a where x and x are decision variables referring to hectares harvested and hectares converted respectively at each time step and sub basin the sum of converted hectares to all crops from each crop must not exceed crop hectares harvested 7 the second constraint eq 8 ensures the annual harvested crop area was less than or equal to allocated land for a given particular sub basin continuing from this eq 9 confirms the sum among allocated crop area for each sub basin and year is equal to the physical area of each subbasin and trivially at each period our model works to project the hypothetical evolution of land cover across the lrew through several years the basis of which is the initial year of land allocation land classed as extra was set constant to initial year land composition in 1997 for remaining crops eq 10 shows how the land allocation was deduced as a function of the decision variable optimal hectares harvested x that is for a given sub basin allocated annual cropland was set equal to the allocated annual cropland in the previous year plus the sum of annual converted hectares from all old crops to each new crop minus total annual converted hectares to all new crops from each old crop the water quality constraint sets the level of restriction on nutrient concentration for each year in the study period 11 j i b j i t s j i t x j i t d t γ t where the lhs in the above captures the measured nutrient concentration in the watershed each year here the notation b follows from eq 3 and s stands for surface runoff load originally measured in kg ha was converted to mg ha likewise surface flows were converted from mm to l transforming units in this manner produce units in mg l consistent with the theoretical nutrient limit denoted by d the superscript γ references nutrient type i e no3 n or p in the initial year our water quality limit was set equal to the total annual concentration as derived on the right hand side rhs of 11 in subsequent years d t follows a linear percentage reduction from the preceding year 12a d t γ j i b j i t s j i t x j i t f o r t 0 12b d t γ d t 1 γ 1 q f o r t 0 where q is the nutrient percent limit reduction although the formal policy may be unlikely to consist of successive reductions to set concentration limits per succeeding year the conjecture allows a useful perspective in visualizing the impact of increasing water quality restrictions on changes in land cover the ending limits applied in respective models for no3 n and p were based on the maximum percentage reduction permitted before the solver renders the solution infeasible more precisely prescribed nutrient limit percentage declines were construed by simply a determining the smallest percentage reduction that first triggers a marginal change in maximized aggregate profit b determining the smallest percentage reduction that first triggers the optimization model infeasible and c composing a series of six equally spaced intervals between the two percentages as defined in preceding steps a and b thus the imposed limit in our model is primarily a function of the computed aggregate nutrient concentration the application of our model in a different setting i e watershed would derive limits directly dependent on the total size in the area nutrient loadings and surface flows considered our analysis begins with a base scenario where no reductions to the maximum concentration limit are implemented relative to this scenario our optimization problem assumes annual percentage declines in the concentration limit for subsequent years we consider gradual tightening of no3 n limits p limits as well as concurrent no3 n and p constraints we identify the minimum feasible limit on the right hand side rhs of our water quality constraints for each case similarly we make a note of the minimum percentage decline in our rhs water quality limit to trigger a profit decline relative to the base scenario in total 21 scenarios as well as a base scenario are evaluated the scenarios presented in table 3 can be interpreted as hypothetical restrictions from our base scenario mandating a percentage reduction in nutrient concentration as measured at the watershed outlet included are seven changes in no3 n limit 48 n1 52 n2 56 n3 60 n4 64 n5 68 n6 72 n7 seven changes in p limit 14 75 p1 15 25 p2 15 75 p3 16 25 p4 16 75 p5 17 25 p6 17 75 p7 and seven simultaneous changes in respective no3 n and p limits 48 14 75 np1 49 16 15 08 np2 50 33 15 42 np3 51 50 15 75 np4 52 66 16 08 np5 53 82 16 42 np6 54 99 16 75 np7 therefore n1 to n7 as well as p1 to p7 and np1 to np7 refer to completely different scenarios differentiated by the percentage reduction from base each solved for the entire period of the model 4 results 4 1 swat calibration and validation the calibration process for the lrew started with 36 hydrologic and biophysical parameters after 1000 simulations the most sensitive flow and biophysical parameters were identified and are listed in table 4 in order of decreasing sensitivity the most sensitive parameters were effective hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium in the main channel ch k2 rte groundwater delay time gw delay gw the fraction of growing season when leaf area begins to decline dlai plant dat runoff curve number 2 cn2 mgt and available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc sol parameter values should be considered after calibration to avoid unrealistic simulations for instance the fitted values for sol awc in the swat model for crops and forest soil ranged from 0 06 to 0 07 which was comparable to the measured weighted average sol awc of 0 057 for the tifton soil series by hubbard 60 cn2 for the main crops and forest evergreen and deciduous were reduced by 12 resulted in a better adjustment to streamflow predictions the model fit was deemed satisfactory for streamflow calibration and validation with a daily kge of 0 80 and 0 71 and pbias of 2 5 and 3 8 respectively fig s1 the observed streamflow the model best fit and the 95 ppu band for calibration and validation periods are shown in fig s2 after the model was calibrated for hydrology and biophysical parameters the narrow ranges for selected parameter values were fixed and the model was calibrated for sediment load at the watershed outlet using 14 parameters following calibration of sediment load total phosphorus p and nitrate nitrogen no3 n loads were calibrated table 5 the most sensitive parameters for sediment load were the exponent parameter for calculating sediment reentrained in channel sediment routing spexp bsn a linear parameter for calculating the maximum amount of sediment that can be reentrained during channel sediment routing spcon bsn and the cover factor for the effect of land cover on erosion usle c plant the spexp and spcon are parameters used to calculate the maximum amount of sediment that can be transported from a reach the fitted value for spexp and spcon in our model was 1 210 and 0 001 respectively the daily kge was 0 43 and 0 57 for the calibration and validation period respectively with pbias of 2 5 for the calibration period and 0 2 for the validation periods table 5 the most sensitive p parameters were residue decomposition coefficient rsdco bsn phosphorus enrichment ratio for loading with sediment erorgp hru and the cover factor for the effect of land cover on erosion usle c plant table 4 the fitted value for rsdco and erorgp was 0 07 and 2 58 respectively the daily kge for p load was 0 63 with pbias of 0 4 for the calibration period and kge of 0 35 with pbias of 2 8 for the validation period the model performance for daily p at the watershed outlet evaluated as satisfactory with daily kge 0 35 and pbias 30 the lower kge for the validation period was expected because the observation data for p loads were sparse for that period compared with daily observations for streamflow the most sensitive n parameter was denitrification threshold water content sdnco bsn table 4 the daily kge for no3 n load was 0 50 with pbias of 7 9 for the calibration period and the kge of 0 46 with pbias of 19 for the validation period the model performance for daily no3 n load at the watershed outlet was considered satisfactory with daily kge 0 35 and pbias 30 4 2 nutrient contribution upon calibration and validation in swat nutrient loadings linked to a given hru for each day for each year were summed across days to arrive at annual values before averaging across all years for each hru a comparison of nutrient loadings by crop type is presented in fig s3 using a log scale boxplots in panel 5a reveal the highest no3 n loadings observed for bermuda crop averaging 0 622 kg ha per year the second highest was corn averaging 0 014 kg ha per year followed by cotton 0 001 kg ha per year and peanut 0 00018 kg ha per year no3 n loadings were even lower for forest with hardwood averaging 0 00012 kg ha per year and softwood associated with an average annual no3 n load of virtually zero similarly average annual p loadings in panel 5b were lowest for forest here softwood was associated with slightly higher loads estimated at 0 023 kg ha per year compared with 0 021 kg ha per year for hardwoods bermuda again was reflective of the highest nutrient load out of the six crops at 0 396 kg ha per year like bermuda cotton shows a fairly large number of outliers in the upper fence averaging 0 252 kg ha per year peanut and corn trail behind with estimated average annual loads of 0 081 and 0 072 kg ha respectively when we account for and subsequently incorporate a measure of nutrient decay based on the downstream travel time of a nutrient loads were reduced significantly while p loss mainly occurred through sedimentation for no3 n the primary process behind decay is denitrification a graphical interpretation is offered in figs 4 and 5 which show for all years how adjusted no3 n and p loads compare across individual sub basins respectively more precisely the values mapped in both figures may be referred to as b i t continuing with notation from above the adjusted nutrient load for each sub basin at each time step amounts derived for sub basins located in the southern part of the watershed generally correlated with higher loads because our model transforms calculated load amounts into concentration estimates before analysis for added perspective comparable amounts of surface runoff are presented for each sub basin throughout the years in fig 6 compared to nutrient content runoff amounts emerge as evenly distributed throughout the watershed for any given year 4 3 crop yield calibration calibrated versus observed values for all crop types are reported in fig s4 for corn cotton and peanut respective relative percentage differentials from calibrated to observed were 5 99 13 76 and 8 13 likewise calibrated yields for bermuda differed by 3 66 on average across the eight years compared to observed values meanwhile calibrated yields for both forest types were slightly higher compared to observed yields across the eight year study period on average for both hardwood and softwood at 2 84 and 1 39 respectively 4 4 optimization we multiplied the lhs by a factor of a million in eq 11 to produce nutrient concentration amounts in mg l as shown in table 6 the initial year records comparatively high concentrations for both no3 n and p amounts reach a high of 0 0319 mg l and a low of 0 0001 for no3 n compared with a maximum 0 1029 p mg l and minimum 0 0215 p mg l measures of aggregate landowner welfare for each of the scenarios listed in table 3 are presented in fig 7 in the base scenario maximum aggregate profits for the watershed reach 162 1 million water quality limits on no3 n concentration and p concentration were estimated at 0 0319 mg l and 0 1029 mg l for all years respectively examined in fig 7 a are changes in welfare from tighter no3 n constraints while p constraints are held constant at 1997 levels for all years not surprisingly as yearly constraints defining the maximum concentration of no3 n become gradually more restrictive or alternatively as percentage reductions to the rhs gradually increase aggregate profits decline the waning profits appear to decrease at an increasing rate given a linear percentage decline in water quality limits indeed n1 or the first decline of 48 has a marginal effect on profit levels dropping roughly 1 9 million from base in the most extreme scenario n7 a 72 decline in the maximum allowable limit each successive year from 1997 yields 102 6 million equivalent to an approximate 59 5 million in cumulative loss from base b illustrates the decline in profits from successively tighter p constraints holding no3 n constraints constant contrasted with fig 7 a aside from the significantly greater plunge in profits occurring from base to p1 14 75 the remaining downward trend in profits also takes general concave form albeit on a different scale profit under the p1 scenario equates to 1411 million a nearly 20 9 million drop from base when the percentage decline was increased to p7 17 75 aggregate watershed profit was reduced to 128 8 million fig 7 c assumes concurrent changes in no3 n and p constraints relative to our base scenario profit follows a similar path to the general shape presented in fig 7 b characterized by a relatively large initial dip for the combined case profit reaches a low of 125 8 million in the np7 scenario to understand the exact land use transformations driving deteriorated profits we refer to fig 10 which expose the majority land use class at the sub basin level based on cumulative acreage over the years for all scenarios under prescribed changes to limit constraints for no3 n fig 8 a p fig 8 b and concurrent changes in no3 n and p fig 8 c the common base scenario in the top left corner for all three panels shows the composition of land use across the lrew in this case the watershed was dominated by the cotton crop in terms of the percentage of real acreage over the nine year period cotton composes almost 59 of all land with combined hardwood and softwood areas occupying just over 4 of the watershed the land class extra accounts for 23 of total lands in the watershed and based on our modeling approach remains constant in all scenarios however except for two relatively small sub basins the land use maps produced in fig 8 reflect the fact that extra land fails to account for primary land cover under any of the remaining sub basins it becomes clear from fig 8 a that softwood increasingly permeates the watershed as land progressively converts from the highest profitable crop i e cotton in the study area in the n7 scenario successive declines of 72 to the no3 n water quality constraints expose softwood as the primary crop in most sub basins throughout the watershed in terms of percent of the actual area this equates to nearly 35 of all land cover the n7 scenario also shows the area of cotton slashed by nearly half from base to 30 while hardwood now makes up just less than a tenth of a percent of all lands contained in the watershed when p constraints were made more restrictive holding no3 n constraints constant it was hardwood rather than softwood that came to infiltrate the watershed primarily the bottom half the initial tightening of constraints to p1 involves the few prior hardwood dominated sub basins multiplying and to a lesser extent softwood as well though when constraints were tightened three percentage points further to p7 the few patches of hardwood dominated sub basins disappear under p7 the cotton remains the principal crop composing 45 of the watershed followed by hardwood which grows to over 13 of land cover as in fig 8 b fig 8 c also depicts a strong forest presence in southern sub basins after the initial change to np1 which continues to steadily grow up until np7 unlike fig 8 b however a closer examination reveals relatively more softwood patches as well as a few sub basins located further up north also converting to softwood sankey diagrams shed additional perspective on land use progression in scenarios n7 fig 9 and p7 fig 10 4 4 a sankey diagram for the np7 scenario followed a similar pattern to illustrations for n7 and p7 but is not presented to conserve space here the flows between years represent a transition in land use from one year to the next where width is directly proportional to the relative contribution from old crop to new crop type for example the band starting from bermuda in the first column in both a and b designates the complete transition of land from bermuda in 1997 to cotton in 1998 it should be noted that linear programming is well known to provide sparse solutions where only a few variables are selected as seen in figs 9 and 10 since the simplex algorithm searches for solutions on the vertices of the feasible region following an optimal policy implies a reduction in heterogeneity among crop selection which may in turn lead to possible deterrence in adoption by landowners 5 5 a simple example may serve to illustrate the referenced reduction in crop heterogeneity consider for a moment that only two land use options x y are permitted for which three optimal solutions exist 0 1 1 0 and ½ ½ in such a case our model will always return a solution of 0 1 or 1 0 dual values for binding constraints in our linear program commonly termed shadow prices are presented in table 7 for select model runs values in this table reflect the decline in landowner profits given a unit decrease defined as 0 000001 in the constant term i e rhs of a particular water quality constraint we highlight the n7 p7 and np7 scenarios along with n1 p1 and np1 scenarios for added context the first two columns referring to no3 n constraints reveal dual prices tend to increase every year the largest occurring in 2004 and 2001 under n1 and n7 respectively for these years we may state that tightening the constraint by one unit causes the objective value to decrease on a per unit basis of 2111 49 under n1 and 40 326 96 under n7 comparatively dual prices associated with p constraints under n1 and n7 were minimal under p1 and p7 scenarios all dual prices associated with no3 n constraints were zero concerning p constraints dual prices reach a max of 769 02 96 and 1915 85 for respective scenarios p1 and p7 the last two columns show respective dual prices for np1 and np7 as was the case in p1 in np1 dual prices linked to constraint changes associated with no3 n were zero prices linked to constraint changes associated with p however were higher when compared to n1 and p1 scenarios similarly np7 dual prices exceeded those in n7 and p7 scenarios for both no3 n and p constraints 4 5 sensitivity analysis running the optimization problem with simultaneous no3 n and p constraints can provide additional output to ascertain other individual effects from water quality mandates as well as any notable interacting effects under changes to both no3 n and p constraints from base we observe the steady increase in hardwood and softwood tends to reflect hybrid traits of the individual no3 n and p scenarios previously considered the progression of land use patterns may be analyzed more closely by examining certain combinations of specific scenarios in each of the following three distinct sets we note equal percent reductions defining the combined np constraint and those identifying solo n p constraints as confirmed in table 3 i n1 p1 and np1 ii n2 p4 and np5 iii n3 p5 and np7 under i derived welfare estimates were virtually the same across all three scenarios in ii profits under np5 were 23 6 million less than what they were under n2 and 1 2 million less than under p4 and in iii profits are 8 1 million less in np7 than what they were under p5 and 24 1 million less compared to n3 these findings show that the combined effect of requiring both water quality constraints to be met appears to exert greater losses in aggregate watershed welfare versus only having to consider lone no3 n or p constraints as right hand side limits tighten this is expected and can be explained in part by the reduced feasible region of our optimization problem a consequence of incorporating a second concurrent water quality constraint however it also observed that the scale of loss experienced in profits between solo constraint and combined constraint scenarios behave quite differently as water quality limits tighten according to specific nutrient content for example the 1 3 million loss in profits between the p scenario p4 and np scenario np5 in set ii grows to a 8 1 million loss in set iii comparatively the 22 1 million loss in profits between the n scenario and np scenario in set ii gets slightly raised to 24 1 million in set iii indeed the biophysical and socioeconomic variation across a landscape undoubtedly complicates management decisions since every hectare of a given land class is not of equal value in generating a particular ecosystem service 61 however estimates as just described are notable in that they show in monetary terms the degree to how much crop cover can be maintained while maintaining compliance with water quality standards also provided is a sense of expected impact on welfare based on competing water related policies in our case results indicate the possibility to reduce nutrient concentration considerably within a moderate range of total profit losses 20 at the most such information can play an integral role in helping set amounts for potential ambient tax or subsidy schemes commonly based on the water quality of the resource receiving the pollutant assuming the appropriate zone for measuring concentrations in the water body has been identified 62 the sankey diagrams further examine the interflow between different land use types in the most extreme cases associated with changes to no3 n and p constraints i e the n7 and p7 scenarios undoubtedly these were the scenarios in which most land use changes took place as the model encouraged the transition from agriculture to the forest due to tighter water quality constraints figs 9 and 10 are meant to visually highlight the degree of land use transition over the study time frame the number of land use transitions observed could increase or decrease dramatically dependent upon reported crop profits and associated crop loadings yet we note the likely practical feasibility from agriculture to forest remains questionable and therefore the significant crop conversion required to meet water quality constraints may manifest as a social planner s problem those areas that struggle to produce good yield perhaps marginal lands should be targeted first our optimization problem takes the general form of maximizing a real function subject to certain resource water quality constraints accordingly in the case of a less than or equal constraint such as a resource constraint a dual price represents the value of having one more unit of the resource represented by that constraint in our case we measure the amount the objective deteriorates as the rhs of the constraint was decreased by one unit as observed in table 7 the highest price was observed for the np7 2005 scenario related to the no3 n constraint while even the highest observed dual price was low in terms of calculated welfare less than one percent all else equal overall sensitivity emerges as higher in no3 n constraint linked dual prices and in many instances significantly higher such data can aid in making informed land planning decisions for meeting environmental standards for example it would be much costlier for the aggregate of landowners residing in the watershed to have to comply with a unit decrease in no3 n concentration compared with p at the minimum a range of dual price estimates tied to various scenarios can provide landowners with better planning opportunities for reducing systematic risk while complying with various water quality criteria 5 discussion our discussion primarily concerns examining trade offs involved in jointly managing land use decisions i e profit and water quality 6 6 aside from greater nutrient runoff increased agricultural lands depending on management practices can also be the source of several other ecosystem disservices including loss of wildlife habitat and greenhouse gas emissions 63 in this context pfister et al 64 seem to suggest the land water trade off rests more on the location of cultivation rather than characteristics of agricultural crop cover at a global level figs 4 and 5 reveal that after accounting for nutrient decay adjusted loads amounts were higher in sub basins located in the southern part of the lrew nearer the watershed outlet this appears logical given that sub basins closer to the outlet would be characterized by lower associated travel time and hence less nutrient decay because part of p gets carried with sediment and sediment deposits it reasons that in the case of p two factors reactions and deposition may play a prominent role in explaining the spatial variation observed in nutrient loadings succeeding derivations of average annual concentration amounts per the watershed fell well within ranges reported in prior work 65 66 based on data between 1974 and 2003 feyereisen et al 66 derived mean annual nutrient concentrations between 0 14 and 0 23 no3 n mg l and 0 19 to 0 27 p mg l for five sub watersheds contained within the larger lrew likewise for the two decades that overlap our study time frame bosch et al 65 report average annual concentration amounts of 0 13 no3 n mg l and 0 10 p mg l from 1990 to 1999 and 0 11 mg l for both no3 n and p from 2000 to 2009 cho et al 17 use the swat model to evaluate the water quality effects of conservation practice alternatives in the lrew and report validation results with wide ranging errors from 25 7 for tn to 42 for p in our results the higher concentrations in 1997 for both no3 n and p were due to the large initial year allocation to traditional row crops corn within the watershed table 6 to compare with mcls defined earlier the 0 0319 mg l no3 n computed at the watershed outlet in 1997 is well within the maximum limit of 10 mg l and remains negligible for the duration of the simulation period on the other hand the corresponding 0 1029 mg l of p just breaks the epa s recommended total phosphorus concentration of 0 10 mg l in streams not discharging directly into reservoirs this p reading was arguably somewhat unexpected since the lrew is not particularly known for water quality issues after the first year p concentrations persist slightly above naturally occurring background levels 0 02 mg l but below an amount worthy of triggering periodic algal blooms it remains critical to visualize not only the overall changes in land cover that are likely to occur because of stricter water quality mandates but also the relative impacts associated with adhering to maximum allowable amounts set for one water quality parameter i e no3 n compared to another i e p it is clear from the results fig 8 that under progressively tighter limits the watershed gradually gets converted to forestlands before the model is rendered infeasible under changing no3 n constraints this manifests in the form of softwood making up primary land use in most sub basins by n7 fig 8 a in the case of firmer p constraints fig 8 b hardwoods grow the most eventually taking over softwoods as well but to a lesser extent than the prior softwood domination observed in the end under no3 n constraints also noted was the steep rise in hardwoods from base to p1 versus base to n1 scenarios in both the individual n and p scenarios fig 8 c the sub basins that convert to majority forestland seem most prevalent along the southern reaches of the watershed such spatial patterns may be caused by affiliation with higher local nutrient content if indeed the case it seems plausible that these would be some of the first sub basins to flip to land use more conducive to meeting lower concentration limits enforced at the watershed outlet thus for constraints on p and especially no3 n interventions aimed at improving water quality are likely to occur at the detriment of agriculturally productive land these findings agree with a recent study investigating trade offs between agricultural productivity and near identical parameters describing water quality in a new zealand catchment 67 the authors suggest that agricultural land losses can be partly offset by an improvement in production on land less subject to nutrient loss although yield maximization while reducing the pressures on land can itself coincide with lower water use efficiencies 64 understanding how water quality impacts of proposed land use changes compared to impacts of baseline land use regimes is equally important in this context baseline land use may be defined as 1998 allocations since the initial land composition in 1997 was assumed fixed in the base case scenario annual no3 n concentration amounts derived for the lrew increased 61 from 1998 to 2005 p concentration rose about 29 during the same interval the observed growth in concentration amounts is not necessarily surprising even though water quality limits get more restrictive each year one may interpret that under the base scenario defined water quality limits are too large to influence land allocation decisions thus in the base scenario landowners continue to produce the most profitable crop in any given year percentage declines in no3 n concentration from 1998 to 2005 increase as the annual decline in limits grow in magnitude i e tighter limits for example under n1 and n7 scenarios no3 n concentration declines 1 8 and 99 respectively over the eight years interestingly detected under base n1 n2 and n3 scenarios p concentration had a higher concentration in 2005 compared to 1998 this could be attributed to the fact that although cotton was associated with the second highest p load behind bermuda associated no3 n loadings were relatively low thus up until some point at least it remains practical and profitable to continue agriculture producing cotton for remaining scenarios up to n7 p concentration generally declined year over year with n7 exhibiting the most significant decline in p concentration 11 1 meanwhile p scenarios showed reduced concentration in p and no3 n derived over time from 1998 to 2005 p concentration was reduced by 57 6 under p1 compared to a negative 68 6 under p7 under these same scenarios no3 n concentration declined 16 5 and 23 1 respectively the combined np scenarios follow a similar pattern where no3 n and p concentration fell by 16 6 and 57 8 respectively in np1 compared with np7 for which no3 n concentration reduced by 69 1 and p concentration decreased by 65 0 bosch et al 65 in comparison found no clear relationship among changes in land cover or management practices on nutrient loads cho et al 17 in their analysis of nps pollution impacts from different management practices found the single greatest contributor to nps pollutant reduction in the lrew was that of current riparian forest cover levels riparian forest buffers offered the most comprehensive reduction in total phosphorous 19 5 and total nitrogen 7 0 5 1 key study caveats the fundamental goal driving our study design was to provide a conceptual overview of the core model framework and demonstrate its potential with a working application nonetheless key caveats to our study follow constraints on the maximum number of hectares for each crop at a particular period may be called for since it is likely that in any given year an entire sub basin would could not convert to 100 of a certain crop of greater matter are environmental uncertainties regarding amounts of nutrient load or precipitation which in turn would affect recorded surface runoff that may warrant inclusion in future applications and similarly economic fluctuations captured through historical crop price volatility further while we assume zero nutrient loadings and zero profits in an attempt keep land categorized as extra i e any land not considered part of our six major land use categories neutral we realize in the case of barren land included as part of extra no erosion and consequently sediment and phosphorus loads are likely to occur however considering extra constitutes almost a quarter 23 of the total watershed area the current study may suffer from a limitation in this regard from a policy perspective water quality constraints which mandate increasing stringency over a nine year periodcould be regarded as too theoretical from a policy perspective to add further complexity one may argue substantial spatially distributed time lags exist between actions on the surface and the response in streams where numeric nutrient criteria must be met one solution would be to introduce appropriate time lags provided a generous dataset an alternative might involve exploiting large temporal datasets to develop optimal land use configurations for a single water quality constraint over a decadal or more climate sequence with year to year price uncertainty yet as the temporal or spatial scale increases trade offs inevitably become more ambiguous and challenging to quantify in terms of nutrient legacies swat to some degree can handle these effects but it is not the ideal tool for it even if one were to shut down all the nutrient inputs the nutrient concentrations would slowly decrease in swat simulations swat considers multiple pools for n and p each pool undergoes reactions e g transformation and decay they are also transported between different systems in the watershed it takes time for nitrate for example to move from the top of the soil to the groundwater there it remains for a while but undergoes a decay process before it is released to streams our simulation period is nearly two decades longer periods are more desirable to better capture the legacy effects additionally we acknowledge swat is not the perfect tool to capture legacy effects and other tools should be evaluated for better exploring the watershed dynamics in the study area due to such data limitations our study timeframe is restricted to nine years yet the above concerns remain valid model modifications will need to be made where deemed appropriate this also opens avenues for future research for example an additional dimension such as a particular bmp could be extended to the framework fig s5 to strategically target optimal land management regimes across the watershed contemporary bmps in the lrew have been documented to include riparian forest buffers contour farming and cover crops for conservation tillage systems 17 32 65 undoubtedly depending on the size of a particular dimension e g number of sub basins as well as the number of dimensions themselves e g incorporating additional features such as hru or management style the breadth of the problem can grow quite large lastly our new approach offers more indications to policymakers rather than landowners the swat model as described here is based on sub basins and hrus unique combinations of soil land use and slope and not set up at the farm level therefore it is harder to based on swat results provide landowners guidelines to specific crops in their fields it can however provide indications to policymakers on where certain measures can be more effective in reducing non point sources nutrients runoff at the watershed outlet moreover though the lens of policy uncertainties it is unlikely for such a nutrient limit constraint i e policy to exist exactly as we have specified but results from using the proposed model do provide generalized results of where and possibly when changes in land cover may have to be implemented to realize local water quality targets 6 conclusion this study combined estimates for nutrient load and surface runoff from a calibrated and validated swat model with profits by crop type to construct a dynamic lp problem capable of gauging impacts on aggregate watershed profits due to conforming to nutrient concentration criteria at the watershed outlet the model allows the researcher to identify dynamic patterns in land use evolution at the sub basin level our study concludes with three important findings in light of obtained results first compliance with different nutrient load criteria may produce substantial relative differences in the impact on land cover while the general pattern can be described as a shift towards forestland results can vary drastically in terms of total acres converted and forest type second compliance with prescribed limits on numeric nutrient criteria is expected to reduce aggregate landowner profit but the degree of profit reduction will directly depend on land use decisions the disparity in profits between the particular nutrient content measured i e in our case no3 n or p may be more pronounced depending on relative price differences among crops considered third a close examination of dual prices reveals sensitivity could vary greatly depending on how restrictive the water quality limits are ceteris paribus our results showed greater sensitivity as permittable concentration amounts shrank and greater dual prices associated with no3 n constraints to comparable p constraints it is essential to keep in mind this is a methods based study and should be inferred as such although the lrew is devoid of apparent water quality issues the watershed was selected in part since it served as a convenient source of comprehensive hydrological and nutrient data yet due to its relative ease in scaling up in terms of allowing for a greater number of spatial units crops or time periods as well as its capacity to take on a greater number of dimensions extensions e g perhaps incorporating crop specific management regimes associated with each spatial unit per time step we hope our model construct may serve as a general template to establish ideal cropping patterns

8641,by combining information on nutrient output from the soil water assessment tool swat and secondary data on local profits from different crop types we devise a profit maximization problem subject to dynamic water quality constraints which become gradually more restrictive over time the solution aims to detect the optimal allocation of land parcels by crop type that maximizes the total net present value of landowner profits throughout the watershed over a nine year time span our model construct is applied to the little river experimental watershed lrew in south georgia water quality constraints involve the landowner adhering to specific permittable limits on numeric nutrient criteria recorded at the watershed outlet under various scenarios including i no3 n constraints ii total phosphorus p constraints and iii concurrent no3 n and p constraints in the most extreme case a reduction in aggregate profits of 24 1 million and 8 1 million was observed for combined no3 n and p constraints relative to commensurate solo constraints on no3 n and p respectively the designing watersheds for integrated development dwid model could support policymaking for ascertaining trade offs

landowners numeric nutrient criteria watershed management data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction long term exposure to chemicals in the water supply are associated with a range of acute and long term chronic illnesses 1 2 nitrate overconsumption for example can cause adverse effects on the health of children e g neurodevelopment and babies e g methemoglobinemia or baby blue syndrome 3 contaminated streams also harm the surrounding aquatic ecosystem life for instance excessive phosphorus concentrations cause increased occurrences of algal blooms which deplete the water body of oxygen and can in turn potentially wreak havoc on freshwater animal communities 4 however unlike point sources such as sewage treatment plants and factories the vagueness behind non point source nps water pollution makes it difficult to manage it is the diffuse nature of contaminants often originating from fertilizer application at the surface to eventual discharge into surface and ground waters that result in contaminants being picked up by water flow over extensive areas of land nps pollution itself results from both leaching to groundwater as well as land runoff to surface waters thus the land use within a watershed can have a substantial effect on the water chemistry commonly interpreted as quality indicators of a river network forestlands for example are generally linked to better conditions in water quality health downstream 5 8 conversely positive associations between certain land uses namely modern industrial agriculture and degraded water quality have also been well documented 9 12 identifying individual land parcels linked to elevated pollution levels downstream however remains challenging indeed two interrelated themes that consistently emerge in the environmental and natural resources management literature are land allocation and water quality research concerning land allocation and water quality must also be examined in the context of specific numeric nutrient criteria guidelines the national primary drinking water standards npdws which apply to public water systems set the maximum contaminant level mcl for no3 n at 10 mg l for rivers and streams the epa s recommended total nitrogen criteria range from 0 12 to 2 18 mg l and from 0 01 to 0 08 mg l for total p across each of the nation s distinct 14 eco regions 70 while no explicit mcl associated with p currently exists the epa recommends total phosphorus concentration as phosphorus not exceeding 0 10 mg l in streams not discharging directly into reservoirs and not exceeding 0 05 mg l in streams discharging directly into reservoirs 13 such low concentrations make p monitoring particularly challenging in addition to mcl s section 303 d of the clean water act requires states to submit a list of all waters that are not supporting their designated uses and need to have a total maximum daily load tmdl developed although environmental laws designed to protect water resources largely exclude regular ongoing farming silvicultural and ranching activities several federal and state policies still apply to farmers and forest landowners activities associated with converting timberland to agricultural crop production for example are not exempt from environmental regulations in

specific landowners and the landowner fails to take remedial measures incidents are referred to the gepd for enforcement future policies must draft potential water quality regulations consistent with the usepa s method for deriving ambient water quality criteria for the protection of human health the usepa peer reviewed technical guidance for developing additional numeric nutrient criteria for rivers and streams suggests the use of predictive relationships by applying empirical and mechanistic models 15 here we apply an empirical economic model to a small watershed in south georgia we examine the interaction among competing environmental and financial pursuits on land use allocation and how they are likely to change over time our work contributes to water resource management literature in at least two aspects first we hope our relatively straightforward approach may provide indications to policymakers on where certain measures can be more effective in reducing non point sources of nutrient runoff at the watershed outlet second by ascertaining the prospect of likely land cover patterns across our considered watershed we draw on conclusions reached in this study to better identify trade offs in the context of future watershed quality programs although our analysis centers around the landowner and their combined profits we note the practical infeasibility stemming from the landowner s understandable lack of clarity in interpreting water quality improvements downstream i e watershed outlet and thus perhaps their inability to implement suggested alternative crops on their land rather our approach would seem to give more indications to policymakers as opposed to landowners before elaborating on our approach further it is necessary to consider the context of the methods we have used previous research in lrew has examined the application of the swat model with different periods and approaches 16 19 yet the relationship between water quality and land cover is intricate and requires monitoring of water bodies and land management best management practices bmps for instance have been proven to reduce nutrient loadings from agricultural areas in the case of filtration systems or vegetated systems i e biofilters the goal is to capture a portion of received runoff and in the process channel it into the soil the pollutants in that portion are thereby effectively prevented from penetrating the local river network with advances in computing power evolutionary computation and mathematical programming techniques such as genetic algorithms gas have been increasingly used in determining the optimal placement of bmps to attain water quality targets at watershed scales 20 22 in another study shoemaker et al 23 employed mixed integer linear programming alongside evolutionary computations i e scatter search and genetic algorithms to jointly determine the optimal location type and cost of stormwater bmps needed to meet water quality goals in urban watersheds genetic algorithms however can be time intensive in comparison to classical optimization solvers and require a rather intricate grasp of elaborate parameters e g crossover mutation rate fitness function limbrunner et al 24 demonstrate a linear programming algorithm analog to a nonlinear optimization model that efficiently reproduced much of the same solution structure when optimizing the watershed scale placement of bmps classical optimization techniques typically take the form of minimizing costs subject to certain pollutant load criteria 22 25 26 or in the alternative maximizing water quality under cost constraints 21 24 27 28 multi objective optimization whereby the researcher simultaneously solves multiple objective functions 20 29 has also been utilized in managing water resource problems additionally uncertainties linked to a specific parameter have been modeled using stochastic programming 27 28 30 for example jia culver 28 developed a robust optimization model that sought to minimize pollutant load reductions given various levels of reliability with respect to water quality standards in a virginia watershed likewise zhou et al 30 considered a small hypothetical watershed for which costs associated with pollutant removal were minimized subject to chance constraints describing pollutant removal efficiency the focus of our study concerns a group of private landowners in a georgia watershed who face the task of allocating land for a given set of crops over a multi period planning horizon the influences of a range of hypothetical government policies limiting specific water quality parameters on land use decisions by the landowner and its subsequent impact on land cover evolution are considered we seek to maximize aggregate landowner net profit subject to prescribed limits on water quality indicators downstream selected scenarios allow gradual reductions in permissible nutrient concentration recorded at the watershed outlet three distinct watershed mandates are considered 1 tightened restrictions in permissible no3 n concentration 2 tightened restrictions in permissible p concentration and 3 tightened restrictions in both no3 n and p concentration trade offs between environmental and economic interests are evaluated through measures of marginal changes in aggregate landowner net profit because of having to meet increasingly higher water quality criteria by attaining a better understanding of landowner behavior through the perceived trade offs between profit and environment we hope to contribute to the design of prospective environmental programs to promote improved water quality while prior work has also investigated programs of land allocation which rely on swat and optimization procedures see ref 31 our study is of relevance because of the increasing need for studies that offer guidance on farm practices or configurations to decrease the environmental deterioration of water bodies we first describe the study area the methodological framework follows outlining the assumptions and inputs that feed our modeling technique highlighted results are presented for the linear programming problem under various scenarios defining different water quality mandates the manuscript concludes with a discussion of the findings with an emphasis on policy recommendations and potential avenues for future research 2 characteristics of watershed this study was conducted on the 334 km2 lrew located in the headwaters area of the suwannee river in the coastal plain physiographic province basin near tifton ga fig 1 the watershed overlays three counties turner tift and worth in the state broad valleys supporting wide stream networks are typical of the local geography the elevation of the watershed generally increases from south to north with the highest elevations occurring in the northwest corner underlain by the coastal plain aquifer the lrew consists primarily of low gradient streams surrounded by higher gradient streams most of the soil classifies as a tifton loamy sand followed by alapaha loamy sand with a high infiltration rate 32 streamflow and water quality of the lrew have been monitored by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars since 1967 no permitted point source discharges exist in the watershed 18 climate is categorized as humid subtropical with a long growing season 33 average annual precipitation and temperature are 1208 mm and 19 1 c respectively streamflow is likely attributable to 30 of annual rainfall mainly composed of return flow from the local shallow aquifer and to a lesser extent direct surface runoff 34 although the lrew is agricultural dominated forests still occupy the landscape in a significant manner watershed land characteristics based on the 2004 national land cover database nlcd is approximately defined as 51 row crops primarily peanut corn and cotton 16 evergreen forest 2 deciduous forest and 1 hay other notable categories include woody wetland 22 which largely occurs on the borders of the stream network and urban space 6 mostly confined to a small northeast corner of the watershed 3 methodology 3 1 synopsis the swat model is initially calibrated and validated over a nine year time frame 1997 to 2005 to simulate no3 n loadings p loadings and surface runoff at the watershed outlet calibrating for crop related parameters which control plant growth produced average crop yields at the hru level in the end annual data on crop profits nutrient loadings and surface runoff feed a dynamic linear optimization program that maximizes landowner profits subject to specific water quality constraints fig 2 provides for a concise flowchart illustrating the steps involved 3 2 swat model 3 2 1 overview the swat model is a process based and semi distributed continuous time step model that can simulate hydrology crop growth nutrients and sediment loads 35 swat is one of the most broadly applied large scale watershed simulation models in total maximum daily load tmdl analyses and water resource planning its applications have included predicting the impact of land management practices on nutrient yields from agricultural land use in large complex watersheds with varying soils land use and management conditions over long periods 36 37 we used arcswat 2012 interface to set up the model using the 30 m digital elevation model dem soil survey spatial tabular ssurgo 2 2 soils data national land cover dataset nlcd and national agricultural statistics services nass land use data precipitation temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind data were obtained from global weather data for swat https globalweather tamu edu table 1 we followed liew et al 19 and chose the hargreaves method 38 for estimating potential evapotranspiration pet using topographic information the swat model divided the watershed into 198 sub basins subsequently each subbasin was divided into hydrologic response units hrus with unique combinations of land use soil and slope 39 three slope classes were used for hru classification 0 5 5 10 and above 10 the threshold of 20 10 and 5 for soil land use and the slope was applied to reduce the number of hrus total 1272 across 198 sub basins we obtained an estimate of management operations planting dates fertilizer application rate and type crops yield and harvesting dates for the lrew from the university of georgia cooperative extension specialist dr dewey lee personal communication and https www caes uga edu extension outreach html and usda nass 1997 https www nass usda gov publications national crop progress a three year peanut corn cotton rotation was applied in the model for all the peanut corn and cotton fields amounts of 134 and 65 kg n ha in the form of elemental nitrogen fertilizer were applied in corn and cotton fields respectively the amount of 50 kg p ha of phosphorus fertilizer as p2o5 was applied in both corn and cotton fields for hay land use urea 200 kg ha with two applications in may and june and elemental p 60 kg ha were applied we used harvest only operation in swat that occurred twice a year a baseflow separation technique 40 was used to initialize the value of the baseflow recession constant alpha bf we made relative adjustments of alpha bf during the model calibration 3 2 2 calibration validation the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi version 2 in the swat calibration and uncertainty programs platform 41 42 was used to calibrate and validate the model for streamflow nutrients nitrate nitrogen and total phosphorus and sediment at daily time step at the outlet of lrew the sufi 2 combines optimization with uncertainty analysis uncertainties in the parameters result in model output uncertainties quantified as the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu band between the 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution of an output variable using latin hypercube sampling 42 the observed data from the usda ars gauging station at the main watershed outlet ftp www tiftonars org database between 1997 and 2005 were used with a four year model initialization 1993 1996 followed by a five year calibration 1997 2001 and two years model validation 2002 2003 to evaluate the model performance we used two quantitative error statistics kling gupta efficiency kge 43 and the percent bias pbias the kge contains three components correlation r the ratio between the mean of the simulated values and the mean of the observed ones μ s μ o and variability ratio σ s σ o between the simulated s and observed o variable μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the variable respectively 1 k g e 1 r 1 2 μ s μ o 1 2 σ s σ o 1 2 kge ranges from to 1 with a value closer to 1 representing a relatively accurate model kge overcomes the disadvantage of nash sutcliffe efficiency 44 in underestimating peak flow prediction 43 pbias measures the average tendency of the predicted data to be larger or smaller than observed values it also measures over and underestimation of bias 45 2 p b i a s i 1 n o i s i 1 n o i 100 the optimum value for pbias is 0 where values close to zero indicate better model prediction and overestimation is signified by pbias 0 and underestimation indicates when pbias 0 46 calibration and validation of the model were conducted as one at a time calibration in addition to parameters we incorporate biophysical parameters for major crops in the lrew in our calibration process parameters controlling nutrients and sediment loads were indicated through a literature review 42 49 parameters controlling streamflow and plant growth were calibrated first followed by sediment and phosphorus and then nitrate nitrogen parameters we used average annual usda nass crop yield observed data except for forest classes after the streamflow was calibrated crop parameters were adjusted to simulate crop yields refer to table s1 in si average modeled yields for each crop were subsequently compared across the lrew with published yields for tift county retrieved from the university of georgia 56 3 3 nutrient load assignment 3 3 1 contribution modeling to account for n and p loss and transformations at each subbasin we used an approach that assesses nutrient load contributions from each subbasin over simulation periods at the watershed outlet see refs 50 52 therefore after calibrating and validating the swat model we defined a virtual rain gauge for each sub basin in the watershed the rain gauge was then switched off in successive series to find the contribution percentage of nutrient loads remaining at the watershed outlet from each sub basin the software r v 4 0 2 with extension package swatplusr 53 was employed as a part of this analysis by interacting with our swat project to help execute efficient simulation runs across all sub basins for both no3 n and p swat computes contribution percentages using a routing scheme based on the channel network that connects the outlets of sub basins to the watershed s primary outlet the exact nutrient loading to be routed for a given sub basin i was estimated accordingly we refer to this estimated amount as an adjusted nutrient loading per sub basin written as 3 b i b i a i 1 2 198 where b adjusted nutrient loading was calculated as the product of original nutrient loading amount b and nutrient loading contribution percentage a 3 3 2 land use assumptions adjusted nutrient loadings calculated at the sub basin level were further broken down by land use the model framework considers six land uses bermuda hay corn cotton peanut and forest classified as softwood and hardwood the default swat setup was used for forest management which assumes no fertilization no thinning and a maturity of 10 and 30 years for deciduous and evergreen forests respectively an additional land use category extra which is meant to capture barren land is also included crop type in our analysis is therefore composed of a total of seven classes nutrient loadings for each crop in each subbasin were calculated as the weighted average of loadings weighted by swat reported crop yields at the hru level as an initial step daily no3 n and p loadings corresponding to each hru by crop type for each year were obtained from calibrated swat output values were summed over days to arrive at annual values corresponding to each hru computing the average across all years and hru for each crop then served as the basis for constructing relative weights among crop type the created crop coefficients were subsequently multiplied by the adjusted nutrient load recorded at each sub basin i to derive specific nutrient allocation by crop type land classified as extra was assumed to produce zero nutrient loadings an analogous procedure applies to the surface runoff calculations also projected at the crop level 3 4 economic modeling adopting present value pv considerations landowner profit was discounted back to the initial period using the notation below π and π reflect respective average annual profits and pv of average annual profits 4 π t p t y t w t t 0 1 2 8 5 π t π t 1 r t where p is the annual crop price assessed in kg y is annual crop yield produced from swat output measured in kg ha and w is annual crop cost reported in ha the time is denoted by t where 0 is synonymous with the year 1997 the discount rate is captured by r set at an interest rate of 4 1 2 2 the discount rate as applied here was calculated based on the average federal funds rate during the time period 1997 to 2005 plus a spread of 50 basis points similar to nutrient loading assignments zero profits were assumed for land designated as extra a depiction of relative comparisons in profit amounts by the crop is presented in fig 3 annual price data for agricultural crops were acquired through usda nass 54 prices for forest crops softwood and hardwood were calculated using historical stumpage values sourced from timbermart south 55 average annual costs were estimated by referencing historically expected cost budgets for non irrigated land in the study area 56 hardwood and softwood forest costs were calculated as the sum of average annual costs consisting of fertilizer and herbicide application machine planting mechanical site preparation and prescribed burning 57 cost budgets as described were assumed constant across years in eq 5 replacing π with c meant to capture estimated conversion costs associated with switching from one land use class to another yields an analogous left hand side lhs value c t or the pv of incurred conversion costs for a particular year these necessary conversion costs are considered when our analysis is extended to the profit maximization problem described in the following section in this way land moving between aggregate land use classes agriculture and forestland becomes dependent on relative returns a major component in land preparation from forest to agriculture is clearing the land of stumps based on consultation with field experts academia and industry it was estimated that excavator services required to pull and pile stumps post clear cut would charge at a minimum the equivalent pv of 4942 ha for pine and 6177 ha in the case of hardwoods costs associated with having to convert bermuda to another crop potentially were also derived estimates were based on incurred costs for prepping the land with necessary fertilizer and herbicide application our average watershed corn yield of 7841 kg ha would require approximately 134 kg n ha suggesting a cost of 168 03 ha in addition the herbicide glyphosate is effective at killing green weeds assuming a common recommended application of 3 36 kg ha of herbicide further costs were calculated at 3 30 kg or 11 09 ha hence conversion costs from the bermuda crop were set equal to the pv of a total future outflow value 179 12 ha 3 5 dynamic linear optimization table 1 presents a comprehensive list of the inputs feeding the dynamic optimization model as well as input parameters for the preceding swat runs table 2 provides short descriptions of the primary notation used in our optimization model our profit maximization problem spans the following dimensions old crop type new crop type sub basin and year captured in respective j j i and t subscripts the dynamic optimization framework seeks to maximize aggregate landowner profit subject to constraints on land use and downstream water quality the sum of individual landowner net profit is interpreted as a measure of social welfare in the lrw we presume that because changes to consumer surplus would be minimized if crops were traded in the market total economic surplus becomes a function of producer surplus and thus may be roughly captured through a representation of producer surplus i e aggregate watershed profit the model was solved in ms excel with what sbest v 16 0 58 solver to find an efficient solution to the optimization problem the objective function solves for the annual land allocation l for each of 198 sub basins that result in maximum net profit z across the watershed over the nine years 1997 to 2005 3 3 using sub basins as the unit for land use configuration in this manner as opposed to finer scales such as hydrological response units hrus may result in improved optimizing efficiency by decreasing the search space of spatial optimization 59 mathematically the profit maximization problem with land area a constraints is expressed as follows 6 max z j i t π j i t x j i t j i t j c j i t j x j i t j subject to land use restrictions 7 j x j i t j x j i t j i t 8 x j i t l j i t j i t 9 j l j i t a i t i t 10 j l j i t j x j i t 1 j j j x j i t 1 j j j j j x j i t 1 j i t j e x t r a where x and x are decision variables referring to hectares harvested and hectares converted respectively at each time step and sub basin the sum of converted hectares to all crops from each crop must not exceed crop hectares harvested 7 the second constraint eq 8 ensures the annual harvested crop area was less than or equal to allocated land for a given particular sub basin continuing from this eq 9 confirms the sum among allocated crop area for each sub basin and year is equal to the physical area of each subbasin and trivially at each period our model works to project the hypothetical evolution of land cover across the lrew through several years the basis of which is the initial year of land allocation land classed as extra was set constant to initial year land composition in 1997 for remaining crops eq 10 shows how the land allocation was deduced as a function of the decision variable optimal hectares harvested x that is for a given sub basin allocated annual cropland was set equal to the allocated annual cropland in the previous year plus the sum of annual converted hectares from all old crops to each new crop minus total annual converted hectares to all new crops from each old crop the water quality constraint sets the level of restriction on nutrient concentration for each year in the study period 11 j i b j i t s j i t x j i t d t γ t where the lhs in the above captures the measured nutrient concentration in the watershed each year here the notation b follows from eq 3 and s stands for surface runoff load originally measured in kg ha was converted to mg ha likewise surface flows were converted from mm to l transforming units in this manner produce units in mg l consistent with the theoretical nutrient limit denoted by d the superscript γ references nutrient type i e no3 n or p in the initial year our water quality limit was set equal to the total annual concentration as derived on the right hand side rhs of 11 in subsequent years d t follows a linear percentage reduction from the preceding year 12a d t γ j i b j i t s j i t x j i t f o r t 0 12b d t γ d t 1 γ 1 q f o r t 0 where q is the nutrient percent limit reduction although the formal policy may be unlikely to consist of successive reductions to set concentration limits per succeeding year the conjecture allows a useful perspective in visualizing the impact of increasing water quality restrictions on changes in land cover the ending limits applied in respective models for no3 n and p were based on the maximum percentage reduction permitted before the solver renders the solution infeasible more precisely prescribed nutrient limit percentage declines were construed by simply a determining the smallest percentage reduction that first triggers a marginal change in maximized aggregate profit b determining the smallest percentage reduction that first triggers the optimization model infeasible and c composing a series of six equally spaced intervals between the two percentages as defined in preceding steps a and b thus the imposed limit in our model is primarily a function of the computed aggregate nutrient concentration the application of our model in a different setting i e watershed would derive limits directly dependent on the total size in the area nutrient loadings and surface flows considered our analysis begins with a base scenario where no reductions to the maximum concentration limit are implemented relative to this scenario our optimization problem assumes annual percentage declines in the concentration limit for subsequent years we consider gradual tightening of no3 n limits p limits as well as concurrent no3 n and p constraints we identify the minimum feasible limit on the right hand side rhs of our water quality constraints for each case similarly we make a note of the minimum percentage decline in our rhs water quality limit to trigger a profit decline relative to the base scenario in total 21 scenarios as well as a base scenario are evaluated the scenarios presented in table 3 can be interpreted as hypothetical restrictions from our base scenario mandating a percentage reduction in nutrient concentration as measured at the watershed outlet included are seven changes in no3 n limit 48 n1 52 n2 56 n3 60 n4 64 n5 68 n6 72 n7 seven changes in p limit 14 75 p1 15 25 p2 15 75 p3 16 25 p4 16 75 p5 17 25 p6 17 75 p7 and seven simultaneous changes in respective no3 n and p limits 48 14 75 np1 49 16 15 08 np2 50 33 15 42 np3 51 50 15 75 np4 52 66 16 08 np5 53 82 16 42 np6 54 99 16 75 np7 therefore n1 to n7 as well as p1 to p7 and np1 to np7 refer to completely different scenarios differentiated by the percentage reduction from base each solved for the entire period of the model 4 results 4 1 swat calibration and validation the calibration process for the lrew started with 36 hydrologic and biophysical parameters after 1000 simulations the most sensitive flow and biophysical parameters were identified and are listed in table 4 in order of decreasing sensitivity the most sensitive parameters were effective hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium in the main channel ch k2 rte groundwater delay time gw delay gw the fraction of growing season when leaf area begins to decline dlai plant dat runoff curve number 2 cn2 mgt and available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc sol parameter values should be considered after calibration to avoid unrealistic simulations for instance the fitted values for sol awc in the swat model for crops and forest soil ranged from 0 06 to 0 07 which was comparable to the measured weighted average sol awc of 0 057 for the tifton soil series by hubbard 60 cn2 for the main crops and forest evergreen and deciduous were reduced by 12 resulted in a better adjustment to streamflow predictions the model fit was deemed satisfactory for streamflow calibration and validation with a daily kge of 0 80 and 0 71 and pbias of 2 5 and 3 8 respectively fig s1 the observed streamflow the model best fit and the 95 ppu band for calibration and validation periods are shown in fig s2 after the model was calibrated for hydrology and biophysical parameters the narrow ranges for selected parameter values were fixed and the model was calibrated for sediment load at the watershed outlet using 14 parameters following calibration of sediment load total phosphorus p and nitrate nitrogen no3 n loads were calibrated table 5 the most sensitive parameters for sediment load were the exponent parameter for calculating sediment reentrained in channel sediment routing spexp bsn a linear parameter for calculating the maximum amount of sediment that can be reentrained during channel sediment routing spcon bsn and the cover factor for the effect of land cover on erosion usle c plant the spexp and spcon are parameters used to calculate the maximum amount of sediment that can be transported from a reach the fitted value for spexp and spcon in our model was 1 210 and 0 001 respectively the daily kge was 0 43 and 0 57 for the calibration and validation period respectively with pbias of 2 5 for the calibration period and 0 2 for the validation periods table 5 the most sensitive p parameters were residue decomposition coefficient rsdco bsn phosphorus enrichment ratio for loading with sediment erorgp hru and the cover factor for the effect of land cover on erosion usle c plant table 4 the fitted value for rsdco and erorgp was 0 07 and 2 58 respectively the daily kge for p load was 0 63 with pbias of 0 4 for the calibration period and kge of 0 35 with pbias of 2 8 for the validation period the model performance for daily p at the watershed outlet evaluated as satisfactory with daily kge 0 35 and pbias 30 the lower kge for the validation period was expected because the observation data for p loads were sparse for that period compared with daily observations for streamflow the most sensitive n parameter was denitrification threshold water content sdnco bsn table 4 the daily kge for no3 n load was 0 50 with pbias of 7 9 for the calibration period and the kge of 0 46 with pbias of 19 for the validation period the model performance for daily no3 n load at the watershed outlet was considered satisfactory with daily kge 0 35 and pbias 30 4 2 nutrient contribution upon calibration and validation in swat nutrient loadings linked to a given hru for each day for each year were summed across days to arrive at annual values before averaging across all years for each hru a comparison of nutrient loadings by crop type is presented in fig s3 using a log scale boxplots in panel 5a reveal the highest no3 n loadings observed for bermuda crop averaging 0 622 kg ha per year the second highest was corn averaging 0 014 kg ha per year followed by cotton 0 001 kg ha per year and peanut 0 00018 kg ha per year no3 n loadings were even lower for forest with hardwood averaging 0 00012 kg ha per year and softwood associated with an average annual no3 n load of virtually zero similarly average annual p loadings in panel 5b were lowest for forest here softwood was associated with slightly higher loads estimated at 0 023 kg ha per year compared with 0 021 kg ha per year for hardwoods bermuda again was reflective of the highest nutrient load out of the six crops at 0 396 kg ha per year like bermuda cotton shows a fairly large number of outliers in the upper fence averaging 0 252 kg ha per year peanut and corn trail behind with estimated average annual loads of 0 081 and 0 072 kg ha respectively when we account for and subsequently incorporate a measure of nutrient decay based on the downstream travel time of a nutrient loads were reduced significantly while p loss mainly occurred through sedimentation for no3 n the primary process behind decay is denitrification a graphical interpretation is offered in figs 4 and 5 which show for all years how adjusted no3 n and p loads compare across individual sub basins respectively more precisely the values mapped in both figures may be referred to as b i t continuing with notation from above the adjusted nutrient load for each sub basin at each time step amounts derived for sub basins located in the southern part of the watershed generally correlated with higher loads because our model transforms calculated load amounts into concentration estimates before analysis for added perspective comparable amounts of surface runoff are presented for each sub basin throughout the years in fig 6 compared to nutrient content runoff amounts emerge as evenly distributed throughout the watershed for any given year 4 3 crop yield calibration calibrated versus observed values for all crop types are reported in fig s4 for corn cotton and peanut respective relative percentage differentials from calibrated to observed were 5 99 13 76 and 8 13 likewise calibrated yields for bermuda differed by 3 66 on average across the eight years compared to observed values meanwhile calibrated yields for both forest types were slightly higher compared to observed yields across the eight year study period on average for both hardwood and softwood at 2 84 and 1 39 respectively 4 4 optimization we multiplied the lhs by a factor of a million in eq 11 to produce nutrient concentration amounts in mg l as shown in table 6 the initial year records comparatively high concentrations for both no3 n and p amounts reach a high of 0 0319 mg l and a low of 0 0001 for no3 n compared with a maximum 0 1029 p mg l and minimum 0 0215 p mg l measures of aggregate landowner welfare for each of the scenarios listed in table 3 are presented in fig 7 in the base scenario maximum aggregate profits for the watershed reach 162 1 million water quality limits on no3 n concentration and p concentration were estimated at 0 0319 mg l and 0 1029 mg l for all years respectively examined in fig 7 a are changes in welfare from tighter no3 n constraints while p constraints are held constant at 1997 levels for all years not surprisingly as yearly constraints defining the maximum concentration of no3 n become gradually more restrictive or alternatively as percentage reductions to the rhs gradually increase aggregate profits decline the waning profits appear to decrease at an increasing rate given a linear percentage decline in water quality limits indeed n1 or the first decline of 48 has a marginal effect on profit levels dropping roughly 1 9 million from base in the most extreme scenario n7 a 72 decline in the maximum allowable limit each successive year from 1997 yields 102 6 million equivalent to an approximate 59 5 million in cumulative loss from base b illustrates the decline in profits from successively tighter p constraints holding no3 n constraints constant contrasted with fig 7 a aside from the significantly greater plunge in profits occurring from base to p1 14 75 the remaining downward trend in profits also takes general concave form albeit on a different scale profit under the p1 scenario equates to 1411 million a nearly 20 9 million drop from base when the percentage decline was increased to p7 17 75 aggregate watershed profit was reduced to 128 8 million fig 7 c assumes concurrent changes in no3 n and p constraints relative to our base scenario profit follows a similar path to the general shape presented in fig 7 b characterized by a relatively large initial dip for the combined case profit reaches a low of 125 8 million in the np7 scenario to understand the exact land use transformations driving deteriorated profits we refer to fig 10 which expose the majority land use class at the sub basin level based on cumulative acreage over the years for all scenarios under prescribed changes to limit constraints for no3 n fig 8 a p fig 8 b and concurrent changes in no3 n and p fig 8 c the common base scenario in the top left corner for all three panels shows the composition of land use across the lrew in this case the watershed was dominated by the cotton crop in terms of the percentage of real acreage over the nine year period cotton composes almost 59 of all land with combined hardwood and softwood areas occupying just over 4 of the watershed the land class extra accounts for 23 of total lands in the watershed and based on our modeling approach remains constant in all scenarios however except for two relatively small sub basins the land use maps produced in fig 8 reflect the fact that extra land fails to account for primary land cover under any of the remaining sub basins it becomes clear from fig 8 a that softwood increasingly permeates the watershed as land progressively converts from the highest profitable crop i e cotton in the study area in the n7 scenario successive declines of 72 to the no3 n water quality constraints expose softwood as the primary crop in most sub basins throughout the watershed in terms of percent of the actual area this equates to nearly 35 of all land cover the n7 scenario also shows the area of cotton slashed by nearly half from base to 30 while hardwood now makes up just less than a tenth of a percent of all lands contained in the watershed when p constraints were made more restrictive holding no3 n constraints constant it was hardwood rather than softwood that came to infiltrate the watershed primarily the bottom half the initial tightening of constraints to p1 involves the few prior hardwood dominated sub basins multiplying and to a lesser extent softwood as well though when constraints were tightened three percentage points further to p7 the few patches of hardwood dominated sub basins disappear under p7 the cotton remains the principal crop composing 45 of the watershed followed by hardwood which grows to over 13 of land cover as in fig 8 b fig 8 c also depicts a strong forest presence in southern sub basins after the initial change to np1 which continues to steadily grow up until np7 unlike fig 8 b however a closer examination reveals relatively more softwood patches as well as a few sub basins located further up north also converting to softwood sankey diagrams shed additional perspective on land use progression in scenarios n7 fig 9 and p7 fig 10 4 4 a sankey diagram for the np7 scenario followed a similar pattern to illustrations for n7 and p7 but is not presented to conserve space here the flows between years represent a transition in land use from one year to the next where width is directly proportional to the relative contribution from old crop to new crop type for example the band starting from bermuda in the first column in both a and b designates the complete transition of land from bermuda in 1997 to cotton in 1998 it should be noted that linear programming is well known to provide sparse solutions where only a few variables are selected as seen in figs 9 and 10 since the simplex algorithm searches for solutions on the vertices of the feasible region following an optimal policy implies a reduction in heterogeneity among crop selection which may in turn lead to possible deterrence in adoption by landowners 5 5 a simple example may serve to illustrate the referenced reduction in crop heterogeneity consider for a moment that only two land use options x y are permitted for which three optimal solutions exist 0 1 1 0 and ½ ½ in such a case our model will always return a solution of 0 1 or 1 0 dual values for binding constraints in our linear program commonly termed shadow prices are presented in table 7 for select model runs values in this table reflect the decline in landowner profits given a unit decrease defined as 0 000001 in the constant term i e rhs of a particular water quality constraint we highlight the n7 p7 and np7 scenarios along with n1 p1 and np1 scenarios for added context the first two columns referring to no3 n constraints reveal dual prices tend to increase every year the largest occurring in 2004 and 2001 under n1 and n7 respectively for these years we may state that tightening the constraint by one unit causes the objective value to decrease on a per unit basis of 2111 49 under n1 and 40 326 96 under n7 comparatively dual prices associated with p constraints under n1 and n7 were minimal under p1 and p7 scenarios all dual prices associated with no3 n constraints were zero concerning p constraints dual prices reach a max of 769 02 96 and 1915 85 for respective scenarios p1 and p7 the last two columns show respective dual prices for np1 and np7 as was the case in p1 in np1 dual prices linked to constraint changes associated with no3 n were zero prices linked to constraint changes associated with p however were higher when compared to n1 and p1 scenarios similarly np7 dual prices exceeded those in n7 and p7 scenarios for both no3 n and p constraints 4 5 sensitivity analysis running the optimization problem with simultaneous no3 n and p constraints can provide additional output to ascertain other individual effects from water quality mandates as well as any notable interacting effects under changes to both no3 n and p constraints from base we observe the steady increase in hardwood and softwood tends to reflect hybrid traits of the individual no3 n and p scenarios previously considered the progression of land use patterns may be analyzed more closely by examining certain combinations of specific scenarios in each of the following three distinct sets we note equal percent reductions defining the combined np constraint and those identifying solo n p constraints as confirmed in table 3 i n1 p1 and np1 ii n2 p4 and np5 iii n3 p5 and np7 under i derived welfare estimates were virtually the same across all three scenarios in ii profits under np5 were 23 6 million less than what they were under n2 and 1 2 million less than under p4 and in iii profits are 8 1 million less in np7 than what they were under p5 and 24 1 million less compared to n3 these findings show that the combined effect of requiring both water quality constraints to be met appears to exert greater losses in aggregate watershed welfare versus only having to consider lone no3 n or p constraints as right hand side limits tighten this is expected and can be explained in part by the reduced feasible region of our optimization problem a consequence of incorporating a second concurrent water quality constraint however it also observed that the scale of loss experienced in profits between solo constraint and combined constraint scenarios behave quite differently as water quality limits tighten according to specific nutrient content for example the 1 3 million loss in profits between the p scenario p4 and np scenario np5 in set ii grows to a 8 1 million loss in set iii comparatively the 22 1 million loss in profits between the n scenario and np scenario in set ii gets slightly raised to 24 1 million in set iii indeed the biophysical and socioeconomic variation across a landscape undoubtedly complicates management decisions since every hectare of a given land class is not of equal value in generating a particular ecosystem service 61 however estimates as just described are notable in that they show in monetary terms the degree to how much crop cover can be maintained while maintaining compliance with water quality standards also provided is a sense of expected impact on welfare based on competing water related policies in our case results indicate the possibility to reduce nutrient concentration considerably within a moderate range of total profit losses 20 at the most such information can play an integral role in helping set amounts for potential ambient tax or subsidy schemes commonly based on the water quality of the resource receiving the pollutant assuming the appropriate zone for measuring concentrations in the water body has been identified 62 the sankey diagrams further examine the interflow between different land use types in the most extreme cases associated with changes to no3 n and p constraints i e the n7 and p7 scenarios undoubtedly these were the scenarios in which most land use changes took place as the model encouraged the transition from agriculture to the forest due to tighter water quality constraints figs 9 and 10 are meant to visually highlight the degree of land use transition over the study time frame the number of land use transitions observed could increase or decrease dramatically dependent upon reported crop profits and associated crop loadings yet we note the likely practical feasibility from agriculture to forest remains questionable and therefore the significant crop conversion required to meet water quality constraints may manifest as a social planner s problem those areas that struggle to produce good yield perhaps marginal lands should be targeted first our optimization problem takes the general form of maximizing a real function subject to certain resource water quality constraints accordingly in the case of a less than or equal constraint such as a resource constraint a dual price represents the value of having one more unit of the resource represented by that constraint in our case we measure the amount the objective deteriorates as the rhs of the constraint was decreased by one unit as observed in table 7 the highest price was observed for the np7 2005 scenario related to the no3 n constraint while even the highest observed dual price was low in terms of calculated welfare less than one percent all else equal overall sensitivity emerges as higher in no3 n constraint linked dual prices and in many instances significantly higher such data can aid in making informed land planning decisions for meeting environmental standards for example it would be much costlier for the aggregate of landowners residing in the watershed to have to comply with a unit decrease in no3 n concentration compared with p at the minimum a range of dual price estimates tied to various scenarios can provide landowners with better planning opportunities for reducing systematic risk while complying with various water quality criteria 5 discussion our discussion primarily concerns examining trade offs involved in jointly managing land use decisions i e profit and water quality 6 6 aside from greater nutrient runoff increased agricultural lands depending on management practices can also be the source of several other ecosystem disservices including loss of wildlife habitat and greenhouse gas emissions 63 in this context pfister et al 64 seem to suggest the land water trade off rests more on the location of cultivation rather than characteristics of agricultural crop cover at a global level figs 4 and 5 reveal that after accounting for nutrient decay adjusted loads amounts were higher in sub basins located in the southern part of the lrew nearer the watershed outlet this appears logical given that sub basins closer to the outlet would be characterized by lower associated travel time and hence less nutrient decay because part of p gets carried with sediment and sediment deposits it reasons that in the case of p two factors reactions and deposition may play a prominent role in explaining the spatial variation observed in nutrient loadings succeeding derivations of average annual concentration amounts per the watershed fell well within ranges reported in prior work 65 66 based on data between 1974 and 2003 feyereisen et al 66 derived mean annual nutrient concentrations between 0 14 and 0 23 no3 n mg l and 0 19 to 0 27 p mg l for five sub watersheds contained within the larger lrew likewise for the two decades that overlap our study time frame bosch et al 65 report average annual concentration amounts of 0 13 no3 n mg l and 0 10 p mg l from 1990 to 1999 and 0 11 mg l for both no3 n and p from 2000 to 2009 cho et al 17 use the swat model to evaluate the water quality effects of conservation practice alternatives in the lrew and report validation results with wide ranging errors from 25 7 for tn to 42 for p in our results the higher concentrations in 1997 for both no3 n and p were due to the large initial year allocation to traditional row crops corn within the watershed table 6 to compare with mcls defined earlier the 0 0319 mg l no3 n computed at the watershed outlet in 1997 is well within the maximum limit of 10 mg l and remains negligible for the duration of the simulation period on the other hand the corresponding 0 1029 mg l of p just breaks the epa s recommended total phosphorus concentration of 0 10 mg l in streams not discharging directly into reservoirs this p reading was arguably somewhat unexpected since the lrew is not particularly known for water quality issues after the first year p concentrations persist slightly above naturally occurring background levels 0 02 mg l but below an amount worthy of triggering periodic algal blooms it remains critical to visualize not only the overall changes in land cover that are likely to occur because of stricter water quality mandates but also the relative impacts associated with adhering to maximum allowable amounts set for one water quality parameter i e no3 n compared to another i e p it is clear from the results fig 8 that under progressively tighter limits the watershed gradually gets converted to forestlands before the model is rendered infeasible under changing no3 n constraints this manifests in the form of softwood making up primary land use in most sub basins by n7 fig 8 a in the case of firmer p constraints fig 8 b hardwoods grow the most eventually taking over softwoods as well but to a lesser extent than the prior softwood domination observed in the end under no3 n constraints also noted was the steep rise in hardwoods from base to p1 versus base to n1 scenarios in both the individual n and p scenarios fig 8 c the sub basins that convert to majority forestland seem most prevalent along the southern reaches of the watershed such spatial patterns may be caused by affiliation with higher local nutrient content if indeed the case it seems plausible that these would be some of the first sub basins to flip to land use more conducive to meeting lower concentration limits enforced at the watershed outlet thus for constraints on p and especially no3 n interventions aimed at improving water quality are likely to occur at the detriment of agriculturally productive land these findings agree with a recent study investigating trade offs between agricultural productivity and near identical parameters describing water quality in a new zealand catchment 67 the authors suggest that agricultural land losses can be partly offset by an improvement in production on land less subject to nutrient loss although yield maximization while reducing the pressures on land can itself coincide with lower water use efficiencies 64 understanding how water quality impacts of proposed land use changes compared to impacts of baseline land use regimes is equally important in this context baseline land use may be defined as 1998 allocations since the initial land composition in 1997 was assumed fixed in the base case scenario annual no3 n concentration amounts derived for the lrew increased 61 from 1998 to 2005 p concentration rose about 29 during the same interval the observed growth in concentration amounts is not necessarily surprising even though water quality limits get more restrictive each year one may interpret that under the base scenario defined water quality limits are too large to influence land allocation decisions thus in the base scenario landowners continue to produce the most profitable crop in any given year percentage declines in no3 n concentration from 1998 to 2005 increase as the annual decline in limits grow in magnitude i e tighter limits for example under n1 and n7 scenarios no3 n concentration declines 1 8 and 99 respectively over the eight years interestingly detected under base n1 n2 and n3 scenarios p concentration had a higher concentration in 2005 compared to 1998 this could be attributed to the fact that although cotton was associated with the second highest p load behind bermuda associated no3 n loadings were relatively low thus up until some point at least it remains practical and profitable to continue agriculture producing cotton for remaining scenarios up to n7 p concentration generally declined year over year with n7 exhibiting the most significant decline in p concentration 11 1 meanwhile p scenarios showed reduced concentration in p and no3 n derived over time from 1998 to 2005 p concentration was reduced by 57 6 under p1 compared to a negative 68 6 under p7 under these same scenarios no3 n concentration declined 16 5 and 23 1 respectively the combined np scenarios follow a similar pattern where no3 n and p concentration fell by 16 6 and 57 8 respectively in np1 compared with np7 for which no3 n concentration reduced by 69 1 and p concentration decreased by 65 0 bosch et al 65 in comparison found no clear relationship among changes in land cover or management practices on nutrient loads cho et al 17 in their analysis of nps pollution impacts from different management practices found the single greatest contributor to nps pollutant reduction in the lrew was that of current riparian forest cover levels riparian forest buffers offered the most comprehensive reduction in total phosphorous 19 5 and total nitrogen 7 0 5 1 key study caveats the fundamental goal driving our study design was to provide a conceptual overview of the core model framework and demonstrate its potential with a working application nonetheless key caveats to our study follow constraints on the maximum number of hectares for each crop at a particular period may be called for since it is likely that in any given year an entire sub basin would could not convert to 100 of a certain crop of greater matter are environmental uncertainties regarding amounts of nutrient load or precipitation which in turn would affect recorded surface runoff that may warrant inclusion in future applications and similarly economic fluctuations captured through historical crop price volatility further while we assume zero nutrient loadings and zero profits in an attempt keep land categorized as extra i e any land not considered part of our six major land use categories neutral we realize in the case of barren land included as part of extra no erosion and consequently sediment and phosphorus loads are likely to occur however considering extra constitutes almost a quarter 23 of the total watershed area the current study may suffer from a limitation in this regard from a policy perspective water quality constraints which mandate increasing stringency over a nine year periodcould be regarded as too theoretical from a policy perspective to add further complexity one may argue substantial spatially distributed time lags exist between actions on the surface and the response in streams where numeric nutrient criteria must be met one solution would be to introduce appropriate time lags provided a generous dataset an alternative might involve exploiting large temporal datasets to develop optimal land use configurations for a single water quality constraint over a decadal or more climate sequence with year to year price uncertainty yet as the temporal or spatial scale increases trade offs inevitably become more ambiguous and challenging to quantify in terms of nutrient legacies swat to some degree can handle these effects but it is not the ideal tool for it even if one were to shut down all the nutrient inputs the nutrient concentrations would slowly decrease in swat simulations swat considers multiple pools for n and p each pool undergoes reactions e g transformation and decay they are also transported between different systems in the watershed it takes time for nitrate for example to move from the top of the soil to the groundwater there it remains for a while but undergoes a decay process before it is released to streams our simulation period is nearly two decades longer periods are more desirable to better capture the legacy effects additionally we acknowledge swat is not the perfect tool to capture legacy effects and other tools should be evaluated for better exploring the watershed dynamics in the study area due to such data limitations our study timeframe is restricted to nine years yet the above concerns remain valid model modifications will need to be made where deemed appropriate this also opens avenues for future research for example an additional dimension such as a particular bmp could be extended to the framework fig s5 to strategically target optimal land management regimes across the watershed contemporary bmps in the lrew have been documented to include riparian forest buffers contour farming and cover crops for conservation tillage systems 17 32 65 undoubtedly depending on the size of a particular dimension e g number of sub basins as well as the number of dimensions themselves e g incorporating additional features such as hru or management style the breadth of the problem can grow quite large lastly our new approach offers more indications to policymakers rather than landowners the swat model as described here is based on sub basins and hrus unique combinations of soil land use and slope and not set up at the farm level therefore it is harder to based on swat results provide landowners guidelines to specific crops in their fields it can however provide indications to policymakers on where certain measures can be more effective in reducing non point sources nutrients runoff at the watershed outlet moreover though the lens of policy uncertainties it is unlikely for such a nutrient limit constraint i e policy to exist exactly as we have specified but results from using the proposed model do provide generalized results of where and possibly when changes in land cover may have to be implemented to realize local water quality targets 6 conclusion this study combined estimates for nutrient load and surface runoff from a calibrated and validated swat model with profits by crop type to construct a dynamic lp problem capable of gauging impacts on aggregate watershed profits due to conforming to nutrient concentration criteria at the watershed outlet the model allows the researcher to identify dynamic patterns in land use evolution at the sub basin level our study concludes with three important findings in light of obtained results first compliance with different nutrient load criteria may produce substantial relative differences in the impact on land cover while the general pattern can be described as a shift towards forestland results can vary drastically in terms of total acres converted and forest type second compliance with prescribed limits on numeric nutrient criteria is expected to reduce aggregate landowner profit but the degree of profit reduction will directly depend on land use decisions the disparity in profits between the particular nutrient content measured i e in our case no3 n or p may be more pronounced depending on relative price differences among crops considered third a close examination of dual prices reveals sensitivity could vary greatly depending on how restrictive the water quality limits are ceteris paribus our results showed greater sensitivity as permittable concentration amounts shrank and greater dual prices associated with no3 n constraints to comparable p constraints it is essential to keep in mind this is a methods based study and should be inferred as such although the lrew is devoid of apparent water quality issues the watershed was selected in part since it served as a convenient source of comprehensive hydrological and nutrient data yet due to its relative ease in scaling up in terms of allowing for a greater number of spatial units crops or time periods as well as its capacity to take on a greater number of dimensions extensions e g perhaps incorporating crop specific management regimes associated with each spatial unit per time step we hope our model construct may serve as a general template to establish ideal cropping patterns

8642,in this paper we evaluate a randomized controlled trial in which households were given home water reports hwrs that provided recent consumption information aside a social comparison we estimate an average treatment effect of 2 4 consistent with previous literature the effects are significantly larger during months that require irrigation but are still statistically significant during non irrigation months we then investigate if the treatment effect depends on the specific message a household receives using a regression discontinuity design we find no evidence that the type of message received e g good or take action has an impact on the average response size of 2 4 in our particular setting we use these findings to motivate a discussion regarding study design in the context of rcts being used to identify heterogeneous impacts when they are not specifically designed to identify such effects specific to our study we use ex post power tests to demonstrate that our findings related to message type are likely due to sample size keywords municipal water social comparison randomized controlled trial power test data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction as providers of natural resources and energy face increasing scarcity interest in incentivizing consumer level conservation has surged because of political and legal constraints such as cost recovery pricing and equity concerns many utilities find it difficult to use pricing policies as the sole mechanism for promoting conservation instead utilities typically use a portfolio approach to manage demand increasingly relying on non pecuniary interventions such as conservation based messaging to influence behavior there are several general types of conservation based messaging a household could receive a conservation appeal with no personalized information information on their own resource consumption and conservation tips and a peer comparison with a normative message such as home water reports hwrs and home energy reports hers households could receive a single treatment or a combination of treatments and the differences between treatments within studies and across studies can be subtle the literature has consistently demonstrated that the average household responds to well designed conservation appeals 1 3 hwrs and hers with a social comparison 4 11 and in some settings simply providing personalized consumption information or conservation tips is sufficient to induce conservation 10 1 1 some studies have found no significant information provision treatment effects given certain conditions burkhardt et al 12 could not find evidence of a reduction in electricity consumption during peak hours on hot summer days in austin texas while 13 did not find evidence of a reduction in electricity consumption in university dorms where residents do not pay for the service while most types of messaging have been shown to reduce resource use in particular settings each study and setting yields slightly different results previous studies in residential electricity show that receiving hers reduces electricity consumption on average among treated households by 2 to 6 2 10 14 17 in the context of water use hwrs have been shown to reduce hourly and monthly water consumption by 1 5 to 7 with considerable heterogeneity across geographies baseline usage and the nature of the treatment 4 9 furthermore some studies have shown that her and hwr treatment effects persist over time with no reduction in effect after two years of continual treatment 5 10 while others show declining effects over time 2 5 8 in some cases the effects actually increase as the intervention continues 11 and can even spillover beyond the targeted sector 16 this paper makes several contributions first we replicate the finding that receiving an hwr reduces residential water consumption by approximately 2 4 on average among households in an urban arid environment second we find evidence that the treatment effect persists over a two year trial period is significantly larger during irrigation months and is actually largest in the final summer of treatment the latter findings are particularly important because healthy outdoor vegetation such as lawns in our setting depends on irrigation and the final summer of treatment was exceptionally dry this suggests that households in our study continued to respond to an hwr treatment even during drought conditions similar to 4 the difference in effect between irrigation and non irrigation seasons could also help explain the mixed result in the literature regarding how the effect evolves across time our final contribution uses a power test to explore mixed results in the literature regarding the impact of subtle differences in the messages households receive but we first outline some of the recent literature to provide context goette et al 18 find no evidence of differences in treatment effects between houses that were given regular feedback on their water consumption relative to informative normative or monetary incentives likewise 8 find evidence that the content of a message is less important than simply receiving a message alternatively many studies such as 1 show that receiving a social comparison along with conservation tips and a personally addressed letter has a larger effect than only receiving tips and a personal letter bhanot 9 provides evidence that peer comparison can demotivate conservation and in some cases backfire while 7 shows that the presence of an injunctive norm increases the treatment effect in the context of hwrs and peer comparison a question that naturally arises is whether the strength of the normative message e g being categorized as great good or take action relative to one s peers is important or if simply being compared to one s peers is sufficient to generate the treatment effects observed in hwr experiments several studies have attempted to answer this question with mixed results in the context of hers 10 finds no significant effect of the message received i e no categorization effect however 4 developed a cleverly designed study in which households are categorized relative to their peers based on a within household percent reduction in water consumption rather than a comparison in absolute terms as is the case with most hwrs and hers importantly their experimental design decouples the type of normative message a household receives from their pre treatment consumption brent et al 4 show that when the strength i e good or bad relative to peers of the injunctive message is uncorrelated with pre treatment use low pre treatment users reduce consumption in response to injunctive messages but when the strength of the message is correlated with pre treatment use low pre treatment users do not significantly reduce consumption in response to injunctive messages the results suggest that the strength of the message or the categorization effect matters and that one reason previous studies have not been able to identify the effect is that the normative messaging is not randomly assigned highlighting the importance of random treatment assignment in summary previous efforts to identify heterogeneity effects based on the content of the normative messages have yielded mixed results specifically some have found that the strength of the message matters 4 while others have found that it does not 10 our attempts to test for differential effects based on the strength of the normative message fall into the latter group however instead of citing this result as evidence that strength of the messaging is not important we use these findings to motivate a discussion regarding study design in the context of randomized controlled trials rcts being used to identify heterogeneous impacts when they are not specifically designed to identify such effects as is often the case throughout this literature the experiment we analyze was designed to study a single treatment this can be problematic if portions of the treatment such as the strength of the normative message were not randomly assigned or if the heterogeneous treatment effects are small relative to the sample size or the overall treatment effect in our paper we take a closer look at this third point we perform a power test to show that our experiment along with others that analyze hwrs and hers is unlikely to have sufficient statistical power to detect small differences in treatment effects between groups of customers that receive a good message relative to their peers and customers that receive a take action message relative to their peers particularly when the messaging is not randomly assigned this finding placed in the broader context of using rcts to answer questions they were not originally designed to study is the final contribution of this paper this paper proceeds as follows in section 2 we outline our experiment our study setting and our data in section 3 we describe our methodology and main results in section 4 we introduce ex post power tests and provide a discussion of the power tests in the context of the broader rct literature section 5 concludes with implications and caveats 2 experiment and hypotheses 2 1 experimental design and context in this study we evaluate an rct that began in september 2014 and for which we observe two years of data ending in september 2016 2 2 the utility implemented the rct and allowed us to evaluate the results due to a data sharing agreement we are not allowed to disclose the study location however the study location is relatively arid requiring irrigation for lawns and most outdoor vegetation the area is urban with a population of around 100 000 for the experiment 7000 households were randomly chosen for the treatment group and 4000 households for the control group households in the treatment group received a home water report hwr every two months starting at the beginning of the experiment during our sample period households in the treatment group received 12 hwrs two treatment years on the other hand households in the control group did not receive hwrs hwrs include a water score a comparison to other similar households and conservation tips specially crafted for each household type or cohort described below fig 1 is an example of the water score received by a household while fig 2 is an example of the conservation tips 3 3 the reports did not substantively change over the 2 year period to provide households with water scores each household was assigned to a cohort of similar houses each cohort is fixed across time and was defined by the household s number of occupants the size of the irrigable area and the type of residence e g single family home or multi unit for each cohort month the 52nd and the 20th percentiles of consumption were calculated each household s consumption was then compared to the 52nd and 20th percentiles of the cohort s consumption and the household was given a water score based on their relative consumption for example if the household s consumption was less than the cohort specific 20th percentile of consumption the utility assigned a water score of 1 and provided the message great if the household s consumption was greater than the cohort specific 20th percentile of consumption but less than the 52nd percentile the utility assigned a water score of 2 and provided the message good finally if the household s consumption was greater than the cohort specific 52nd percentile of consumption the utility assigned a water score of 3 and provided the message take action messages are calculated every month but treated households observe water scores once every two months one is calculated but not observed unfortunately the utility did not have data on the cohort composition which means that even though we observe the 20th percentile and the median 50th percentile consumption for each cohort it is not possible for us to back out the 52nd percentile of consumption in other words we do not observe the cutoff between water scores 2 and 3 based on this limitation we primarily focus our analysis of a categorization effect on the distinction between great and good but we explore several methods for identifying a categorization effect between the good and take action cohorts 4 4 to be clear water smart provided the utility and us with information on each cohort s 20th percentile of consumption and 50th percentile of consumption they did not provide information on which houses were included in each cohort or the 52nd percentile of consumption for each cohort this is the reason we end up using a fuzzy regression discontinuity approach at the 50th percentile of consumption later in the paper the experiment was designed to test one main hypothesis that receiving a hwr every two months reduces water consumption among the treated houses relative to the control houses on average if we find a statistically significant treatment effect then the results would suggest that households in our study respond to social comparison information provision or both consistent with previous literature 10 though our study was designed to test a single hypothesis we use the data to test three further hypotheses hypothesis 2 we test if the treatment effect reduction in water consumption is larger during the irrigation season may september as has been found in other contexts 19 if so this would suggest that irrigation is a primary water savings mechanism in our context and utilities could save money by sending home water reports only during the irrigation season hypothesis 3 we test whether the treatment effect is consistent over the 2 year treatment period or if it declines or increases over time hypothesis 4 we hypothesize that the treatment message matters meaning that households that receive a take action message will respond more than households that receive a good message and those that receive a good message will respond more than those that receive a great message 2 2 data our primary data consists of monthly water consumption in gallons per day 5 5 the utility reports total consumption over the billing cycle as billing cycles are different across customers we normalize consumption by dividing the billing cycle water use by the number of days in the cycle we also observe each household s cohort s 20th percentile and median consumption and their designated water score 6 6 again the cutoffs were the 20th percentile and 52nd percentile of consumption a cohort is defined as a group of similar houses based on square footage number of residents and average use the pre treatment consumption we observe is from january 2014 to august 2014 while the post treatment consumption is from september 2014 to september 2016 we define the irrigation season as may through september and the non irrigation season as october through april an rct is built on the assumption that in the absence of a treatment both treatment and control groups would have followed the same trend 20 22 therefore our primary identification assumption is based on the treatment and the control groups being random samples from the same population in this case the universe of residential households in the municipality for which water is provided while we assume this assumption was originally true some households opted out of the experiment or were removed from it because they moved resulting in 3713 households in the treatment group and 6441 in the control group our data do not include information about those households that left which could be a source of selection bias if households that opted out have characteristics that influence how they would respond to the treatment furthermore we flagged 90 households in the control group and 163 households in the treatment group as having non valid consumption values 0s negative values or extremely large values which were not included in the analysis to assess the random treatment assignment after attrition and cleaning we first compare sample pre treatment means and standard deviations across the treatment and control groups e g 291 45 gpd for the control group and 290 09 gpd for the treated group the results of these tests are as shown in table 1 for the two sided t test for differences in pre treatment means the calculated p value is 0 43 thus we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the mean pre treatment consumption of the treatment and control groups are equal for the two sided f test for standard deviations the p value is 0 64 so we also failed to reject the null hypothesis that the ratio of pre treatment standard deviations for treatment and control is equal to 1 we also compare household characteristics in the county assessor data to further assess the random treatment assignment several household types and key characteristics are compared in table 2 the characteristics are quite similar across the two groups having failed to reject the null that the mean and standard deviation of pre treatment consumption are statistically different for the treatment and control groups and that the characteristics of the households are similar across both groups we have no evidence to suggest that the groups were not the result of random sampling 7 7 water smart has a history of successfully performing the randomization these findings provide evidence in favor of the assumption of random assignment which is the same as assuming orthogonality of the treatment to other potentially confounding factors affecting the water consumption such as household size as the expected value of the differences between the means of all other variables affecting both groups is then zero before presenting our more complete model for average treatment effect we start the analysis by performing a simple difference in differences means test to determine if there are statistically significant responses to the treatment to do so we compare the difference in mean treated and mean control consumption after treatment relative to before treatment the results are reported in the bottom right quadrant of table 1 we find a statistically significant reduction of 6 74 gallons per day across the sample the distribution of the observed normative categories is as expected given the percentiles used for the cutoffs we observe 45 632 great messages 16 7 96 814 good messages 35 4 and 131 023 take action messages 47 9 8 8 we note that these percentages are not quite equal to 20 32 and 48 as one might expect given the within cohort consumption cutoffs for the normative categories this could be due to several factors for instance the utility s consumption data is notoriously messy so we drop outliers which we discuss previously in the data section this could result in an unbalanced panel which could affect the number of observations in each cohort additionally water smart may not always include the same number of houses in each cohort over time as the cohorts can change every two months which could also affect the number of observations in each cohort over time on the other hand the mean consumption for those who receive a great message in a given month was 93 gallons per day 191 gallons per day for those who received a good message and 428 gallons per day for those who received a take action message summary statistics are as shown in table 3 the mean number of occupants in the household is quite similar across messages with averages of 3 05 2 94 and 2 79 for the groups receiving a great good and take action messages respectively furthermore the size of the irrigable area is also very similar across households receiving different normative messages about 50 of the houses that received any normative message have a large outdoor area about 40 have a medium outdoor area about 5 have a small outdoor area and finally about 5 have a extra large outdoor area 9 9 the utility defined the outdoor area categories we do not have irrigable area square footage for each parcel but we can say that the small outdoor area group used an average of 112 gallons per day the medium outdoor area group used an average of 130 gallons per day the large outdoor area group used an average of 134 gallons per day and the extra large outdoor area group used an average of 140 gallons per day as the number of occupants and the size of the irrigable area define the cohort that a household belongs to this balance across messages is expected 3 methodology and results the methodology and results are presented in two sections first we estimate the average treatment effect and the irrigation season versus non irrigation season treatment effect second we explore several specifications to test for the existence of a categorization effect 3 1 test of hypotheses 1 3 average treatment effect irrigation season treatment effect and treatment effects over time to estimate the average treatment effect we use a difference in differences model as follows 1 l o g g p d i t β 0 τ t i p t μ m y υ i ϵ i t where l o g g p d i t is the logarithm of household i s water consumption in month of the sample t t i is a treatment indicator equal to 0 for the control group and 1 for the treatment group p t is a post treatment indicator equal to 0 in the pre treatment period and 1 in the post treatment period υ i is a household fixed effect and μ m y is a month by year fixed effect 10 10 the unit of observation is the household month in the post treatment period treated households receive the treatment every two months to account for this we assign the treatment in period t to periods t and t 1 the terms t i and p t would normally enter this equation however they are absorbed by our fixed effects we omit all variables that are absorbed by fixed effects in the equations that follow finally ϵ i t is a normally distributed error term the parameters are estimated using ordinary least squares and standard errors are clustered at the household level to allow for intra household dependence across months finally if we assume there was no contamination between the treatment and control groups 20 23 otherwise known as the stable unit treatment value assumption sutva the coefficient associated with the interaction between t i and p t denoted τ is an unbiased estimate of the average treatment effect the use of water in western us cities varies considerably across irrigation seasons and non irrigation seasons as irrigation plays an important role in total household water use during the summer months reducing water consumption could therefore differ in months that require irrigation when compared to the rest of the year and we can expect the results of the intervention to be different as well we test for differences in consumption between irrigation months and non irrigation months our second hypothesis in two ways first we use a difference in difference in difference ddd estimator to compare the results of the intervention during irrigation months from may to september with the rest of the year we define d i r r as an indicator for irrigation months i t 5 6 7 8 9 which we use to estimate the following triple differences model 2 l o g g p d i t β 0 β 1 t i d i r r β 2 p t d i r r β 3 t i p t β 4 t i p t d i r r μ m y υ i ϵ i t where p t and t i and ϵ i t are as defined as before in this setting β 4 can be interpreted as the expected proportional impact of hwrs between may and september compared to the rest of the year table 4 presents the results of estimating eq 1 in columns 1 2 and 3 in column 4 we present the results of estimating eq 2 the coefficients on t and p are omitted due to multicollinearity with the fixed effects column 1 presents our preferred specification with both household and month by year fixed effects household fixed effects are removed in column 2 and month by year fixed effects are removed in column 3 the estimated treatment effect ate is stable across specifications again indicating that the treatment is not correlated with omitted household characteristics we find a statistically significant average treatment effect ate of 2 4 confirming our first hypothesis presented in section 2 incidentally the treatment effect identified in table 1 is 6 74 290 which is approximately 2 3 to provide context we compare this value to the change in price needed to achieve a similar reduction according to 24 the elasticity of residential water consumption ranges from 0 1 to 1 8 thus our estimate suggests that to achieve similar reductions in consumption prices would have to increase by 0 2 to 4 3 notably allcott 10 finds that home energy reports result in a 2 reduction in residential energy consumption it is important to note that we cannot directly extrapolate our results to other regions but because households in our sample were randomly selected we can extrapolate the treatment effect to the population from which the sample was drawn in doing so we find that if 50 000 households in the region were provided with hwrs water consumption would decrease by 121 million gallons per year our results show column 4 of table 4 that the expected reduction in the irrigation season 3 9 is larger than the expected reduction in the non irrigation season 1 5 indicating that most of the reduction happens during the hotter months of the year this result is not surprising given that the marginal cost of reducing water consumption is less during the irrigation season when water is used more widely for outdoor use 11 11 to be clear we do not observe outdoor water use separate from indoor water use we can only assume that increases in irrigation season water use are due to outdoor watering as the study location is an arid environment furthermore it is consistent with the reduction in water consumption observed by previous studies such as 2 19 and 25 the triple differences specification is limited in that it reports the average of the treatment effects across both the 2015 and 2016 irrigation seasons to relax this assumption we employ an event study style analysis to determine if the treatment effect is consistent over the sample period and if the effect size differs across the two sample years to do so we create dummy variables for the fall of 2014 winter of 2014 15 spring of 2015 summer of 2015 fall of 2015 winter of 2015 16 spring of 2016 and summer of 2016 we then interact these dummy variables with the treatment indicator as follows 3 l o g g p d i t β 0 β 1 t i d f a l 14 β 2 t i d w i n 14 15 β 3 t i d s p r 15 β 4 t i d s u m 15 β 5 t i d f a l 15 β 6 t i d w i n 15 16 β 4 t i d s p r 16 β 4 t i d s u m 16 μ m y υ i ϵ i t we present the results of estimating eq 3 in fig 3 the circles represent the seasonal point estimates while the lines represent the 95 confidence intervals these estimates indicate that residents responded the least in the first winter of the study period winter of 2014 15 and the most in the final summer of the study period summer 2016 12 12 we note that the point estimates are not statistically different from one another this is an interesting finding because it suggests the treatment effect did not taper over the sample period the overall pattern of the findings also corresponds to the results in column 4 of table 4 in the sense that the treatment effects are lowest in the winters and highest in the summers another important point to consider is that total precipitation in the irrigation season of 2016 was roughly 1 3 of the total precipitation of the irrigation season in 2015 which means that houses were more reliant on irrigation in 2016 than 2015 a priori houses could have responded more or less to the messaging during drought conditions for instance houses could be less responsive to messaging when they are more reliant on irrigation because they need the irrigation to keep their laws green or their landscaping from dying on the other hand when rainfall is low houses use more water and therefore have greater margins for conservation which could yield larger treatment effects likewise residents may have been aware of the drought conditions in 2016 which could have made them more likely to reduce their own consumption for the public good or conversely as 4 discuss houses with prior conservation may be less likely to respond to treatment overall the treatment effects we observe indicate that houses responded more to the hwrs during the months typically associated with irrigation and the treatment effects did not subside over time 3 2 test of hypothesis 4 categorization effect in this section we perform a series of tests to explore our fourth hypothesis whether the treatment effect is a function of the social comparison message categorization that a household in the treatment group receives as the rct was not designed for this purpose categorization was not randomized across participants and is endogenous to address this identification challenge we employ several different strategies which we outline below 3 2 1 great to good we begin by using a regression discontinuity rd approach to look for a categorization effect between the great and good categories an rd identification strategy is quasi experimental 26 as it exploits the arbitrary nature of the treatment when assigning water scores for example we observe a clear cutoff between the great to good categories which allows us to assume that within a certain bandwidth households on one side of the cutoff are statistically identical to those on the other side of the cutoff and that the receipt of a particular normative message is simply a product of random variation in month to month consumption among households in the cohort hence the only meaningful difference across households within this particular bandwidth is the water score they have received 20 this assumption is also important because the messages households receive can be correlated with their usage 4 we exploit this assumption to test for a categorization effect on the cutoff from great to good the model used for the estimation is as follows 4 l o g g p d i t β 0 ρ i d 2 0 i t 0 β 1 d 2 0 i t i d 2 0 i t 0 β 2 d 2 0 i t i d 2 0 i t 0 μ m y υ i ϵ i t t i 1 p i t 1 d 2 0 i t h d 2 0 i t 0 where d 2 0 i t is the distance to the 20th percentile cutoff in the previous month t 1 13 13 the sample for the rd models are limited to t i 1 and p t 1 for example if the 20th percentile cutoff is 100 gpd and household i consumed 110 gpd in month t 1 d 2 0 i t 10 the term i d 2 0 i t 0 is an indicator function that is equal to 1 when d 2 0 i t 0 and 0 otherwise the term i d 2 0 i t 0 is an indicator function that is equal to 1 when d 2 0 i t 0 and 0 otherwise if d 2 0 i t 0 then the assigned water score in t is 2 good and if d 2 0 i t 0 then the assigned water score in t is 1 great the variable h is half the bandwidth in which we are assuming that households are statistically identical 14 14 h is half the bandwidth because we allow for above and below the cutoff both d 2 0 i t and h are measured in gallons per day finally ϵ i t is the normally distributed error term the parameters of interest are then ρ and the difference between β 1 and β 2 the parameter ρ can be seen as the discontinuity in the intercept while if there is a significant difference between β 1 and β 2 the regression discontinuity is manifested as a change in the slope we also estimate an rd specification but without allowing for different slopes as follows 5 l o g g p d i t β 0 ρ i d 2 0 i t 0 β 1 d 2 0 i t μ m y υ i ϵ i t t i 1 p i t 1 d 2 0 i t h d 2 0 i t 0 the parameter of interest is again ρ representing an intercept shift in the underlying populations on either side of the cut off table 5 presents in columns 1 and 2 the results of estimating eq 4 allowing for different slopes in columns 3 and 4 we present the results of estimating eq 5 without allowing for different slopes in both cases we present the results for two different values of the bandwidth h the results indicate that ρ is for both specifications and for every considered bandwidth h not statistically different from zero indicating that we fail to reject our hypothesis of no regression discontinuity manifested as a change in intercept slopes are in both cases positive this result is as expected since it is capturing serial autocorrelation for example we expect that the distance to the cutoff in month t 1 for house i is correlated with the distance to the cutoff in month t for house i finally when we allow for different slopes the difference between the slope on the negative side of the cutoff and on the positive side of the cutoff β 1 and β 2 is not statistically significant 15 15 when h 15 the differences between the estimated slopes is 0 0017 and the standard error for that difference is 0 002 when h 30 the difference is 0 0005 and the standard error is 0 0007 in summary we do not find evidence of a regression discontinuity indicating a categorization effect either in the shape of a bump in the linear fit ρ nor in a change in slope 3 2 2 good to take action in the previous subsection we looked for the presence of a categorization effect between the great and good categories we did not find statistical evidence of such an effect in the following section we look for the presence of a categorization effect between the good and take action categories the consumption cutoff defining houses in the good and take action categories is the 52nd percentile of consumption for each cohort which is based on the per capita consumption of each household in the cohort unfortunately we observe only the median 50th percentile this limitation imposes challenges in a regression discontinuity setting as from our perspective the water score is not deterministically defined based on the distance to the median thus we must assume it is probabilistically defined in other words being on one side or the other of the median changes the probability of being treated getting a water score of 3 this setting lends itself to a fuzzy regression discontinuity frd model to determine if there is a statistically significant categorization effect the primary difference between a sharp rd approach eq 4 and a fuzzy regression discontinuity approach frd is that we use a 2 stage least squares model where we instrument the treatment dummy variable i w s i t 3 with the dummy variable indicating if the consumption is larger than the median i d 5 0 i t 0 20 the model is then defined in eqs 6 and 7 where both ϵ i t and ξ i t are normally distributed error terms structural equation 6 l o g g p d i t β 0 ρ i w s i t 3 β 1 d 5 0 i t μ m y υ i ϵ i t t i 1 p i t 1 d 5 0 i t h d 5 0 i t 0 first stage 7 i w s i t 3 θ 0 θ 1 d 5 0 i t θ 2 i d 5 0 i t 0 ξ i t furthermore as in eq 4 we define a bandwidth h such that we can assume that households with consumption within the specified bandwidth d 5 0 i t h are statistically identical in practice we weight the observations using d 5 0 i t to give more weight to those observations closer to the fuzzy cut off the weighting function we use is as follows 8 w i t m a x 0 h d 5 0 i t h the results of jointly estimating eqs 6 and 7 are presented in table 6 the coefficient of interest is the coefficient on i w s i t 3 the coefficients are all negative but not statistically significant this provides suggestive evidence that households that received the take action message reduced their water consumption more than households that received the good message however it is likely that the effect is too small relative to the overall treatment effect to be identified with our data to better understand the limitations of our rct in identifying this effect we estimate the power of the test in section 4 4 ex post power of the test analysis in this section we use an ex post power test to understand whether or data and models have sufficient statistical power to identify categorization effects if they are present 27 deriving a statistical estimate requires understanding the probability of a false negative defined as a type ii error to do so we need to simulate the distribution of an alternative hypothesis for a given true treatment effect if the test had a high probability of detecting an increase in the treatment effect due to the categorization effect a null finding could be interpreted as no effect but if the probability of detecting the categorization effect is low for relatively large effects our experiment is likely not powerful enough to identify a reasonable categorization effect 16 16 we note that these tests do not allow us to accept a null results but had the tests indicated a high probability of detecting an effect if one were present then we could use the test results to build an argument towards a null result to be clear we can never accept the null in general posterior power is estimated using a closed interval test based on the marginal distribution of the regression coefficient β t e associated with the treatment effect we want to analyze 9 h 0 β t e β t e c r i t the cutoff or critical bound of the test statistic is β t e c r i t t 1 α 2 n m σ β t e where n is the number of observations m is the number of independent variables and σ β t e is the estimated standard error of the coefficient from the linear regression the probability that the null hypothesis is true is then the proportion of times the simulated β t e estimates are within the interval defined in eq 9 we use both methods explained in 27 to perform ex post power simulations monte carlo resampling similar to bootstrapped percentile t test and a bayesian approach to characterize the entire posterior distribution of an estimated effect size we perform the ex post power simulation test on the categorization effects between great and good for the rd model 4 1 ex post power simulation with monte carlo resampling for a sample size n and a given effect size β t e the one for which we want to estimate the power of the test we resample with replacement from the original design matrix the matrix of observed explanatory variables and from the ols residual vector the estimated errors x n n ϵ ˆ n n to generate a bootstrap data set x n n ϵ ˆ n n to keep the original structure in the variance covariance matrix where we allowed for within household auto correlation clustered standard errors we sample n households and for each household we include all observations for a total of n n which will be slightly different for each sample as the panel is unbalanced the next step is to calculate a new y n n x n n β t e ϵ ˆ n n to finally re estimate β ˆ t e for each of the m bootstrap data sets the power of the test given the true effect size is then the number of times that β ˆ t e β t e c r i t divided by the number of bootstrap samples m following 27 we use m 10 000 4 2 ex post power simulation from posterior marginal distributions the bayesian approach characterizes the entire posterior distribution of an estimated effect size for the coefficient associated with the treatment effect we assume a prior distribution with the mean equal to the effect size we want to test and we look at the proportion of times the simulated posterior distribution met the interval test defined in eq 9 the distributional assumptions for the bayesian approach are as follows 10 y i n x i β σ 2 11 π β k n 0 σ k 2 k k does not include β t e 12 π β t e n β t e σ β t e 2 13 π σ 2 n 0 σ 0 2 where the π s are prior distributions assigned to the model parameters we use diffuse priors for the variance of the β k s and σ 2 s setting σ k 2 and σ 0 2 to 10 000 strong priors are used on the treatment effect anchoring β t e to the posited effect size and using the square of the ols standard error as prior for the variance following 27 we generate 5 markov chain monte carlo mcmc chains of 6000 samples each with a burn in period of 5000 and a thinning interval of 10 to reduce autocorrelation in the chain 4 3 results of the power analysis table 7 displays the results for the ex post power simulation with monte carlo re sampling and the bayesian approach on the rd between great and good given different posited true effects and the number of households re sampled consistent with the estimated ate of 2 4 we tested the probability of identifying the categorization effect given true effect sizes of 1 2 or 3 on a sample of size n where n is the original sample size in the rd setting to identify the categorization effect between great and good a true effect of 1 would mean that treated household s that received a good message reacted by consuming 1 less than those households that received a great message on average in other words the estimated parameter ρ would be added to the treatment effect due to the categorization effect the monte carlo results in table 7 indicate that even with a categorization effect of 2 almost as large as the ate it would have been a coin toss to detect it with the data the bayesian results indicate a 21 chance of detecting a 2 categorization effect to understand why our estimation strategies perform so poorly in identifying the categorization effect we start by defining the power of the test as a function of the effect size the variance of the population and the sample size first as we borrow data from an rct designed to identify the ate of receiving hwrs we do not have the exogenous random variation in categorization that would allow for a powerful analysis instead as we rely on the bandwidth h to assume randomized categorization we are left with considerably fewer observations than the original design in other words as we rely on the bandwidth h for randomization we are using experimental data with a sample size designed to answer a specific question as the source of quasi experimental data to answer a different question as a result if we assume that an estimated coefficient β t e is significant at an 1 α level if β t e c u t o f f a large σ β t e pushes the cutoff for significance further from 0 table 8 shows the size of these standard errors for each model and the corresponding cutoff for a 95 confidence level 17 17 we tried other specifications such as a triple differences strategy but we were unable to find statistically significant categorization effects consistent with the power tests as we have such a large cutoff compared to the expected categorization effects we can conclude that the power is low based on the estimated standard errors in summary rcts have gained more traction in economics research especially in the development field where the work of abhijit banerjee esther duflo and michael kremer received the 2019 nobel prize in economics for using experiments to assess policies to reduce poverty even when some researchers argue that evidence from randomized experiments have no special priority 28 most researchers agree that randomized experiments when appropriately designed are more reliable for identifying causal effects 29 30 the theoretical foundation for using randomization as a means to identify causal effects began when 31 proposed that treatment should be allocated randomly to different units to ensure no observable characteristics of the units are reflected in the assignment this way differences between treatment and control units should reflect the impact of the treatment economic research has increasingly relied on rcts to study causal effects and this has been especially true for non pecuniary conservation interventions our work demonstrates the limits of using experimental data to test a hypothesis that the experiment was not originally designed to test palm forster et al 32 identified underpowered designs and multiple hypothesis testing as key challenges when assessing agri environmental programs and they emphasized the need for a more detailed planning during the experimental design including a power analysis in this work we empirically show that the power of the test for heterogeneous effects in the context of traditional hers and hwrs is low given the relatively small sample collected as a result of the power needed to estimate average effects 5 conclusions and discussions on average hwrs are an effective means to incentivize conservation in line with previous literature we find that the average household in our urban arid study setting reduced monthly consumption by approximately 2 4 of the 2 year trial period we also find that there is a significant increase in the treatment effect during months that require irrigation to keep lawns green yet the treatment effect remained statistically significant during non irrigation months this finding is important as utilities may need to encourage winter water conservation as well as summer water conservation a takeaway for utilities is that they could possibly see greater reductions in winter use by providing information on how to conserve water used indoors we also show that the treatment effect is persistent over the 2 year trial period and has a seasonal trend in fact the largest treatment effect we observe occurs in the final summer of treatment during a period with exceptionally low precipitation roughly 1 3 of the previous summer this indicates that households continue to respond to hwrs despite a greater need to irrigate in line with 10 we found no evidence of the existence of a categorization effect between households that received a great message relative to households that received a good message or between households that received a good message relative to households that received a take action message while many studies show that peer comparison combined with injunctive norms such as these are important drivers of conservation 7 10 we are aware of only one study that utilizes a credible study design that decouples pre treatment water consumption with the strength of the messaging to show that the content of the message matters 4 we use a power test to show that identifying a categorization effect was improbable even for large effect sizes because the rct we evaluated was designed to identify solely the average treatment effect the findings highlight the challenge of using experimental data as the source of quasi experimental data to answer a different question than the experimental data were originally designed to identify with a deeper understanding behind the mechanisms through which hwrs incentivize conservation we expect to inform utilities on how to better craft non pecuniary interventions future work should carefully design rcts to specifically identify heterogeneous treatment effects or effects of specific messaging such as randomized normative messaging cutoffs within peer groups and with an rct designed to test for the existence of alternative mechanisms that could explain the observed reduction in consumption that occurs as a result of information provision finally even when we failed to identify a categorization effect it is important to mention that we did not correct for multiple hypotheses testing future work should correct for the increased probability of incorrectly identifying a significant effect credit authorship contribution statement salvador lurbé software methodology conceptualization formal

8642,in this paper we evaluate a randomized controlled trial in which households were given home water reports hwrs that provided recent consumption information aside a social comparison we estimate an average treatment effect of 2 4 consistent with previous literature the effects are significantly larger during months that require irrigation but are still statistically significant during non irrigation months we then investigate if the treatment effect depends on the specific message a household receives using a regression discontinuity design we find no evidence that the type of message received e g good or take action has an impact on the average response size of 2 4 in our particular setting we use these findings to motivate a discussion regarding study design in the context of rcts being used to identify heterogeneous impacts when they are not specifically designed to identify such effects specific to our study we use ex post power tests to demonstrate that our findings related to message type are likely due to sample size keywords municipal water social comparison randomized controlled trial power test data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction as providers of natural resources and energy face increasing scarcity interest in incentivizing consumer level conservation has surged because of political and legal constraints such as cost recovery pricing and equity concerns many utilities find it difficult to use pricing policies as the sole mechanism for promoting conservation instead utilities typically use a portfolio approach to manage demand increasingly relying on non pecuniary interventions such as conservation based messaging to influence behavior there are several general types of conservation based messaging a household could receive a conservation appeal with no personalized information information on their own resource consumption and conservation tips and a peer comparison with a normative message such as home water reports hwrs and home energy reports hers households could receive a single treatment or a combination of treatments and the differences between treatments within studies and across studies can be subtle the literature has consistently demonstrated that the average household responds to well designed conservation appeals 1 3 hwrs and hers with a social comparison 4 11 and in some settings simply providing personalized consumption information or conservation tips is sufficient to induce conservation 10 1 1 some studies have found no significant information provision treatment effects given certain conditions burkhardt et al 12 could not find evidence of a reduction in electricity consumption during peak hours on hot summer days in austin texas while 13 did not find evidence of a reduction in electricity consumption in university dorms where residents do not pay for the service while most types of messaging have been shown to reduce resource use in particular settings each study and setting yields slightly different results previous studies in residential electricity show that receiving hers reduces electricity consumption on average among treated households by 2 to 6 2 10 14 17 in the context of water use hwrs have been shown to reduce hourly and monthly water consumption by 1 5 to 7 with considerable heterogeneity across geographies baseline usage and the nature of the treatment 4 9 furthermore some studies have shown that her and hwr treatment effects persist over time with no reduction in effect after two years of continual treatment 5 10 while others show declining effects over time 2 5 8 in some cases the effects actually increase as the intervention continues 11 and can even spillover beyond the targeted sector 16 this paper makes several contributions first we replicate the finding that receiving an hwr reduces residential water consumption by approximately 2 4 on average among households in an urban arid environment second we find evidence that the treatment effect persists over a two year trial period is significantly larger during irrigation months and is actually largest in the final summer of treatment the latter findings are particularly important because healthy outdoor vegetation such as lawns in our setting depends on irrigation and the final summer of treatment was exceptionally dry this suggests that households in our study continued to respond to an hwr treatment even during drought conditions similar to 4 the difference in effect between irrigation and non irrigation seasons could also help explain the mixed result in the literature regarding how the effect evolves across time our final contribution uses a power test to explore mixed results in the literature regarding the impact of subtle differences in the messages households receive but we first outline some of the recent literature to provide context goette et al 18 find no evidence of differences in treatment effects between houses that were given regular feedback on their water consumption relative to informative normative or monetary incentives likewise 8 find evidence that the content of a message is less important than simply receiving a message alternatively many studies such as 1 show that receiving a social comparison along with conservation tips and a personally addressed letter has a larger effect than only receiving tips and a personal letter bhanot 9 provides evidence that peer comparison can demotivate conservation and in some cases backfire while 7 shows that the presence of an injunctive norm increases the treatment effect in the context of hwrs and peer comparison a question that naturally arises is whether the strength of the normative message e g being categorized as great good or take action relative to one s peers is important or if simply being compared to one s peers is sufficient to generate the treatment effects observed in hwr experiments several studies have attempted to answer this question with mixed results in the context of hers 10 finds no significant effect of the message received i e no categorization effect however 4 developed a cleverly designed study in which households are categorized relative to their peers based on a within household percent reduction in water consumption rather than a comparison in absolute terms as is the case with most hwrs and hers importantly their experimental design decouples the type of normative message a household receives from their pre treatment consumption brent et al 4 show that when the strength i e good or bad relative to peers of the injunctive message is uncorrelated with pre treatment use low pre treatment users reduce consumption in response to injunctive messages but when the strength of the message is correlated with pre treatment use low pre treatment users do not significantly reduce consumption in response to injunctive messages the results suggest that the strength of the message or the categorization effect matters and that one reason previous studies have not been able to identify the effect is that the normative messaging is not randomly assigned highlighting the importance of random treatment assignment in summary previous efforts to identify heterogeneity effects based on the content of the normative messages have yielded mixed results specifically some have found that the strength of the message matters 4 while others have found that it does not 10 our attempts to test for differential effects based on the strength of the normative message fall into the latter group however instead of citing this result as evidence that strength of the messaging is not important we use these findings to motivate a discussion regarding study design in the context of randomized controlled trials rcts being used to identify heterogeneous impacts when they are not specifically designed to identify such effects as is often the case throughout this literature the experiment we analyze was designed to study a single treatment this can be problematic if portions of the treatment such as the strength of the normative message were not randomly assigned or if the heterogeneous treatment effects are small relative to the sample size or the overall treatment effect in our paper we take a closer look at this third point we perform a power test to show that our experiment along with others that analyze hwrs and hers is unlikely to have sufficient statistical power to detect small differences in treatment effects between groups of customers that receive a good message relative to their peers and customers that receive a take action message relative to their peers particularly when the messaging is not randomly assigned this finding placed in the broader context of using rcts to answer questions they were not originally designed to study is the final contribution of this paper this paper proceeds as follows in section 2 we outline our experiment our study setting and our data in section 3 we describe our methodology and main results in section 4 we introduce ex post power tests and provide a discussion of the power tests in the context of the broader rct literature section 5 concludes with implications and caveats 2 experiment and hypotheses 2 1 experimental design and context in this study we evaluate an rct that began in september 2014 and for which we observe two years of data ending in september 2016 2 2 the utility implemented the rct and allowed us to evaluate the results due to a data sharing agreement we are not allowed to disclose the study location however the study location is relatively arid requiring irrigation for lawns and most outdoor vegetation the area is urban with a population of around 100 000 for the experiment 7000 households were randomly chosen for the treatment group and 4000 households for the control group households in the treatment group received a home water report hwr every two months starting at the beginning of the experiment during our sample period households in the treatment group received 12 hwrs two treatment years on the other hand households in the control group did not receive hwrs hwrs include a water score a comparison to other similar households and conservation tips specially crafted for each household type or cohort described below fig 1 is an example of the water score received by a household while fig 2 is an example of the conservation tips 3 3 the reports did not substantively change over the 2 year period to provide households with water scores each household was assigned to a cohort of similar houses each cohort is fixed across time and was defined by the household s number of occupants the size of the irrigable area and the type of residence e g single family home or multi unit for each cohort month the 52nd and the 20th percentiles of consumption were calculated each household s consumption was then compared to the 52nd and 20th percentiles of the cohort s consumption and the household was given a water score based on their relative consumption for example if the household s consumption was less than the cohort specific 20th percentile of consumption the utility assigned a water score of 1 and provided the message great if the household s consumption was greater than the cohort specific 20th percentile of consumption but less than the 52nd percentile the utility assigned a water score of 2 and provided the message good finally if the household s consumption was greater than the cohort specific 52nd percentile of consumption the utility assigned a water score of 3 and provided the message take action messages are calculated every month but treated households observe water scores once every two months one is calculated but not observed unfortunately the utility did not have data on the cohort composition which means that even though we observe the 20th percentile and the median 50th percentile consumption for each cohort it is not possible for us to back out the 52nd percentile of consumption in other words we do not observe the cutoff between water scores 2 and 3 based on this limitation we primarily focus our analysis of a categorization effect on the distinction between great and good but we explore several methods for identifying a categorization effect between the good and take action cohorts 4 4 to be clear water smart provided the utility and us with information on each cohort s 20th percentile of consumption and 50th percentile of consumption they did not provide information on which houses were included in each cohort or the 52nd percentile of consumption for each cohort this is the reason we end up using a fuzzy regression discontinuity approach at the 50th percentile of consumption later in the paper the experiment was designed to test one main hypothesis that receiving a hwr every two months reduces water consumption among the treated houses relative to the control houses on average if we find a statistically significant treatment effect then the results would suggest that households in our study respond to social comparison information provision or both consistent with previous literature 10 though our study was designed to test a single hypothesis we use the data to test three further hypotheses hypothesis 2 we test if the treatment effect reduction in water consumption is larger during the irrigation season may september as has been found in other contexts 19 if so this would suggest that irrigation is a primary water savings mechanism in our context and utilities could save money by sending home water reports only during the irrigation season hypothesis 3 we test whether the treatment effect is consistent over the 2 year treatment period or if it declines or increases over time hypothesis 4 we hypothesize that the treatment message matters meaning that households that receive a take action message will respond more than households that receive a good message and those that receive a good message will respond more than those that receive a great message 2 2 data our primary data consists of monthly water consumption in gallons per day 5 5 the utility reports total consumption over the billing cycle as billing cycles are different across customers we normalize consumption by dividing the billing cycle water use by the number of days in the cycle we also observe each household s cohort s 20th percentile and median consumption and their designated water score 6 6 again the cutoffs were the 20th percentile and 52nd percentile of consumption a cohort is defined as a group of similar houses based on square footage number of residents and average use the pre treatment consumption we observe is from january 2014 to august 2014 while the post treatment consumption is from september 2014 to september 2016 we define the irrigation season as may through september and the non irrigation season as october through april an rct is built on the assumption that in the absence of a treatment both treatment and control groups would have followed the same trend 20 22 therefore our primary identification assumption is based on the treatment and the control groups being random samples from the same population in this case the universe of residential households in the municipality for which water is provided while we assume this assumption was originally true some households opted out of the experiment or were removed from it because they moved resulting in 3713 households in the treatment group and 6441 in the control group our data do not include information about those households that left which could be a source of selection bias if households that opted out have characteristics that influence how they would respond to the treatment furthermore we flagged 90 households in the control group and 163 households in the treatment group as having non valid consumption values 0s negative values or extremely large values which were not included in the analysis to assess the random treatment assignment after attrition and cleaning we first compare sample pre treatment means and standard deviations across the treatment and control groups e g 291 45 gpd for the control group and 290 09 gpd for the treated group the results of these tests are as shown in table 1 for the two sided t test for differences in pre treatment means the calculated p value is 0 43 thus we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the mean pre treatment consumption of the treatment and control groups are equal for the two sided f test for standard deviations the p value is 0 64 so we also failed to reject the null hypothesis that the ratio of pre treatment standard deviations for treatment and control is equal to 1 we also compare household characteristics in the county assessor data to further assess the random treatment assignment several household types and key characteristics are compared in table 2 the characteristics are quite similar across the two groups having failed to reject the null that the mean and standard deviation of pre treatment consumption are statistically different for the treatment and control groups and that the characteristics of the households are similar across both groups we have no evidence to suggest that the groups were not the result of random sampling 7 7 water smart has a history of successfully performing the randomization these findings provide evidence in favor of the assumption of random assignment which is the same as assuming orthogonality of the treatment to other potentially confounding factors affecting the water consumption such as household size as the expected value of the differences between the means of all other variables affecting both groups is then zero before presenting our more complete model for average treatment effect we start the analysis by performing a simple difference in differences means test to determine if there are statistically significant responses to the treatment to do so we compare the difference in mean treated and mean control consumption after treatment relative to before treatment the results are reported in the bottom right quadrant of table 1 we find a statistically significant reduction of 6 74 gallons per day across the sample the distribution of the observed normative categories is as expected given the percentiles used for the cutoffs we observe 45 632 great messages 16 7 96 814 good messages 35 4 and 131 023 take action messages 47 9 8 8 we note that these percentages are not quite equal to 20 32 and 48 as one might expect given the within cohort consumption cutoffs for the normative categories this could be due to several factors for instance the utility s consumption data is notoriously messy so we drop outliers which we discuss previously in the data section this could result in an unbalanced panel which could affect the number of observations in each cohort additionally water smart may not always include the same number of houses in each cohort over time as the cohorts can change every two months which could also affect the number of observations in each cohort over time on the other hand the mean consumption for those who receive a great message in a given month was 93 gallons per day 191 gallons per day for those who received a good message and 428 gallons per day for those who received a take action message summary statistics are as shown in table 3 the mean number of occupants in the household is quite similar across messages with averages of 3 05 2 94 and 2 79 for the groups receiving a great good and take action messages respectively furthermore the size of the irrigable area is also very similar across households receiving different normative messages about 50 of the houses that received any normative message have a large outdoor area about 40 have a medium outdoor area about 5 have a small outdoor area and finally about 5 have a extra large outdoor area 9 9 the utility defined the outdoor area categories we do not have irrigable area square footage for each parcel but we can say that the small outdoor area group used an average of 112 gallons per day the medium outdoor area group used an average of 130 gallons per day the large outdoor area group used an average of 134 gallons per day and the extra large outdoor area group used an average of 140 gallons per day as the number of occupants and the size of the irrigable area define the cohort that a household belongs to this balance across messages is expected 3 methodology and results the methodology and results are presented in two sections first we estimate the average treatment effect and the irrigation season versus non irrigation season treatment effect second we explore several specifications to test for the existence of a categorization effect 3 1 test of hypotheses 1 3 average treatment effect irrigation season treatment effect and treatment effects over time to estimate the average treatment effect we use a difference in differences model as follows 1 l o g g p d i t β 0 τ t i p t μ m y υ i ϵ i t where l o g g p d i t is the logarithm of household i s water consumption in month of the sample t t i is a treatment indicator equal to 0 for the control group and 1 for the treatment group p t is a post treatment indicator equal to 0 in the pre treatment period and 1 in the post treatment period υ i is a household fixed effect and μ m y is a month by year fixed effect 10 10 the unit of observation is the household month in the post treatment period treated households receive the treatment every two months to account for this we assign the treatment in period t to periods t and t 1 the terms t i and p t would normally enter this equation however they are absorbed by our fixed effects we omit all variables that are absorbed by fixed effects in the equations that follow finally ϵ i t is a normally distributed error term the parameters are estimated using ordinary least squares and standard errors are clustered at the household level to allow for intra household dependence across months finally if we assume there was no contamination between the treatment and control groups 20 23 otherwise known as the stable unit treatment value assumption sutva the coefficient associated with the interaction between t i and p t denoted τ is an unbiased estimate of the average treatment effect the use of water in western us cities varies considerably across irrigation seasons and non irrigation seasons as irrigation plays an important role in total household water use during the summer months reducing water consumption could therefore differ in months that require irrigation when compared to the rest of the year and we can expect the results of the intervention to be different as well we test for differences in consumption between irrigation months and non irrigation months our second hypothesis in two ways first we use a difference in difference in difference ddd estimator to compare the results of the intervention during irrigation months from may to september with the rest of the year we define d i r r as an indicator for irrigation months i t 5 6 7 8 9 which we use to estimate the following triple differences model 2 l o g g p d i t β 0 β 1 t i d i r r β 2 p t d i r r β 3 t i p t β 4 t i p t d i r r μ m y υ i ϵ i t where p t and t i and ϵ i t are as defined as before in this setting β 4 can be interpreted as the expected proportional impact of hwrs between may and september compared to the rest of the year table 4 presents the results of estimating eq 1 in columns 1 2 and 3 in column 4 we present the results of estimating eq 2 the coefficients on t and p are omitted due to multicollinearity with the fixed effects column 1 presents our preferred specification with both household and month by year fixed effects household fixed effects are removed in column 2 and month by year fixed effects are removed in column 3 the estimated treatment effect ate is stable across specifications again indicating that the treatment is not correlated with omitted household characteristics we find a statistically significant average treatment effect ate of 2 4 confirming our first hypothesis presented in section 2 incidentally the treatment effect identified in table 1 is 6 74 290 which is approximately 2 3 to provide context we compare this value to the change in price needed to achieve a similar reduction according to 24 the elasticity of residential water consumption ranges from 0 1 to 1 8 thus our estimate suggests that to achieve similar reductions in consumption prices would have to increase by 0 2 to 4 3 notably allcott 10 finds that home energy reports result in a 2 reduction in residential energy consumption it is important to note that we cannot directly extrapolate our results to other regions but because households in our sample were randomly selected we can extrapolate the treatment effect to the population from which the sample was drawn in doing so we find that if 50 000 households in the region were provided with hwrs water consumption would decrease by 121 million gallons per year our results show column 4 of table 4 that the expected reduction in the irrigation season 3 9 is larger than the expected reduction in the non irrigation season 1 5 indicating that most of the reduction happens during the hotter months of the year this result is not surprising given that the marginal cost of reducing water consumption is less during the irrigation season when water is used more widely for outdoor use 11 11 to be clear we do not observe outdoor water use separate from indoor water use we can only assume that increases in irrigation season water use are due to outdoor watering as the study location is an arid environment furthermore it is consistent with the reduction in water consumption observed by previous studies such as 2 19 and 25 the triple differences specification is limited in that it reports the average of the treatment effects across both the 2015 and 2016 irrigation seasons to relax this assumption we employ an event study style analysis to determine if the treatment effect is consistent over the sample period and if the effect size differs across the two sample years to do so we create dummy variables for the fall of 2014 winter of 2014 15 spring of 2015 summer of 2015 fall of 2015 winter of 2015 16 spring of 2016 and summer of 2016 we then interact these dummy variables with the treatment indicator as follows 3 l o g g p d i t β 0 β 1 t i d f a l 14 β 2 t i d w i n 14 15 β 3 t i d s p r 15 β 4 t i d s u m 15 β 5 t i d f a l 15 β 6 t i d w i n 15 16 β 4 t i d s p r 16 β 4 t i d s u m 16 μ m y υ i ϵ i t we present the results of estimating eq 3 in fig 3 the circles represent the seasonal point estimates while the lines represent the 95 confidence intervals these estimates indicate that residents responded the least in the first winter of the study period winter of 2014 15 and the most in the final summer of the study period summer 2016 12 12 we note that the point estimates are not statistically different from one another this is an interesting finding because it suggests the treatment effect did not taper over the sample period the overall pattern of the findings also corresponds to the results in column 4 of table 4 in the sense that the treatment effects are lowest in the winters and highest in the summers another important point to consider is that total precipitation in the irrigation season of 2016 was roughly 1 3 of the total precipitation of the irrigation season in 2015 which means that houses were more reliant on irrigation in 2016 than 2015 a priori houses could have responded more or less to the messaging during drought conditions for instance houses could be less responsive to messaging when they are more reliant on irrigation because they need the irrigation to keep their laws green or their landscaping from dying on the other hand when rainfall is low houses use more water and therefore have greater margins for conservation which could yield larger treatment effects likewise residents may have been aware of the drought conditions in 2016 which could have made them more likely to reduce their own consumption for the public good or conversely as 4 discuss houses with prior conservation may be less likely to respond to treatment overall the treatment effects we observe indicate that houses responded more to the hwrs during the months typically associated with irrigation and the treatment effects did not subside over time 3 2 test of hypothesis 4 categorization effect in this section we perform a series of tests to explore our fourth hypothesis whether the treatment effect is a function of the social comparison message categorization that a household in the treatment group receives as the rct was not designed for this purpose categorization was not randomized across participants and is endogenous to address this identification challenge we employ several different strategies which we outline below 3 2 1 great to good we begin by using a regression discontinuity rd approach to look for a categorization effect between the great and good categories an rd identification strategy is quasi experimental 26 as it exploits the arbitrary nature of the treatment when assigning water scores for example we observe a clear cutoff between the great to good categories which allows us to assume that within a certain bandwidth households on one side of the cutoff are statistically identical to those on the other side of the cutoff and that the receipt of a particular normative message is simply a product of random variation in month to month consumption among households in the cohort hence the only meaningful difference across households within this particular bandwidth is the water score they have received 20 this assumption is also important because the messages households receive can be correlated with their usage 4 we exploit this assumption to test for a categorization effect on the cutoff from great to good the model used for the estimation is as follows 4 l o g g p d i t β 0 ρ i d 2 0 i t 0 β 1 d 2 0 i t i d 2 0 i t 0 β 2 d 2 0 i t i d 2 0 i t 0 μ m y υ i ϵ i t t i 1 p i t 1 d 2 0 i t h d 2 0 i t 0 where d 2 0 i t is the distance to the 20th percentile cutoff in the previous month t 1 13 13 the sample for the rd models are limited to t i 1 and p t 1 for example if the 20th percentile cutoff is 100 gpd and household i consumed 110 gpd in month t 1 d 2 0 i t 10 the term i d 2 0 i t 0 is an indicator function that is equal to 1 when d 2 0 i t 0 and 0 otherwise the term i d 2 0 i t 0 is an indicator function that is equal to 1 when d 2 0 i t 0 and 0 otherwise if d 2 0 i t 0 then the assigned water score in t is 2 good and if d 2 0 i t 0 then the assigned water score in t is 1 great the variable h is half the bandwidth in which we are assuming that households are statistically identical 14 14 h is half the bandwidth because we allow for above and below the cutoff both d 2 0 i t and h are measured in gallons per day finally ϵ i t is the normally distributed error term the parameters of interest are then ρ and the difference between β 1 and β 2 the parameter ρ can be seen as the discontinuity in the intercept while if there is a significant difference between β 1 and β 2 the regression discontinuity is manifested as a change in the slope we also estimate an rd specification but without allowing for different slopes as follows 5 l o g g p d i t β 0 ρ i d 2 0 i t 0 β 1 d 2 0 i t μ m y υ i ϵ i t t i 1 p i t 1 d 2 0 i t h d 2 0 i t 0 the parameter of interest is again ρ representing an intercept shift in the underlying populations on either side of the cut off table 5 presents in columns 1 and 2 the results of estimating eq 4 allowing for different slopes in columns 3 and 4 we present the results of estimating eq 5 without allowing for different slopes in both cases we present the results for two different values of the bandwidth h the results indicate that ρ is for both specifications and for every considered bandwidth h not statistically different from zero indicating that we fail to reject our hypothesis of no regression discontinuity manifested as a change in intercept slopes are in both cases positive this result is as expected since it is capturing serial autocorrelation for example we expect that the distance to the cutoff in month t 1 for house i is correlated with the distance to the cutoff in month t for house i finally when we allow for different slopes the difference between the slope on the negative side of the cutoff and on the positive side of the cutoff β 1 and β 2 is not statistically significant 15 15 when h 15 the differences between the estimated slopes is 0 0017 and the standard error for that difference is 0 002 when h 30 the difference is 0 0005 and the standard error is 0 0007 in summary we do not find evidence of a regression discontinuity indicating a categorization effect either in the shape of a bump in the linear fit ρ nor in a change in slope 3 2 2 good to take action in the previous subsection we looked for the presence of a categorization effect between the great and good categories we did not find statistical evidence of such an effect in the following section we look for the presence of a categorization effect between the good and take action categories the consumption cutoff defining houses in the good and take action categories is the 52nd percentile of consumption for each cohort which is based on the per capita consumption of each household in the cohort unfortunately we observe only the median 50th percentile this limitation imposes challenges in a regression discontinuity setting as from our perspective the water score is not deterministically defined based on the distance to the median thus we must assume it is probabilistically defined in other words being on one side or the other of the median changes the probability of being treated getting a water score of 3 this setting lends itself to a fuzzy regression discontinuity frd model to determine if there is a statistically significant categorization effect the primary difference between a sharp rd approach eq 4 and a fuzzy regression discontinuity approach frd is that we use a 2 stage least squares model where we instrument the treatment dummy variable i w s i t 3 with the dummy variable indicating if the consumption is larger than the median i d 5 0 i t 0 20 the model is then defined in eqs 6 and 7 where both ϵ i t and ξ i t are normally distributed error terms structural equation 6 l o g g p d i t β 0 ρ i w s i t 3 β 1 d 5 0 i t μ m y υ i ϵ i t t i 1 p i t 1 d 5 0 i t h d 5 0 i t 0 first stage 7 i w s i t 3 θ 0 θ 1 d 5 0 i t θ 2 i d 5 0 i t 0 ξ i t furthermore as in eq 4 we define a bandwidth h such that we can assume that households with consumption within the specified bandwidth d 5 0 i t h are statistically identical in practice we weight the observations using d 5 0 i t to give more weight to those observations closer to the fuzzy cut off the weighting function we use is as follows 8 w i t m a x 0 h d 5 0 i t h the results of jointly estimating eqs 6 and 7 are presented in table 6 the coefficient of interest is the coefficient on i w s i t 3 the coefficients are all negative but not statistically significant this provides suggestive evidence that households that received the take action message reduced their water consumption more than households that received the good message however it is likely that the effect is too small relative to the overall treatment effect to be identified with our data to better understand the limitations of our rct in identifying this effect we estimate the power of the test in section 4 4 ex post power of the test analysis in this section we use an ex post power test to understand whether or data and models have sufficient statistical power to identify categorization effects if they are present 27 deriving a statistical estimate requires understanding the probability of a false negative defined as a type ii error to do so we need to simulate the distribution of an alternative hypothesis for a given true treatment effect if the test had a high probability of detecting an increase in the treatment effect due to the categorization effect a null finding could be interpreted as no effect but if the probability of detecting the categorization effect is low for relatively large effects our experiment is likely not powerful enough to identify a reasonable categorization effect 16 16 we note that these tests do not allow us to accept a null results but had the tests indicated a high probability of detecting an effect if one were present then we could use the test results to build an argument towards a null result to be clear we can never accept the null in general posterior power is estimated using a closed interval test based on the marginal distribution of the regression coefficient β t e associated with the treatment effect we want to analyze 9 h 0 β t e β t e c r i t the cutoff or critical bound of the test statistic is β t e c r i t t 1 α 2 n m σ β t e where n is the number of observations m is the number of independent variables and σ β t e is the estimated standard error of the coefficient from the linear regression the probability that the null hypothesis is true is then the proportion of times the simulated β t e estimates are within the interval defined in eq 9 we use both methods explained in 27 to perform ex post power simulations monte carlo resampling similar to bootstrapped percentile t test and a bayesian approach to characterize the entire posterior distribution of an estimated effect size we perform the ex post power simulation test on the categorization effects between great and good for the rd model 4 1 ex post power simulation with monte carlo resampling for a sample size n and a given effect size β t e the one for which we want to estimate the power of the test we resample with replacement from the original design matrix the matrix of observed explanatory variables and from the ols residual vector the estimated errors x n n ϵ ˆ n n to generate a bootstrap data set x n n ϵ ˆ n n to keep the original structure in the variance covariance matrix where we allowed for within household auto correlation clustered standard errors we sample n households and for each household we include all observations for a total of n n which will be slightly different for each sample as the panel is unbalanced the next step is to calculate a new y n n x n n β t e ϵ ˆ n n to finally re estimate β ˆ t e for each of the m bootstrap data sets the power of the test given the true effect size is then the number of times that β ˆ t e β t e c r i t divided by the number of bootstrap samples m following 27 we use m 10 000 4 2 ex post power simulation from posterior marginal distributions the bayesian approach characterizes the entire posterior distribution of an estimated effect size for the coefficient associated with the treatment effect we assume a prior distribution with the mean equal to the effect size we want to test and we look at the proportion of times the simulated posterior distribution met the interval test defined in eq 9 the distributional assumptions for the bayesian approach are as follows 10 y i n x i β σ 2 11 π β k n 0 σ k 2 k k does not include β t e 12 π β t e n β t e σ β t e 2 13 π σ 2 n 0 σ 0 2 where the π s are prior distributions assigned to the model parameters we use diffuse priors for the variance of the β k s and σ 2 s setting σ k 2 and σ 0 2 to 10 000 strong priors are used on the treatment effect anchoring β t e to the posited effect size and using the square of the ols standard error as prior for the variance following 27 we generate 5 markov chain monte carlo mcmc chains of 6000 samples each with a burn in period of 5000 and a thinning interval of 10 to reduce autocorrelation in the chain 4 3 results of the power analysis table 7 displays the results for the ex post power simulation with monte carlo re sampling and the bayesian approach on the rd between great and good given different posited true effects and the number of households re sampled consistent with the estimated ate of 2 4 we tested the probability of identifying the categorization effect given true effect sizes of 1 2 or 3 on a sample of size n where n is the original sample size in the rd setting to identify the categorization effect between great and good a true effect of 1 would mean that treated household s that received a good message reacted by consuming 1 less than those households that received a great message on average in other words the estimated parameter ρ would be added to the treatment effect due to the categorization effect the monte carlo results in table 7 indicate that even with a categorization effect of 2 almost as large as the ate it would have been a coin toss to detect it with the data the bayesian results indicate a 21 chance of detecting a 2 categorization effect to understand why our estimation strategies perform so poorly in identifying the categorization effect we start by defining the power of the test as a function of the effect size the variance of the population and the sample size first as we borrow data from an rct designed to identify the ate of receiving hwrs we do not have the exogenous random variation in categorization that would allow for a powerful analysis instead as we rely on the bandwidth h to assume randomized categorization we are left with considerably fewer observations than the original design in other words as we rely on the bandwidth h for randomization we are using experimental data with a sample size designed to answer a specific question as the source of quasi experimental data to answer a different question as a result if we assume that an estimated coefficient β t e is significant at an 1 α level if β t e c u t o f f a large σ β t e pushes the cutoff for significance further from 0 table 8 shows the size of these standard errors for each model and the corresponding cutoff for a 95 confidence level 17 17 we tried other specifications such as a triple differences strategy but we were unable to find statistically significant categorization effects consistent with the power tests as we have such a large cutoff compared to the expected categorization effects we can conclude that the power is low based on the estimated standard errors in summary rcts have gained more traction in economics research especially in the development field where the work of abhijit banerjee esther duflo and michael kremer received the 2019 nobel prize in economics for using experiments to assess policies to reduce poverty even when some researchers argue that evidence from randomized experiments have no special priority 28 most researchers agree that randomized experiments when appropriately designed are more reliable for identifying causal effects 29 30 the theoretical foundation for using randomization as a means to identify causal effects began when 31 proposed that treatment should be allocated randomly to different units to ensure no observable characteristics of the units are reflected in the assignment this way differences between treatment and control units should reflect the impact of the treatment economic research has increasingly relied on rcts to study causal effects and this has been especially true for non pecuniary conservation interventions our work demonstrates the limits of using experimental data to test a hypothesis that the experiment was not originally designed to test palm forster et al 32 identified underpowered designs and multiple hypothesis testing as key challenges when assessing agri environmental programs and they emphasized the need for a more detailed planning during the experimental design including a power analysis in this work we empirically show that the power of the test for heterogeneous effects in the context of traditional hers and hwrs is low given the relatively small sample collected as a result of the power needed to estimate average effects 5 conclusions and discussions on average hwrs are an effective means to incentivize conservation in line with previous literature we find that the average household in our urban arid study setting reduced monthly consumption by approximately 2 4 of the 2 year trial period we also find that there is a significant increase in the treatment effect during months that require irrigation to keep lawns green yet the treatment effect remained statistically significant during non irrigation months this finding is important as utilities may need to encourage winter water conservation as well as summer water conservation a takeaway for utilities is that they could possibly see greater reductions in winter use by providing information on how to conserve water used indoors we also show that the treatment effect is persistent over the 2 year trial period and has a seasonal trend in fact the largest treatment effect we observe occurs in the final summer of treatment during a period with exceptionally low precipitation roughly 1 3 of the previous summer this indicates that households continue to respond to hwrs despite a greater need to irrigate in line with 10 we found no evidence of the existence of a categorization effect between households that received a great message relative to households that received a good message or between households that received a good message relative to households that received a take action message while many studies show that peer comparison combined with injunctive norms such as these are important drivers of conservation 7 10 we are aware of only one study that utilizes a credible study design that decouples pre treatment water consumption with the strength of the messaging to show that the content of the message matters 4 we use a power test to show that identifying a categorization effect was improbable even for large effect sizes because the rct we evaluated was designed to identify solely the average treatment effect the findings highlight the challenge of using experimental data as the source of quasi experimental data to answer a different question than the experimental data were originally designed to identify with a deeper understanding behind the mechanisms through which hwrs incentivize conservation we expect to inform utilities on how to better craft non pecuniary interventions future work should carefully design rcts to specifically identify heterogeneous treatment effects or effects of specific messaging such as randomized normative messaging cutoffs within peer groups and with an rct designed to test for the existence of alternative mechanisms that could explain the observed reduction in consumption that occurs as a result of information provision finally even when we failed to identify a categorization effect it is important to mention that we did not correct for multiple hypotheses testing future work should correct for the increased probability of incorrectly identifying a significant effect credit authorship contribution statement salvador lurbé software methodology conceptualization formal

8643,ecosystem accounting produces data on ecosystems their condition and the services they provide in a consistent and comparable form with the system of national accounts sna this study focused on accounting of recreational ecosystem services in the context of freshwaters in finland we used georeferenced data to measure the extent and condition of ecosystems available for recreation and representative population data to measure the actual use of the services in the monetary valuation of the recreational service we applied the simulated exchange value method which has been developed for the monetary valuation of non market ecosystem services in accordance with the sna we extend the simulated exchange value method to incorporate the effect of water quality on the number and monetary value of recreational visits keywords ecosystem accounting recreation non market valuation simulated exchange value water quality data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nature and ecosystems are essential for human life and well being in the literature the contributions of ecosystems to human well being are commonly described with the concept of ecosystem services 1 2 in order to facilitate the mainstreaming of ecosystem services into economic development and planning discussions efforts have been made to develop accounting to monitor and measure the state of ecosystems and their ability to provide ecosystem services the aim has been to develop an accounting system that would complement national accounts which are an important tool for societal planning and decision making but which do not consider the environmental impacts of economic activities or the value of benefits provided by nature to society as a result the ecosystem accounting framework has been developed the aim of ecosystem accounting is to produce data on ecosystems their condition and the ecosystem services they provide in a form that is consistent and comparable with the economic data in the system of national accounts sna 3 since ecosystem accounting is a relatively new field different approaches and perspectives are still developing and only a limited number of studies have explored the practical feasibility of the framework 4 in particular there is a need for empirical examples on how to incorporate environmental quality in ecosystem accounting for various ecosystem services 5 in this study we tested how the recreational services of freshwater ecosystems can be presented in the accounting framework and particularly how the impact of water quality on the monetary value of the use of recreational ecosystem services can be captured and presented in the accounting the united nations system of environmental accounting ecosystem accounting seea ea provides common principles and concepts regarding how to measure and organize information on the extent and condition of ecosystems and the services they generate and it works as a starting point for developing ecosystem accounting at the national level 6 in practice the seea ea framework for ecosystem accounting consists of i ecosystem extent and condition accounts which present biophysical information on the extent and quality of different ecosystem types and ii supply and use accounts for ecosystem services which record the actual flow of ecosystem services to people 6 use accounts are presented in both physical and monetary terms while physical accounts present the actual use of ecosystem services monetary use accounting enables a comparison of the value of ecosystem services with other sna records the monetary valuation of ecosystem service use needs to follow the valuation principles of the sna in which the goods and services are valued at their exchange values i e at the prices they are traded at 7 8 this is a challenge for many ecosystem services such as recreational ecosystem services which are not typically traded on the markets while a variety of environmental valuation methods have been developed to measure the economic value of non market ecosystem services for policy and project evaluation e g contingent valuation 9 10 and travel cost methods 11 12 their use in valuation in the ecosystem accounting context is not entirely straightforward they measure the monetary value of welfare changes due to changes in the state of the environment or of ecosystem services the welfare changes are measured in terms of consumer surplus i e the maximum amount of money individuals are willing to pay for a specified improvement in environmental quality 13 in contrast the sna measures economic activity rather than welfare and the monetary values in the sna represent the prices at which the products and services are actually traded i e exchange values not individuals maximum willingness to pay for them 14 nevertheless environmental valuation methods can also be useful in the ecosystem accounting context one proposed method for monetary valuation in ecosystem accounting is the simulated exchange value sev 14 sev utilizes traditional environmental valuation studies but they are used for producing estimates of the exchange value of ecosystem services the method builds on the demand curves obtained for ecosystem services using valuation methods the demand curves are combined with the supply functions for providing these services and as a result yield a simulated exchange value for the ecosystem services in question that could hypothetically occur if the ecosystem services were provided on the markets recreational services belong to cultural ecosystem services that are defined in seea ea as the perceived or realized qualities of ecosystems whose existence and functioning enables a range of cultural benefits including recreational benefits to be derived 6 their use and value are affected not only by the quality of the environment but also by human infrastructure and services as enjoying recreational services usually requires various types of facilities equipment transportation and infrastructure such as access to nature 4 the characteristics and conditions of the ecosystems also affects their recreational use and its value 15 19 as recreational visitors might prefer certain ecosystem and landscape characteristics over others for a review see barton et al 4 the use and value of water recreation in particular have been shown to be significantly associated with different characteristics of the water environment such as water clarity the absence of blue green algal blooms and a low tendency for sliming e g ahtiainen et al 20 lankia et al 21 bertram et al 22 the challenge in recreational ecosystem services accounting is to measure the use of ecosystems for recreational purposes and determine the contribution of the ecosystems and their conditions to the use and its value 4 in previous studies focusing on recreational ecosystem services accounting different approaches have been employed to measure the use of recreational services and its monetary value vallecillo et al 23 defined the availability of recreational services as the extent of high quality recreational areas available for daily recreation and they quantified the use of recreational services based on the number of people living over different distances from these areas the predicted use of recreational areas was then valued in monetary terms using the travel cost method horlings et al 24 assessed the monetary accounting value of nature based recreation in the netherlands based on consumer expenditure on nature based recreation and a hedonic pricing model of the impact of natural areas on housing prices in a study focusing on cultural ecosystem services in france martin et al 25 measured the use of recreational services with the frequency of recreational visits and used the household production function approach for monetary valuation in a pilot study on ecosystem accounting in the us warnell et al 26 focused the accounting of recreational ecosystem services on birdwatching and measured the use of recreational services in terms of the number of birding days but due to data limitations did not measure the monetary value of this use in our approach we use georeferenced data to measure the extent and condition of inland water ecosystems available for recreation and representative population data to measure the actual use of the services in the monetary valuation of the use we apply the simulated exchange value method which we extend to incorporate the effect of water quality on both the number and the monetary value of recreational visits the sev method has previously been applied in studies by caparrós et al 14 grilli et al 27 and lankia et al 28 caparrós et al 14 used sev with the contingent valuation method to estimate site specific demands and value for the main recreational areas in andalusia 14 grilli et al 27 applied sev with demand curves for a recreational ecosystem that they derived from the results of a choice experiment study lankia et al 28 in nordic open access conditions based their measurement of the use of ecosystem services on the number of recreational visits by individuals derived from national statistics on outdoor recreation for valuation they applied sev in previous studies the associations of water quality and recreational use and benefits have not yet been integrated with ecosystem accounting here we fill the gap in empirical approaches for recreation accounting by presenting an approach to integrating the impact of water quality on recreational use and its monetary value in ecosystem accounting we apply national statistics for recreational visits and the sev method for valuation but we extend the approach from previous studies to integrate the effect of water quality on the number and monetary value of the visits to develop our approach for recreational ecosystem services accounting we focus on freshwaters in finland where surface water areas are important for recreation as nearly 10 of finland s area is covered by water surface water areas are used by residents living near lakes and rivers but also by owners and users of ca 500 000 leisure homes 29 to reduce the computational burden of spatial data we perform the accounting for the region of pirkanmaa in southern finland instead of covering the whole country for the ecosystem extent and condition account in physical terms we use georeferenced data to calculate and map the extent and condition of water systems available for recreational use in the use account we assess the recreational use of water ecosystems based on representative population data on the demand for outdoor recreation in finland to assess the association between ecosystem condition here the water quality of the water bodies with the monetary value of recreational ecosystem service use we build a model based on the simulated markets for recreational visits as a starting point we use the sev method which we extend to incorporate the effect of water quality on the number and monetary value of the visits we build the sev model based on spatial data on the supply and quality of water recreation areas and the number of residents in the area as well as on the empirically estimated demand curve for swimming visits in finland the rest of the paper is structured as follows the next section presents the case study area the region of pirkanmaa and the data and methods used in the study the third section presents the results of the pilot accounting finally the discussion and conclusions address the strengths and limitations of our esa approach 2 data and methods 2 1 case study to develop our approach and test it with pilot accounts for freshwater recreation we selected the pirkanmaa region with an area of 14 600 km2 as a case study area fig 1 the national level ecosystem services account was applied to the regional level due to the computational burden related to gis data 1 1 the computational burden of the gis calculation depends on the number of watersheds and shorelines the size and distribution of the population and the number of buildings in the study area due to the high number of buildings and watersheds in the pirkanmaa region the computational burden is above average compared to other regions in finland the spatial analysis consisted of the development of the calculation method and the calculation the calculation took 3 4 working days extending the analysis to the national level would require one to two months of additional computation work from the various regions in finland pirkanmaa was selected because it does not border sea areas and only freshwaters are available for recreation approximately 14 of the total land cover comprises inland waters pirkanmaa and the city of tampere are among the fastest growing and urbanized regions in finland outside the helsinki metropolitan area more than 500 000 residents live in pirkanmaa and nearly half of these 235 000 in the city of tampere to apply the ecosystem accounting for water based recreation in the pirkanmaa region we used the following data for the accounts the extent and condition accounts the total length of open shoreline available in the pirkanmaa region for public recreational use categorized according to the ecological quality of the water systems the use account in physical terms the total number of swimming visits and other water recreational visits by the inhabitants of the pirkanmaa region and the total number of visits divided according to water systems with a different ecological status the use account in monetary terms the monetary value of swimming visits by the pirkanmaa inhabitants in the pirkanmaa region the monetary value is assessed for swimming visits only due to limitations in the data available for the monetary valuation 2 2 the extent and condition accounts georeferenced data on water bodies and their quality we used a gis based approach to measure and describe the extent and conditions of ecosystems available for water recreation the focus was on considering the degree of developed shoreline and the ecological quality of surface waters in the pirkanmaa region to accomplish this several datasets were used the topographic database of the national land survey of finland nls 2016 is a vector format dataset depicting the terrain of the whole of finland it includes road networks buildings and constructions administrative borders land use waterways and elevation the product belongs to the open data of the national land survey of finland the monitoring system of spatial structure and urban form ykr 2017 is a spatial dataset based on an urban rural regional classification system produced by the finnish environment institute syke it describes the densely populated areas in finland the water bodies according to the water framework directive vhs dataset 2016 of syke consists of polygon data determining the borders of surface waters and includes a considerable amount of data describing the properties of the watersheds e g the ecological quality of surface waters the product belongs to the open datasets of syke vhs watershed data do not include all watersheds and the ranta10 dataset of syke was therefore used for small watersheds not covered by vhs data statistics finland s population grid dataset 2016 1 km 1 km describes the distribution of the population according to age groups it is an open dataset and depicts the population distribution independent of administrative areas such as municipal borders information about the location and properties of beaches and swimming places was derived from the lipas sports facility gis database 30 which is an open data source provided by the university of jyväskylä furthermore national outdoor recreation demand inventory data lvvi of natural resources institute finland luke was used to obtain estimates of water recreation visits by different age groups in the pirkanmaa region 31 in the extent and condition calculations the degree of developed shoreline and the ecological quality of surface waters 32 were determined shorelines located outside an urban area were classified into open shores in public use and closed or built up shores only for landowners furthermore shorelines were classified into five different ecological quality classes according to the ecological state of the water bodies bad poor moderate good and high 32 regarding shorelines inside urban areas only the length of the shoreline in different ecological quality classes was considered these classifications were carried out separately for lakes and rivers in the case of lakes both watersheds and islands larger than 1 ha in size were included regarding rivers those more than 5 m in width were included in the analysis buildings that prevent public access to the shore e g residential buildings leisure homes saunas were distinguished from the topographic database in next phase 100 m buffer zones were created around these buildings 2 2 swimming in watersheds belongs in finland to the public right of access to nature for recreational purposes regardless of who owns the land but there are some restrictions it is not allowed to walk through a yard area to the beach disturb the domestic peace or otherwise cause a disturbance or harm that could be evaluated to be larger than minimal finnish legislation does not determine exactly the size of the yard area but it varies case by case we applied 100 m distance laurila and kalliola 2019 to determine the size of the yard area shorelines were clipped by the buffer zones and openness closedness information was assigned to shoreline segments fig 2 information about densely and sparsely populated areas was assigned to shorelines in a similar way in the case of rivers the two shorelines were considered separately in order to avoid a situation where a building situated near one shoreline would also close the shoreline on the opposite bank of the river 2 3 the use account in physical terms national outdoor recreation demand inventory data the use account is based on the national outdoor recreation demand inventory lvvi comprising population level survey data on participation in outdoor recreation in finland the data n 8895 are based on random sampling and cover the finnish adult population aged between 15 and 74 years the survey was carried out in 2009 and 2010 together with statistics finland lvvi data are collected every 10 years and the newest data collected in 2019 2020 were not yet available when conducting this research the lvvi data include measurements of 1 the number of outdoor recreation visits or recreation occasions 2 a description of the destination areas 3 measurements of travel costs that are used to estimate the value of visits in monetary terms and 4 socio economic background information on the respondents the data also include more specific information on swimming and other water recreation activities of finns in this study the data allowed us to calculate the total number of water recreation and swimming visits by pirkanmaa residents in this study we focused on water based outdoor activities in the pirkanmaa region applying population mean and median values for recreation participation in the region number of survey participants in the pirkanmaa region n 845 and the number of visits in the region mean and median values as well as distributions were corrected with calibrated survey weights to estimate the total number of recreationists and visits in pirkanmaa data on recreation participation and the number of recreation visits in pirkanmaa were combined with the number of inhabitants in pirkanmaa obtained from the population data 33 the lvvi dataset also provided a basis for the monetary valuation of the swimming visits the travel cost model for the monetary value of swimming visits 21 used in the sev application of this study was based on lvvi data 2 4 the use account in monetary terms monetary valuation of recreation visits with the simulated exchange value method 2 4 1 basic methodology the monetary valuation of water recreation more precisely swimming visits was based on simulated exchange value sev methodology a method suggested by caparrós et al 34 the objective of the method is to simulate the market and a corresponding exchange value for an ecosystem service for which there is no market price the sev method relies on a simulated or counterfactual market equilibrium for ecosystem services where theoretical suppliers of ecosystem services sell the services to their users 6 14 to simulate real market behavior the suppliers optimize the pricing of ecosystem services to maximize their profits given the consumers demand for the services the demand is based on an econometric demand model obtained from an environmental valuation study see below solving the constructed market equilibrium provides simulated price estimates for services that in the real world are not priced since the price estimates are based on market equilibrium the price is interpreted as the exchange value and is directly applicable to ecosystem accounting the supply of services in the method is defined based on the relevant cost structure and competitive environment 14 we measured the monetary value of swimming visits at different water quality levels according to the simulated exchange value of the visits but the available data did not allow us to distinguish the relative value contributions of ecosystems and the recreational facilities at the swimming sites united nations et al 6 p 191 192 199 the sev procedure of this study is summarized in fig 3 the procedure is presented in detail in sections 2 4 2 2 4 5 readers mainly interested in the empirical results may wish to move directly to the results in section 3 one could argue that the sev methodology and the idea of a hypothetical market equilibrium is fundamentally contradictory with the fact that in finland freshwater recreation is open access however the very aim of the sev approach is to estimate the exchange value for an ecosystem service that does not currently have a market price to this end one examines a hypothetical reality that can be used for estimating possible exchange values from the known consumer preferences these estimates heavily depend on assumptions related to the market structure and the cost of providing these services although such exchange value estimates are inaccurate they provide guidance on their possible magnitude 2 4 2 sev demand model in our application the demand for recreation is defined as the number of swimming visits to water bodies in the pirkanmaa region the demand estimate is based on population grid data 1 km 1 km from statistics finland the rate of participation in swimming in the pirkanmaa region and an empirically estimated demand curve for swimming visits 21 the demand curve for swimming visits is based on an empirical travel cost model contingent behavior model e g parsons et al 35 for swimming visits in finland 21 where an expected number of swimming visits μ i for an individual i is determined by the travel costs incurred from travelling to the swimming place i e beach socio demographic variables x i and the perceived water quality of the swimming place i i the variables x i of the original empirical model include the travel costs incurred from travelling to the swimming place and individual socio demographic characteristics however as we simultaneously describe the behavior of all inhabitants of a grid cell we cannot use the socio demographic information for the individuals in the sev model but the individual is assumed to be a representative agent for the whole population in that grid cell hence in our sev model the expected number of swimming visits μ i for an individual i is assumed to depend on the travel costs 3 3 there is an ongoing debate in ea on whether the opportunity cost of time should be included in the travel costs in the seea it is said that the costs of travelling may include the opportunity cost of time to travel and visit the site 6 p 197 while for example pelletier et al 2021 justified the exclusion of the opportunity cost of time in ea on the grounds that the cost of leisure time is not taken into account in the national accounting either here the opportunity cost of time was included in the travel costs because it was included in the existing valuation study 21 applied in the sev application the opportunity cost of time was included according to a standard approach in travel cost method literature as 1 3 net hourly income per adult time spent on round trip from home to the swimming site it is good to note that if the cost of time had not been taken into account the cost of travel for walkers and cyclists would have been zero which would have implied a zero exchange value for walkers and cyclists it would have underestimated the value of swimming visits taking place in the walking or cycling distance from one s home and water quality only the water quality of the swimming place i is given by a vector of quality indicators dummies that is i i g o o d i p o o r naturally only one of the dummies can have a value of one at each beach if both dummies are zero then the water quality is ordinary in the demand model 21 good water quality is defined as water in which the bottom of the water body can be seen from the surface at a depth of over 2 m and there is no sliming on piers or rocks poor water quality is defined as water in which the bottom can be seen from a depth of less than 1 m and sliming is abundant or sliming can be felt on the skin during or after swimming good water quality is assumed to correspond to the ecological class excellent and poor water quality to the class satisfactory or worse see section 2 2 the extent and condition accounts georeferenced data on water bodies and their quality respectively ordinary water quality is assumed to correspond to the ecological class good for a detailed description of the demand model and the associated data see lankia et al 21 given that the estimated travel cost model is a negative binomial model the expected number of visits is μ i μ x i i i where μ x i i i a exp β t c x i γ i i here parameter β t c is the travel cost parameter and vector γ contains the parameters for different water quality levels 4 4 values for the parameters are derived from ref 21 where β t c is 0 06 γ for good water quality is 0 54 and γ for poor water quality is 0 40 travel cost km are defined as eur 0 59 km based on the average travel cost per trip eur 6 5 divided by average distance 11 km these parameters are obtained from the travel cost model in lankia et al 21 parameter a is a scaling factor that is used for calibrating the aggregate number of swimming visits to match with the aggregate swimming statistics in the lvvi data the value of a is equal in all the grid cells the model is estimated for finnish conditions where there is open public access to unbuilt shorelines and visitors are not charged an access fee i e the price of swimming is zero nevertheless due to the positive distance from homes to swimming places swimmers face positive travel costs i e x 0 in the sev model we estimate theoretical prices that would exist if access would not be free but the suppliers would set a positive price for visits to be able to estimate the effect of a positive price on visit demand we assume that the demand effect of the price equals the effect of the travel costs which is given by the coefficient β t c 0 hence both increased travel costs and positive prices decrease the expected number of visits by an individual given these assumptions we can reformulate the expected number of visits to take into account the impact of a positive price μ p i x i i i a exp p i x i β t c γ i i the aggregate demand n for swimming visits is obtained simply by multiplying the number of people who participate in swimming activities n i in each grid cell with the expected number of visits and summing over all the grid cells 1 n i n i μ p i x i i i here we assume that the swimmers from each grid cell only go to a single swimming place hence a unique price travel distance and water quality is linked to the swimmers of each grid cell swimming place selection is based on utility maximization the choice is affected by the three factors pricing distance and water quality the details are provided next in connection with the pricing problem of suppliers 2 4 3 sev supply model in the supply side of the sev model the starting point is the swimming places which are not located side by side but there is a non negligible distance between them since swimmers face travel costs that increase with distance they prefer to visit nearby swimming places hence the hypothetical beach owners would have market power over the swimmers living nearby we assume that the variable costs of producing recreational opportunities in swimming places are negligible 5 5 the fixed costs of establishing a swimming place however are nonnegligible in the sev approach we assume that fixed costs are high enough to prevent the establishment of new swimming places and the swimmers need to choose between existing places the market power arises from the facts that the swimmers incur travel costs and swimming places cannot be established next to each other in addition we assume that there will be no congestion at swimming places and an unlimited supply of services is available in such a setting the supply decision is a pricing decision in which the swimming place owner tries to maximize revenues from the swimming place the pricing is constrained by the swimmers reactivity to price increases and by the price competition between the two swimming places to obtain a pricing rule for the swimming places we examine the simplest case of two competing swimming places between which people are assumed to live on a line segment 6 6 the supply model is a variant of the 41 location model however in this setup the suppliers cannot decide the location of their beach but they can choose the price of the swimming services at their beach people are assumed to be uniformly distributed along the line and their number is normalized to unity the distance between the two swimming places is x which is measured in travel cost units i e euros 7 7 since the distance is measured in travel costs the travel costs and distance are the same in the model in the sev model we use the terms travel cost and distance interchangeably thus the density function of the uniform distribution is a constant x 1 from these two swimming places people prefer the one that yields a higher utility and they will always go there the level of utility is jointly determined by the disutility from travel costs and price and the utility from higher water quality as the swimmers balance between different components of utility a swimming place with high water quality can attract people even if there is a lower quality swimming place nearer to them the equilibrium determines a point on the line segment x 1 that divides the line segment into two regimes in which all the swimmers go the same swimming place we call this point a separating distance let us name the swimming place owners as 1 and 2 given the prices p i and quality dummy vectors i i for beaches i 1 2 and negligible variable costs swimming place owner 1 has revenues r 1 p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 p 1 d p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 x where the number of visits i e demand to swimming place 1 is given by d 1 p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 x x 1 0 x 1 p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 x μ p 1 x i 1 d x this demand formulation utilizes the fact that all the swimmers living between distance in travel cost x 0 x 1 p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 x go to swimming place 1 and their expected number of visits is μ p 1 x i 1 the function x 1 p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 x is the separating distance which we define without loss of generality as a distance from swimming place 1 here we use the fact that price p and travel cost x have an equal effect on visit intensity note that the water quality effect i i is also included in both the number of visits and the separating distance x 1 p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 x to fully specify the demand and the resulting revenues the separating distance x 1 p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 needs to be determined we assume that the separation is based on utility i e swimmers go to the swimming place that yields a higher utility for them swimmers located at the separation points are indifferent between the swimming places in the present model we can associate higher utility with a higher number of visits hence the separation i e indifference condition equalizes the number of visits to both swimming places μ p 1 x 1 i 1 μ p 2 x x 1 i 2 here we have replaced the distance to swimming place 2 with x x 1 where x is the distance between the two swimming places as the equation shows both the prices of the swimming places and their water quality affect the separating distance given the exponential structure of the demand function this is equivalent to equalization of the arguments that is a swimmer is indifferent between swimming places when β t c p 1 β t c x 1 q β q i q 1 β t c p 2 β t c x x 1 q β q i q 2 the water quality summation terms pick the corresponding water quality level i e q g o o d p o o r if the water quality is ordinary then i g o o d i p o o r 0 the separating distance from swimming place 1 x 1 is directly obtained as x 1 1 2 x p 1 p 2 β t c 1 q β q i q 1 i q 2 note that with this formulation x 1 can obtain both negative values and values greater than x with negative values all the swimmers go to swimming place 2 and with values greater than x all the swimmers go to swimming place 1 to keep the separating distance x 1 0 x we increase negative values to zero and reduce the excessively large values to x formally the separating distance is given as a function 2 x 1 p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 x max 0 min 1 2 x p 1 p 2 β t c 1 q β q i q 1 i q 2 x with the separating distance we have specified the demand and the resulting revenues of swimming place owner 1 analogously we can define the revenues of beach owner 2 2 4 4 simulated market equilibrium sev in the equilibrium both swimming place owners maximize their revenues given the actions of the other swimming place owner hence the equilibrium constitutes a nash equilibrium revenue maximizing pricing decisions for both i 1 2 can be written compactly using the separating distances x i for i 1 2 see appendix 3 p i 2 β t c 1 e β t c x i 2 e β t c x i where the separating distance x 1 is given by equation 2 and x 2 x x 1 interestingly water quality has only an indirect effect on pricing through separating distances x i the equilibrium price increases as a function of the separating distance when the separating distance grows large i e x i the price approaches p i β t c 1 which is equal to the average consumer surplus of a single visit as implied by the empirical demand model hence if swimming places are far from each other the swimming place owner can extract all the surplus the market equilibrium is a price vector p 1 p 2 which solves the above system of equations consisting of optimal pricing decisions 3 and the separating distances 2 we solve the equilibrium numerically with matlab the equilibrium is solved for each 1 k m 1 km grid cell the equilibrium is based on a swimming place choice between the two closest available swimming places 8 8 the assumption is likely to bias the exchange values upwards we elaborate this point in the discussion section the equilibrium is determined by the distance between these swimming places x and the quality information i 1 and i 2 the equilibrium determines the prices p 1 and p 2 and the separating distance x 1 which then indicates which swimming place is chosen by the swimmers of the grid cell in question finally the number of swimming visits is calculated using the price travel distance and quality information in equation 1 the simulated exchange value of swimming recreation is v i p i n i μ p i x i i i where each grid cell i is connected to a unique swimming place determined by the equilibrium with price distance and quality indicated by p i x i and i i respectively 2 4 5 application we apply the above described data sets and the sev model to estimate the accounting value of swimming recreation in the pirkanmaa region we apply the model with two types of distance data sets for each inhabited square kilometer grid point in the pirkanmaa region the first dataset consists of the distance of grid points center points of 1 km 1 km grid cells to the nearest and second nearest official swimming places with environmental quality information beaches the second dataset consists of the distance of grid points to any nearest and second nearest water body water bodies we focus on the first data set but we use the second data set for sensitivity analysis to produce the needed datasets a grid format 1 km 1 km population dataset was first converted to a point dataset points were positioned at the centers of the grid cells inhabited points were chosen and euclidean distances from these points to the nearest and second nearest supervised or unsupervised beach and to the lakeshore were calculated fig 4 9 9 in the spatial analysis we used open access population data with a regularly spaced grid of points 1 km 1 km to calculate the euclidean distances to swimming places and water bodies the rather sparse point grid compared to the data on exact locations of swimming places and lakes and the use of euclidean distances instead of distances along the roads cause some inaccuracies in the measured distances with these two simplifications we kept the calculation burden in sensible limits an alternative approach could be to use the centroids of waterbodies instead of the exact locations of swimming places and shorelines to keep the accuracy of different datasets at about same level however for large waterbodies it could cause large additional errors the pricing formula 3 suggests that relative distance errors imply relative pricing errors of a similar magnitude the shorter the distance between the two beaches is the higher are the relative errors in the distances which implies higher pricing errors therefore the centroid approach could be too inaccurate if the distance between the beaches is relatively short only those lakes that had information about the ecological quality of the watershed were chosen to be included in the analysis lakes that were located outside of the pirkanmaa region were also taken into account so that when a center point was located near the border of pirkanmaa the nearest or second nearest lake could be located outside of pirkanmaa finally information about the quality of the watershed and the number of inhabitants in each grid cell was connected to the distance table in the calculation of the monetary value of swimming visits in the pirkanmaa region the number of visits is based on the above described demand models and the number of swimmers in each grid in the above described demand model swimming takes place in either the nearest or second nearest swimming place since in reality swimmers do not always go to the two nearest beaches the second assumption together with the euclidean distances used suggests that our sev is based on underestimated travel costs to correct this we recalibrated 10 10 the recalibration was performed for demand levels so that the baseline demand would be correct the scale of the demand does not affect the pricing decision and the recalibration did not therefore alter the exchange values the demand levels to match with the visit frequency levels in the lvvi swimming data see details in the results section the number of swimmers in each population grid n i was calculated using the age distribution for the population and the participation rate in swimming in different age groups based on the lvvi data for grid points that did not have age distribution information the regional average age was used the model generates prices for the nearest two beaches for each population grid cell all the swimmers in the grid cell face these prices and this affects the choice of swimming place and the frequency of swimming visits water quality coding of the demand model data and the ecological quality data of the spatial data were not the same therefore we recoded the ecological quality data to match the demand model specification in the recoding we identified the ecological quality levels excellent good and satisfactory passable poor with demand model levels good ordinary and poor respectively also see the section sev demand model note that the ecological state good i e the demand model s ordinary was dominant in the data set ca 60 3 results 3 1 ecosystem extent and condition accounts waters available for recreation the total length of shoreline in the pirkanmaa region is 13 307 km of which 11 424 km is lake shoreline and 1883 km river shoreline tables 1 and 2 present the classification of the shorelines in more detail according to the gis analysis in rural areas about 47 of the lake shoreline and 83 of the river shoreline is unbuilt and thus open for public recreation in the pirkanmaa region fig 5 in densely populated urban areas the classification of shorelines into built up shorelines and those that are open for recreational use is difficult due to the large numbers of buildings with different purposes based on the gis data there is no easy way to separate built but publicly accessible shorelines from built shorelines that are only used by the landowners therefore we only provide the estimated total length of shoreline in urban areas most of the lakes in urban areas are in good or even excellent ecological condition table 1 in rural areas about two thirds of the closed lake shoreline and slightly less than half of the open lake shoreline has a good or excellent ecological status in the majority of rivers the ecological status is good or satisfactory table 2 according to the data the closest beach is located on average around 5 km from residents in pirkanmaa and of the closest beaches 68 have a good or excellent ecological status table 3 3 1 1 use account in physical terms number of water recreation visits the actual use of recreation ecosystem services in the pirkanmaa region was assessed based on the national outdoor recreation survey data according to the data more than two thirds namely 70 6 of pirkanmaa residents participate annually in swimming in natural waters the mean for the finnish adult population is 69 5 48 4 in boating 42 6 in fishing and 7 1 in long distance skating 11 11 http www metla fi metinfo monikaytto lvvi tilastot 2010 alueittain harrastukset htm of all recreation visits made by residents in pirkanmaa 48 take place close to home within walking distance of the resident s home the same estimate for the whole of finland is 46 and for the helsinki metropolitan area 61 of all close to home recreation visits 12 12 http www metla fi metinfo monikaytto lvvi tilastot 2010 alueittain lahiulkoilu htm according to lvvi data supplemented with population data pirkanmaa residents annually make ca 15 8 million water based recreation visits within the pirkanmaa region of these visits ca 4 9 million are swimming occasions table 5 the data did not reveal the type of water body river or lake the visits were made to 3 2 use account in monetary terms the accounting value of the swimming visits 3 2 1 monetary value of swimming visits with current observed water quality to obtain the best possible estimates for the monetary value the level of swimming visit demand in the sev model was calibrated to correspond with the total number of swimming visits in the pirkanmaa region observed in the lvvi data 4 9 million the population data together with the lvvi data give the number of potential swimmers in a grid cell see the data and methods section while the demand model gives the swimming visit frequency in each grid cell as a function of the travel costs and the water quality of the water bodies the simplifying assumptions about the choice of swimming place lead to an imprecise estimate for the aggregate swimming demand therefore we calibrated the aggregate level of swimming demand at the zero price level to the observed number of swimming occasions in the pirkanmaa region i e 4 9 million annual visits see previous section the same calibration was performed for both the beach and the water body datasets hence with both datasets the sev model yields 4 9 million annual visits if the price is fixed to zero in the sev methodology a market equilibrium is solved and positive simulated price levels are obtained calculating the sev equilibrium for the beach data set resulted in a mean price of 2 7 visit the equilibrium number of annual visits was 4 1 million which is lower than the actual observed number of visits with zero price as the simulated positive price level reduces the swimming activity together they implied a total annual value of 11 1 million for swimming recreation in the pirkanmaa region under the current water quality while these results are based on data on official swimming places i e beaches in the pirkanmaa region to test the sensitivity of the results to the swimming place data we also solved the sev equilibrium for another dataset in which swimming places were not restricted to official beaches but any unbuilt shoreline could be used for swimming clearly the distances to the nearest water bodies are systematically shorter than to official beaches the shorter distances imply lower equilibrium prices as expected the mean price was lower 2 5 visit for the water body data correspondingly the number of annual visits was higher 4 2 million the total value with water body data was 10 4 million per year which is relatively close to the value obtained with the beach dataset hence our calculation suggests that the values are relatively insensitive to slight changes in the underlying data 3 2 2 water quality effects to examine how changes in water quality affect the accounting value we performed counterfactual analysis in which the water qualities of all swimming places both beaches and water bodies were equalized to good ordinary or poor levels these results are presented in table 6 as expected the value of the ecosystem service depends on its quality interestingly with the beach dataset the value reaction is notably stronger than with the water body dataset with the beach dataset a state where the water quality is uniformly good yields a 4 6 million higher value than the current state with the water body data the value increase is only 1 1 million correspondingly uniform poor quality leads to value reductions of 5 0 million and 5 9 million with the beach and water body datasets respectively note that in the uniform quality counterfactuals the pricing is not affected by the quality this is because in the counterfactuals the quality dummies cancel each other out in equation 2 and therefore neither the separating distances nor the equilibrium prices depend on quality as a result the equilibrium prices are the same in all the counterfactuals the intuition is that the separating distances are the same because when all water bodies have the same water quality water quality does not affect which of the two nearest beaches individuals visit in the beach data the separating distances are systematically greater than in the water body data which implies a higher price level in the former on the other hand the numbers of visits are almost the same in both datasets when qualities are uniform and the annual numbers of visits differ in the second decimal this is explained by the almost equal relative demand effect of the counterfactual quality uniformity and the same original calibration of the total demand level table 6 presents the sev results mean price of a visit number of annual visits in the pirkanmaa region and annual value of the ecosystem service in the pirkanmaa region for the current real world conditions current state and for the counterfactual conditions where all swimming places have a uniform water quality all good all ordinary or all poor the results are presented for both beach and water body datasets 4 discussion and conclusions ecosystem accounting is a promising initiative on the route towards mainstreaming the state of ecosystems and their contribution to human well being into economic development and planning discussions however it is still in the development phase and requires the testing of different approaches and the production of experimental accounts for different ecosystem services in this study the focus was on the recreational ecosystem services of inland waters we presented an approach for including the ecological quality of water ecosystems in accounting of recreational ecosystem services and particularly for how to acknowledge it in defining the accounting value of recreational ecosystem service use the accounting value of swimming visits was determined with the sev method building on spatial data on the extent and conditions of water bodies observed data on the number of recreational visits and a national level travel cost model the main advantage of our approach compared to previous studies is that it yields the accounting value of swimming visits based on spatial data on the supply and quality of water recreation opportunities and empirical data on the sensitivity of swimmers to the costs of swimming visits and water quality by regularly updating the underlying datasets and the potential changes in swimmers preferences the model could be used to produce the up to date accounting value of swimming visits on a regular basis when compared to previous studies on the economic value of outdoor recreation in finland the estimated exchange value i e price per swimming visit 1 7 2 7 is as expected somewhat lower than the estimates of the consumer surplus of water recreation vesterinen et al 36 estimated the consumer surplus of water recreation visits to be 6 3 19 0 per visit and lankia et al 21 estimated the consumer surplus of swimming visits to be 6 8 16 1 per visit as with all experimental ecosystem accounting studies while the approach appears promising there is room for further improvement and development the estimated accounting value of water recreation was limited to the accounting value of swimming visits due to the availability of demand information naturally comprehensive accounting would also require accounting values for other water recreation activities the monetary use accounts included swimming visits only because the valuation was based on a previous travel cost study focusing on swimming while the national recreational inventory also includes data on the visit frequency for other water related activities extending the present exercise to other water activities would require valuation studies on the impacts of water quality changes on the demand for other activities and their monetary value however extending the accounting to other activities could pose a risk of double counting in the recreation demand inventory survey respondents might have reported for example combined swimming and boating occasions separately as swimming visits and boating visits one alternative to avoid this could be to ask respondents to report the total number of recreational visits to waterbodies in a given period or their participation in various activities during one visit furthermore the spatial coverage of the accounting could be extended the national recreation inventory data also provide visit frequency data for other parts of the country including coastal areas and geographical data on water systems and their water quality are additionally available for coastal waters the sev model contains several assumptions that could bias the exchange value estimates first we assumed that swimmers can only choose between two swimming places which biases the exchange value upwards adding an option to choose between the three closest places would imply additional competition for the second closest place namely the third closest place would offer lower prices and hence the price level of the second closest would depend on the travel cost difference between these two swimming places second we assumed that swimming places do not experience congestion this assumption reduces the scarcity of swimming places and tends to lower exchange values in addition it makes those swimming places close to highly populated areas and thus highly visited appear too attractive relative to places with a lower population density if swimmers could choose between more than the two closest swimming places the bias could be smaller because in the equilibrium the swimmers would be distributed more evenly between swimming places third we used the euclidean distance between points which underestimates travel costs and therefore decreases market power and exchange value the impact of these three sev model assumptions on the value of swimming recreation also depends on the changes in the expected number of visits the assumptions of a choice between two swimming places and of no congestion have opposite price impacts both cause the redistribution of swimmers the joint impact on value depends on the model parameters and spatial distribution of swimmers and beaches the assumption regarding euclidean distances implies too short distances which tends to overestimate the demand this compensates the underestimated prices and the alleviates the effect on value all in all it is difficult to state which direction the value bias will take given the opposing impacts the bias may be relatively moderate in this gis analysis for extent and condition accounts we observed some data challenges first the use classification of buildings in the topographic database was not perfect for determining the openness or closedness of shorelines the type of building did not clearly indicate whether the shoreline was available for recreation this causes some uncertainty in the results second not all of those shorelines that are in theory open for anyone to access are necessarily used for recreational purposes 37 many characteristics prevent or discourage the recreational use of the shoreline e g poor possibilities for landing a boat on the shore a lack of public transportation poor recreation facilities e g no parking places routes or signs the poor quality of the beach and scenery and perceived crowding 38 thus in addition to ecosystem conditions the availability of infrastructure and recreational facilities may also influence the supply and use of recreational ecosystem services in the use account the reported figures measure the total number of water recreation visits by the residents of pirkanmaa to any water recreation destination in pirkanmaa and are derived from the national outdoor recreation survey site specific survey data on the number of recreational visits compare barton et al 4 would provide a more accurate picture of visit frequency however the collection and compiling of site specific data to produce estimates of the total annual number of recreational visits in an entire region would be costly and challenging in a country where the public right of access allows recreation in almost any un built natural area new sources of data such as user generated mobile data or geotagged social media posts and sports applications with gis tracking enlarge the opportunities for visitor monitoring with new types of data there are more options to distinguish the timing and volume of visitors activities and spatial patterns of visits 39 however the new data sources might not always provide sufficient information to identify the visitors and non visitors and only a segment of visitors uses the new tools despite the challenges novel data sources could for a start be used to complement recreation survey data 40 our analysis provided a regional level assessment of the extent condition and use in physical and monetary terms of the recreational ecosystem services of water systems this can support regional land use planning spatially more explicit accounting with an even finer spatial resolution would provide data to support land use planning and management on the municipality level to identify priority areas for water ecosystems and shorelines from the outdoor recreation point of view author statement tuija lankia conceptualization methodology writing original

8643,ecosystem accounting produces data on ecosystems their condition and the services they provide in a consistent and comparable form with the system of national accounts sna this study focused on accounting of recreational ecosystem services in the context of freshwaters in finland we used georeferenced data to measure the extent and condition of ecosystems available for recreation and representative population data to measure the actual use of the services in the monetary valuation of the recreational service we applied the simulated exchange value method which has been developed for the monetary valuation of non market ecosystem services in accordance with the sna we extend the simulated exchange value method to incorporate the effect of water quality on the number and monetary value of recreational visits keywords ecosystem accounting recreation non market valuation simulated exchange value water quality data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nature and ecosystems are essential for human life and well being in the literature the contributions of ecosystems to human well being are commonly described with the concept of ecosystem services 1 2 in order to facilitate the mainstreaming of ecosystem services into economic development and planning discussions efforts have been made to develop accounting to monitor and measure the state of ecosystems and their ability to provide ecosystem services the aim has been to develop an accounting system that would complement national accounts which are an important tool for societal planning and decision making but which do not consider the environmental impacts of economic activities or the value of benefits provided by nature to society as a result the ecosystem accounting framework has been developed the aim of ecosystem accounting is to produce data on ecosystems their condition and the ecosystem services they provide in a form that is consistent and comparable with the economic data in the system of national accounts sna 3 since ecosystem accounting is a relatively new field different approaches and perspectives are still developing and only a limited number of studies have explored the practical feasibility of the framework 4 in particular there is a need for empirical examples on how to incorporate environmental quality in ecosystem accounting for various ecosystem services 5 in this study we tested how the recreational services of freshwater ecosystems can be presented in the accounting framework and particularly how the impact of water quality on the monetary value of the use of recreational ecosystem services can be captured and presented in the accounting the united nations system of environmental accounting ecosystem accounting seea ea provides common principles and concepts regarding how to measure and organize information on the extent and condition of ecosystems and the services they generate and it works as a starting point for developing ecosystem accounting at the national level 6 in practice the seea ea framework for ecosystem accounting consists of i ecosystem extent and condition accounts which present biophysical information on the extent and quality of different ecosystem types and ii supply and use accounts for ecosystem services which record the actual flow of ecosystem services to people 6 use accounts are presented in both physical and monetary terms while physical accounts present the actual use of ecosystem services monetary use accounting enables a comparison of the value of ecosystem services with other sna records the monetary valuation of ecosystem service use needs to follow the valuation principles of the sna in which the goods and services are valued at their exchange values i e at the prices they are traded at 7 8 this is a challenge for many ecosystem services such as recreational ecosystem services which are not typically traded on the markets while a variety of environmental valuation methods have been developed to measure the economic value of non market ecosystem services for policy and project evaluation e g contingent valuation 9 10 and travel cost methods 11 12 their use in valuation in the ecosystem accounting context is not entirely straightforward they measure the monetary value of welfare changes due to changes in the state of the environment or of ecosystem services the welfare changes are measured in terms of consumer surplus i e the maximum amount of money individuals are willing to pay for a specified improvement in environmental quality 13 in contrast the sna measures economic activity rather than welfare and the monetary values in the sna represent the prices at which the products and services are actually traded i e exchange values not individuals maximum willingness to pay for them 14 nevertheless environmental valuation methods can also be useful in the ecosystem accounting context one proposed method for monetary valuation in ecosystem accounting is the simulated exchange value sev 14 sev utilizes traditional environmental valuation studies but they are used for producing estimates of the exchange value of ecosystem services the method builds on the demand curves obtained for ecosystem services using valuation methods the demand curves are combined with the supply functions for providing these services and as a result yield a simulated exchange value for the ecosystem services in question that could hypothetically occur if the ecosystem services were provided on the markets recreational services belong to cultural ecosystem services that are defined in seea ea as the perceived or realized qualities of ecosystems whose existence and functioning enables a range of cultural benefits including recreational benefits to be derived 6 their use and value are affected not only by the quality of the environment but also by human infrastructure and services as enjoying recreational services usually requires various types of facilities equipment transportation and infrastructure such as access to nature 4 the characteristics and conditions of the ecosystems also affects their recreational use and its value 15 19 as recreational visitors might prefer certain ecosystem and landscape characteristics over others for a review see barton et al 4 the use and value of water recreation in particular have been shown to be significantly associated with different characteristics of the water environment such as water clarity the absence of blue green algal blooms and a low tendency for sliming e g ahtiainen et al 20 lankia et al 21 bertram et al 22 the challenge in recreational ecosystem services accounting is to measure the use of ecosystems for recreational purposes and determine the contribution of the ecosystems and their conditions to the use and its value 4 in previous studies focusing on recreational ecosystem services accounting different approaches have been employed to measure the use of recreational services and its monetary value vallecillo et al 23 defined the availability of recreational services as the extent of high quality recreational areas available for daily recreation and they quantified the use of recreational services based on the number of people living over different distances from these areas the predicted use of recreational areas was then valued in monetary terms using the travel cost method horlings et al 24 assessed the monetary accounting value of nature based recreation in the netherlands based on consumer expenditure on nature based recreation and a hedonic pricing model of the impact of natural areas on housing prices in a study focusing on cultural ecosystem services in france martin et al 25 measured the use of recreational services with the frequency of recreational visits and used the household production function approach for monetary valuation in a pilot study on ecosystem accounting in the us warnell et al 26 focused the accounting of recreational ecosystem services on birdwatching and measured the use of recreational services in terms of the number of birding days but due to data limitations did not measure the monetary value of this use in our approach we use georeferenced data to measure the extent and condition of inland water ecosystems available for recreation and representative population data to measure the actual use of the services in the monetary valuation of the use we apply the simulated exchange value method which we extend to incorporate the effect of water quality on both the number and the monetary value of recreational visits the sev method has previously been applied in studies by caparrós et al 14 grilli et al 27 and lankia et al 28 caparrós et al 14 used sev with the contingent valuation method to estimate site specific demands and value for the main recreational areas in andalusia 14 grilli et al 27 applied sev with demand curves for a recreational ecosystem that they derived from the results of a choice experiment study lankia et al 28 in nordic open access conditions based their measurement of the use of ecosystem services on the number of recreational visits by individuals derived from national statistics on outdoor recreation for valuation they applied sev in previous studies the associations of water quality and recreational use and benefits have not yet been integrated with ecosystem accounting here we fill the gap in empirical approaches for recreation accounting by presenting an approach to integrating the impact of water quality on recreational use and its monetary value in ecosystem accounting we apply national statistics for recreational visits and the sev method for valuation but we extend the approach from previous studies to integrate the effect of water quality on the number and monetary value of the visits to develop our approach for recreational ecosystem services accounting we focus on freshwaters in finland where surface water areas are important for recreation as nearly 10 of finland s area is covered by water surface water areas are used by residents living near lakes and rivers but also by owners and users of ca 500 000 leisure homes 29 to reduce the computational burden of spatial data we perform the accounting for the region of pirkanmaa in southern finland instead of covering the whole country for the ecosystem extent and condition account in physical terms we use georeferenced data to calculate and map the extent and condition of water systems available for recreational use in the use account we assess the recreational use of water ecosystems based on representative population data on the demand for outdoor recreation in finland to assess the association between ecosystem condition here the water quality of the water bodies with the monetary value of recreational ecosystem service use we build a model based on the simulated markets for recreational visits as a starting point we use the sev method which we extend to incorporate the effect of water quality on the number and monetary value of the visits we build the sev model based on spatial data on the supply and quality of water recreation areas and the number of residents in the area as well as on the empirically estimated demand curve for swimming visits in finland the rest of the paper is structured as follows the next section presents the case study area the region of pirkanmaa and the data and methods used in the study the third section presents the results of the pilot accounting finally the discussion and conclusions address the strengths and limitations of our esa approach 2 data and methods 2 1 case study to develop our approach and test it with pilot accounts for freshwater recreation we selected the pirkanmaa region with an area of 14 600 km2 as a case study area fig 1 the national level ecosystem services account was applied to the regional level due to the computational burden related to gis data 1 1 the computational burden of the gis calculation depends on the number of watersheds and shorelines the size and distribution of the population and the number of buildings in the study area due to the high number of buildings and watersheds in the pirkanmaa region the computational burden is above average compared to other regions in finland the spatial analysis consisted of the development of the calculation method and the calculation the calculation took 3 4 working days extending the analysis to the national level would require one to two months of additional computation work from the various regions in finland pirkanmaa was selected because it does not border sea areas and only freshwaters are available for recreation approximately 14 of the total land cover comprises inland waters pirkanmaa and the city of tampere are among the fastest growing and urbanized regions in finland outside the helsinki metropolitan area more than 500 000 residents live in pirkanmaa and nearly half of these 235 000 in the city of tampere to apply the ecosystem accounting for water based recreation in the pirkanmaa region we used the following data for the accounts the extent and condition accounts the total length of open shoreline available in the pirkanmaa region for public recreational use categorized according to the ecological quality of the water systems the use account in physical terms the total number of swimming visits and other water recreational visits by the inhabitants of the pirkanmaa region and the total number of visits divided according to water systems with a different ecological status the use account in monetary terms the monetary value of swimming visits by the pirkanmaa inhabitants in the pirkanmaa region the monetary value is assessed for swimming visits only due to limitations in the data available for the monetary valuation 2 2 the extent and condition accounts georeferenced data on water bodies and their quality we used a gis based approach to measure and describe the extent and conditions of ecosystems available for water recreation the focus was on considering the degree of developed shoreline and the ecological quality of surface waters in the pirkanmaa region to accomplish this several datasets were used the topographic database of the national land survey of finland nls 2016 is a vector format dataset depicting the terrain of the whole of finland it includes road networks buildings and constructions administrative borders land use waterways and elevation the product belongs to the open data of the national land survey of finland the monitoring system of spatial structure and urban form ykr 2017 is a spatial dataset based on an urban rural regional classification system produced by the finnish environment institute syke it describes the densely populated areas in finland the water bodies according to the water framework directive vhs dataset 2016 of syke consists of polygon data determining the borders of surface waters and includes a considerable amount of data describing the properties of the watersheds e g the ecological quality of surface waters the product belongs to the open datasets of syke vhs watershed data do not include all watersheds and the ranta10 dataset of syke was therefore used for small watersheds not covered by vhs data statistics finland s population grid dataset 2016 1 km 1 km describes the distribution of the population according to age groups it is an open dataset and depicts the population distribution independent of administrative areas such as municipal borders information about the location and properties of beaches and swimming places was derived from the lipas sports facility gis database 30 which is an open data source provided by the university of jyväskylä furthermore national outdoor recreation demand inventory data lvvi of natural resources institute finland luke was used to obtain estimates of water recreation visits by different age groups in the pirkanmaa region 31 in the extent and condition calculations the degree of developed shoreline and the ecological quality of surface waters 32 were determined shorelines located outside an urban area were classified into open shores in public use and closed or built up shores only for landowners furthermore shorelines were classified into five different ecological quality classes according to the ecological state of the water bodies bad poor moderate good and high 32 regarding shorelines inside urban areas only the length of the shoreline in different ecological quality classes was considered these classifications were carried out separately for lakes and rivers in the case of lakes both watersheds and islands larger than 1 ha in size were included regarding rivers those more than 5 m in width were included in the analysis buildings that prevent public access to the shore e g residential buildings leisure homes saunas were distinguished from the topographic database in next phase 100 m buffer zones were created around these buildings 2 2 swimming in watersheds belongs in finland to the public right of access to nature for recreational purposes regardless of who owns the land but there are some restrictions it is not allowed to walk through a yard area to the beach disturb the domestic peace or otherwise cause a disturbance or harm that could be evaluated to be larger than minimal finnish legislation does not determine exactly the size of the yard area but it varies case by case we applied 100 m distance laurila and kalliola 2019 to determine the size of the yard area shorelines were clipped by the buffer zones and openness closedness information was assigned to shoreline segments fig 2 information about densely and sparsely populated areas was assigned to shorelines in a similar way in the case of rivers the two shorelines were considered separately in order to avoid a situation where a building situated near one shoreline would also close the shoreline on the opposite bank of the river 2 3 the use account in physical terms national outdoor recreation demand inventory data the use account is based on the national outdoor recreation demand inventory lvvi comprising population level survey data on participation in outdoor recreation in finland the data n 8895 are based on random sampling and cover the finnish adult population aged between 15 and 74 years the survey was carried out in 2009 and 2010 together with statistics finland lvvi data are collected every 10 years and the newest data collected in 2019 2020 were not yet available when conducting this research the lvvi data include measurements of 1 the number of outdoor recreation visits or recreation occasions 2 a description of the destination areas 3 measurements of travel costs that are used to estimate the value of visits in monetary terms and 4 socio economic background information on the respondents the data also include more specific information on swimming and other water recreation activities of finns in this study the data allowed us to calculate the total number of water recreation and swimming visits by pirkanmaa residents in this study we focused on water based outdoor activities in the pirkanmaa region applying population mean and median values for recreation participation in the region number of survey participants in the pirkanmaa region n 845 and the number of visits in the region mean and median values as well as distributions were corrected with calibrated survey weights to estimate the total number of recreationists and visits in pirkanmaa data on recreation participation and the number of recreation visits in pirkanmaa were combined with the number of inhabitants in pirkanmaa obtained from the population data 33 the lvvi dataset also provided a basis for the monetary valuation of the swimming visits the travel cost model for the monetary value of swimming visits 21 used in the sev application of this study was based on lvvi data 2 4 the use account in monetary terms monetary valuation of recreation visits with the simulated exchange value method 2 4 1 basic methodology the monetary valuation of water recreation more precisely swimming visits was based on simulated exchange value sev methodology a method suggested by caparrós et al 34 the objective of the method is to simulate the market and a corresponding exchange value for an ecosystem service for which there is no market price the sev method relies on a simulated or counterfactual market equilibrium for ecosystem services where theoretical suppliers of ecosystem services sell the services to their users 6 14 to simulate real market behavior the suppliers optimize the pricing of ecosystem services to maximize their profits given the consumers demand for the services the demand is based on an econometric demand model obtained from an environmental valuation study see below solving the constructed market equilibrium provides simulated price estimates for services that in the real world are not priced since the price estimates are based on market equilibrium the price is interpreted as the exchange value and is directly applicable to ecosystem accounting the supply of services in the method is defined based on the relevant cost structure and competitive environment 14 we measured the monetary value of swimming visits at different water quality levels according to the simulated exchange value of the visits but the available data did not allow us to distinguish the relative value contributions of ecosystems and the recreational facilities at the swimming sites united nations et al 6 p 191 192 199 the sev procedure of this study is summarized in fig 3 the procedure is presented in detail in sections 2 4 2 2 4 5 readers mainly interested in the empirical results may wish to move directly to the results in section 3 one could argue that the sev methodology and the idea of a hypothetical market equilibrium is fundamentally contradictory with the fact that in finland freshwater recreation is open access however the very aim of the sev approach is to estimate the exchange value for an ecosystem service that does not currently have a market price to this end one examines a hypothetical reality that can be used for estimating possible exchange values from the known consumer preferences these estimates heavily depend on assumptions related to the market structure and the cost of providing these services although such exchange value estimates are inaccurate they provide guidance on their possible magnitude 2 4 2 sev demand model in our application the demand for recreation is defined as the number of swimming visits to water bodies in the pirkanmaa region the demand estimate is based on population grid data 1 km 1 km from statistics finland the rate of participation in swimming in the pirkanmaa region and an empirically estimated demand curve for swimming visits 21 the demand curve for swimming visits is based on an empirical travel cost model contingent behavior model e g parsons et al 35 for swimming visits in finland 21 where an expected number of swimming visits μ i for an individual i is determined by the travel costs incurred from travelling to the swimming place i e beach socio demographic variables x i and the perceived water quality of the swimming place i i the variables x i of the original empirical model include the travel costs incurred from travelling to the swimming place and individual socio demographic characteristics however as we simultaneously describe the behavior of all inhabitants of a grid cell we cannot use the socio demographic information for the individuals in the sev model but the individual is assumed to be a representative agent for the whole population in that grid cell hence in our sev model the expected number of swimming visits μ i for an individual i is assumed to depend on the travel costs 3 3 there is an ongoing debate in ea on whether the opportunity cost of time should be included in the travel costs in the seea it is said that the costs of travelling may include the opportunity cost of time to travel and visit the site 6 p 197 while for example pelletier et al 2021 justified the exclusion of the opportunity cost of time in ea on the grounds that the cost of leisure time is not taken into account in the national accounting either here the opportunity cost of time was included in the travel costs because it was included in the existing valuation study 21 applied in the sev application the opportunity cost of time was included according to a standard approach in travel cost method literature as 1 3 net hourly income per adult time spent on round trip from home to the swimming site it is good to note that if the cost of time had not been taken into account the cost of travel for walkers and cyclists would have been zero which would have implied a zero exchange value for walkers and cyclists it would have underestimated the value of swimming visits taking place in the walking or cycling distance from one s home and water quality only the water quality of the swimming place i is given by a vector of quality indicators dummies that is i i g o o d i p o o r naturally only one of the dummies can have a value of one at each beach if both dummies are zero then the water quality is ordinary in the demand model 21 good water quality is defined as water in which the bottom of the water body can be seen from the surface at a depth of over 2 m and there is no sliming on piers or rocks poor water quality is defined as water in which the bottom can be seen from a depth of less than 1 m and sliming is abundant or sliming can be felt on the skin during or after swimming good water quality is assumed to correspond to the ecological class excellent and poor water quality to the class satisfactory or worse see section 2 2 the extent and condition accounts georeferenced data on water bodies and their quality respectively ordinary water quality is assumed to correspond to the ecological class good for a detailed description of the demand model and the associated data see lankia et al 21 given that the estimated travel cost model is a negative binomial model the expected number of visits is μ i μ x i i i where μ x i i i a exp β t c x i γ i i here parameter β t c is the travel cost parameter and vector γ contains the parameters for different water quality levels 4 4 values for the parameters are derived from ref 21 where β t c is 0 06 γ for good water quality is 0 54 and γ for poor water quality is 0 40 travel cost km are defined as eur 0 59 km based on the average travel cost per trip eur 6 5 divided by average distance 11 km these parameters are obtained from the travel cost model in lankia et al 21 parameter a is a scaling factor that is used for calibrating the aggregate number of swimming visits to match with the aggregate swimming statistics in the lvvi data the value of a is equal in all the grid cells the model is estimated for finnish conditions where there is open public access to unbuilt shorelines and visitors are not charged an access fee i e the price of swimming is zero nevertheless due to the positive distance from homes to swimming places swimmers face positive travel costs i e x 0 in the sev model we estimate theoretical prices that would exist if access would not be free but the suppliers would set a positive price for visits to be able to estimate the effect of a positive price on visit demand we assume that the demand effect of the price equals the effect of the travel costs which is given by the coefficient β t c 0 hence both increased travel costs and positive prices decrease the expected number of visits by an individual given these assumptions we can reformulate the expected number of visits to take into account the impact of a positive price μ p i x i i i a exp p i x i β t c γ i i the aggregate demand n for swimming visits is obtained simply by multiplying the number of people who participate in swimming activities n i in each grid cell with the expected number of visits and summing over all the grid cells 1 n i n i μ p i x i i i here we assume that the swimmers from each grid cell only go to a single swimming place hence a unique price travel distance and water quality is linked to the swimmers of each grid cell swimming place selection is based on utility maximization the choice is affected by the three factors pricing distance and water quality the details are provided next in connection with the pricing problem of suppliers 2 4 3 sev supply model in the supply side of the sev model the starting point is the swimming places which are not located side by side but there is a non negligible distance between them since swimmers face travel costs that increase with distance they prefer to visit nearby swimming places hence the hypothetical beach owners would have market power over the swimmers living nearby we assume that the variable costs of producing recreational opportunities in swimming places are negligible 5 5 the fixed costs of establishing a swimming place however are nonnegligible in the sev approach we assume that fixed costs are high enough to prevent the establishment of new swimming places and the swimmers need to choose between existing places the market power arises from the facts that the swimmers incur travel costs and swimming places cannot be established next to each other in addition we assume that there will be no congestion at swimming places and an unlimited supply of services is available in such a setting the supply decision is a pricing decision in which the swimming place owner tries to maximize revenues from the swimming place the pricing is constrained by the swimmers reactivity to price increases and by the price competition between the two swimming places to obtain a pricing rule for the swimming places we examine the simplest case of two competing swimming places between which people are assumed to live on a line segment 6 6 the supply model is a variant of the 41 location model however in this setup the suppliers cannot decide the location of their beach but they can choose the price of the swimming services at their beach people are assumed to be uniformly distributed along the line and their number is normalized to unity the distance between the two swimming places is x which is measured in travel cost units i e euros 7 7 since the distance is measured in travel costs the travel costs and distance are the same in the model in the sev model we use the terms travel cost and distance interchangeably thus the density function of the uniform distribution is a constant x 1 from these two swimming places people prefer the one that yields a higher utility and they will always go there the level of utility is jointly determined by the disutility from travel costs and price and the utility from higher water quality as the swimmers balance between different components of utility a swimming place with high water quality can attract people even if there is a lower quality swimming place nearer to them the equilibrium determines a point on the line segment x 1 that divides the line segment into two regimes in which all the swimmers go the same swimming place we call this point a separating distance let us name the swimming place owners as 1 and 2 given the prices p i and quality dummy vectors i i for beaches i 1 2 and negligible variable costs swimming place owner 1 has revenues r 1 p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 p 1 d p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 x where the number of visits i e demand to swimming place 1 is given by d 1 p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 x x 1 0 x 1 p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 x μ p 1 x i 1 d x this demand formulation utilizes the fact that all the swimmers living between distance in travel cost x 0 x 1 p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 x go to swimming place 1 and their expected number of visits is μ p 1 x i 1 the function x 1 p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 x is the separating distance which we define without loss of generality as a distance from swimming place 1 here we use the fact that price p and travel cost x have an equal effect on visit intensity note that the water quality effect i i is also included in both the number of visits and the separating distance x 1 p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 x to fully specify the demand and the resulting revenues the separating distance x 1 p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 needs to be determined we assume that the separation is based on utility i e swimmers go to the swimming place that yields a higher utility for them swimmers located at the separation points are indifferent between the swimming places in the present model we can associate higher utility with a higher number of visits hence the separation i e indifference condition equalizes the number of visits to both swimming places μ p 1 x 1 i 1 μ p 2 x x 1 i 2 here we have replaced the distance to swimming place 2 with x x 1 where x is the distance between the two swimming places as the equation shows both the prices of the swimming places and their water quality affect the separating distance given the exponential structure of the demand function this is equivalent to equalization of the arguments that is a swimmer is indifferent between swimming places when β t c p 1 β t c x 1 q β q i q 1 β t c p 2 β t c x x 1 q β q i q 2 the water quality summation terms pick the corresponding water quality level i e q g o o d p o o r if the water quality is ordinary then i g o o d i p o o r 0 the separating distance from swimming place 1 x 1 is directly obtained as x 1 1 2 x p 1 p 2 β t c 1 q β q i q 1 i q 2 note that with this formulation x 1 can obtain both negative values and values greater than x with negative values all the swimmers go to swimming place 2 and with values greater than x all the swimmers go to swimming place 1 to keep the separating distance x 1 0 x we increase negative values to zero and reduce the excessively large values to x formally the separating distance is given as a function 2 x 1 p 1 p 2 i 1 i 2 x max 0 min 1 2 x p 1 p 2 β t c 1 q β q i q 1 i q 2 x with the separating distance we have specified the demand and the resulting revenues of swimming place owner 1 analogously we can define the revenues of beach owner 2 2 4 4 simulated market equilibrium sev in the equilibrium both swimming place owners maximize their revenues given the actions of the other swimming place owner hence the equilibrium constitutes a nash equilibrium revenue maximizing pricing decisions for both i 1 2 can be written compactly using the separating distances x i for i 1 2 see appendix 3 p i 2 β t c 1 e β t c x i 2 e β t c x i where the separating distance x 1 is given by equation 2 and x 2 x x 1 interestingly water quality has only an indirect effect on pricing through separating distances x i the equilibrium price increases as a function of the separating distance when the separating distance grows large i e x i the price approaches p i β t c 1 which is equal to the average consumer surplus of a single visit as implied by the empirical demand model hence if swimming places are far from each other the swimming place owner can extract all the surplus the market equilibrium is a price vector p 1 p 2 which solves the above system of equations consisting of optimal pricing decisions 3 and the separating distances 2 we solve the equilibrium numerically with matlab the equilibrium is solved for each 1 k m 1 km grid cell the equilibrium is based on a swimming place choice between the two closest available swimming places 8 8 the assumption is likely to bias the exchange values upwards we elaborate this point in the discussion section the equilibrium is determined by the distance between these swimming places x and the quality information i 1 and i 2 the equilibrium determines the prices p 1 and p 2 and the separating distance x 1 which then indicates which swimming place is chosen by the swimmers of the grid cell in question finally the number of swimming visits is calculated using the price travel distance and quality information in equation 1 the simulated exchange value of swimming recreation is v i p i n i μ p i x i i i where each grid cell i is connected to a unique swimming place determined by the equilibrium with price distance and quality indicated by p i x i and i i respectively 2 4 5 application we apply the above described data sets and the sev model to estimate the accounting value of swimming recreation in the pirkanmaa region we apply the model with two types of distance data sets for each inhabited square kilometer grid point in the pirkanmaa region the first dataset consists of the distance of grid points center points of 1 km 1 km grid cells to the nearest and second nearest official swimming places with environmental quality information beaches the second dataset consists of the distance of grid points to any nearest and second nearest water body water bodies we focus on the first data set but we use the second data set for sensitivity analysis to produce the needed datasets a grid format 1 km 1 km population dataset was first converted to a point dataset points were positioned at the centers of the grid cells inhabited points were chosen and euclidean distances from these points to the nearest and second nearest supervised or unsupervised beach and to the lakeshore were calculated fig 4 9 9 in the spatial analysis we used open access population data with a regularly spaced grid of points 1 km 1 km to calculate the euclidean distances to swimming places and water bodies the rather sparse point grid compared to the data on exact locations of swimming places and lakes and the use of euclidean distances instead of distances along the roads cause some inaccuracies in the measured distances with these two simplifications we kept the calculation burden in sensible limits an alternative approach could be to use the centroids of waterbodies instead of the exact locations of swimming places and shorelines to keep the accuracy of different datasets at about same level however for large waterbodies it could cause large additional errors the pricing formula 3 suggests that relative distance errors imply relative pricing errors of a similar magnitude the shorter the distance between the two beaches is the higher are the relative errors in the distances which implies higher pricing errors therefore the centroid approach could be too inaccurate if the distance between the beaches is relatively short only those lakes that had information about the ecological quality of the watershed were chosen to be included in the analysis lakes that were located outside of the pirkanmaa region were also taken into account so that when a center point was located near the border of pirkanmaa the nearest or second nearest lake could be located outside of pirkanmaa finally information about the quality of the watershed and the number of inhabitants in each grid cell was connected to the distance table in the calculation of the monetary value of swimming visits in the pirkanmaa region the number of visits is based on the above described demand models and the number of swimmers in each grid in the above described demand model swimming takes place in either the nearest or second nearest swimming place since in reality swimmers do not always go to the two nearest beaches the second assumption together with the euclidean distances used suggests that our sev is based on underestimated travel costs to correct this we recalibrated 10 10 the recalibration was performed for demand levels so that the baseline demand would be correct the scale of the demand does not affect the pricing decision and the recalibration did not therefore alter the exchange values the demand levels to match with the visit frequency levels in the lvvi swimming data see details in the results section the number of swimmers in each population grid n i was calculated using the age distribution for the population and the participation rate in swimming in different age groups based on the lvvi data for grid points that did not have age distribution information the regional average age was used the model generates prices for the nearest two beaches for each population grid cell all the swimmers in the grid cell face these prices and this affects the choice of swimming place and the frequency of swimming visits water quality coding of the demand model data and the ecological quality data of the spatial data were not the same therefore we recoded the ecological quality data to match the demand model specification in the recoding we identified the ecological quality levels excellent good and satisfactory passable poor with demand model levels good ordinary and poor respectively also see the section sev demand model note that the ecological state good i e the demand model s ordinary was dominant in the data set ca 60 3 results 3 1 ecosystem extent and condition accounts waters available for recreation the total length of shoreline in the pirkanmaa region is 13 307 km of which 11 424 km is lake shoreline and 1883 km river shoreline tables 1 and 2 present the classification of the shorelines in more detail according to the gis analysis in rural areas about 47 of the lake shoreline and 83 of the river shoreline is unbuilt and thus open for public recreation in the pirkanmaa region fig 5 in densely populated urban areas the classification of shorelines into built up shorelines and those that are open for recreational use is difficult due to the large numbers of buildings with different purposes based on the gis data there is no easy way to separate built but publicly accessible shorelines from built shorelines that are only used by the landowners therefore we only provide the estimated total length of shoreline in urban areas most of the lakes in urban areas are in good or even excellent ecological condition table 1 in rural areas about two thirds of the closed lake shoreline and slightly less than half of the open lake shoreline has a good or excellent ecological status in the majority of rivers the ecological status is good or satisfactory table 2 according to the data the closest beach is located on average around 5 km from residents in pirkanmaa and of the closest beaches 68 have a good or excellent ecological status table 3 3 1 1 use account in physical terms number of water recreation visits the actual use of recreation ecosystem services in the pirkanmaa region was assessed based on the national outdoor recreation survey data according to the data more than two thirds namely 70 6 of pirkanmaa residents participate annually in swimming in natural waters the mean for the finnish adult population is 69 5 48 4 in boating 42 6 in fishing and 7 1 in long distance skating 11 11 http www metla fi metinfo monikaytto lvvi tilastot 2010 alueittain harrastukset htm of all recreation visits made by residents in pirkanmaa 48 take place close to home within walking distance of the resident s home the same estimate for the whole of finland is 46 and for the helsinki metropolitan area 61 of all close to home recreation visits 12 12 http www metla fi metinfo monikaytto lvvi tilastot 2010 alueittain lahiulkoilu htm according to lvvi data supplemented with population data pirkanmaa residents annually make ca 15 8 million water based recreation visits within the pirkanmaa region of these visits ca 4 9 million are swimming occasions table 5 the data did not reveal the type of water body river or lake the visits were made to 3 2 use account in monetary terms the accounting value of the swimming visits 3 2 1 monetary value of swimming visits with current observed water quality to obtain the best possible estimates for the monetary value the level of swimming visit demand in the sev model was calibrated to correspond with the total number of swimming visits in the pirkanmaa region observed in the lvvi data 4 9 million the population data together with the lvvi data give the number of potential swimmers in a grid cell see the data and methods section while the demand model gives the swimming visit frequency in each grid cell as a function of the travel costs and the water quality of the water bodies the simplifying assumptions about the choice of swimming place lead to an imprecise estimate for the aggregate swimming demand therefore we calibrated the aggregate level of swimming demand at the zero price level to the observed number of swimming occasions in the pirkanmaa region i e 4 9 million annual visits see previous section the same calibration was performed for both the beach and the water body datasets hence with both datasets the sev model yields 4 9 million annual visits if the price is fixed to zero in the sev methodology a market equilibrium is solved and positive simulated price levels are obtained calculating the sev equilibrium for the beach data set resulted in a mean price of 2 7 visit the equilibrium number of annual visits was 4 1 million which is lower than the actual observed number of visits with zero price as the simulated positive price level reduces the swimming activity together they implied a total annual value of 11 1 million for swimming recreation in the pirkanmaa region under the current water quality while these results are based on data on official swimming places i e beaches in the pirkanmaa region to test the sensitivity of the results to the swimming place data we also solved the sev equilibrium for another dataset in which swimming places were not restricted to official beaches but any unbuilt shoreline could be used for swimming clearly the distances to the nearest water bodies are systematically shorter than to official beaches the shorter distances imply lower equilibrium prices as expected the mean price was lower 2 5 visit for the water body data correspondingly the number of annual visits was higher 4 2 million the total value with water body data was 10 4 million per year which is relatively close to the value obtained with the beach dataset hence our calculation suggests that the values are relatively insensitive to slight changes in the underlying data 3 2 2 water quality effects to examine how changes in water quality affect the accounting value we performed counterfactual analysis in which the water qualities of all swimming places both beaches and water bodies were equalized to good ordinary or poor levels these results are presented in table 6 as expected the value of the ecosystem service depends on its quality interestingly with the beach dataset the value reaction is notably stronger than with the water body dataset with the beach dataset a state where the water quality is uniformly good yields a 4 6 million higher value than the current state with the water body data the value increase is only 1 1 million correspondingly uniform poor quality leads to value reductions of 5 0 million and 5 9 million with the beach and water body datasets respectively note that in the uniform quality counterfactuals the pricing is not affected by the quality this is because in the counterfactuals the quality dummies cancel each other out in equation 2 and therefore neither the separating distances nor the equilibrium prices depend on quality as a result the equilibrium prices are the same in all the counterfactuals the intuition is that the separating distances are the same because when all water bodies have the same water quality water quality does not affect which of the two nearest beaches individuals visit in the beach data the separating distances are systematically greater than in the water body data which implies a higher price level in the former on the other hand the numbers of visits are almost the same in both datasets when qualities are uniform and the annual numbers of visits differ in the second decimal this is explained by the almost equal relative demand effect of the counterfactual quality uniformity and the same original calibration of the total demand level table 6 presents the sev results mean price of a visit number of annual visits in the pirkanmaa region and annual value of the ecosystem service in the pirkanmaa region for the current real world conditions current state and for the counterfactual conditions where all swimming places have a uniform water quality all good all ordinary or all poor the results are presented for both beach and water body datasets 4 discussion and conclusions ecosystem accounting is a promising initiative on the route towards mainstreaming the state of ecosystems and their contribution to human well being into economic development and planning discussions however it is still in the development phase and requires the testing of different approaches and the production of experimental accounts for different ecosystem services in this study the focus was on the recreational ecosystem services of inland waters we presented an approach for including the ecological quality of water ecosystems in accounting of recreational ecosystem services and particularly for how to acknowledge it in defining the accounting value of recreational ecosystem service use the accounting value of swimming visits was determined with the sev method building on spatial data on the extent and conditions of water bodies observed data on the number of recreational visits and a national level travel cost model the main advantage of our approach compared to previous studies is that it yields the accounting value of swimming visits based on spatial data on the supply and quality of water recreation opportunities and empirical data on the sensitivity of swimmers to the costs of swimming visits and water quality by regularly updating the underlying datasets and the potential changes in swimmers preferences the model could be used to produce the up to date accounting value of swimming visits on a regular basis when compared to previous studies on the economic value of outdoor recreation in finland the estimated exchange value i e price per swimming visit 1 7 2 7 is as expected somewhat lower than the estimates of the consumer surplus of water recreation vesterinen et al 36 estimated the consumer surplus of water recreation visits to be 6 3 19 0 per visit and lankia et al 21 estimated the consumer surplus of swimming visits to be 6 8 16 1 per visit as with all experimental ecosystem accounting studies while the approach appears promising there is room for further improvement and development the estimated accounting value of water recreation was limited to the accounting value of swimming visits due to the availability of demand information naturally comprehensive accounting would also require accounting values for other water recreation activities the monetary use accounts included swimming visits only because the valuation was based on a previous travel cost study focusing on swimming while the national recreational inventory also includes data on the visit frequency for other water related activities extending the present exercise to other water activities would require valuation studies on the impacts of water quality changes on the demand for other activities and their monetary value however extending the accounting to other activities could pose a risk of double counting in the recreation demand inventory survey respondents might have reported for example combined swimming and boating occasions separately as swimming visits and boating visits one alternative to avoid this could be to ask respondents to report the total number of recreational visits to waterbodies in a given period or their participation in various activities during one visit furthermore the spatial coverage of the accounting could be extended the national recreation inventory data also provide visit frequency data for other parts of the country including coastal areas and geographical data on water systems and their water quality are additionally available for coastal waters the sev model contains several assumptions that could bias the exchange value estimates first we assumed that swimmers can only choose between two swimming places which biases the exchange value upwards adding an option to choose between the three closest places would imply additional competition for the second closest place namely the third closest place would offer lower prices and hence the price level of the second closest would depend on the travel cost difference between these two swimming places second we assumed that swimming places do not experience congestion this assumption reduces the scarcity of swimming places and tends to lower exchange values in addition it makes those swimming places close to highly populated areas and thus highly visited appear too attractive relative to places with a lower population density if swimmers could choose between more than the two closest swimming places the bias could be smaller because in the equilibrium the swimmers would be distributed more evenly between swimming places third we used the euclidean distance between points which underestimates travel costs and therefore decreases market power and exchange value the impact of these three sev model assumptions on the value of swimming recreation also depends on the changes in the expected number of visits the assumptions of a choice between two swimming places and of no congestion have opposite price impacts both cause the redistribution of swimmers the joint impact on value depends on the model parameters and spatial distribution of swimmers and beaches the assumption regarding euclidean distances implies too short distances which tends to overestimate the demand this compensates the underestimated prices and the alleviates the effect on value all in all it is difficult to state which direction the value bias will take given the opposing impacts the bias may be relatively moderate in this gis analysis for extent and condition accounts we observed some data challenges first the use classification of buildings in the topographic database was not perfect for determining the openness or closedness of shorelines the type of building did not clearly indicate whether the shoreline was available for recreation this causes some uncertainty in the results second not all of those shorelines that are in theory open for anyone to access are necessarily used for recreational purposes 37 many characteristics prevent or discourage the recreational use of the shoreline e g poor possibilities for landing a boat on the shore a lack of public transportation poor recreation facilities e g no parking places routes or signs the poor quality of the beach and scenery and perceived crowding 38 thus in addition to ecosystem conditions the availability of infrastructure and recreational facilities may also influence the supply and use of recreational ecosystem services in the use account the reported figures measure the total number of water recreation visits by the residents of pirkanmaa to any water recreation destination in pirkanmaa and are derived from the national outdoor recreation survey site specific survey data on the number of recreational visits compare barton et al 4 would provide a more accurate picture of visit frequency however the collection and compiling of site specific data to produce estimates of the total annual number of recreational visits in an entire region would be costly and challenging in a country where the public right of access allows recreation in almost any un built natural area new sources of data such as user generated mobile data or geotagged social media posts and sports applications with gis tracking enlarge the opportunities for visitor monitoring with new types of data there are more options to distinguish the timing and volume of visitors activities and spatial patterns of visits 39 however the new data sources might not always provide sufficient information to identify the visitors and non visitors and only a segment of visitors uses the new tools despite the challenges novel data sources could for a start be used to complement recreation survey data 40 our analysis provided a regional level assessment of the extent condition and use in physical and monetary terms of the recreational ecosystem services of water systems this can support regional land use planning spatially more explicit accounting with an even finer spatial resolution would provide data to support land use planning and management on the municipality level to identify priority areas for water ecosystems and shorelines from the outdoor recreation point of view author statement tuija lankia conceptualization methodology writing original

8644,this study proposes a reservoir operation optimization framework to maximize the regional agricultural profit under the constraints of downstream environmental flow requirements and climate change three climate change models canesm2 miroc5 and noresm1 m and the soil and water assessment tool swat were used to simulate the reservoir inflow in future periods under uncertainty minimum and ideal environmental flow regimes were embedded in the structure of the reservoir operation model to optimize the environmental flow needs and water supply and assess their tradeoffs cropping pattern optimization was used to maximize farmer profit particle swarm optimization was applied in the optimization processes the method was applied to a case study in the tajan river basin iran with the results showing the environmental flow regime considerably reduces irrigation supply and has significant impacts on farmer profits the results showed that cropping pattern optimization was not an effective strategy to mitigate the economic impacts of climate change under environmental flow constraints but this assessment may not be generalized to other areas uncertainties related to the climate change models are a notable weakness of the approach and should be considered in future studies keywords profit environmental flow reservoir operation optimization climate change reservoir

different economic aspects of water resources optimization such as maximizing job opportunities considering water allocation optimization 27 such studies corroborate the efficiency of entropy based multi objective interval stochastic models to increase the ecological benefits of croplands 28 optimizing water resource use is helpful for achieving sustainable agriculture 29 economic optimization is also important for agricultural water management 30 recent studies have integrated global warming and economic aspects for example 31 proposed a novel framework to quantify the destructive effects of the global warming and 32 linked local scale water decisions under climate change to the river basin economy cropping pattern is an important economic aspect for minimizing irrigation demand and maximizing profit e g ref 33 however environmental impacts on river ecosystems are not considered in the conventional form of the cropping pattern optimization more production with less water is required to maximize the economic benefits of farming but environmental impacts on the river ecosystems must be minimized 34 hydro economic models for assessing the potential effects of climate change on irrigated lands and options for available adaptive scenarios have great potential to mitigate the impacts of climate change for example 35 recommend interdisciplinary frameworks be used to investigate the effects of global warming on the water resource systems despite many hydro economic frameworks that have been developed none address the economic impacts of environmental flow downstream of reservoirs in other words the impact of releasing optimal environmental flow on downstream farmer profits at the river basin scale is not known this study aims to optimize reservoir operation for environmental flow regimes taking into consideration the influence of climate change as well as impacts on the agricultural profit of downstream farmers by exploring different cropping patterns this study was carried out in the tajan river basin iran in which satisfying environmental flow is a serious challenge the results of this study demonstrate the utility of hydro economic frameworks for mitigating environmental and economic impacts in water resource management the proposed method is very flexible leaving ample space for improvements in future studies 2 case study we applied our method to the tajan river basin in iran the tajan river originates from the alborz mountains and flows toward the caspian sea and is one of the most important rivers in mazandaran province agriculture is a key economic activity in this river basin and satisfying irrigation demand is critical for farmers rajaei dam was constructed in an upstream reach of the river to satisfy downstream irrigation demands rice is currently cultivated in downstream farms and is an important crop for farmers due to its high price due to climate change and the challenges associated with satisfying irrigation demand and environmental flow requirements an integrated optimization framework is necessary we selected 72 months as the simulation period for the reservoir operation optimization fig 1 displays the river network land use and location of the rajaei reservoir fig 2 displays the price irrigation demand yield and cost for the five crops rice wheat corn cotton barley selected for the case study with this information used in the economic optimization model irrigation demand for some crops such as barley and corn is dramatically less than for rice which highlights the importance of cropping pattern optimization the determination of environmental flow is not within the scope of this study two environmental flow regimes minimum and ideal have been proposed in the study area using ifim 36 a reliable method that considers water quality quantity and timing the minimum environmental flow regime aims to guarantee the minimum required habitat suitability for aquatic species while the ideal environmental flow is defined to better protect river habitats table 1 provides more details regarding the agricultural economic and hydrological data used in this study 3 methodology 3 1 overview fig 3 displays the workflow of the proposed method environmental flow regimes were defined based on previous studies 36 modeling climate change impacts on the reservoir inflow was carried out using different climate change models and rainfall runoff simulation the reservoir operation model then optimized releases from the reservoir finally the cropping pattern model was used to optimize the cropping mix for three different conditions 1 current condition without considering environmental flow 2 current condition considering environmental flow and 3 the most pessimistic scenario in

required the computation of yield and profit which included consideration of total costs including labour machinery fuel fertilizers seeds biocides and electricity fig 4 fig 5 displays the workflow of

limitations might be problematic in the economic optimization model the total profit in the cropping area computed by summing the profit for each crop was maximized we applied a yield function in which irrigation is the variable affecting the yield of each crop this assumption was acceptable in the case study due to the considerable impact of irrigation on yield in the region and was helpful for simplifying the model notably we adopted this assumption based on extensive survey in the study area and it might not be appropriate for other case studies finally the total cultivated area in the case study could be increased due to the availability of non cropped lands hence total area means total cropped and non cropped area downstream of the rajaei reservoir we selected 72 months 6 years as

full description on all results is available in this section figure a 3 annex displays the simulated inflow using three climate change models cm1 cm2 cm3 for different periods the performance of the climate change models in terms of simulating precipitation and stream flow is different hence available stream flow and reservoir storage will differ and will affect the ability to satisfy irrigation demand as well as environmental flow using a number of models is helpful to address the uncertainties of climate change modelling by shifting from best guess predictions to exploring a range of plausible scenarios 49 the results show stream flow might markedly increase or decrease in each time step for example in month 10 the stream flow increased by more than 100 compared to month 9 thus the impact of climate change on reservoir operation might be considerable and unpredictable and the associated impacts might not be similar for different scenarios fig 7 displays the output of the reservoir operation optimization considering environmental flow in the current condition the outputs of climate change scenarios are shown in the annex figure a 4 to a 6 the optimal environmental flow regime is similar to the minimum environmental flow regime and satisfying the ideal environmental flow regime is not possible in the case study the design of the optimization model contains a number of potential options to achieve the objective and constraints so the supply of ideal environmental flow might be possible in other case studies the outputs of the optimization under the three climate change scenarios confirm the significant impact of climate change on both water supply and optimal environmental flow figure a 7 annex displays the water supply predicted by the different models and table 3 displays the reliability indices the lowest value of the reliability index in the climate change condition is 28 rcp 8 5 2040 2060 cm2 year 4 which indicates the impacts on the water supply are significant however the model indicates the impact of environmental flow supply under current conditions is considerable as well reliability index 38 for year 5 the model faces serious challenges with respect to satisfying environmental flow as illustrated by the optimal environmental flow regime being similar to the minimum environmental flow interestingly the maximum reliability index for any of the simulated conditions is 70 rcp 8 5 2020 2040 cm1 year 2 the significant difference between the lowest and highest reliability index values for different climate change models e g 61 46 and 39 for rcp4 5 2020 2040 for cm1 cm2 and cm3 table 3 demonstrates the considerable uncertainty within the climate change models and the associated unreliability with respect to predicting whether irrigation demand can be satisfied in future periods fig 8 summarizes the outputs of the reservoir operation model which shows how much water would be available for irrigation under current conditions as well as the most optimistic and pessimistic scenarios in the future under current conditions the reservoir provides an average of 180 mcm million cubic meters however to satisfy environmental flow as the objective in the optimization model the irrigation supply would be significantly reduced to 78 mcm hence a significant portion of the environmental flow requirement is currently allocated to water supply and as such the river ecosystem is threatened the impact of climate change on the water supply in the different scenarios is considerable the highest reliability index in the future periods was considered as the optimistic scenario and the lowest as the pessimistic scenario climate change might increase the water supply to 100 mcm in the best condition but reduce it to 55 mcm in the worst condition the pessimistic scenario results in the greatest impact of climate change on agricultural profits in the study area based on the outputs of the cropping pattern optimization figs 9 and 10 respectively display the optimal cropping pattern for the current condition and for future years considering optimal environmental flow the optimization model reduced the cultivated area of rice in both conditions conversely the cultivated area of other crops such as barley corn and wheat are increased to result in a net reduction in water consumption notably the land area required in all simulations for both conditions was less than the total available land area cropped lands non cropped lands in the region of 80 000 ha the main objective of the cropping pattern optimization was to minimize the difference in profit between current conditions considering no environmental flow and in both current and future conditions considering optimal environmental flow fig 11 displays the profit in different years and indicates the performance of the optimization model is not perfect in terms of maximizing profit in the study area satisfying the minimum environmental flow in the case study would currently result in up to a predicted 50 or greater reduction i e years 4 6 in agricultural profit if the cropping pattern optimization was utilized considering the potential impacts of climate change would diminish the profit even further 5 discussion conclusions simulation of stream flow incorporating the potential impact of climate change is a challenging task because the results of this and previous studies e g ref 50 demonstrate the large uncertainties in climate change models we applied three models in this study in consideration of this uncertainly based on recommendations by the regional water authority more could be employed but at the cost of increasing computational complexity these models provide different predictions in terms of stream flow which makes them unreliable for reservoir operation model applications specifically underestimating stream flow might limit the potential cultivated area but overestimating stream flow might lead to misconceptions of water availability to supply irrigation demand and environmental flow requirements the environmental flow assessment is another key component in the proposed method we used two protective ecological scenarios minimum and ideal environmental flow that had been generated by ifim 36 other holistic methods could also be employed notably environmental flows should be determined after extensive study before developing economic optimization models for case studies we applied the outputs of an assessment study considering two terms in the optimization model the first term minimizes the difference between the environmental flow target and optimal release for the environment minimum environmental flow was then added in the form of a penalty function this strategy was helpful for guaranteeing the minimum environmental flow regime supply in the study area in the case study the optimization model could guarantee minimum protection of aquatic habitats downstream of the reservoir however it was unable to provide the ideal environmental flow due to low inflow of the reservoir in the simulated period this issue might occur in many case studies in semi arid and arid river basins moreover the impact of environmental flow requirements and climate change might markedly alter the storage level in the reservoir and thus threaten reservoir storage benefits we did not consider storage benefits in this study but suggest economic indices of storage loss be included in future studies cropping pattern was optimized in the study area for two conditions the current condition considering environmental flow and the pessimistic climate change scenario this strategy is helpful for managing impacts in the study area and minimizing conflict between agricultural stakeholders who wish to maximize profits and environmental managers who wish to protect the river ecosystem the proposed model maximizes farmer profits considering the available water however the results show the use of optimal cropping patterns would not increase the economic benefits of agriculture in the tajan river basin and therefore it is essential to consider additional strategies such as deficit irrigation in the optimization model we did not limit the area of each crop but such constraints regarding minimum and maximum areas might be required in other case studies one weakness of the model is the use of discrete crop areas covered by specific crops which means the model replaces one fixed area under one crop with another crop this limitation makes the model inflexible with respect to defining different crop pattern scenarios data limitations in the case study were the main hindrance to developing a better model our model is one of the first to integrate cropping pattern optimization with environmental flow and climate change models and aims to lead to improved applicability of cropping pattern models consistent with ecological management in river basins use of a non discrete cropping pattern model would likely lead to more effective solutions that protect the river ecosystem and maximize economic benefits we made some assumptions in the development of the optimization model for this case study that might not be applicable in other regions the type of soil and its condition might be critical for the successful cultivation of crops in the case study the general land suitability for the selected crops was acceptable however long term puddling had changed the formation of the topsoil layer as well as the subsoil furthermore soil fertility has been weakened due to long term flooded conditions furthermore changing the crop in a given area might require the installation of a drainage system or alterations to the irrigation system to obtain a suitable yield such considerations might require marked investment which increases the uncertainty of the optimization model because such factors are not included in the case study the regional government is committed to investments to overcome climate change and environmental degradation impacts hence we ignored the above crop requirements in the optimization model and only considered the costs paid by farmers and revenue to calculate the profit however these assumptions might not be appropriate in other cases a final important point is which economic parameter should be considered in the objective function in the present study we developed the model based on farm profit we considered the constant marginal product which means the output level is not determined by the equi marginal principle hence using revenue and profit in the proposed model will generate the same results each optimization model might have advantages and limitations that should be highlighted by the developers we applied metaheuristic optimization in this study these algorithms do not guarantee global optimization pso was used to optimize the environmental flow and cropping pattern however a wide range of new generation algorithms has been developed in the literature and could be advantageous for future studies the proposed optimization model for the reservoir operation is a multi objective optimization model that can simultaneously optimize water supply and environmental flow utilizing multi objective evolutionary algorithms such as multi objective pso or multi objective genetic algorithm is possible but adds computational complexity instead we aggregated two terms in a single objective function that is solvable by a single objective evolutionary algorithm as this had some advantages for our case study we simulated a short period in this study but longer periods would need to be simulated in practice numerous simulations may also be needed in other case studies as such the efficiency of the optimization algorithm is important as well as the robustness of the proposed solutions furthermore the proposed method is upgradable which means data driven models can be directly added to the system many new generation algorithms are not available in multi objective form and the outputs of this study indicate that using a single objective function is applicable and robust for multi objective management of reservoirs we face a challenging period with respect to the management of the reservoir in the case study the environmental impact of the rajaei dam is significant and might not be limited to downstream aquatic habitats the main purpose of this dam is to satisfy irrigation demands hence if the rajaei reservoir is unable to improve the economic benefits for regional in the tajan river basin then any negative effects on the river ecosystem are not justified use of an integrated simulation optimization model in which climate change simulation economic and environmental flow and optimization models are linked is essential to reduce the environmental and economic losses of the reservoirs in future periods we recommend using the developed method combined with expert panels to determine the best strategies for reducing the economic impacts of environmental flow requirements the study outputs demonstrate the strong relationship between satisfying environmental flow and economic impacts based on the results satisfying irrigation demand and environmental flow might be challenging in the study area when the inflow of the reservoir is low the proposed method shows that changing the cropping pattern by the optimization process is a potential solution to improve the profit but this strategy was not effective in our case study we note that this could have been affected by the inflexibility of our cropping pattern simulation lack of data availability as well as relevant variables we chose to not include such as soil degradation it should be noted that farming is complex and many parameters affect the economic benefits hence we adopted some simplifications to this end such as a discrete cropping pattern model other parameters such as soil suitability were not considered in the optimization a significant challenge of the proposed method relates to the uncertainty inherent in climate change models and for this reason we recommend considering both pessimistic and optimistic scenarios the outputs of the optimization model highlight that reducing environmental degradation might come at a high price for the community in the case

8644,this study proposes a reservoir operation optimization framework to maximize the regional agricultural profit under the constraints of downstream environmental flow requirements and climate change three climate change models canesm2 miroc5 and noresm1 m and the soil and water assessment tool swat were used to simulate the reservoir inflow in future periods under uncertainty minimum and ideal environmental flow regimes were embedded in the structure of the reservoir operation model to optimize the environmental flow needs and water supply and assess their tradeoffs cropping pattern optimization was used to maximize farmer profit particle swarm optimization was applied in the optimization processes the method was applied to a case study in the tajan river basin iran with the results showing the environmental flow regime considerably reduces irrigation supply and has significant impacts on farmer profits the results showed that cropping pattern optimization was not an effective strategy to mitigate the economic impacts of climate change under environmental flow constraints but this assessment may not be generalized to other areas uncertainties related to the climate change models are a notable weakness of the approach and should be considered in future studies keywords profit environmental flow reservoir operation optimization climate change reservoir

different economic aspects of water resources optimization such as maximizing job opportunities considering water allocation optimization 27 such studies corroborate the efficiency of entropy based multi objective interval stochastic models to increase the ecological benefits of croplands 28 optimizing water resource use is helpful for achieving sustainable agriculture 29 economic optimization is also important for agricultural water management 30 recent studies have integrated global warming and economic aspects for example 31 proposed a novel framework to quantify the destructive effects of the global warming and 32 linked local scale water decisions under climate change to the river basin economy cropping pattern is an important economic aspect for minimizing irrigation demand and maximizing profit e g ref 33 however environmental impacts on river ecosystems are not considered in the conventional form of the cropping pattern optimization more production with less water is required to maximize the economic benefits of farming but environmental impacts on the river ecosystems must be minimized 34 hydro economic models for assessing the potential effects of climate change on irrigated lands and options for available adaptive scenarios have great potential to mitigate the impacts of climate change for example 35 recommend interdisciplinary frameworks be used to investigate the effects of global warming on the water resource systems despite many hydro economic frameworks that have been developed none address the economic impacts of environmental flow downstream of reservoirs in other words the impact of releasing optimal environmental flow on downstream farmer profits at the river basin scale is not known this study aims to optimize reservoir operation for environmental flow regimes taking into consideration the influence of climate change as well as impacts on the agricultural profit of downstream farmers by exploring different cropping patterns this study was carried out in the tajan river basin iran in which satisfying environmental flow is a serious challenge the results of this study demonstrate the utility of hydro economic frameworks for mitigating environmental and economic impacts in water resource management the proposed method is very flexible leaving ample space for improvements in future studies 2 case study we applied our method to the tajan river basin in iran the tajan river originates from the alborz mountains and flows toward the caspian sea and is one of the most important rivers in mazandaran province agriculture is a key economic activity in this river basin and satisfying irrigation demand is critical for farmers rajaei dam was constructed in an upstream reach of the river to satisfy downstream irrigation demands rice is currently cultivated in downstream farms and is an important crop for farmers due to its high price due to climate change and the challenges associated with satisfying irrigation demand and environmental flow requirements an integrated optimization framework is necessary we selected 72 months as the simulation period for the reservoir operation optimization fig 1

case study with this information used in the economic optimization model irrigation demand for some crops such as barley and corn is dramatically less than for rice which highlights the importance of cropping pattern optimization the determination of environmental flow is not within the scope of this study two environmental flow regimes minimum and ideal have been proposed in the study area using ifim 36 a reliable method that considers water quality quantity and timing the minimum environmental flow regime aims to guarantee the minimum required habitat suitability for aquatic species while the ideal environmental flow is defined to better protect river habitats table 1 provides more details regarding the agricultural economic and hydrological data used in this study 3 methodology 3 1

regime is similar to the minimum environmental flow regime and satisfying the ideal environmental flow regime is not possible in the case study the design of the optimization model contains a number of potential options to achieve the objective and constraints so the supply of ideal environmental flow might be possible in other case studies the outputs of the optimization under the three climate change scenarios confirm the significant impact of climate change on both water supply and optimal environmental flow figure a 7 annex displays the water supply predicted by the different models and table 3 displays the reliability indices the lowest value of the reliability index in the climate change condition is 28 rcp 8 5 2040 2060 cm2 year 4 which indicates the impacts on the water supply are significant however the model indicates the impact of environmental flow supply under current conditions is considerable as well reliability index 38 for year 5 the model faces serious challenges with respect to satisfying environmental flow as illustrated by the optimal environmental flow regime being similar to the minimum environmental flow interestingly the maximum reliability index for any of the simulated conditions is 70 rcp 8 5 2020 2040 cm1 year 2 the significant difference between the lowest and highest reliability index values for different climate change models e g 61 46 and 39 for rcp4 5 2020 2040 for cm1 cm2 and cm3 table 3 demonstrates the considerable uncertainty within the climate change models and the associated unreliability with respect to predicting whether irrigation demand can be satisfied in future periods fig 8 summarizes the outputs of the reservoir operation model which shows how much water would be available for irrigation under current conditions as well as the most optimistic and pessimistic scenarios in the future under current conditions the reservoir provides an average of 180 mcm million cubic meters however to satisfy environmental flow as the objective in the optimization model the irrigation supply would be significantly reduced to 78 mcm hence a significant portion of the environmental flow requirement is currently allocated to water supply and as such the river ecosystem is threatened the impact of climate change on the water supply in the different scenarios is considerable the highest reliability index in the future periods was considered as the optimistic scenario and the lowest as the pessimistic scenario climate change might increase the water supply to 100 mcm in the best condition but reduce it to 55 mcm in the worst condition the pessimistic scenario results in the greatest impact of climate change on agricultural profits in the study area based on the outputs of the cropping pattern optimization figs 9 and 10 respectively display the optimal cropping pattern for the current condition and for future years considering optimal environmental flow the optimization model reduced the cultivated area of rice in both conditions conversely the cultivated area of other crops such as barley corn and wheat are increased to result in a net reduction in water consumption notably the land area required in all simulations for both conditions was less than the total available land area cropped lands non cropped lands in the region of 80 000 ha the main objective of the cropping pattern optimization was to minimize the difference in profit between current conditions considering no environmental flow and in both current and future conditions considering optimal environmental flow fig 11 displays the profit in different years and indicates the performance of the optimization model is not perfect in terms of maximizing profit in the study area satisfying the minimum environmental flow in the case study would currently result in up to a predicted 50 or greater reduction i e years 4 6 in agricultural profit if the cropping pattern optimization was utilized considering the potential impacts of climate change would diminish the profit even further 5 discussion conclusions simulation of stream flow incorporating the potential impact of climate change is a challenging task because the results of this and previous studies e g ref 50 demonstrate the large uncertainties in climate change models we applied three models in this study in consideration of this uncertainly based on recommendations by the regional water authority more could be employed but at the cost of increasing computational complexity these models provide different predictions in terms of stream flow which makes them unreliable for reservoir operation model applications specifically underestimating stream flow might limit the potential cultivated area but overestimating stream flow might lead to misconceptions of water availability to supply irrigation demand and environmental flow requirements the environmental flow assessment is another key component in the proposed method we used two protective ecological scenarios minimum and ideal environmental flow that had been generated by ifim 36 other holistic methods could also be employed notably environmental flows should be determined after extensive study before developing economic optimization models for case studies we applied the outputs of an assessment study considering two terms in the optimization model the first term minimizes the difference between the environmental flow target and optimal release for the environment minimum environmental flow was then added in the form of a penalty function this strategy was helpful for guaranteeing the minimum environmental flow regime supply in the study area in the case study the optimization model could guarantee minimum protection of aquatic habitats downstream of the reservoir however it was unable to provide the ideal environmental flow due to low inflow of the reservoir in the simulated period this issue might occur in many case studies in semi arid and arid river basins moreover the impact of environmental flow requirements and climate change might markedly alter the storage level in the reservoir and thus threaten reservoir storage benefits we did not consider storage benefits in this study but suggest economic indices of storage loss be included in future studies cropping pattern was optimized in the study area for two conditions the current condition considering environmental flow and the pessimistic climate change scenario this strategy is helpful for managing impacts in the study area and minimizing conflict between agricultural stakeholders who wish to maximize profits and environmental managers who wish to protect the river ecosystem the proposed model maximizes farmer profits considering the available water however the results show the use of optimal cropping patterns would not increase the economic benefits of agriculture in the tajan river basin and therefore it is essential to consider additional strategies such as deficit irrigation in the optimization model we did not limit the area of each crop but such constraints regarding minimum and maximum areas might be required in other case studies one weakness of the model is the use of discrete crop areas covered by specific crops which means the model replaces one fixed area under one crop with another crop this limitation makes the model inflexible with respect to defining different crop pattern scenarios data limitations in the case study were the main hindrance to developing a better model our model is one of the first to integrate cropping pattern optimization with environmental flow and climate change models and aims to lead to improved applicability of cropping pattern models consistent with ecological management in river basins use of a non discrete cropping pattern model would likely lead to more effective solutions that protect the river ecosystem and maximize economic benefits we made some assumptions in the development of the optimization model for this case study that might not be applicable in other regions the type of soil and its condition might be critical for the successful cultivation of crops in the case study the general land suitability for the selected crops was acceptable however long term puddling had changed the formation of the topsoil layer as well as the subsoil furthermore soil fertility has been weakened due to long term flooded conditions furthermore changing the crop in a given area might require the installation of a drainage system or alterations to the irrigation system to obtain a suitable yield such considerations might require marked investment which increases the uncertainty of the optimization model because such factors are not included in the case study the regional government is committed to investments to overcome climate change and environmental degradation impacts hence we ignored the above crop requirements in the optimization model and only considered the costs paid by farmers and revenue to calculate the profit however these assumptions might not be appropriate in other cases a final important point is which economic parameter should be considered in the objective function in the present study we developed the model based on farm profit we considered the constant marginal product which means the output level is not determined by the equi marginal principle hence using revenue and profit in the proposed model will generate the same results each optimization model might have advantages and limitations that should be highlighted by the developers we applied metaheuristic optimization in this study these algorithms do not guarantee global optimization pso was used to optimize the environmental flow and cropping pattern however a wide range of new generation algorithms has been developed in the literature and could be advantageous for future studies the proposed optimization model for the reservoir operation is a multi objective optimization model that can simultaneously optimize water supply and environmental flow utilizing multi objective evolutionary algorithms such as multi objective pso or multi objective genetic algorithm is possible but adds computational complexity instead we aggregated two terms in a single objective function that is solvable by a single objective evolutionary algorithm as this had some advantages for our case study we simulated a short period in this study but longer periods would need to be simulated in practice numerous simulations may also be needed in other case studies as such the efficiency of the optimization algorithm is important as well as the robustness of the proposed solutions furthermore the proposed method is upgradable which means data driven models can be directly added to the system many new generation algorithms are not available in multi objective form and the outputs of this study indicate that using a single objective function is applicable and robust for multi objective management of reservoirs we face a challenging period with respect to the management of the reservoir in the case study the environmental impact of the rajaei dam is significant and might not be limited to downstream aquatic habitats the main purpose of this dam is to satisfy irrigation demands hence if the rajaei reservoir is unable to improve the economic benefits for regional in the tajan river basin then any negative effects on the river ecosystem are not justified use of an integrated simulation optimization model in which climate change simulation economic and environmental flow and optimization models are linked is essential to reduce the environmental and economic losses of the reservoirs in future periods we recommend using the developed method combined with expert panels to determine the best strategies for reducing the economic impacts of environmental flow requirements the study outputs demonstrate the strong relationship between satisfying environmental flow and economic impacts based on the results satisfying irrigation demand and environmental flow might be challenging in the study area when the inflow of the reservoir is low the proposed method shows that changing the cropping pattern by the optimization process is a potential solution to improve the profit but this strategy was not effective in our case study we note that this could have been affected by the inflexibility of our cropping pattern simulation lack of data availability as well as relevant variables we chose to not include such as soil degradation it should be noted that farming is complex and many parameters affect the economic benefits hence we adopted some simplifications to this end such as a discrete cropping pattern model other parameters such as soil suitability were not considered in the optimization a significant challenge of the proposed method relates to the uncertainty inherent in climate change models and for this reason we recommend considering both pessimistic and optimistic scenarios the outputs of the optimization model highlight that reducing environmental degradation might come at a high price for the community in the case study as farmer profits were reduced by more than 50 in some simulations author statement mahdi sedighkia original draft preparation methodology software data curation bithin datta reviewing research
