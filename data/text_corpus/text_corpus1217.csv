6085,it has been repeatedly shown that conceptual hydrologic model performance degrades under conditions that deviate from those of the calibration period in this study we describe three experiments that aim to understand and address this problem using the conceptual model gr4j over 164 australian catchments the first is an investigation of model transferability where parameters calibrated under certain conditions are applied to simulate both similar and contrasting conditions we find that model performance degradation is more dependent on the conditions under which the model is tested than the conditions under which it is calibrated because dry periods are typically more difficult to simulate than wet periods this means that transferring dry calibrated parameters to wet periods is more successful than transferring wet calibrated parameters to dry periods for both wet and dry periods the best results were obtained when climatically similar calibration periods were used suggesting that targeted use of climatically similar calibration data could improve predictive capacity to this end a second experiment was designed that preferentially weights modeled series calibrated under different conditions with series associated with more climatically similar calibration periods weighted more heavily while this improved model performance in most cases the success was variable across the different catchments given that the model weighting scheme could not easily be generalized to all catchments in the sample a third experiment was conducted where each model parameter was defined dynamically as a function of climate the dynamic parameters were calibrated separately for each model so the individual sensitivities of each catchment to climate conditions could be captured while this also gave performance improvements especially under drier testing conditions the results continued to vary between catchments and there was no clear pattern in the parameter variation this suggests that nonstationarity can be captured in different parameters for models of different catchments while both model weighting and dynamic parameters can benefit overall conceptual model performance it seems that reliable improvements across large samples of catchments may be difficult to achieve without more physically realistic model structures keywords hydrologic modeling model robustness model weighting dynamic parameters climate variability 1 introduction hydrologic models are used for a wide range of purposes including flood risk management water resource planning and environmental flow assessments they typically require calibration to observed streamflow to determine parameter values that reflect the runoff behavior of the catchment this means the model effectively projects past behavior forward assuming stationarity over the long term however there is now overwhelming evidence that the earth s climate is undergoing substantial change due to anthropogenic activities ipcc 2013 it follows that changes in catchment characteristics and hence response may also occur threatening the assumption of stationarity and the validity of models calibrated to past streamflow observations milly et al 2008 uncertainty in future climate drivers and associated catchment property shifts presents a key challenge for developing improved modelling methods a number of studies have shown that the performance of conceptual hydrologic models tends to degrade when climatic conditions become increasingly different to those of the calibration period brigode et al 2013 coron et al 2014 coron et al 2012 merz et al 2011 osuch et al 2015 vaze et al 2010 vaze et al 2010 defined eight calibration periods based on average rainfall wet versus dry then evaluated how calibrated parameters transferred to time periods with different climatic conditions they found that model skill decreased as the contrast between the calibration and testing periods increased with the effect being more pronounced for drier testing periods this result was supported by several subsequent studies coron et al 2014 coron et al 2012 dakhlaoui et al 2017 merz et al 2011 calibrated models of 273 austrian catchments over six consecutive five year periods and found significant trends in parameters related to snow and soil moisture these trends were associated with changes in climate observed in the study area indicating that the parameters being conceptual without a precise physical interpretation do relate to environmental conditions in the catchment these findings were supported by further work in the same region by sleziak et al 2018 other studies have addressed non stationarity in climatic conditions by investigating the utility of non stationary parameterizations westra et al 2014 evaluated time varying parameters in the common conceptual model gr4j perrin et al 2003 that were nominally representative of antecedent conditions climatic cycles and long term trends the model s predictive capacity improved when the parameter representing storage capacity was allowed to vary over time with particular improvement under dry conditions this suggests that there may be potential to enhance future predictions by including time varying parameters in hydrologic models later studies have used data assimilation to automatically update parameters based on climate variability xiong et al 2019 or land cover change pathiraja et al 2016 grigg and hughes 2018 tested two model structural changes in gr4j aiming to reproduce the effects of catchment memory and vegetation cover shifts the updated model was better able to capture hydrologic dynamics associated with groundwater declines and clearing followed by revegetation grigg and hughes 2018 another recommendation that has been put forward to improve model performance under nonstationary conditions is improving calibration methods to identify more widely applicable parameters fowler et al 2016 we put forward an additional idea using the available observations such that climatically similar calibration data is preferenced to simulate a projected future climate state with particular hydrologic statistics given that optimal model calibration parameters have been shown to correlate with climatic conditions merz et al 2011 we hypothesize that targeted use of the available data for model calibration could improve performance under climatic conditions outside the existing record to this end we use data from 164 australian catchments to conduct an exploratory analysis of a model weighting strategy that preferences data from climatically similar calibration subsets we also test an updated model structure where parameters are defined dynamically based on climate conditions at a given time the ultimate goal of this study was to test whether model robustness in a future climate could be targeted through improved calibration strategies with available current climate data 2 data and methods the initial steps for this study involved identifying catchments and obtaining data selecting a hydrologic model calculating a statistic to describe climate conditions and calibrating the model over climatically distinct subsets of the observations the australian bureau of meteorology bom provides high quality streamflow data at 222 hydrologic reference stations hrs around australia we identified catchments with data available over 40 water years commencing in 1974 and whose catchment areas were between 25 km2 and 10 000 km2 totaling 164 catchments fig 1 note that the definition of the water year by month is provided by the bom for each hrs so the data period begins in different months for catchments in different regions rainfall and temperature data were obtained from the australian water availability project daily grids at 0 05 resolution raupach et al 2009 raupach et al 2012 potential evaporation pet was estimated using the mcguinness bordne method mcguinness and bordne 1972 in the r package evapotranspiration guo et al 2016 which requires only temperature data as an input and has been identified as a suitable pet formulation for conceptual hydrologic modeling oudin et al 2005 the streamflow rainfall and pet data were used to calibrate the conceptual hydrologic model gr4j perrin et al 2003 for each catchment gr4j is parsimonious appropriate for a range of climate conditions anshuman et al 2018 perrin et al 2003 and commonly used in australia grigg and hughes 2018 guo et al 2017 humphrey et al 2016 stephens et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 it contains a production store or soil moisture accounting store controlled by parameter x1 a non linear routing store controlled by parameter x3 and an inter catchment water exchange allowance controlled by parameter x2 the fourth parameter x4 controls the time bases of two unit hydrographs of the water that either bypasses or percolates through the production store 90 is routed through the first unit hydrograph with time base x4 and into the routing store where it contributes to the routed flow component the remaining 10 is routed through the second unit hydrograph with time base 2x4 and contributes to the direct flow component further detail on the model components and equations is provided by perrin et al 2003 the experiments conducted in this study involved calibrating models over climatically distinctive subsets of the available observations in order to specify calibration subsets it was necessary to select an appropriate climate indicator the reconnaissance drought index rdi tsakiris and vangelis 2005 was chosen because it considers both precipitation and pet and it has been shown that this will become increasingly important for classifying climate states in a warming world zarch et al 2015 calculated on a monthly basis the rdi is based on the ratio between precipitation and potential evaporation summed for the months of the water year so far i e the calculation resets at the beginning of a new water year it can be calculated over past periods using observations or over future climate series by inputting data produced through perturbation methods or downscaling of general circulation model results maraun et al 2010 the rdi is defined as 1 rd i i k j 1 j k p ij j 1 j k p e t ij where rdii k is the rdi for the kth month of the ith water year pij and petij are the total monthly rainfall and potential evaporation for the jth month of the ith year normalized rdi rdin is usually calculated with reference to the average conditions for each month in order to identify drought conditions tsakiris and vangelis 2005 but for this study it was necessary to have a consistent measure of catchment wetness across time it would not be suitable to have different rdin values for equivalent catchment wetness depending on time of year therefore rdi was normalized as follows 2 rd i n i k rd i i k m e a n rdi 1 in eq 2 each value is normalized based on the overall mean rdi for the catchment rather than the mean rdi calculated for the kth month which is standard the value of rdin increases with climatic wetness with negative values indicating dry conditions and positive values indicating wet conditions for each catchment subsets for model calibration were selected from the first 35 water years of observations note the last five years were kept aside for use as unseen testing data a monthly rdin series was calculated and the periods with the lowest and highest mean rdin starting at the beginning of any month were selected as the driest dry1 and wettest wet1 subsets the second and third driest wettest subsets were then identified as well dry2 wet2 dry3 and wet3 ensuring there was no overlap fig 2 a this was repeated for subset periods of different lengths discussed in detail in section 4 1 to explore the trade off between subset length and climate specificity shorter subsets allow for more climatic variation between periods i e the driest period over one year will be more extreme than the driest period over two years for longer subsets there may not be sufficient distinction between different climatic states however a sufficient amount of information is necessary to properly identify hydrologic parameters and ensure the catchment response is modeled realistically perrin et al 2007 sorooshian et al 1983 for this experiment period lengths from 1 year to five years were tested a limitation to this approach is that the conditions of preceding water years are not considered when defining subsets in some catchments soil moisture and groundwater stores can impact runoff behavior over multi year periods saft et al 2015 however given the large number and wide variety of catchments considered in this study it was not feasible to define a universal period over which long term antecedent conditions should be taken into account therefore we do not account for conditions prior to the water year in which each subset begins and this is a source of uncertainty for the methods we examine note that short gaps left between defined periods may not be long enough to define subsequent periods without overlapping gaps shorter than the period length are therefore excluded from the process this means that the length of data required to define six independent subsets can be up to twice the minimum necessary length i e to define six two year periods at least 12 and at most 24 years of data will be required if the maximum length of data necessary is not available the timing of wet and dry periods will determine whether six independent subsets can be defined in cases where six periods couldn t be defined without overlap the catchment was excluded from the analysis for that length of subset see section 4 1 for this reason two catchments were excluded from the four year subset experiment and 98 catchments were excluded from the five year analysis for each catchment the six climatically distinct subsets were used to calibrate six sets of gr4j parameters using the shuffled complex evolution sce ua method duan et al 1992 each of the six parameter sets was then used to simulate the full 35 year calibration period this gave an ensemble of six series covering the full 35 year calibration period each representing a possible mode of catchment response fig 2b shows an example of an ensemble with flow on a log scale so that low flows are visible the red series are generated with parameters calibrated over dry subsets while the blue series are generated with parameters calibrated over wet subsets these ensembles were used in the model weighting procedure described in section 4 conceptually the ensemble shown in fig 2b might align with our general expectations based on theoretical catchment behavior the observations tend to be closer to the wet calibrated series during periods of high flow and closer to the dry calibrated series during periods of low flow if the modeled ensembles follow this general pattern it is likely that a series weighting technique will be effective in matching appropriate parameters with climate conditions three experiments were conducted as part of this investigation starting with the parameter sets calibrated under wet and dry conditions for each catchment an experiment was performed to investigate 1 the general ability of hydrologic model parameters to transfer across distinct climate states a second experiment utilized the final five years of available data kept aside for model testing to explore 2 the potential for improved simulation under specified future climate conditions through preferentially applying parameters calibrated under similar past conditions the results of the first two investigations led to a third experiment where the four gr4j parameters were defined dynamically as a function of climate conditions the updated model structure is described in section 5 this final experiment investigated 3 the potential for improved simulation through allowing the model parameters to vary based on climatic conditions each experiment is discussed in a dedicated section sections 3 4 and 5 respectively with an outline of the overall process shown in fig 3 because the justification and methods for each experiment are influenced by the results of the experiment before discussion of the specific steps taken are outlined in the individual sections 3 parameter transferability between periods it has been shown that wet periods are generally easier to model hydrologically than dry periods and that model performance degrades less when parameters are transferred between climatically similar periods than climatically contrasting periods vaze et al 2010 the concept of skillful parameter donors and acceptors was introduced by smith et al 2018 in the context of parameter transfer between different catchments they found that some catchments acted as good donors i e calibration parameters could be generalized to other catchments while others acted as good acceptors i e the catchment could be skillfully simulated with a broad range of parameter values here we consider this concept when transferring parameters over time rather than space this section describes testing undertaken with the 164 study catchments to understand the calibration performance of gr4j under dry and wet conditions for the study catchments the performance degradation when parameters from a given period are donated to climatically similar periods the performance degradation when parameters from similar periods are accepted by a given period the performance degradation when parameters from a given period are donated to climatically contrasting periods the performance degradation when parameters from contrasting periods are accepted by a given period the objective function used for calibration was the widely used nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the results presented are based on four year climatic periods similar results were obtained when periods were defined over other timeframes fig 4 shows the distribution of calibration nse values for dry and wet periods in 164 catchments where dry1 is the driest period dry2 is the second driest etc all calibrations have high median performance nse 0 8 indicating that four year periods are generally adequate for model calibration however there are catchments where calibration performance is poor particularly during the dry periods many catchments in australia including some used in this study are intermittent and there may be many zero flow days in the drier periods which can reduce the information available for calibration it seems that the higher information content of the wetter periods is providing an advantage for calibration of the more difficult catchments when parameters from climatically similar periods were transferred i e a dry calibrated parameter set to another dry period and similarly for wet calibrated parameters the performance of wet and dry periods contrasted more strongly fig 5 a and b wet periods both donated and accepted parameters between themselves substantially more effectively than dry periods interestingly of the three dry periods the most extreme dry1 was the best donor but the worst acceptor this indicates that the transferability of parameters is more dependent on the nature of the period being modeled than the calibration period specifically the driest period hence most difficult to simulate experienced the most performance degradation when calibration parameters from other periods were applied but its own calibration parameters still appear to have been reasonably specified otherwise dry1 would have been a very poor donor the same finding was reinforced when parameters were transferred between climatically contrasting periods i e a dry calibrated parameter set to a wet period and a wet calibrated parameter set to a dry period fig 5c and d wet periods being easy to model and with well specified parameters appeared to be poor donors because they were donating parameters to dry periods being difficult to model despite the fact that dry period parameters may not be as well specified evidenced by lower calibration nses fig 1 the dry parameters appeared to be better donors because the target wet periods were easier to model accurately and hence good acceptors fig 5c the key finding here is that the conditions of the accepting period are more important than the conditions of the donating period of the three dry subsets with dry1 being the driest and dry3 the least dry more extreme dry periods experienced more performance degradation when wet period calibration parameters were applied fig 5d this is in line with previous findings coron et al 2012 vaze et al 2010 and suggests that areas where climate change leads to drier conditions could be particularly difficult to model accurately using only historical data for model set up for both the dry and wet periods parameter acceptance was better when the donor period was climatically similar than when it was contrasting fig 5b and d this is both intuitive and in line with previous findings vaze et al 2010 it also indicates that when modeling a future period under specified climatic conditions parameters calibrated during similar past climatic periods will be most informative this observation underpins the model weighting scheme that aims to improve simulation of an unseen validation period detailed in the following section 4 weighting modeled series with wet dry calibration parameters given that parameters can be most readily transferred between climatically similar periods section 3 it follows that simulation of an unseen future period could be best represented by parameters calibrated to a similar past period this suggests that to simulate drier future conditions for example it may be advantageous to only use dry historical periods in model calibration however this would require discarding much of the recorded data that could still contain relevant information about catchment function in this section we propose a model weighting scheme that uses both wet and dry calibration parameters to generate a number of series representing possible catchment behavior as described in section 2 the series are then weighted based on climatic similarity to a target simulation period the subsections describing this process are structured as follows section 4 1 describes a testing framework that was implemented to inform decisions that could impact the model weighting strategy here the length of distinct subsets for gr4j calibration is examined but the same framework could be used to aid other decisions e g choice of climate indicator section 4 2 describes the method for applying weights to the ensemble of series this includes a strategy for defining how strongly the calibration climate similarity to the target period should impact series weights section 4 3 presents the application of the weighting strategy over an unseen validation period and reports on its performance 4 1 calibration testing framework one important trade off that needs to be considered in developing a model weighting method is the length of climatically distinct subsets for calibration naturally shorter calibration subsets will show greater distinction between wet and dry conditions however if the subsets are too short parameters may be poorly defined and therefore less useful for simulating catchment behavior outside the calibration period it was necessary to develop a framework that could predict the likely performance of the method with calibration subsets of different lengths without referring to the final validation data which needs to remain unseen for testing the weighting strategy this framework is described below for an example in which the subsets are one year long 1 calibrate the model over the three driest dry1 dry2 dry3 and three wettest wet1 wet2 wet3 one year subsets of the calibration period water years 1974 2009 2 produce six modeled series that cover the full calibration period using each of the six parameter sets obtained in 1 3 for each series calculate the difference between the modeled flows and the observations for every day of the calibration period then take the one year moving average of this difference this gives a measure of how different the series is from the observations at a one year timescale calculated starting at the first day second day etc through to one year before the final day the inverse of this measure quantifies similarity of the series to the observations i e how well the series matches the observations for every possible one year period the similarity values are then normalized so that their sum is one 4 for every possible one year period i e starting at the first day second day etc through to one year before the final day multiply the series by the similarity value for that period calculated in 3 this gives a theoretical optimized weighting based on true distance from the observed flow 5 calculate the correlation between the optimized weights and the average rdin over the corresponding one year period if there is a strong correlation between the true climate conditions and the weights assigned i e during a dry one year period the series calibrated over dry subsets are favored this indicates that the climatic conditions are a good predictor of appropriate model parameters and the model weighting scheme is likely to perform well under validation 6 repeat this for all 164 catchments and calculate the average correlations negative correlations are expected between the dry series weights and rdin and positive correlations are expected between the wet series weights and rdin this framework was applied to test the prediction strength of rdin in determining appropriate model parameters for one two three four and five year subsets in each case six subsets were defined hence six different series produced in step 2 and the similarity was calculated at a timescale matching the subset length e g a two year moving average was used in step 3 when the subsets were two years long the correlations obtained are shown in table 1 averaged over all 164 catchments note that the issue of defining non overlapping subsets discussed in section 2 affected some catchments in the four and five year subset tests so some catchments were discarded this is based on the timing of the three wettest and three driest periods only and not on other climatic features so the specific catchments removed should be somewhat random and not lead to overall bias in the results this was confirmed by rerunning with only catchments for which six independent subsets could be defined in every case not shown here and this gave similar overall results based on the average correlations between climate conditions and optimized weights see step 5 it seems that the best calibration subsets were defined over four year periods 4 2 defining the weighting algorithm the weighting strategy should preference information from climatically similar calibration periods without entirely discarding information from climatically different calibration periods eq 3 was developed to define calibration period cal per similarity sim to the target period tar per 3 s i m cal p e r 1 rd i n cal p e r r d i n tar p e r ω the weighting parameter ω determines how strongly the difference between calibration subset rdin and the target period rdin influences a series weight if ω equals zero the series are simply averaged a relatively large value of ω indicates heavy weighting on the most climatically similar calibration periods with the remaining series having limited influence positive but smaller values of ω represent a preference for series calibrated under more similar conditions but with substantial information also extracted from series calibrated under contrasting conditions we aim to define a generalized value of ω across all study catchments in order to understand the typical importance of climate in determining model parameters this strategy avoids excessive dependence on the particular conditions under which ω is calibrated since a large number of sites will represent a variety of conditions without requiring lengthy data records additionally if a widely applicable value of ω can be determined the strategy can be applied to new catchments without recalibration as noted in section 2 the last five years of data were kept aside from the initial selection of calibration subsets see fig 2a the first two water years of this unseen data starting in 2009 herein referred to as the ω calibration period were used to calibrate ω with the last two water years saved for validation the third water year was discarded to minimize dependence between the two two year periods two stations g0050115 and g0060005 recorded zero flow over one of these two year periods so they were removed from both this step and the application step described in section 4 3 calibration of ω was undertaken through the following steps 1 select a ω value based on the sce ua algorithm initially random 2 for the first catchment calculate the similarity between each calibration subset rdin and the ω calibration period rdin the target in this case as per eq 3 the greater the value of ω the more strongly rdin difference will influence this measure 3 standardize the similarity measures to sum to one as in a weighted average procedure giving fractional weights for each series based on climatic similarity to the ω calibration period eq 4 shows an example calculation for the series calibrated over the driest subset dry1 4 w e i g h t d r y 1 s i m d r y 1 s i m d r y 1 s i m d r y 2 s i m d r y 3 s i m w e t 1 s i m w e t 2 s i m w e t 3 4 take the six series modelled over the ω calibration period each with parameters from one of the calibration subsets and multiply the by the calculated weight then sum them to give an overall weighted prediction 5 compare the weighted prediction with the observed flow to calculate c2m a bounded formulation that has been proposed as an alternative to nse for averaging results across large samples of catchments described by mathevet et al 2006 and reproduced in eq 5 5 c 2 m nse 2 n s e 6 repeat steps 2 to 6 for all catchments and calculate the average c2m these steps were repeated using the sce ua method until the ω value that optimized average c2m was identified with ω allowed to vary between 10 and 10 note that c2m was used as the objective function in this process instead of nse to keep the possible range between 1 and 1 preventing poorly performing catchments from having a disproportionate impact on the average calculated in step 6 and hence the calibrated value for ω aggregated performance results e g mean performance across all catchments are herein reported in c2m for the same reason time series calibrations sections 3 4 1 and 5 were undertaken using the more widely applied nse criterion but since there is a monotonic relationship between nse and c2m use of either function would give the same parameter sets in these cases the following parameters were obtained for the five gr4j calibration subset lengths table 2 in all five cases values above zero but below 10 the user specified upper limit for calibration were selected indicating that the weighting scheme tends to preference series calibrated under similar climatic conditions but also extracts information from series representing contrasting conditions for the four year calibration subsets the value of ω was particularly small 0 07 which means that all six series tend to be weighted relatively evenly for most catchments proportional weightings tended to vary between about 0 14 and 0 20 for the six different series in contrast the series associated with shorter calibration subsets gave optimal performance with heavier weighting on more similar conditions this could indicate that calibration under more extreme conditions i e the driest or wettest single year in the entire record does not provide much useful information for the model when simulating more average conditions the exercise was repeated excluding the catchments for which independent four and five year calibration subsets could not be defined so all five tests used the same subset of catchments in this test larger values of ω were obtained in every case table 2 this highlights that the ω parameter is dependent on the combination of catchments used therefore ω calibration was repeated using different catchment groupings based on four year subsets since these performed best in the testing framework described in section 4 1 the groupings were defined based on hydrological physical and climatic characteristics of the watersheds with thresholds set such that the number of catchments in each group was fairly consistent the calibrated values for ω are shown in table 3 consistent trends in ω across a grouping are highlighted in shading e g consistently increasing ω relative to the proportion of rainy days where the largest ω value is shown in the darkest shade while there is potential for overlap in groups for example catchments with a high proportion of zero flow days may also have a small area criteria sets that could be expected to give overlaps were identified and checked if there were less than 20 catchments that were different between the two groups one of the criteria sets was discarded as such the catchment groupings shown in table 3 are all distinctly different for some catchment groupings no discernible pattern exists in the calibrated values of ω however in other cases there does seem to be a trend the value for ω tended to increase with decreasing dryness indicated by zero rain days and increasing latitude this suggests that wet catchments with strong rainfall seasonality as in the more northern parts of australia may benefit particularly from the use of the model weighting technique since the ω parameter indicates fairly strong preference for series calculated under similar conditions to the ω calibration period it is also interesting that the value for ω tended to increase with increasing flow variance relative to average flow this suggests that catchments with more variable flow regimes have higher parameter dependence on climate indicating that a single set of parameters may not appropriately capture the different catchment states negative parameter values indicate that the group of catchments is not benefiting from the weighting procedure as intended rather the best results are obtained from series calibrated under the conditions that deviate most from the ω calibration period i e in the extreme an average period would be modeled by taking the mean of the series associated with the driest and wettest calibration periods a preference for negative ω values in certain catchments was associated with three main patterns 1 all six models of the catchment performed very poorly in the ω calibration period in these cases it was not meaningful to weight the series and unexpected values of ω often optimized results 2 there was no meaningful relationship between calibration subset conditions and modeled flow behavior for example dry calibrated series sometimes matched high flows more accurately than wet calibrated series this was fairly common in the results and suggests that the gr4j models may not be reflecting catchment response realistically 3 one series gave very bad results the ω calibration algorithm would tend to distance this series by choosing a value of ω that minimized its contribution if the series had a similar calibration rdin to the ω calibration period this would be a large negative value of ω the overall efficacy of the weighting method for the full set of catchments as well as groupings based on different properties is investigated in section 4 3 4 3 application of the weighting strategy for each calibration time period and in each catchment the six series section 2 were weighted and aggregated over the test period two water years starting in 2012 the steps are outlined as follows 1 take the appropriate ω value depending on calibration subset length from table 2 2 for the first catchment calculate rdin similarity between each calibration subset and the unseen test period eq 3 3 standardize similarity values to sum to one giving weights for each associated series eq 4 4 multiply the test period modelled series associated with each calibration subset by the appropriate weight and sum to give a weighted prediction the results of the weighting strategy application were benchmarked against a traditional calibration approach where data over the full calibration period 35 years was used to calibrate one set of parameters under the assumption of stationarity the performance indicators were the mean difference in c2m between the weighting strategy and the traditional calibration approach the median difference in c2m between the weighting strategy and the traditional calibration approach the percentage of catchments for which the weighting strategy improved prediction based on all three indicators the best performance was achieved with four year calibration subsets table 4 this was predicted by the testing framework described in section 4 1 indicating that the framework is appropriate for assessing decisions that influence the weighting strategy the results presented here suggest that extracting past information in a targeted way based on climatic conditions may improve simulation of a climatically distinct future period when the optimum length of calibration subset four years was used in the weighting strategy predictions improved in 66 of catchments although the mean and median improvements in c2m were fairly small it is possible that the strategy would provide more benefit in a climate change assessment where the testing period would likely be more different to the average past conditions since model weighting is unlikely to provide significant benefit if the testing period is not climatically distinct from the full calibration period the four year subset results for catchments where the test period conditions deviated from the average are shown in table 5 for wet validation periods rdin 0 1 the weighting scheme improved results for 74 of catchments compared to 66 over the full set of catchments and the median improvement was also higher table 4 for dry validation periods rdin 0 1 the mean and median nse improvements were both higher than for the full set of catchments this indicates that the scheme tends to give the greatest improvements under dry conditions but that improvements are more consistent under wet conditions as expected model weighting appears to be more advantageous under conditions that deviate notably from the average climate at a catchment the process was repeated for the different catchment groupings outlined in section 4 2 using the ω parameter values given in table 3 the model test results are shown in table 6 consistent trends in performance across a criterion i e all three indicators moving in the same direction are highlighted in shading where the greatest improvement is shown in the darkest shade unexpectedly the results indicate that the calibrated value of ω does not necessarily predict the validation performance of the model weighting strategy under unseen conditions in the cases of both flow variance and latitude the groupings with negative and very small ω values respectively in table 3 had the best validation performance performance improved especially strongly as runoff ratio decreased perhaps indicating that dry intermittent catchments generally considered difficult to model may benefit particularly from model weighting however overall it seems that the strategy is highly dependent on the specific set of catchments used and it is not necessarily straightforward to predict how ω is likely to vary under different conditions it follows that a more flexible approach where parameter changes are specifically calibrated for each catchment might be worth investigating this finding provided the motivation for the work described in section 5 5 climate dependent dynamic model parameters the results discussed in section 4 particularly those shown in tables 3 and 6 demonstrate that it is not straightforward to generalize the weighting strategy across different catchments it is unlikely that a universal weighting strategy could be defined such that all catchments experienced improved performance consistently under future conditions therefore for the third experiment a more flexible approach was adopted in which all four gr4j parameters were allowed to vary based on rdin this dynamic version of the model was calibrated individually for each catchment meaning that model parameters dependence on climate did not need to be generalized across multiple catchments with different sensitivities in the dynamic version of gr4j each of the four standard gr4j parameters x1 x2 x3 and x4 is defined as a 3 parameter sigmoidal function this form was selected because it is substantially more flexible than a simple linear function but still requires that the parameter change somewhat consistently with rdin i e the value cannot increase with rdin up to a certain point then decrease this increases the likelihood of parameter shifts being physically interpretable and decreases the extent of equifinality expected in the flexible model the functions defining the four gr4j parameters are as follows eq 6 6 x 1 t 0 1 t 1 1 e a 1 r d i e a 1 r d i 1 x 2 t 0 2 t 1 2 e a 2 r d i e a 2 r d i 1 x 3 t 0 3 t 1 3 e a 3 r d i e a 3 r d i 1 x 4 t 0 4 t 1 4 e a 4 r d i e a 4 r d i 1 rdin is defined on a monthly basis so the parameters vary at a monthly timestep based on the overall conditions of that month the sigmoidal function parameters e g t0 1 t1 1 and a1 to define x1 are calibrated to give a function specifying the four original parameters meaning that the number of calibration parameters is 12 for the dynamic model naturally this leads to a substantial reduction in calibration efficiency which could only be justified if the method significantly outperformed both traditional calibration and the model weighting strategy the original static model is one possible realization of the dynamic model i e if t1 1 t1 2 t1 3 and t1 4 all calibrate to zero so the option of one or more parameters remaining static is inherently available if this provides the best calibration because catchment behavior under very wet or dry climate conditions could be more extreme than overall catchment behavior we decided to add flexibility by allowing greater variation in parameter values than is generally applied for gr4j table 7 for comparison the standard four parameter version of gr4j was also run with the expanded parameter ranges the models were calibrated based on nse over the same 35 year period water years 1974 2009 used in the model weighting strategy calibration step again the final five water years were kept aside for validation in this case no second calibration period was required as in ω calibration for the experiment described in section 4 so the full five year period was used for validation the 12 calibrated parameters were used to define the four parameters in the standard version of gr4j dynamically with respect to rdin an example of how the parameters may vary with climate is shown in fig 6 the static and dynamic models were compared over the calibration and validation periods as would be expected from a more flexible model the dynamic model outperformed the static model over the calibration period in 91 of cases indicating that the dynamic calibration was mostly successful theoretically the dynamic model should always give equal or better calibrations than the static model since the static model is nested within the dynamic model in cases where the dynamic calibration nse was lower it indicates that the calibration algorithm located a local peak in the objective function rather than the true optimum but this is difficult to avoid entirely for a model with a large number of parameters the dynamic model also outperformed the static model over the validation period in 59 of catchments results aggregated across catchments are reported in terms of c2m as discussed in section 4 2 because this avoids excessive influence from individual catchments with very poor performance the mean and median c2m values were higher for the dynamic model in both the calibration and validation periods table 8 interestingly the variance in validation performance was substantially smaller for the dynamic model indicating that the performance was more consistent across the 164 catchments this suggests that the dynamic model may be particularly useful when simulating catchments that the static model represents poorly further investigation revealed that the dynamic model offered far greater performance improvements for dry validation periods most of the catchments tested were relatively wet over the water years from 2009 to 2014 but 29 catchments had average rdin values less than zero for the validation period for these catchments the dynamic model outperformed the static model in 76 of cases versus 56 of the models where average validation period rdin was greater than zero it is well established that existing conceptual models achieve better validation results over wet periods than dry periods vaze et al 2010 so the dynamic model may not offer a significant advantage during wet periods when only the 29 simulations with dry validation periods were considered table 9 the validation performance improvement was more substantial than for the full suite of models table 8 these results suggest that there may be promise in updating existing conceptual models by using climate dependent parameter values especially for drier future climate scenarios there was no clear difference in performance between catchments with different areas or latitudes intuitively it seems that the utility of climate varying model parameters should depend on how they relate to physical processes in the catchment this can be difficult to ascertain in conceptual models but different conceptual models inherently account for physical processes in widely varying ways therefore future work should test the potential of climate varying parameters in other conceptual models in this study we found that dynamic calibration resulted in widely varying effects in different catchments for some catchments the optimal values for three parameters remained static with climate and just one parameter varied notably this suggests that for some catchments it may be possible to reduce the total number of calibration parameters by representing three gr4j parameters as static and one as dynamic however for other catchments several parameters varied together to give the optimal dynamic model this is evident in the results for station 304 497 shown in fig 6 where x1 remains stable with climatic conditions but x2 x3 and x4 all vary substantially there were some patterns identified across catchments e g x2 tended to increase with increasing rdin but these were not sufficiently consistent to inform potential model structural changes while the results presented here show potential for model improvement through accounting for parameter dependence on climate they certainly don t solve the problem of model nonstationarity entirely efficacy varied across catchments and poor performance often seemed to be associated with models where the parameters did not seem to represent catchment behavior as expected for example when wet period calibration parameters performed best under dry testing conditions this implies that some minimum level of reasonable process representation may be required to reliably relate model parameters to climate conditions and ultimately to improve model performance under nonstationarity deb et al 2019 recently showed that better representing surface water ground water interactions improved hydrologic simulation under change these sorts of processes are notoriously difficult to model in some highly intermittent australian catchments with complex spatially and temporally varying runoff mechanisms dean et al 2016 so it is likely to be some time before hydrologists can rely entirely on physical process representation rather than calibrated conceptual parameters however lumped conceptual models like gr4j make no attempt to represent any of these physical complexities and may not be suitable for continued use in a changing climate 6 conclusion our results along with much prior work indicate that transferring conceptual hydrologic models to unseen future climate states will result in performance degradation the experiments presented in this paper show that increased reliability may be achievable through preferential use of climatically similar calibration data while still extracting some information from contrasting periods as well however there is high variability in performance improvements between catchments in many cases this seems to relate to the conceptual model failing to reflect realistic catchment behavior changes under different climate states it also seems that the importance of climate conditions in determining model parameters cannot be easily generalized across numerous catchments an alternative approach defining climate dependent dynamic parameters was also tested the dynamic model gave improved validation performance especially under dry conditions in combination these experiments show that the performance of conceptual models under altered climate conditions can be improved through both targeted use of calibration data and model structural adjustments since previous studies have demonstrated parameter dependence on climate for a wide range of hydrologic models guo et al 2018 merz et al 2011 vaze et al 2010 it is likely that models other than gr4j could also see some prediction improvement through application of the methods outlined here however these sorts of strategies are unlikely to offer a silver bullet that reliably improves model predictions in all catchments and so it is important to

6085,it has been repeatedly shown that conceptual hydrologic model performance degrades under conditions that deviate from those of the calibration period in this study we describe three experiments that aim to understand and address this problem using the conceptual model gr4j over 164 australian catchments the first is an investigation of model transferability where parameters calibrated under certain conditions are applied to simulate both similar and contrasting conditions we find that model performance degradation is more dependent on the conditions under which the model is tested than the conditions under which it is calibrated because dry periods are typically more difficult to simulate than wet periods this means that transferring dry calibrated parameters to wet periods is more successful than transferring wet calibrated parameters to dry periods for both wet and dry periods the best results were obtained when climatically similar calibration periods were used suggesting that targeted use of climatically similar calibration data could improve predictive capacity to this end a second experiment was designed that preferentially weights modeled series calibrated under different conditions with series associated with more climatically similar calibration periods weighted more heavily while this improved model performance in most cases the success was variable across the different catchments given that the model weighting scheme could not easily be generalized to all catchments in the sample a third experiment was conducted where each model parameter was defined dynamically as a function of climate the dynamic parameters were calibrated separately for each model so the individual sensitivities of each catchment to climate conditions could be captured while this also gave performance improvements especially under drier testing conditions the results continued to vary between catchments and there was no clear pattern in the parameter variation this suggests that nonstationarity can be captured in different parameters for models of different catchments while both model weighting and dynamic parameters can benefit overall conceptual model performance it seems that reliable improvements across large samples of catchments may be difficult to achieve without more physically realistic model structures keywords hydrologic modeling model robustness model weighting dynamic parameters climate variability 1 introduction hydrologic models are used for a wide range of purposes including flood risk management water resource planning and environmental flow assessments they typically require calibration to observed streamflow to determine parameter values that reflect the runoff behavior of the catchment this means the model effectively projects past behavior forward assuming stationarity over the long term however there is now overwhelming evidence that the earth s climate is undergoing substantial change due to anthropogenic activities ipcc 2013 it follows that changes in catchment characteristics and hence response may also occur threatening the assumption of stationarity and the validity of models calibrated to past streamflow observations milly et al 2008 uncertainty in future climate drivers and associated catchment property shifts presents a key challenge for developing improved modelling methods a number of studies have shown that the performance of conceptual hydrologic models tends to degrade when climatic conditions become increasingly different to those of the calibration period brigode et al 2013 coron et al 2014 coron et al 2012 merz et al 2011 osuch et al 2015 vaze et al 2010 vaze et al 2010 defined eight calibration periods based on average rainfall wet versus dry then evaluated how calibrated parameters transferred to time periods with different climatic conditions they found that model skill decreased as the contrast between the calibration and testing periods increased with the effect being more pronounced for drier testing periods this result was supported by several subsequent studies coron et al 2014 coron et al 2012 dakhlaoui et al 2017 merz et al 2011 calibrated models of 273 austrian catchments over six consecutive five year periods and found significant trends in parameters related to snow and soil moisture these trends were associated with changes in climate observed in the study area indicating that the parameters being conceptual without a precise physical interpretation do relate to environmental conditions in the catchment these findings were supported by further work in the same region by sleziak et al 2018 other studies have addressed non stationarity in climatic conditions by investigating the utility of non stationary parameterizations westra et al 2014 evaluated time varying parameters in the common conceptual model gr4j perrin et al 2003 that were nominally representative of antecedent conditions climatic cycles and long term trends the model s predictive capacity improved when the parameter representing storage capacity was allowed to vary over time with particular improvement under dry conditions this suggests that there may be potential to enhance future predictions by including time varying parameters in hydrologic models later studies have used data assimilation to automatically update parameters based on climate variability xiong et al 2019 or land cover change pathiraja et al 2016 grigg and hughes 2018 tested two model structural changes in gr4j aiming to reproduce the effects of catchment memory and vegetation cover shifts the updated model was better able to capture hydrologic dynamics associated with groundwater declines and clearing followed by revegetation grigg and hughes 2018 another recommendation that has been put forward to improve model performance under nonstationary conditions is improving calibration methods to identify more widely applicable parameters fowler et al 2016 we put forward an additional idea using the available observations such that climatically similar calibration data is preferenced to simulate a projected future climate state with particular hydrologic statistics given that optimal model calibration parameters have been shown to correlate with climatic conditions merz et al 2011 we hypothesize that targeted use of the available data for model calibration could improve performance under climatic conditions outside the existing record to this end we use data from 164 australian catchments to conduct an exploratory analysis of a model weighting strategy that preferences data from climatically similar calibration subsets we also test an updated model structure where parameters are defined dynamically based on climate conditions at a given time the ultimate goal of this study was to test whether model robustness in a future climate could be targeted through improved calibration strategies with available current climate data 2 data and methods the initial steps for this study involved identifying catchments and obtaining data selecting a hydrologic model calculating a statistic to describe climate conditions and calibrating the model over climatically distinct subsets of the observations the australian bureau of meteorology bom provides high quality streamflow data at 222 hydrologic reference stations hrs around australia we identified catchments with data available over 40 water years commencing in 1974 and whose catchment areas were between 25 km2 and 10 000 km2 totaling 164 catchments fig 1 note that the definition of the water year by month is provided by the bom for each hrs so the data period begins in different months for catchments in different regions rainfall and temperature data were obtained from the australian water availability project daily grids at 0 05 resolution raupach et al 2009 raupach et al 2012 potential evaporation pet was estimated using the mcguinness bordne method mcguinness and bordne 1972 in the r package evapotranspiration guo et al 2016 which requires only temperature data as an input and has been identified as a suitable pet formulation for conceptual hydrologic modeling oudin et al 2005 the streamflow rainfall and pet data were used to calibrate the conceptual hydrologic model gr4j perrin et al 2003 for each catchment gr4j is parsimonious appropriate for a range of climate conditions anshuman et al 2018 perrin et al 2003 and commonly used in australia grigg and hughes 2018 guo et al 2017 humphrey et al 2016 stephens et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 it contains a production store or soil moisture accounting store controlled by parameter x1 a non linear routing store controlled by parameter x3 and an inter catchment water exchange allowance controlled by parameter x2 the fourth parameter x4 controls the time bases of two unit hydrographs of the water that either bypasses or percolates through the production store 90 is routed through the first unit hydrograph with time base x4 and into the routing store where it contributes to the routed flow component the remaining 10 is routed through the second unit hydrograph with time base 2x4 and contributes to the direct flow component further detail on the model components and equations is provided by perrin et al 2003 the experiments conducted in this study involved calibrating models over climatically distinctive subsets of the available observations in order to specify calibration subsets it was necessary to select an appropriate climate indicator the reconnaissance drought index rdi tsakiris and vangelis 2005 was chosen because it considers both precipitation and pet and it has been shown that this will become increasingly important for classifying climate states in a warming world zarch et al 2015 calculated on a monthly basis the rdi is based on the ratio between precipitation and potential evaporation summed for the months of the water year so far i e the calculation resets at the beginning of a new water year it can be calculated over past periods using observations or over future climate series by inputting data produced through perturbation methods or downscaling of general circulation model results maraun et al 2010 the rdi is defined as 1 rd i i k j 1 j k p ij j 1 j k p e t ij where rdii k is the rdi for the kth month of the ith water year pij and petij are the total monthly rainfall and potential evaporation for the jth month of the ith year normalized rdi rdin is usually calculated with reference to the average conditions for each month in order to identify drought conditions tsakiris and vangelis 2005 but for this study it was necessary to have a consistent measure of catchment wetness across time it would not be suitable to have different rdin values for equivalent catchment wetness depending on time of year therefore rdi was normalized as follows 2 rd i n i k rd i i k m e a n rdi 1 in eq 2 each value is normalized based on the overall mean rdi for the catchment rather than the mean rdi calculated for the kth month which is standard the value of rdin increases with climatic wetness with negative values indicating dry conditions and positive values indicating wet conditions for each catchment subsets for model calibration were selected from the first 35 water years of observations note the last five years were kept aside for use as unseen testing data a monthly rdin series was calculated and the periods with the lowest and highest mean rdin starting at the beginning of any month were selected as the driest dry1 and wettest wet1 subsets the second and third driest wettest subsets were then identified as well dry2 wet2 dry3 and wet3 ensuring there was no overlap fig 2 a this was repeated for subset periods of different lengths discussed in detail in section 4 1 to explore the trade off between subset length and climate specificity shorter subsets allow for more climatic variation between periods i e the driest period over one year will be more extreme than the driest period over two years for longer subsets there may not be sufficient distinction between different climatic states however a sufficient amount of information is necessary to properly identify hydrologic parameters and ensure the catchment response is modeled realistically perrin et al 2007 sorooshian et al 1983 for this experiment period lengths from 1 year to five years were tested a limitation to this approach is that the conditions of preceding water years are not considered when defining subsets in some catchments soil moisture and groundwater stores can impact runoff behavior over multi year periods saft et al 2015 however given the large number and wide variety of catchments considered in this study it was not feasible to define a universal period over which long term antecedent conditions should be taken into account therefore we do not account for conditions prior to the water year in which each subset begins and this is a source of uncertainty for the methods we examine note that short gaps left between defined periods may not be long enough to define subsequent periods without overlapping gaps shorter than the period length are therefore excluded from the process this means that the length of data required to define six independent subsets can be up to twice the minimum necessary length i e to define six two year periods at least 12 and at most 24 years of data will be required if the maximum length of data necessary is not available the timing of wet and dry periods will determine whether six independent subsets can be defined in cases where six periods couldn t be defined without overlap the catchment was excluded from the analysis for that length of subset see section 4 1 for this reason two catchments were excluded from the four year subset experiment and 98 catchments were excluded from the five year analysis for each catchment the six climatically distinct subsets were used to calibrate six sets of gr4j parameters using the shuffled complex evolution sce ua method duan et al 1992 each of the six parameter sets was then used to simulate the full 35 year calibration period this gave an ensemble of six series covering the full 35 year calibration period each representing a possible mode of catchment response fig 2b shows an example of an ensemble with flow on a log scale so that low flows are visible the red series are generated with parameters calibrated over dry subsets while the blue series are generated with parameters calibrated over wet subsets these ensembles were used in the model weighting procedure described in section 4 conceptually the ensemble shown in fig 2b might align with our general expectations based on theoretical catchment behavior the observations tend to be closer to the wet calibrated series during periods of high flow and closer to the dry calibrated series during periods of low flow if the modeled ensembles follow this general pattern it is likely that a series weighting technique will be effective in matching appropriate parameters with climate conditions three experiments were conducted as part of this investigation starting with the parameter sets calibrated under wet and dry conditions for each catchment an experiment was performed to investigate 1 the general ability of hydrologic model parameters to transfer across distinct climate states a second experiment utilized the final five years of available data kept aside for model testing to explore 2 the potential for improved simulation under specified future climate conditions through preferentially applying parameters calibrated under similar past conditions the results of the first two investigations led to a third experiment where the four gr4j parameters were defined dynamically as a function of climate conditions the updated model structure is described in section 5 this final experiment investigated 3 the potential for improved simulation through allowing the model parameters to vary based on climatic conditions each experiment is discussed in a dedicated section sections 3 4 and 5 respectively with an outline of the overall process shown in fig 3 because the justification and methods for each experiment are influenced by the results of the experiment before discussion of the specific steps taken are outlined in the individual sections 3 parameter transferability between periods it has been shown that wet periods are generally easier to model hydrologically than dry periods and that model performance degrades less when parameters are transferred between climatically similar periods than climatically contrasting periods vaze et al 2010 the concept of skillful parameter donors and acceptors was introduced by smith et al 2018 in the context of parameter transfer between different catchments they found that some catchments acted as good donors i e calibration parameters could be generalized to other catchments while others acted as good acceptors i e the catchment could be skillfully simulated with a broad range of parameter values here we consider this concept when transferring parameters over time rather than space this section describes testing undertaken with the 164 study catchments to understand the calibration performance of gr4j under dry and wet conditions for the study catchments the performance degradation when parameters from a given period are donated to climatically similar periods the performance degradation when parameters from similar periods are accepted by a given period the performance degradation when parameters from a given period are donated to climatically contrasting periods the performance degradation when parameters from contrasting periods are accepted by a given period the objective function used for calibration was the widely used nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the results presented are based on four year climatic periods similar results were obtained when periods were defined over other timeframes fig 4 shows the distribution of calibration nse values for dry and wet periods in 164 catchments where dry1 is the driest period dry2 is the second driest etc all calibrations have high median performance nse 0 8 indicating that four year periods are generally adequate for model calibration however there are catchments where calibration performance is poor particularly during the dry periods many catchments in australia including some used in this study are intermittent and there may be many zero flow days in the drier periods which can reduce the information available for calibration it seems that the higher information content of the wetter periods is providing an advantage for calibration of the more difficult catchments when parameters from climatically similar periods were transferred i e a dry calibrated parameter set to another dry period and similarly for wet calibrated parameters the performance of wet and dry periods contrasted more strongly fig 5 a and b wet periods both donated and accepted parameters between themselves substantially more effectively than dry periods interestingly of the three dry periods the most extreme dry1 was the best donor but the worst acceptor this indicates that the transferability of parameters is more dependent on the nature of the period being modeled than the calibration period specifically the driest period hence most difficult to simulate experienced the most performance degradation when calibration parameters from other periods were applied but its own calibration parameters still appear to have been reasonably specified otherwise dry1 would have been a very poor donor the same finding was reinforced when parameters were transferred between climatically contrasting periods i e a dry calibrated parameter set to a wet period and a wet calibrated parameter set to a dry period fig 5c and d wet periods being easy to model and with well specified parameters appeared to be poor donors because they were donating parameters to dry periods being difficult to model despite the fact that dry period parameters may not be as well specified evidenced by lower calibration nses fig 1 the dry parameters appeared to be better donors because the target wet periods were easier to model accurately and hence good acceptors fig 5c the key finding here is that the conditions of the accepting period are more important than the conditions of the donating period of the three dry subsets with dry1 being the driest and dry3 the least dry more extreme dry periods experienced more performance degradation when wet period calibration parameters were applied fig 5d this is in line with previous findings coron et al 2012 vaze et al 2010 and suggests that areas where climate change leads to drier conditions could be particularly difficult to model accurately using only historical data for model set up for both the dry and wet periods parameter acceptance was better when the donor period was climatically similar than when it was contrasting fig 5b and d this is both intuitive and in line with previous findings vaze et al 2010 it also indicates that when modeling a future period under specified climatic conditions parameters calibrated during similar past climatic periods will be most informative this observation underpins the model weighting scheme that aims to improve simulation of an unseen validation period detailed in the following section 4 weighting modeled series with wet dry calibration parameters given that parameters can be most readily transferred between climatically similar periods section 3 it follows that simulation of an unseen future period could be best represented by parameters calibrated to a similar past period this suggests that to simulate drier future conditions for example it may be advantageous to only use dry historical periods in model calibration however this would require discarding much of the recorded data that could still contain relevant information about catchment function in this section we propose a model weighting scheme that uses both wet and dry calibration parameters to generate a number of series representing possible catchment behavior as described in section 2 the series are then weighted based on climatic similarity to a target simulation period the subsections describing this process are structured as follows section 4 1 describes a testing framework that was implemented to inform decisions that could impact the model weighting strategy here the length of distinct subsets for gr4j calibration is examined but the same framework could be used to aid other decisions e g choice of climate indicator section 4 2 describes the method for applying weights to the ensemble of series this includes a strategy for defining how strongly the calibration climate similarity to the target period should impact series weights section 4 3 presents the application of the weighting strategy over an unseen validation period and reports on its performance 4 1 calibration testing framework one important trade off that needs to be considered in developing a model weighting method is the length of climatically distinct subsets for calibration naturally shorter calibration subsets will show greater distinction between wet and dry conditions however if the subsets are too short parameters may be poorly defined and therefore less useful for simulating catchment behavior outside the calibration period it was necessary to develop a framework that could predict the likely performance of the method with calibration subsets of different lengths without referring to the final validation data which needs to remain unseen for testing the weighting strategy this framework is described below for an example in which the subsets are one year long 1 calibrate the model over the three driest dry1 dry2 dry3 and three wettest wet1 wet2 wet3 one year subsets of the calibration period water years 1974 2009 2 produce six modeled series that cover the full calibration period using each of the six parameter sets obtained in 1 3 for each series calculate the difference between the modeled flows and the observations for every day of the calibration period then take the one year moving average of this difference this gives a measure of how different the series is from the observations at a one year timescale calculated starting at the first day second day etc through to one year before the final day the inverse of this measure quantifies similarity of the series to the observations i e how well the series matches the observations for every possible one year period the similarity values are then normalized so that their sum is one 4 for every possible one year period i e starting at the first day second day etc through to one year before the final day multiply the series by the similarity value for that period calculated in 3 this gives a theoretical optimized weighting based on true distance from the observed flow 5 calculate the correlation between the optimized weights and the average rdin over the corresponding one year period if there is a strong correlation between the true climate conditions and the weights assigned i e during a dry one year period the series calibrated over dry subsets are favored this indicates that the climatic conditions are a good predictor of appropriate model parameters and the model weighting scheme is likely to perform well under validation 6 repeat this for all 164 catchments and calculate the average correlations negative correlations are expected between the dry series weights and rdin and positive correlations are expected between the wet series weights and rdin this framework was applied to test the prediction strength of rdin in determining appropriate model parameters for one two three four and five year subsets in each case six subsets were defined hence six different series produced in step 2 and the similarity was calculated at a timescale matching the subset length e g a two year moving average was used in step 3 when the subsets were two years long the correlations obtained are shown in table 1 averaged over all 164 catchments note that the issue of defining non overlapping subsets discussed in section 2 affected some catchments in the four and five year subset tests so some catchments were discarded this is based on the timing of the three wettest and three driest periods only and not on other climatic features so the specific catchments removed should be somewhat random and not lead to overall bias in the results this was confirmed by rerunning with only catchments for which six independent subsets could be defined in every case not shown here and this gave similar overall results based on the average correlations between climate conditions and optimized weights see step 5 it seems that the best calibration subsets were defined over four year periods 4 2 defining the weighting algorithm the weighting strategy should preference information from climatically similar calibration periods without entirely discarding information from climatically different calibration periods eq 3 was developed to define calibration period cal per similarity sim to the target period tar per 3 s i m cal p e r 1 rd i n cal p e r r d i n tar p e r ω the weighting parameter ω determines how strongly the difference between calibration subset rdin and the target period rdin influences a series weight if ω equals zero the series are simply averaged a relatively large value of ω indicates heavy weighting on the most climatically similar calibration periods with the remaining series having limited influence positive but smaller values of ω represent a preference for series calibrated under more similar conditions but with substantial information also extracted from series calibrated under contrasting conditions we aim to define a generalized value of ω across all study catchments in order to understand the typical importance of climate in determining model parameters this strategy avoids excessive dependence on the particular conditions under which ω is calibrated since a large number of sites will represent a variety of conditions without requiring lengthy data records additionally if a widely applicable value of ω can be determined the strategy can be applied to new catchments without recalibration as noted in section 2 the last five years of data were kept aside from the initial selection of calibration subsets see fig 2a the first two water years of this unseen data starting in 2009 herein referred to as the ω calibration period were used to calibrate ω with the last two water years saved for validation the third water year was discarded to minimize dependence between the two two year periods two stations g0050115 and g0060005 recorded zero flow over one of these two year periods so they were removed from both this step and the application step described in section 4 3 calibration of ω was undertaken through the following steps 1 select a ω value based on the sce ua algorithm initially random 2 for the first catchment calculate the similarity between each calibration subset rdin and the ω calibration period rdin the target in this case as per eq 3 the greater the value of ω the more strongly rdin difference will influence this measure 3 standardize the similarity measures to sum to one as in a weighted average procedure giving fractional weights for each series based on climatic similarity to the ω calibration period eq 4 shows an example calculation for the series calibrated over the driest subset dry1 4 w e i g h t d r y 1 s i m d r y 1 s i m d r y 1 s i m d r y 2 s i m d r y 3 s i m w e t 1 s i m w e t 2 s i m w e t 3 4 take the six series modelled over the ω calibration period each with parameters from one of the calibration subsets and multiply the by the calculated weight then sum them to give an overall weighted prediction 5 compare the weighted prediction with the observed flow to calculate c2m a bounded formulation that has been proposed as an alternative to nse for averaging results across large samples of catchments described by mathevet et al 2006 and reproduced in eq 5 5 c 2 m nse 2 n s e 6 repeat steps 2 to 6 for all catchments and calculate the average c2m these steps were repeated using the sce ua method until the ω value that optimized average c2m was identified with ω allowed to vary between 10 and 10 note that c2m was used as the objective function in this process instead of nse to keep the possible range between 1 and 1 preventing poorly performing catchments from having a disproportionate impact on the average calculated in step 6 and hence the calibrated value for ω aggregated performance results e g mean performance across all catchments are herein reported in c2m for the same reason time series calibrations sections 3 4 1 and 5 were undertaken using the more widely applied nse criterion but since there is a monotonic relationship between nse and c2m use of either function would give the same parameter sets in these cases the following parameters were obtained for the five gr4j calibration subset lengths table 2 in all five cases values above zero but below 10 the user specified upper limit for calibration were selected indicating that the weighting scheme tends to preference series calibrated under similar climatic conditions but also extracts information from series representing contrasting conditions for the four year calibration subsets the value of ω was particularly small 0 07 which means that all six series tend to be weighted relatively evenly for most catchments proportional weightings tended to vary between about 0 14 and 0 20 for the six different series in contrast the series associated with shorter calibration subsets gave optimal performance with heavier weighting on more similar conditions this could indicate that calibration under more extreme conditions i e the driest or wettest single year in the entire record does not provide much useful information for the model when simulating more average conditions the exercise was repeated excluding the catchments for which independent four and five year calibration subsets could not be defined so all five tests used the same subset of catchments in this test larger values of ω were obtained in every case table 2 this highlights that the ω parameter is dependent on the combination of catchments used therefore ω calibration was repeated using different catchment groupings based on four year subsets since these performed best in the testing framework described in section 4 1 the groupings were defined based on hydrological physical and climatic characteristics of the watersheds with thresholds set such that the number of catchments in each group was fairly consistent the calibrated values for ω are shown in table 3 consistent trends in ω across a grouping are highlighted in shading e g consistently increasing ω relative to the proportion of rainy days where the largest ω value is shown in the darkest shade while there is potential for overlap in groups for example catchments with a high proportion of zero flow days may also have a small area criteria sets that could be expected to give overlaps were identified and checked if there were less than 20 catchments that were different between the two groups one of the criteria sets was discarded as such the catchment groupings shown in table 3 are all distinctly different for some catchment groupings no discernible pattern exists in the calibrated values of ω however in other cases there does seem to be a trend the value for ω tended to increase with decreasing dryness indicated by zero rain days and increasing latitude this suggests that wet catchments with strong rainfall seasonality as in the more northern parts of australia may benefit particularly from the use of the model weighting technique since the ω parameter indicates fairly strong preference for series calculated under similar conditions to the ω calibration period it is also interesting that the value for ω tended to increase with increasing flow variance relative to average flow this suggests that catchments with more variable flow regimes have higher parameter dependence on climate indicating that a single set of parameters may not appropriately capture the different catchment states negative parameter values indicate that the group of catchments is not benefiting from the weighting procedure as intended rather the best results are obtained from series calibrated under the conditions that deviate most from the ω calibration period i e in the extreme an average period would be modeled by taking the mean of the series associated with the driest and wettest calibration periods a preference for negative ω values in certain catchments was associated with three main patterns 1 all six models of the catchment performed very poorly in the ω calibration period in these cases it was not meaningful to weight the series and unexpected values of ω often optimized results 2 there was no meaningful relationship between calibration subset conditions and modeled flow behavior for example dry calibrated series sometimes matched high flows more accurately than wet calibrated series this was fairly common in the results and suggests that the gr4j models may not be reflecting catchment response realistically 3 one series gave very bad results the ω calibration algorithm would tend to distance this series by choosing a value of ω that minimized its contribution if the series had a similar calibration rdin to the ω calibration period this would be a large negative value of ω the overall efficacy of the weighting method for the full set of catchments as well as groupings based on different properties is investigated in section 4 3 4 3 application of the weighting strategy for each calibration time period and in each catchment the six series section 2 were weighted and aggregated over the test period two water years starting in 2012 the steps are outlined as follows 1 take the appropriate ω value depending on calibration subset length from table 2 2 for the first catchment calculate rdin similarity between each calibration subset and the unseen test period eq 3 3 standardize similarity values to sum to one giving weights for each associated series eq 4 4 multiply the test period modelled series associated with each calibration subset by the appropriate weight and sum to give a weighted prediction the results of the weighting strategy application were benchmarked against a traditional calibration approach where data over the full calibration period 35 years was used to calibrate one set of parameters under the assumption of stationarity the performance indicators were the mean difference in c2m between the weighting strategy and the traditional calibration approach the median difference in c2m between the weighting strategy and the traditional calibration approach the percentage of catchments for which the weighting strategy improved prediction based on all three indicators the best performance was achieved with four year calibration subsets table 4 this was predicted by the testing framework described in section 4 1 indicating that the framework is appropriate for assessing decisions that influence the weighting strategy the results presented here suggest that extracting past information in a targeted way based on climatic conditions may improve simulation of a climatically distinct future period when the optimum length of calibration subset four years was used in the weighting strategy predictions improved in 66 of catchments although the mean and median improvements in c2m were fairly small it is possible that the strategy would provide more benefit in a climate change assessment where the testing period would likely be more different to the average past conditions since model weighting is unlikely to provide significant benefit if the testing period is not climatically distinct from the full calibration period the four year subset results for catchments where the test period conditions deviated from the average are shown in table 5 for wet validation periods rdin 0 1 the weighting scheme improved results for 74 of catchments compared to 66 over the full set of catchments and the median improvement was also higher table 4 for dry validation periods rdin 0 1 the mean and median nse improvements were both higher than for the full set of catchments this indicates that the scheme tends to give the greatest improvements under dry conditions but that improvements are more consistent under wet conditions as expected model weighting appears to be more advantageous under conditions that deviate notably from the average climate at a catchment the process was repeated for the different catchment groupings outlined in section 4 2 using the ω parameter values given in table 3 the model test results are shown in table 6 consistent trends in performance across a criterion i e all three indicators moving in the same direction are highlighted in shading where the greatest improvement is shown in the darkest shade unexpectedly the results indicate that the calibrated value of ω does not necessarily predict the validation performance of the model weighting strategy under unseen conditions in the cases of both flow variance and latitude the groupings with negative and very small ω values respectively in table 3 had the best validation performance performance improved especially strongly as runoff ratio decreased perhaps indicating that dry intermittent catchments generally considered difficult to model may benefit particularly from model weighting however overall it seems that the strategy is highly dependent on the specific set of catchments used and it is not necessarily straightforward to predict how ω is likely to vary under different conditions it follows that a more flexible approach where parameter changes are specifically calibrated for each catchment might be worth investigating this finding provided the motivation for the work described in section 5 5 climate dependent dynamic model parameters the results discussed in section 4 particularly those shown in tables 3 and 6 demonstrate that it is not straightforward to generalize the weighting strategy across different catchments it is unlikely that a universal weighting strategy could be defined such that all catchments experienced improved performance consistently under future conditions therefore for the third experiment a more flexible approach was adopted in which all four gr4j parameters were allowed to vary based on rdin this dynamic version of the model was calibrated individually for each catchment meaning that model parameters dependence on climate did not need to be generalized across multiple catchments with different sensitivities in the dynamic version of gr4j each of the four standard gr4j parameters x1 x2 x3 and x4 is defined as a 3 parameter sigmoidal function this form was selected because it is substantially more flexible than a simple linear function but still requires that the parameter change somewhat consistently with rdin i e the value cannot increase with rdin up to a certain point then decrease this increases the likelihood of parameter shifts being physically interpretable and decreases the extent of equifinality expected in the flexible model the functions defining the four gr4j parameters are as follows eq 6 6 x 1 t 0 1 t 1 1 e a 1 r d i e a 1 r d i 1 x 2 t 0 2 t 1 2 e a 2 r d i e a 2 r d i 1 x 3 t 0 3 t 1 3 e a 3 r d i e a 3 r d i 1 x 4 t 0 4 t 1 4 e a 4 r d i e a 4 r d i 1 rdin is defined on a monthly basis so the parameters vary at a monthly timestep based on the overall conditions of that month the sigmoidal function parameters e g t0 1 t1 1 and a1 to define x1 are calibrated to give a function specifying the four original parameters meaning that the number of calibration parameters is 12 for the dynamic model naturally this leads to a substantial reduction in calibration efficiency which could only be justified if the method significantly outperformed both traditional calibration and the model weighting strategy the original static model is one possible realization of the dynamic model i e if t1 1 t1 2 t1 3 and t1 4 all calibrate to zero so the option of one or more parameters remaining static is inherently available if this provides the best calibration because catchment behavior under very wet or dry climate conditions could be more extreme than overall catchment behavior we decided to add flexibility by allowing greater variation in parameter values than is generally applied for gr4j table 7 for comparison the standard four parameter version of gr4j was also run with the expanded parameter ranges the models were calibrated based on nse over the same 35 year period water years 1974 2009 used in the model weighting strategy calibration step again the final five water years were kept aside for validation in this case no second calibration period was required as in ω calibration for the experiment described in section 4 so the full five year period was used for validation the 12 calibrated parameters were used to define the four parameters in the standard version of gr4j dynamically with respect to rdin an example of how the parameters may vary with climate is shown in fig 6 the static and dynamic models were compared over the calibration and validation periods as would be expected from a more flexible model the dynamic model outperformed the static model over the calibration period in 91 of cases indicating that the dynamic calibration was mostly successful theoretically the dynamic model should always give equal or better calibrations than the static model since the static model is nested within the dynamic model in cases where the dynamic calibration nse was lower it indicates that the calibration algorithm located a local peak in the objective function rather than the true optimum but this is difficult to avoid entirely for a model with a large number of parameters the dynamic model also outperformed the static model over the validation period in 59 of catchments results aggregated across catchments are reported in terms of c2m as discussed in section 4 2 because this avoids excessive influence from individual catchments with very poor performance the mean and median c2m values were higher for the dynamic model in both the calibration and validation periods table 8 interestingly the variance in validation performance was substantially smaller for the dynamic model indicating that the performance was more consistent across the 164 catchments this suggests that the dynamic model may be particularly useful when simulating catchments that the static model represents poorly further investigation revealed that the dynamic model offered far greater performance improvements for dry validation periods most of the catchments tested were relatively wet over the water years from 2009 to 2014 but 29 catchments had average rdin values less than zero for the validation period for these catchments the dynamic model outperformed the static model in 76 of cases versus 56 of the models where average validation period rdin was greater than zero it is well established that existing conceptual models achieve better validation results over wet periods than dry periods vaze et al 2010 so the dynamic model may not offer a significant advantage during wet periods when only the 29 simulations with dry validation periods were considered table 9 the validation performance improvement was more substantial than for the full suite of models table 8 these results suggest that there may be promise in updating existing conceptual models by using climate dependent parameter values especially for drier future climate scenarios there was no clear difference in performance between catchments with different areas or latitudes intuitively it seems that the utility of climate varying model parameters should depend on how they relate to physical processes in the catchment this can be difficult to ascertain in conceptual models but different conceptual models inherently account for physical processes in widely varying ways therefore future work should test the potential of climate varying parameters in other conceptual models in this study we found that dynamic calibration resulted in widely varying effects in different catchments for some catchments the optimal values for three parameters remained static with climate and just one parameter varied notably this suggests that for some catchments it may be possible to reduce the total number of calibration parameters by representing three gr4j parameters as static and one as dynamic however for other catchments several parameters varied together to give the optimal dynamic model this is evident in the results for station 304 497 shown in fig 6 where x1 remains stable with climatic conditions but x2 x3 and x4 all vary substantially there were some patterns identified across catchments e g x2 tended to increase with increasing rdin but these were not sufficiently consistent to inform potential model structural changes while the results presented here show potential for model improvement through accounting for parameter dependence on climate they certainly don t solve the problem of model nonstationarity entirely efficacy varied across catchments and poor performance often seemed to be associated with models where the parameters did not seem to represent catchment behavior as expected for example when wet period calibration parameters performed best under dry testing conditions this implies that some minimum level of reasonable process representation may be required to reliably relate model parameters to climate conditions and ultimately to improve model performance under nonstationarity deb et al 2019 recently showed that better representing surface water ground water interactions improved hydrologic simulation under change these sorts of processes are notoriously difficult to model in some highly intermittent australian catchments with complex spatially and temporally varying runoff mechanisms dean et al 2016 so it is likely to be some time before hydrologists can rely entirely on physical process representation rather than calibrated conceptual parameters however lumped conceptual models like gr4j make no attempt to represent any of these physical complexities and may not be suitable for continued use in a changing climate 6 conclusion our results along with much prior work indicate that transferring conceptual hydrologic models to unseen future climate states will result in performance degradation the experiments presented in this paper show that increased reliability may be achievable through preferential use of climatically similar calibration data while still extracting some information from contrasting periods as well however there is high variability in performance improvements between catchments in many cases this seems to relate to the conceptual model failing to reflect realistic catchment behavior changes under different climate states it also seems that the importance of climate conditions in determining model parameters cannot be easily generalized across numerous catchments an alternative approach defining climate dependent dynamic parameters was also tested the dynamic model gave improved validation performance especially under dry conditions in combination these experiments show that the performance of conceptual models under altered climate conditions can be improved through both targeted use of calibration data and model structural adjustments since previous studies have demonstrated parameter dependence on climate for a wide range of hydrologic models guo et al 2018 merz et al 2011 vaze et al 2010 it is likely that models other than gr4j could also see some prediction improvement through application of the methods outlined here however these sorts of strategies are unlikely to offer a silver bullet that reliably improves model predictions in all catchments and so it is important to continue improving representation of physical dynamics that contribute to nonstationarity in conceptual hydrologic models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

6086,physically based distributed hydrological models pdhm are complex and exhibits extreme challenges for simulating the dynamics of coupled streamflow and groundwater table depths the present work assesses the capabilities of a pdhm shetran in capturing streamflow and depth to groundwater table to represent the hydrologic processes within a wet tropical humid catchment the most significant model parameters for the coupled simulations of streamflow and groundwater table depths are assessed through a multiobjective sensitivity analysis using morris screening method and local sensitivity analysis horizontal and vertical soil saturated hydraulic conductivities specific storage as well as actual potential evapotranspiration and strickler overland coefficient are highly sensitive for both the model responses considered in order to arrive at the optimal model parameters for simulating depth to water table and streamflow the effect of three model parametrization approaches were analyzed with no spatial variation in soil properties elevation based variation of only middle and bottom soil layer saturated hydraulic conductivity and elevation based variation of horizontal kx vertical kz soil saturated hydraulic conductivities and specific storage ss results indicate that for the studied watershed the elevation based variation in kx kz and ss resulted in a better prediction of depth to water table variations in terms of correlation coefficient with no significant improvements in streamflow simulation compared to the other two parameterization cases the study suggests incorporating preferential flows in shetran model to improve prediction of the water table dynamics in catchments belonging to the humid tropical region keywords physically based distributed model shetran multi objective sensitivity analysis parameterization streamflow groundwater table depth 1 introduction hydrological processes within a river basin are altered significantly due to changes in climate and land use and hence assessment of the impacts associated with these changes is imperative for water resources planning and management physically based distributed hydrologic models pdhm are extensively used in assessing the impact of climate change land use changes and estimation of sediment yield in river basins birkinshaw et al 2016 birkinshaw et al 2011 elliott et al 2012 pdhm models can incorporate the spatial variability in watershed characteristics such as soil land use and topography however the calibration of physically based distributed model requires tremendous efforts due to high computational demands and a multitude of input parameters blasone et al 2007 identification of parameter values in pdhms is associated with many issues such as limited data availability to represent spatial heterogeneity in properties of a catchment like soil hydraulic properties simplified representation of natural processes in models spatial scale differences between field measurements and model parameters beven 1989 grayson et al 1992b these issues necessitate model calibration procedure for pdhms manual calibration by trial and error procedure is widely adopted for pdhm models refsgaard and knudsen 1996 refsgaard 1997 the manual model calibration approach is subjective time consuming and requires modeller s expertise and understanding about the study region to achieve realistic model representation a systematic approach to reduce parameter dimension needs to be applied for a lesser number of model runs during the calibration sometimes the inadequate knowledge regarding model parameter sensitivities can lead modeller s attention on insensitive parameters resulting in considerable time wastage bahremand and smedt 2008 sensitivity analysis sa is a valuable tool in identifying parameters that significantly influence concerned specific model outputs herman et al 2013 saltelli et al 2000 local or global sensitivity analysis methods could be performed prior to model calibration the major limitation in local sa method is that it assumes the relationship between the parameter and the output to be linear where one parameter is varied while keeping other parameters at nominal values to identify model response spruill et al 2000 unlike local sa in global sa the whole parameter space and possible parameter interactions are taken into account to find out the effect on output due to input variations sarrazin et al 2016 however a high number of model evaluations constrain the application of global sa methods to distributed models few of the extensively used global sensitivity techniques include i variance based technique like fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast cukier et al 1973 saltelli et al 1999 and the sobol method sobol 1993 ii global screening method such as latin hypercube oat lh oat van griensven et al 2006 and the morris method morris 1991 iii regional sensitivity analysis rsa spear and hornberger 1980 and iv response surface methodology myers and montgomery 1995 studies have been performed comparing the efficiency of different global sa methods in parameter sensitivity analysis of hydrologic models dobler and pappenberger 2013 gan et al 2014 herman et al 2013 reported that the morris method identified sensitive parameters of a spatially distributed hydrologic model with 300 times fewer model evaluations than the sobol method the morris screening method has also been proven to be effective in terms of accuracy and efficiency especially for models with a large number of inputs sun et al 2012 sensitivity information from basic statistics is computed based on elementary effects ee for each input in this method morris 1991 physically distributed models can provide multiple outputs streamflow evapotranspiration soil moisture groundwater level each of these model outputs have multiple characteristics in case of streamflow high flows low flows or overall water balance and including all these aspects makes the calibration procedure even more complex blasone et al 2007 insufficient observed time series datasets of all model outputs also hinders the proper validation of distributed models blasone et al 2008 in most cases of pdhm models only the discharge at the outlet is available to evaluate the model performance bathurst 1986 refsgaard and knudsen 1996 grayson et al 1992b referred to equifinality which implies that in terms of only discharge as model output in spite of incorrectly parameterized internal processes acceptable results can still be achieved due to compensating errors the alternative parameterizations which yield correct discharge erroneously as a result of compensating errors within the model could be excluded by considering multi model responses representing different catchment hydrologic processes grayson et al 1992a o connell and todini 1996 sensitivity analysis results may differ based on different objective functions considered and hence it is essential to adopt a multi objective approach to sa in distributed models wagener et al 2009 yang et al 2012 yang et al 2014 model simulations fail to capture all the observed hydrograph characteristics when a single objective function is considered during the calibration vrugt et al 2003 different aspects of the hydrograph are represented by different objective functions hence a multiobjective calibration strategy should be adopted before hydrologic model calibration gupta et al 1998 water table depth is an important variable to be considered for model performance evaluation because of its high influence on hydrological processes such as discharge and evapotranspiration dai et al 2010 however studies which have tried to calibrate distributed and integrated models coupling groundwater and surface water processes are limited anderton et al 2002a b dai et al 2010 madsen 2003 due to the high computational demands and multitude of input parameters of these models blasone et al 2007 in addition to these factors model parameter interactions are even more complex for integrated models resulting in low identifiability of parameters beven 1989 the studies which attempted to evaluate distributed models using multiple model outputs have emphasized the significance of rigorous model parameterization for model calibration and stated that it is challenging to capture the spatial distribution of groundwater table dai et al 2010 condon and maxwell 2015 the groundwater table dynamics is significantly controlled by the variations of soil and sub soil physical properties soil depth hydraulic conductivity in vertical or horizontal directions porosity etc ambroise et al 1996 weiler and mcdonnell 2004 in many modelling studies as a way to simplify the calibration procedure soil properties are assumed to be laterally homogeneous while such an assumption of homogeneity will not affect discharge simulations from the model significantly it may not yield good water table depth predictions saulnier et al 1997 gascuel odoux et al 2010 by incorporating lateral variations in hydraulic conductivity using topmodel approach better estimates of simulated water table depths with respect to observed water table depths were produced lamb et al 1997 seibert et al 1997 a case study where procuring field data was infeasible has been investigated by gascuel odoux et al 2010 using a physically based hillslope model hill vi different spatial models to incorporate topographic variation to soil model properties porosity hydraulic conductivity were tested by them as a way to represent spatial heterogeneity in soil properties in the absence of fully distributed field data and improved water table depth predictions were achieved previous studies

local sa was applied to identify and quantify the most influential model parameters in simulating streamflow for netravathi river basin by considering spatial variability in only the land use related parameter and homogeneous soil properties in three soil layers sreedevi and eldho 2019 new approaches are to be devised for shetran model parameterization and choice of calibration parameters in case of medium sized catchments where multiple model outputs are considered in this study we investigate the effectiveness of an elevation based model parametrization approach for calibration of physically distributed model shetran considering streamflow and groundwater table depth on a river basin scale to start with we evaluate the model for only streamflow as output using the relevant model parameters identified by sensitivity analysis and then proceed to investigate how coupled simulations of streamflow and groundwater table can be improved using the elevation based model parameterization approach within the context of above discussion the specific objectives of the study are 1 to identify and quantify the model parameter influence on streamflow generation by performing a multiobjective global and local sensitivity analysis without considering heterogeneity in soil parameters 2 to calibrate and validate the model using spatially homogeneous soil parameters for streamflow 3 to quantify the most sensitive model parameter influence on coupled model simulations of streamflow and depth to water table 4 to assess the impact of elevation based model parameterization approach in coupled model simulations and to estimate parameters for both the model output variables 2 shetran model shetran is a physically based distributed model capable of simulating water flow sediment and contaminant transport on a river basin scale ewen et al 2000 the standard version of shetran v 4 4 5 was used in this study she système hydrologique europeen model abbott et al 1986a b was improved with component for sediment and contaminant transport wicks 1988 ewen 1995 along with subsurface water flow model which is three dimensional variably saturated parkin 1996 to develop shetran this work has utilized only the water flow component of the model comprising of separate modules each for overland flow channel flow and evapotranspiration an inbuilt module for sensitivity analysis and calibration is absent in the shetran model hence the application of global sensitivity analysis combined with a local sensitivity analysis can help in simplifying the calibration of shetran model parameters the advantage of using shetran over other conceptual or semi distributed models is that the spatially distributed characteristic of the model allows for a detailed representation of spatial heterogeneity in catchment properties although the values of parameters with physical meaning can be estimated using field studies commensurability issues occur with the model parameters that required to be given at grid scale in the distributed model beven 2001 in shetran the river basin is discretized in the form of rectangular computational grids with each surface grid having columns of cells having vegetation type information on the top and extending downwards representing the soil rock layer beneath to facilitate finite difference method solution of

the arabian sea the data used in the study their spatial resolution time period sources are provided in table 1 in order to have reliable estimates of streamflow from any hydrologic model it is essential to provide rainfall dataset which is consistent with respect to observed streamflow data here we utilized two daily rainfall datasets india meteorological department imd and aphrodite

genuchten α and land use parameter aet pet used for sensitivity analysis were taken from reference manual of shetran model shetran 2013 the model parameters along with the parameter ranges considered for sensitivity analysis are presented in table 2 three soil layers were considered in the model with separate parameter ranges provided for each layer strickler overland coefficient the reciprocal of manning s roughness coefficient is used as a land use parameter in the model the value of this parameter was chosen based on chow 1959 the sensitivity analysis was carried out in two stages in the first stage we analyzed model parameter sensitivity considering only streamflow to arrive at the best model parameter sets no spatial variation in soil parameters were included and in the next stage the applicability of the best parameter values obtained in first stage was tested for coupled simulation of streamflow and depth to water table depth to water table refers to the distance from the surface of the ground to the level of water table beneath the surface further we examined the model parameter sensitivity to both streamflow and depth to water table and applied an elevation based spatial variation to most significant model parameters for obtaining good simulation considering both streamflow and depth to water table the methodology of sensitivity analysis and model calibration validation carried out in two stages are shown in fig 2 4 1 stage i streamflow simulations for the first stage two sensitivity analysis methods comprising of morris screening morris 1991 and local sensitivity by varying one parameter at a time were implemented the shetran model parameters were ranked in the order of significance for streamflow generation by morris method and further one parameter was varied at a time to evaluate the influence of each parameter towards streamflow generation quantitatively the local sensitivity analysis characterizes the direction of change in output due to changes in inputs 4 1 1 morris sensitivity analysis the morris method involves perturbing model parameters one at a time morris 1991 corresponding to each perturbation the elementary effect ee is given by the relative difference of the model output with and without perturbation δ of the ith factor as follows 1 ee i f x 1 x i δ i x k f x δ i where f x is the function evaluation at the prior point in the trajectory and δ is the predefined sampling increment given by p 2 p 1 where p represents the number of levels to be specified saltelli et al 2004 recommends value of p between 4 and 10 within the parameter space ee is calculated at different locations for r number of replications a model with k parameters will have a sample size of r k 1 the recommended value of r is in the range 10 50 campolongo et al 2007 herman et al 2013 however increasing this value will only provide more reliability to sensitivity analysis results kelleher et al 2015 in order to attain proper parameter ranking using the morris method the repetition number greater than 20 is noted in previous studies ruano et al 2011 gan et al 2014 sreedevi and eldho 2019 higher value of repetition number is an indication for a highly nonlinear behavior of the system or a large uncertainty in input in this study the original sampling approach proposed by morris 1991 is utilized the morris sensitivity measures for each factor x i is given by µi mean of elementary effects and σi standard deviation of elementary effects which provides the degree of parameter sensitivity and the parameter interaction extent campolongo and saltelli 1997 proposed the use of µ mean of absolute value of elementary effects to avoid chances of the positive and negative values of µ to get cancelled for nonmonotonic models saltelli et al 2006 in this study we used the measure µ to rank the parameters and identify the significant model parameters from the non influential parameters 2 μ i 1 r j 1 r ee i j an open source sensitivity package in r software was used for implementing the morris method in this study pujol et al 2015 table 2 gives the 31 model parameters with the range of values used for sensitivity analysis in this study a uniform distribution of parameters between the ranges was assumed due to lack of information on the type of distribution with the aim to eliminate a type i error false positive identifying a factor which is non important as significant or a type ii error false negative identifying factor which is important as not significant ruano et al 2011 highlighted the importance of determining the optimal repetition number for each study hence in this study for a constant grid level p 32 the optimal value of r has been searched yang 2011 reported morris parameter rankings to be more distinguishable at p values greater than 10 hence in this study we chose higher grid levels p various replication numbers r 20 40 60 and 80 were used to attain a stable ranking of model parameters thus the sample sizes generated for each repetition number were r 31 1 640 1280 1920 2560 here we computed an index position factor pf r i r j proposed by ruano et al 2012 to evaluate the convergence of ranking i e stability in ranking numerically for ranking obtained from two samples ri and rj position factor index is given as follows 3 pf r i r j k 1 k p k i p k j μ p k i p k j where p k i is the position of the kth parameter in the ranking obtained by ri and μ p k i p k j is the average of the kth parameter positions in the ranking obtained by ri and rj the difference in parameter rankings with samples of size ri and rj is indicated by position factor index position of parameters in the ranking is not subjected to change with sample sizes if the position factor index value is low thus in the present study parameter ranking is considered to be stable when low values are found for a range of sample sizes tested in order to investigate if the model parameter rankings would significantly differ depending on dry or wet year morris analysis was carried out separately for wet dry year and a mixed period of dry wet year the year 1986 with 50 annual rainfall less than the average annual rainfall for the period 1980 to 2009 was regarded as a dry year and year 2005 with 20 rainfall more than the average annual rainfall for the period 1980 to 2009 was regarded as a wet year years 1986 and 1987 were chosen as dry wet mixed period no single objective function is efficient enough to capture all the hydrograph characteristics for example most widely used objective function nash sutcliffe efficiency nse or correlation based measures r are oversensitive to extreme values legates and mccabe 1999 whereas selecting relative volume error re as an objective function may not capture peak flow and shape of hydrograph properly but result in a good performance on total volume hence for evaluating the morris analysis results a multi objective approach was adopted in this study moussa and chahinian 2009 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and relative error of volumetric fit revf for streamflow were used to evaluate results of morris analysis

q obs and q sim is the mean of the observed and simulated discharge respectively n is the total number of observations morris method helps in ranking model parameters qualitatively and screening out the insignificant parameters with less computational cost compared to other global sensitivity analysis methods however it should be noted that morris analysis is incapable of quantifying the influence of parameters on the output hence the local sensitivity method is applied further in this study to provide a quantitative estimate of the sensitivity of each model parameter on streamflow the standard version v4 4 5 of the shetran model was run automatically using matlab software for the sensitivity analysis 4 1 2 local sensitivity analysis the sensitivity to total discharge was assessed in this study by varying each model parameter one at a time local sa is applied to determine the nature of model parameter contribution to streamflow whether an increase or decrease due to changes in their values taking into account the high number of shetran parameters the local sa method is not computationally expensive unlike other quantitative global sa methods like glue or sobol song et al 2015 it is advantageous to perform local sa as a preliminary step to more computationally demanding methods moreover local sa helps to determine whether an increase in parameter values results in an increase or decrease in streamflow the 31 model parameters were perturbed within the range of values presented in table 2 to generate a total of 166 samples shetran model set up at 1 km resolution was run for the time period 1980 to 1990 on a daily scale with the year 1980 taken as warm up period and land use data corresponding to the year 1985 for the local sensitivity analysis 4 1 3 parameter estimation for streamflow simulation from the morris samples corresponding to optimal repetition identified r for the dry wet mixed period 1986 to1987 we selected those samples which yielded highest value of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and lowest value of root mean square error rmse relative error of volumetric fit revf for the daily streamflow simulation the values of parameters found to be non influential in streamflow generation were fixed based on these selected morris samples the parameters identified as most significant using morris sa are only considered for calibration manually the maximum and minimum values of calibrated parameters defining the boundary values were used to develop boundary envelopes of streamflow hydrographs within which the simulated hydrographs having the best match with the observed hydrograph could be determined for the time period 1980 to 1994 with year 1980 considered as warmup period for the upper boundary increase the parameters which cause an increase in streamflow and decrease others which cause a decrease in streamflow for the lower envelope decrease the parameter values which cause an increase in streamflow and increase parameter values which cause a decrease in streamflow in addition to the objective functions mentioned in section 4 1 1 rmse observations standard ratio rsr and correlation coefficient r were also considered to assess the model performance for streamflow calibration on both daily and monthly scale eqs 7 and 8 according to moriasi et al 2007 the streamflow simulations can be regarded as very good nse 0 5 pbias 10 or revf 0 1 and rsr 0 5 for monthly scale gupta et al 1998 reported that the calibration method taking into account multi objectives can aid in apprehending model limitations all parameter sets thus obtained by fine tuning which resulted in daily nse 0 5 and revf 0 1 were found out these parameter sets were used in the second stage for preliminary evaluation of model performance in terms of both streamflow and depth to water table it should be noted that the final calibrated model parameters for streamflow in the first stage do not account their spatial variation in model parameters to save the computational time for running the shetran model 7 r s r r m s e s t d e v q o b s 8 r i 1 n q o b s i q o b s i q s i m i q s i m i i 1 n q o b s i q o b s i

n is the total number of observations 4 2 stage ii coupled simulations of streamflow and groundwater table depth the observed depth to water table data is unavailable for the time period 1980 to 1994 considered for only streamflow simulations in the stage i hence the second stage of sensitivity analysis considering both streamflow and depth to water table as output was performed for a time period outside the stage i simulation period i e the year 2003 to 2007 for which observed data of both streamflow and depth to water table were available we also checked whether the calibrated model parameters from stage i are applicable to a different time period years 2003 to 2007 before proceeding to coupled simulations calibrating the model precisely for depth to water table is difficult since pumping and irrigation are not accounted for as well as mismatch exists in the spatial scale between model and observed water table depth data in the present study hence this study examines only if the model can capture temporal trends in the observed water table along with good streamflow simulation the streamflow calibrated model parameters in the first stage assumed no spatial variation in model soil parameters and hence capturing depth to water table temporal pattern would be difficult the dominant factors controlling groundwater dynamics and streamflow differ depending upon the study catchment groundwater levels can be driven mainly by topography without much influence of spatial variation in hydraulic conductivities in catchments with low permeability soils doppler et al 2014 while a combined influence of soil properties and topography might exert stronger control in catchments with high permeability soils bachmair and weiler 2012 mcdonnell 1990 meerveld et al 2007 uchida et al 2003a b for the coupled simulations as a first step we evaluated the model performance using the best model parameters from stage i with the aim of identifying the most significant parameters and quantifying the influence of all model parameters on streamflow and depth to water table global and local sensitivity analyses was performed for a second time due to lack of fully distributed field data the most significant model parameters for both model output i e streamflow and depth to water table identified using sa was spatially varied according to elevation zones as given in table 3 we compared the shetran model performance with the test cases of no spatial variation in soil parameters and spatially varying soil properties according to elevation zones the soil properties in each elevation zone were varied until the model performed well for predicting streamflow and depth to water table pattern simultaneously the effect of elevation based change in model parameters on streamflow and depth to water table were assessed based on visual comparison of simulated and observed water table depth together with correlation coefficient r values as well as objective functions for streamflow simulation mentioned in section 4 1 1 here r gives the degree of linear relationship between observed and simulated data 5 results 5 1 sensitivity analysis for streamflow simulation 5 1 1 morris analysis the sensitivity measures μ and σ at grid level 32 for different numbers of replications r 20 40 60 80 using nse rmse and revf as objective functions as shown in tables s1 s3 in supplementary information the sensitivity measure values µ and σ are scaled between 0 and 1 it can be noted that on increasing the replication times r the sensitivity measure values of model parameters tend to be closer in similarity table 4 shows the position factor index computed for each pair of compared rankings to quantitatively evaluate the parameter rankings the higher values of replication times r result in the position factor index pf r i r j values to decrease indicating that the positions of the parameters in the compared rankings are closely similar the computed position factor index value is lowest upon increasing the r value from 60 to 80 thus for this study r 80 is chosen as the optimal replication time the overall model runs are therefore 2560 simulations r k 1 with k 31 r 80 the computational cost of one simulation daily scale is around 10 min using a pc with 3 2 ghz intel pentium processor the morris sensitivity measures can be shown graphically by screening plots which have as the x and y axes the mean µ denoting parameter sensitivity and standard deviations σ denoting nonlinearity and parameter interaction respectively fig 3 represents the scatter plot of morris sensitivity indices for three objective functions and three periods i e dry wet and mixed the numbers shown in the scatter plot represent the order of the parameters as in table 2 the sensitive red numbers and insensitive blue numbers labels are decided based on the threshold value of μ 0 05 the parameter is considered to be significant if the value of sensitivity measure μ is high while insignificant parameters can be identified as those with a μ value of zero a high value of σ indicates parameter interaction or a nonlinear effect on the output saltelli et al 2004 the value of absolute mean μ only is taken into account in order to rank the streamflow influential model parameters in shetran the parameter rankings for the three objective functions considered namely nse rmse and revf description given in section 4 1 1 are shown in table 5 parameters identified as most significant considering all the three periods dry wet and mixed are soil properties mainly horizontal and vertical saturated hydraulic conductivities specific storage and vegetation parameters actual potential evapotranspiration ratio and strickler overland coefficient the order of highest ranked model parameters did not differ significantly between the three periods however it can be noted that during dry year the vegetation parameters aet pet and strickler overland coefficient had a significant control in streamflow generation compared to the soil parameters rankings based on nse and rmse are similar for all three periods however for the objective function revf irrespective of the period considered dry wet or mixed year parameter aet pet of dominant land use type i e plantations occupy the highest rank indicating the key role of this parameter for a good water balance within the studied catchment belonging to wet humid tropic region it can be also noted that in addition to the soil parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity and specific storage the residual soil moisture content and van genuchten alpha also found a position in the ranking for revf as objective function the relevance of the parameter strickler overland coefficient is justified on the grounds that it is a major factor affecting variable source areas as noted by lee and delleur 1976 previous studies by putty and prasad 1994 in the western ghats region suggested that runoff processes in this region can be described using the variable source area theory dunne and black 1970 hewlett and troendle 1975 because the infiltration excess overland flow is negligibly small in this region nse tends to emphasize the timing and magnitude of peak flows and be influenced by extreme values of the error kelleher et al 2015 legates and mccabe 1999 the parameter ranking taking into account only nse for the wet year indicates that subsurface soil properties kx kz and ss have a dominant control on streamflow generation along with vegetation parameters str and aet pet the high σ value as shown in fig 3 of the parameter vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity kz of the middle soil layer and aet pet indicate that these have strong interaction or non linearities with the value of other parameters sensitivity analysis results of parameters depend on various factors like climate soil land use characteristics of the catchments and hence transferring its results between basins is considered to be infeasible van griensven et al 2006 consequently morris analysis results presented here pertain to wet mountainous catchment in tropics out of the 31 model parameters considered for sensitivity analysis nine parameters were identified to be most sensitive to streamflow generation fixing the values of non influential parameters identified using morris analysis can help to simplify the shetran calibration procedure 5 1 2 local sensitivity analysis fig 4 shows the variation of total discharge due to change in parameter values one at a time the increase in parameter values that contribute to an increase in total discharge are horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity and strickler overland coefficient increase in parameter values of vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity θsat θres difference between saturated and residual moisture content van genuchten parameters n and α specific storage and actual potential evapotranspiration ratio result in a decrease in total discharge the percentage change in total discharge due to the change in parameter values one at a time are shown in fig 5 it can be observed that an increase in strickler overland coefficient of the dominant land use type i e plantation from 0 05 to 2 m1 3s 1 result in a 6 increase in total discharge whereas the variation in values of other land use types contribute to less than 1 increase in total discharge fig 5a the increase of aet pet at field capacity value for the land use types plantation and forest by values of 0 6 and 0 5 cause total discharge to decrease by 11 and 1 respectively the increase in parameter horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity of bottom and middle soil layer by 6 m day and 25 m day result in 0 1 and 1 3 increase in total discharge respectively whereas top layer horizontal hydraulic conductivity change has only negligible effect fig 5b corresponding to an increase in vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity of top middle bottom layers by 10 m d 5 m d and 2 m d the total discharge shows a decrease of 2 4 and 0 8 respectively the changes in all other soil parameters i e ss van genuchten n van genuchten α and θsat θres difference between saturated and residual moisture content produce less than 1 change to total discharge fig 5c the quantitative estimates from local sa revealed the highest individual contribution to streamflow due to change in the model parameters namely strickler overland coefficient actual potential evapotranspiration vertical and horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity local sa application helped to quantify as well as to determine the nature of parameter contribution an increase or decrease on streamflow which the morris method is incapable of providing 5 2 parameter estimation for streamflow simulation the values of parameters identified as non influential in simulating streamflow i e strickler overland coefficient of land use types other than plantation and forest soil parameters ss topsoil layer van genuchten n van genuchten α θsat θres topsoil hydraulic conductivities which are fixed based on the morris samples corresponding to optimal repetition identified r 80 sample size 2560 for the dry wet mixed period 1986 to1987 yielding highest value of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and lowest value of root mean square error rmse relative error of volumetric fit revf are shown in table 2 the significant model parameters identified using morris analysis i e horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities middle and bottom soil layer specific storage middle and bottom soil layers aet pet at field capacity plantations and forest strickler overland coefficient plantations mixed trees boundary were adjusted to obtain boundary envelopes of streamflow upper and lower as shown in fig s2 supplementary information the model parameters of hydrologic component resulting in an increase in streamflow are used to establish the upper boundary envelope of hydrograph the lower values of aet pet ss kz and θsat θres and the upper values of kx ky and str plantations and forest the lower boundary envelope is determined by model parameters causing a decrease in streamflow the higher values of aet pet ss kz θsat θres and the upper values of kx ky and str plantations and forest a set of 20 model parameter sets satisfying the criterion for only two objective functions i e nse 0 5 and revf 0 1 for daily streamflow simulation during the period 1980 to 1988 by adjusting their values within the boundary ranges is arrived additional objective functions i e r and rsr see section 4 1 3 the criterion by moriasi et al 2007 and visual inspection of simulated hydrographs with observed are taken into account to fix the model parameter values which are optimal for generating streamflow table 2 it should be noted here that these parameter values are not spatially varying considering spatial variations in soil parameters apart from the vertical variations along depth would have required more model runs for sensitivity analysis hence the streamflow calibrated parameter values of soil parameters obtained are uniform irrespective of soil type the calibration period selected is from 1980 to 1994 with 1980 regarded as a warmup period for model initialization and validation period 1989 to 1994 only streamflow data is available for this period hence model performance for streamflow is assessed and presented in table 6 the monthly streamflow simulations obtained in both calibration and validation period shows nse 0 75 rsr 0 5 and revf 0 1 and hence can be regarded as very good according to the guidelines by moriasi et al 2007 gupta et al 1999 reported that a positive value of pbias indicates model underestimation bias and negative value indicates model overestimation bias accordingly the positive value of revf obtained in the calibration period shows model underestimation bias whereas the negative revf value indicates model bias towards overestimation hydrograph during calibration and validation period are shown in fig 6 the hydrographs are found to be well simulated in both calibration and validation periods 5 3 coupled streamflow and groundwater simulations 5 3 1 model parameter application outside calibration validation period in order to evaluate the performance of shetran model to simulate both streamflow and water table depth a different time period year 2002 to 2007 had to be chosen for which both streamflow and depth to water table data were available it is worth emphasizing that the aim of this study is only to check if the temporal trend in groundwater levels could be captured by the model along with a good streamflow simulation the comparison of monthly average rainfall and temperature of the two time periods calibration from year 1981 to 1988 and 2000 to 2007 did not show any marked difference in climate between these two periods see fig s3 and fig s4 in supplementary information the model performance in terms of streamflow and depth to water table is evaluated by applying best model parameter sets which produced nse 0 5 and revf 0 1 from stage i for only streamflow simulation it is observed that no parameter sets could provide correlation coefficient 0 5 for depth to water table considering the three observation wells individually although satisfactory streamflow simulation daily nse 0 5 and revf 0 1 is attained this clearly is an indication of the inconsistency in the model if calibrated only considering streamflow as model output and highlights the significance of evaluating model performance for more than one output as reported earlier by blasone et al 2008 a possible reason for poor simulation of water table dynamics could be that spatial variation of soil properties is neglected the studied catchment vamanapuram river basin belongs to the western ghats region which has highly heterogeneous soil and land use characteristics a study by dai et al 2010 indicated that distributed parameter values should be expected in areas of high spatial heterogeneity especially for those parameters that influence water table dynamics the model performance indicators for streamflow simulation for the time period 2003 2007 year 2002 taken as warmup period using optimal values of model parameters arrived at stage i are shown in table 6 for a monthly time step the nse rmse observations standard ratio rsr and relative error of volumetric fit revf values obtained indicate very good simulation of streamflow according to guidelines mentioned by moriasi et al 2007 the calibrated model parameters for the time period 1980 to 1988 are thus found to be applicable to a different time period from 2003 to 2007 to simulate only streamflow however the simulated water table depths from 2003 to 2007 using the streamflow only calibrated parameters do not reproduce the temporal trends in observed water table depths fig s5 in supplementary information hence a more rigorous parameterization approach is needed to capture both streamflow and depth to water table outputs simultaneously 5 3 2 sensitivity of model parameters to coupled simulations of streamflow and groundwater with an optimal repetition number r 80 the position factor index calculated is lowest among other repetition numbers of 20 40 and 60 for both model outputs ensuring parameter ranking stability position factor index values for coupled simulations during the time period 2003 to 2007 are shown in tables s4 of supplementary information the values of morris sensitivity measures for each repetition number are presented in tables s5 s7 morris sensitivity analysis considering all model parameters for coupled simulations of streamflow and depth to water table is shown in fig 7 the model parameter ranking for coupled simulations are presented in table 7 the most significant model parameters controlling both model outputs i e streamflow and depth to water table identified are vegetation parameters aet pet strickler overland coefficient and soil properties saturated hydraulic conductivity horizontal and vertical specific storage of middle and bottom soil layer vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity of the middle soil layer and aet pet has a high σ value indicating strong interaction or non linearities with other parameters see tables s5 s7 in supplementary information further all model parameters are varied between their maximum and minimum values as in table 2 one at a time and its effect on streamflow and depth to water table are analyzed simultaneously for the period 2003 to 2007 an increase in values of horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity result in an increase in streamflow and increase in depth to water table values strickler overland coefficient affects streamflow increase in total streamflow by 56 mm yr fig 8 a but shows little effect on water table depth fig 8e aet pet has a significant influence on streamflow and negligible effect on water table depth total discharge decrease by 145 39 mm yr and 19 87 mm yr respectively corresponding to increase in aet pet of plantation by 0 6 and forest by 0 4 fig 8d and fig 8h the change in horizontal hydraulic conductivity of middle and bottom soil by 25 m day and 6 m day contribute to an increase in streamflow by 36 mm yr and 6 mm yr respectively fig 8 b the average depth to water table increase from 0 95 m to 2 1 m corresponding to an increase in kxm value from 0 001 m day to 25 m day the value of kxb increase from 0 0001 m day to 6 m day cause average depth to water table to increase from 1 3 m to 3 29 m fig 8 f the topsoil layer kx value kxt has a negligible influence on the streamflow and depth to water table increase in vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity values of top middle and bottom soil layer by 10 m day 5 m day and 2 m day result in streamflow values to decrease by 13 mm yr 26 mm yr and 6 mm yr respectively fig 8 c average depth to water table values reduce by 0 02 m 0 42 m and 0 017 m corresponding to increase in kz values of the three soil layers by 10 m day 5 m day and 2 m day fig 8 g a slight reduction in streamflow mm yr values and an increase in depth to water table values are observed as a result of an increase in specific storage values the streamflow values decrease by 2 mm yr 5 4 mm yr and 5 mm yr whereas depth to water table increase only slightly upon increase in specific storage of top middle and bottom soil layers by 0 04 0 16 and 0 57 m respectively effect of soil parameters such as van genuchten α van genuchten n θsat θres and specific storage ss is not predominant in streamflow and depth to water table simulation for the studied catchment fig 9 from the analysis results it can be noted that horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity kxm kxb of the middle and bottom soil layer is a critical parameter affecting both streamflow and depth to water table in comparison to other model parameters vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity and specific storage also have substantial influence on the two model outputs 5 3 3 effect of spatial variation of soil properties on streamflow and groundwater simulations to effectively capture depth to water table variations in the highly heterogeneous watershed lacking fully distributed field data the model was tested for different cases three cases were tested by running the model using no spatial variation in soil properties with only middle and bottom soil layer horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity kxm kxb identified as most sensitive model parameter in section 5 3 1 and 5 3 2 varied corresponding to each elevation zone and with the three soil properties kx kz ss varied specifically for each elevation zone for the three soil layers for more details refer to section s 1 in supplementary information table 8 gives the values of significant model parameters for the case with no spatial variation obtained for calibrating only streamflow a simulation of streamflow and depth to water table using no spatial variation in soil properties for the time period 2002 2007 with 2002 regarded as warmup period result in very good simulation of streamflow according to moriasi et al 2007 daily nse 0 543 rmse 22 74 cumecs and revf 0 039 given in table 9 although no spatial variation simulation results in a high correlation coefficient 0 61 and 0 48 at w1 and w3 a negative correlation at w2 indicates that assumption of homogeneous soil properties fails to capture water table dynamics within the catchment moreover simulated water table depths shows a rise to the ground surface during most of the simulation periods in w1 and northeast monsoon periods in w2 w3 indicated by zero values of depth to water table in fig 10 a possible reason for this could be the unique hydrologic process within the studied catchment belonging to humid tropical western ghat region observations from the field in this region indicate that lateral flow through the soil occurs mainly through pipes and not through the soil matrix during heavy rainfall events putty and prasad 2000a pipeflow had been identified to have a significant impact on the effective hydraulic conductivity barcelo and nieber 1982 montgomery and dietrich 1995 uchida et al 2003a b the initial range of saturated hydraulic conductivity given for middle and bottom soil layer i e 0 001 25 0 0001 6 m d is hence increased to values as given in table 3 the elevation based variation in kxm and kxb yielded significant improvement in streamflow simulations daily nse 0 548 rmse 22 618 cumecs and revf 0 047 no significant improvement in correlation coefficient at the three observation wells is noted in spite of varying kxm and kxb spatially in comparison to the case of no spatial variation table 9 however it is possible to attain non zero depth to water table during wet seasons using elevation based kx variation in model parameterization while water table depth increased considerably in w1 only a slight increase is noted in w2 and w3 fig 10 further optimal parameter set is obtained as shown in table 8 by varying kx kz and ss of three soil layers for each elevation zone to yield good simulations for both streamflow and depth to water table by analyzing the nse values of simulated streamflow and r value of depth to water table with respect to observed simultaneously in the high elevation zone having well w1 kxm and kz of all layers had to be increased with respect to the case where no spatial variation is considered for the mid elevation zone kx and kz of all soil layers had to be reduced with respect to no spatial variation case the lowest elevation zone with well w3 required its kx all soil layers kz middle and bottom to be reduced and kz top soil layer increased with respect to no spatial variation case details on this test case can be found in the supplementary information section s 1 a combination of parameters arrived at for each elevation zone is shown in 3d scatter plot supplementary figs s6 s8 a significant improvement in the correlation coefficient value r 0 36 at depth to water table in mid elevation well is obtained by incorporating spatially varying soil parameters table 9 there is a good correlation 0 56 between simulated and observed water table depths at w1 and w3 as well the temporal variation of depth to water table for the best parameter set spatially varying with elevation zones shows that during southwest monsoon june sept and northeast monsoon oct dec simulated depth to water table values are almost zero indicating a rise in water level to surface as shown in fig 10 however the rise and fall of the simulated water table is in correspondence to the pattern of the observed water table though the introduction of spatial heterogeneity in the model significantly improved streamflow and the depth to water table dynamics simulations during southwest and northeast monsoon seasons the water table continued to be simulated near the surface the inability of the model to simulate the sudden fluctuations in water table depth as observed during monsoon period necessitate the incorporation of flow processes that account for sudden withdrawal of water from the upper soil layers there are studies which show that in humid tropical areas such preferential flow paths play a significant role in discharge recharge conditions further we assessed the model performance using a high value of specific storage ss at middle and bottom soil layer 0 01 m 1 at high elevation zones and 0 5 m 1 at mid and low elevation zones as a test case it should be noted that the typical range of values for specific storage ss is 0 01 0 000001 m 1 the correlation coefficient values are improved slightly at the three wells but nse daily streamflow reduced upon increasing specific storage values table 9 the simulated water table dynamics shows a close match with the observed fig 10 for this case the significant improvement in the simulation of water table depth while using physically unrealistic high value of ss reveals the need for incorporating the preferential flow processes in the shetran model the high ss value allow the soil to drain water much faster from soil columns and enable the model to capture the sudden fluctuations in water table and peak flow during monsoon the study highlights the need to incorporate pipeflow phenomenon while applying shetran model in humid tropical catchments and possibility of misrepresentation of model parameters for attaining better flow and water depth simulations as observed in a study by shrestha et al 2017 which applied shetran to capture water table dynamics in kathmandu valley using a high value of ss 0 2 m 1 the monthly streamflow simulated matched well with the observed streamflow for the three cases no spatial variation only kxm and kxb spatially varied and three parameters kx kz ss varied as shown in fig 11 the simulation with high ss value however resulted in under prediction of peaks the short length of observed water table depth data is another major constraint in assessing the model performance moreover it should be noted here that the point observation well data is compared against shetran 1 km model grid estimates of water table depth consequently an exact match of simulated water table depths with observed cannot be expected 6 discussion in this study we have tried to set up the shetran model by realistically representing the spatial heterogeneity in land use and soil of a tropical humid catchment within the western ghats region at 1 km model grid resolution the subsurface is modelled by incorporating variable soil depth at each 1 km grid obtained by interpolating lithology data within the study area the model also incorporates variability in soil properties along depth by considering three soil layers a multi objective sensitivity analysis of the model parameters in simulating streamflow of the vamanapuram river is performed using the morris screening method for the statistical metrics nse and rmse controlling hydrograph shape and trends with the simulated and measured flows strickler coefficient controlling overland flow subsurface soil parameters horizontal and vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity the specific storage and aet pet ratio were most sensitive the model performance assessed using hydrologic metric relative error of volumetric fit revf for the long term water balance indicates parameter controlling et losses in watershed i e actual potential evapotranspiration aet pet to be most sensitive the different objective functions used in sensitivity analysis result in only a slight difference in the order of parametric ranking this difference in parameter sensitivity can be attributed to the fact that each objective function focus on a different functional behavior of the basin zhang et al 2013a the parameter sensitivity for model output depth to water table indicate the subsurface soil parameters kx and kz of middle and bottom soil layer to be highly influential the characteristic feature of streamflow in the western ghats region is the dominance of subsurface flow putty and prasad 2000a which depends on infiltration rates the aquifer storage capacity and the hydraulic conductivities chaitra et al 2015 the model parameter sensitivity results from the present investigation demonstrates that subsurface soil parameters together with land use based parameters aet pet and strickler overland coefficient control streamflow and depth to water table morris analysis results also revealed the strong interaction of parameters vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity and aet pet with the values of other parameters in the shetran model the complex parameter interactions in shetran model was previously reported by anderton et al 2002a a possible explanation for the stability of model parameter rankings considering dry and wet year separately could be that the parameters considered were related to soil and land use which may not be altered to a large extent due to change in rainfall amount local sensitivity analysis further assists in quantifying the influence of each model parameter on streamflow a comparison of model sensitivity results from the present study with other case studies would be difficult due to the difference in the structure of models applied a few studies performed in the western ghat region which applied semi distributed hydrologic model swat reported baseflow controlling parameters available water capacity effective hydraulic conductivity along with the surface parameter scs runoff curve number to be most relevant in streamflow generation raneesh and santosh 2011 sinha and eldho 2018 it should be noted that model parameter sensitivities may differ significantly based on region to which the analysed catchment belongs to arid semi arid or tropical for example the study by zhang et al 2013b found saturated hydraulic conductivity to be insensitive while all other soil parameters aet pet ratio and strickler overland flow resistance coefficient were sensitive for streamflow simulation shetran application in a tropical basin of west africa found that aet pet ratio strongly influences total discharge and the roughness parameter affected maximum discharge op de hipt et al 2017 the results shown in this study mainly pertain to wet tropical humid catchments the parameter space to consider for model calibration could be reduced using the detailed sensitivity analysis performed the significant shetran model parameters were further fine tuned to produce very good simulations for streamflow in the vamanapuram river basin no spatial variation of soil properties is considered in order to reduce the computational time for running the shetran model during sensitivity analysis and the first stage of calibration for only streamflow as model output it was noted that the depth to water table simulated using best model parameter sets identified based on statistical indices criterion nse 0 5 and revf 0 1 applied for only streamflow failed to reproduce the temporal trend in observed water table depth this implies that the same model parameter values may not necessarily yield good simulations for the two model responses considered a similar observation was reported by anderton et al 2002a that optimal model parameters occur in different regions of parameter space depending on the model response variable spatial distribution to various aspects of the model like its input structure or parameters can result in improvement of distributed model performance the effect of different cases i e no spatial variation in model parameter i e soil properties and an elevation based spatial distribution of model parameter soil on streamflow and depth to water table simulations was investigated in this study with the aim of capturing both model variables simultaneously no significant improvements in streamflow simulation were noticeable by incorporating the spatial distribution in soil properties in shetran for this river basin a study by boyle et al 2001 on a semi distributed sac sma model also reported that model performance in terms of streamflow forecasts was improved as a result of the spatial distribution in model input and streamflow routing rather than spatial variability of soil properties model parameters the simulated water table had a tendency to rise to surface during the monsoon periods in the no spatial variation case to find a reason for this behavior we checked if the wells are located close to the river network generated at 1 km fig s9 in supplementary information showing well location clearly ruled out this possibility in an attempt to further improve the water table dynamics simulation in the absence of fully distributed field data two cases of heterogeneity in soil properties based on elevation was tested in this study the application of such test cases is justified on the grounds that conducting field experiments to obtain hydraulic properties in such a diverse region would be difficult however topographic attributes like slope elevation are easily captured from dem and hence effectively used as predictors for soil hydraulic properties at catchment scale leij et al 2004 the first test case of heterogeneity by varying only the middle and bottom soil layer horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity according to elevation zones of study area did not significantly improve water table depth simulations in comparison to no spatial variation case indicated by poor correlation coefficient values however non zero water table depth attained in this simulation highlighted the importance of including spatially distributed horizontal hydraulic conductivity with increasing value from low to high elevation furthermore three soil properties kx kz and ss identified as most sensitive shetran model parameters were varied for each elevation zone resulting in better prediction of water table depths in high medium and low elevation zones in terms of correlation coefficient besides a satisfactory streamflow simulation streamflow predictions did not have any significant improvement due to spatially varying soil properties however simulated water table dynamics showed rise to the surface during monsoon period even after introducing spatially varying soil properties internal processes within the catchment such as flow through macropores or pipes could be a possible reason for the unsatisfactory water table depth simulation evidence of such pipe networks and its significant contribution towards runoff within catchments in western ghats has been revealed by field surveys putty and prasad 1994 putty and prasad 2000b in areas with pipeflow saturated hydraulic conductivity may be at an order of magnitude greater than that measured for the soil matrix using small undisturbed soil cores du et al 2007 hence the middle soil layer horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity values were given values in the range of 20 50 m day varying with elevation zones there are limited field studies on the pipe flow in humid tropics bonell and balek 1993 putty and prasad 2000b to know their spatial extent and hence its role in controlling the hydrologic processes within a catchment lacks clarity chappell 2010 jones and connelly 2002 emphasized that for accurate sub surface flow simulation within a catchment with pipe flow the hydrological functioning of pipe systems should also be included an improved water table depth simulation is obtained with a better match of simulated water table depths with respect to observed using another test case conducted with a physically unrealistic high value of specific storage a possible explanation for the use of a physically unrealistic value of specific storage to capture water table dynamics could be the limitation of the shetran model to incorporate preferential flow or flow through macropores explicitly ewen et al 2000 the short length of observed water table depth record and the mismatch of scale in comparing shetran model grid 1 km estimates of water table depth to point well data are the limitations of this study here the study attempts to capture only the temporal trend in simulated water table depths along with satisfactory streamflow simulation it has been already shown by zhang 2015 that temporal resolution of inputs would have more influence than spatial resolution on shetran model results moreover a study which employed similar grid scale shrestha et al 2017 has shown good correlation between observed and simulated water table depths hence in our study after considering a daily scale temporal resolution as per available data to reduce the run time without compromising on model accuracy and available spatial resolution of model input data a comparatively coarser grid resolution is chosen the shortcomings in shetran model performance in the studied catchment vamanapuram river basin can be due to the exclusion of preferential flow a dominant hydrologic process in this region physically based hydrologic models are based on the darcy richards equation e g ewen et al 2000 qu and duffy 2007 ivanov et al 2008 richard s equation is inadequate to represent the flow process in soil with macropores in which assumption of matrix space continuity is not valid and thus making boundary conditions for the flow equation extremely complex beven and germann 1982 hence the application of traditional hydrologic models of soil hydrology using richards s equation neglecting the role of preferential flow has been criticized beven and germann 2013 further work is required to overcome the deficiency of shetran model performance in representing water table dynamics in catchments belonging to western ghats as highlighted in the present study by incorporating subsurface preferential flow the approach presented in this study of fine tuning soil properties corresponding to each elevation zones proved to be effective in estimating parameters satisfying streamflow and depth to water table simulations for the selected watershed vamanapuram however in order to generalize the applicability of such an elevation based model parameterization approach further testing in basins of similar characteristics might be required the application of shetran model provided a realistic representation of the soil and sub soil systems of the complex terrain considered the model parameter ranking using global sa method helped to identify significant parameters and also revealed the interaction between the parameters adopting a multi response evaluation of shetran model considering both streamflow and depth to water table helped in reducing compensating errors in the model by rejecting the alternative parameters which give similar results for only streamflow 7 conclusions a methodological framework of qualitative and quantitative sensitivity analysis has been presented in this study to identify the most relevant parameters influencing the streamflow and groundwater simulations in a medium sized catchment belonging to wet humid tropical climate the morris global sensitivity analysis method employed in this study revealed the parameter interactions within the shetran model with few model evaluations vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity and aet pet showed strongest interaction with other parameters which means that the values of these parameters are bound to change in accordance with values taken by other parameters for streamflow and water table depth simulations the order of model parameter rankings did not differ significantly based on the choice of objective functions in morris sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis method comprising of morris and local sensitivity methods assisted in identifying nine relevant model parameters horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity specific storage of the middle and bottom soil layers as well as strickler overland coefficient and actual potential et out of the initial 31 model parameters considered for streamflow and groundwater simulations the insignificant model parameter values could be fixed during calibration process resulting in a simplified model calibration procedure the results also showed that the optimal parameter values would differ based on model responses examined hence evaluating the shetran model using the two model responses streamflow and depth to water table could be a possible solution to model parameter equifinality although the model parameterization approach by varying soil properties based on elevation zones were tested for a specific region the methodology presented could be utilized in the application of the distributed model to watersheds of similar characteristics the model performance improved considerably in terms of water table depth upon incorporating spatial variability in soil properties based on elevation in comparison to the cases with no spatial variation in soil properties however the rise of water table to surface during monsoon seasons despite incorporating spatially distributed parameter values highlights the need for incorporating flow through macropores in the model hence physically more meaningful results can be expected with the inclusion of subsurface pipe flows which is possible in the shetran model however such an approach is challenging as it requires extensive field investigation within the studied catchment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

6086,physically based distributed hydrological models pdhm are complex and exhibits extreme challenges for simulating the dynamics of coupled streamflow and groundwater table depths the present work assesses the capabilities of a pdhm shetran in capturing streamflow and depth to groundwater table to represent the hydrologic processes within a wet tropical humid catchment the most significant model parameters for the coupled simulations of streamflow and groundwater table depths are assessed through a multiobjective sensitivity analysis using morris screening method and local sensitivity analysis horizontal and vertical soil saturated hydraulic conductivities specific storage as well as actual potential evapotranspiration and strickler overland coefficient are highly sensitive for both the model responses considered in order to arrive at the optimal model parameters for simulating depth to water table and streamflow the effect of three model parametrization approaches were analyzed with no spatial variation in soil properties elevation based variation of only middle and bottom soil layer saturated hydraulic conductivity and elevation based variation of horizontal kx vertical kz soil saturated hydraulic conductivities and specific storage ss results indicate that for the studied watershed the elevation based variation in kx kz and ss resulted in a better prediction of depth to water table variations in terms of correlation coefficient with no significant improvements in streamflow simulation compared to the other two parameterization cases the study suggests incorporating preferential flows in shetran model to improve prediction of the water table dynamics in catchments belonging to the humid tropical region keywords physically based distributed model shetran multi objective sensitivity analysis parameterization streamflow groundwater table depth 1 introduction hydrological processes within a river basin are altered significantly due to changes in climate and land use and hence assessment of the impacts associated with these changes is imperative for water resources planning and management physically based distributed hydrologic models pdhm are extensively used in assessing the impact of climate change land use changes and estimation of sediment yield in river basins birkinshaw et al 2016 birkinshaw et al 2011 elliott et al 2012 pdhm models can incorporate the spatial variability in watershed characteristics such as soil land use and topography however the calibration of physically based distributed model requires tremendous efforts due to high computational demands and a multitude of input parameters blasone et al 2007 identification of parameter values in pdhms is associated with many issues such as limited data availability to represent spatial heterogeneity in properties of a catchment like soil hydraulic properties simplified representation of natural processes in models spatial scale differences between field measurements and model parameters beven 1989 grayson et al 1992b these issues necessitate model calibration procedure for pdhms manual calibration by trial and error procedure is widely adopted for pdhm models refsgaard and knudsen 1996 refsgaard 1997 the manual model calibration approach is subjective time consuming and requires modeller s expertise and understanding about the study region to achieve realistic model representation a systematic approach to reduce parameter dimension needs to be applied for a lesser number of model runs during the calibration sometimes the inadequate knowledge regarding model parameter sensitivities can lead modeller s attention on insensitive parameters resulting in considerable time wastage bahremand and smedt 2008 sensitivity analysis sa is a valuable tool in identifying parameters that significantly influence concerned specific model outputs herman et al 2013 saltelli et al 2000 local or global sensitivity analysis methods could be performed prior to model calibration the major limitation in local sa method is that it assumes the relationship between the parameter and the output to be linear where one parameter is varied while keeping other parameters at nominal values to identify model response spruill et al 2000 unlike local sa in global sa the whole parameter space and possible parameter interactions are taken into account to find out the effect on output due to input variations sarrazin et al 2016 however a high number of model evaluations constrain the application of global sa methods to distributed models few of the extensively used global sensitivity techniques include i variance based technique like fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast cukier et al 1973 saltelli et al 1999 and the sobol method sobol 1993 ii global screening method such as latin hypercube oat lh oat van griensven et al 2006 and the morris method morris 1991 iii regional sensitivity analysis rsa spear and hornberger 1980 and iv response surface methodology myers and montgomery 1995 studies have been performed comparing the efficiency of different global sa methods in parameter sensitivity analysis of hydrologic models dobler and pappenberger 2013 gan et al 2014 herman et al 2013 reported that the morris method identified sensitive parameters of a spatially distributed hydrologic model with 300 times fewer model evaluations than the sobol method the morris screening method has also been proven to be effective in terms of accuracy and efficiency especially for models with a large number of inputs sun et al 2012 sensitivity information from basic statistics is computed based on elementary effects ee for each input in this method morris 1991 physically distributed models can provide multiple outputs streamflow evapotranspiration soil moisture groundwater level each of these model outputs have multiple characteristics in case of streamflow high flows low flows or overall water balance and including all these aspects makes the calibration procedure even more complex blasone et al 2007 insufficient observed time series datasets of all model outputs also hinders the proper validation of distributed models blasone et al 2008 in most cases of pdhm models only the discharge at the outlet is available to evaluate the model performance bathurst 1986 refsgaard and knudsen 1996 grayson et al 1992b referred to equifinality which implies that in terms of only discharge as model output in spite of incorrectly parameterized internal processes acceptable results can still be achieved due to compensating errors the alternative parameterizations which yield correct discharge erroneously as a result of compensating errors within the model could be excluded by considering multi model responses representing different catchment hydrologic processes grayson et al 1992a o connell and todini 1996 sensitivity analysis results may differ based on different objective functions considered and hence it is essential to adopt a multi objective approach to sa in distributed models wagener et al 2009 yang et al 2012 yang et al 2014 model simulations fail to capture all the observed hydrograph characteristics when a single objective function is considered during the calibration vrugt et al 2003 different aspects of the hydrograph are represented by different objective functions hence a multiobjective calibration strategy should be adopted before hydrologic model calibration gupta et al 1998 water table depth is an important variable to be considered for model performance evaluation because of its high influence on hydrological processes such as discharge and evapotranspiration dai et al 2010 however studies which have tried to calibrate distributed and integrated models coupling groundwater and surface water processes are limited anderton et al 2002a b dai et al 2010 madsen 2003 due to the high computational demands and multitude of input parameters of these models blasone et al 2007 in addition to these factors model parameter interactions are even more complex for integrated models resulting in low identifiability of parameters beven 1989 the studies which attempted to evaluate distributed models using multiple model outputs have emphasized the significance of rigorous model parameterization for model calibration and stated that it is challenging to capture the spatial distribution of groundwater table dai et al 2010 condon and maxwell 2015 the groundwater table dynamics is significantly controlled by the variations of soil and sub soil physical properties soil depth hydraulic conductivity in vertical or horizontal directions porosity etc ambroise et al 1996 weiler and mcdonnell 2004 in many modelling studies as a way to simplify the calibration procedure soil properties are assumed to be laterally homogeneous while such an assumption of homogeneity will not affect discharge simulations from the model significantly it may not yield good water table depth predictions saulnier et al 1997 gascuel odoux et al 2010 by incorporating lateral variations in hydraulic conductivity using topmodel approach better estimates of simulated water table depths with respect to observed water table depths were produced lamb et al 1997 seibert et al 1997 a case study where procuring field data was infeasible has been investigated by gascuel odoux et al 2010 using a physically based hillslope model hill vi different spatial models to incorporate topographic variation to soil model properties porosity hydraulic conductivity were tested by them as a way to represent spatial heterogeneity in soil properties in the absence of fully distributed field data and improved water table depth predictions were achieved previous studies on coupled simulations of shetran were performed for small catchments less than 1 sq km where extensive field data were available anderton et al 2002a b bathurst et al 2004 anderton et al 2002a considered single soil type with two layers for the entire studied catchment and ranked subsurface flow parameters in shetran using a glue like approach of beven and binley 1992 this study reported that the model parameter interactions in shetran are complex while accounting multiple model responses i e discharge soil water content and phreatic surface level for sensitivity analysis bathurst et al 2004 performed a blind validation test without the measured response data to assess parameter uncertainty pertaining to spatially varying land use three types and soil type three soil layers with uniform soil type in each layer a local sensitivity analysis of shetran parameters considering two soil types and seven land use types in a torrential catchment located in serbia identified vertical horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivities and strickler overland coefficient as the dominant model parameters controlling runoff đukić and radić 2016 a two stage sa method combining morris and local sa was applied to identify and quantify the most influential model parameters in simulating streamflow for netravathi river basin by considering spatial variability in only the land use related parameter and homogeneous soil properties in three soil layers sreedevi and eldho 2019 new approaches are to be devised for shetran model parameterization and choice of calibration parameters in case of medium sized catchments where multiple model outputs are considered in this study we investigate the effectiveness of an elevation based model parametrization approach for calibration of physically distributed model shetran considering streamflow and groundwater table depth on a river basin scale to start with we evaluate the model for only streamflow as output using the relevant model parameters identified by sensitivity analysis and then proceed to investigate how coupled simulations of streamflow and groundwater table can be improved using the elevation based model parameterization approach within the context of above discussion the specific objectives of the study are 1 to identify and quantify the model parameter influence on streamflow generation by performing a multiobjective global and local sensitivity analysis without considering heterogeneity in soil parameters 2 to calibrate and validate the model using spatially homogeneous soil parameters for streamflow 3 to quantify the most sensitive model parameter influence on coupled model simulations of streamflow and depth to water table 4 to assess the impact of elevation based model parameterization approach in coupled model simulations and to estimate parameters for both the model output variables 2 shetran model shetran is a physically based distributed model capable of simulating water flow sediment and contaminant transport on a river basin scale ewen et al 2000 the standard version of shetran v 4 4 5 was used in this study she système hydrologique europeen model abbott et al 1986a b was improved with component for sediment and contaminant transport wicks 1988 ewen 1995 along with subsurface water flow model which is three dimensional variably saturated parkin 1996 to develop shetran this work has utilized only the water flow component of the model comprising of separate modules each for overland flow channel flow and evapotranspiration an inbuilt module for sensitivity analysis and calibration is absent in the shetran model hence the application of global sensitivity analysis combined with a local sensitivity analysis can help in simplifying the calibration of shetran model parameters the advantage of using shetran over other conceptual or semi distributed models is that the spatially distributed characteristic of the model allows for a detailed representation of spatial heterogeneity in catchment properties although the values of parameters with physical meaning can be estimated using field studies commensurability issues occur with the model parameters that required to be given at grid scale in the distributed model beven 2001 in shetran the river basin is discretized in the form of rectangular computational grids with each surface grid having columns of cells having vegetation type information on the top and extending downwards representing the soil rock layer beneath to facilitate finite difference method solution of the flow and transport partial differential equations a maximum of 9 soil layers can be considered in shetran for a particular soil category river network is depicted as a network of river links run along edges of grid squares surface subsurface flow is coupled in the model allowing overland flow generated by excess rainfall over infiltration and by upward saturation of the soil column birkinshaw et al 2011 the hydrologic processes are represented as rainfall interception by modified rutter model overland and channel flow processes by diffusive wave approximation of saint venant equation and the actual evapotranspiration aet calculated from pet potential evapotranspiration by function of soil water potential the variably saturated subsurface model in shetran is based on a three dimensional richards type equation and river aquifer interaction is calculated from darcy s equation vegetation parameters in shetran include leaf area index root density functions canopy drainage and storage parameters 3 study area and data used the basin selected for the study is vamanapuram river basin located near the equator in the humid tropics of the southern western ghats in peninsular india bounded by 8 35 24 n and 8 49 13 n latitudes and 76 44 24 e and 77 12 45 e longitudes fig 1 a the vamanapuram river basin has a catchment area of 787 sq km traverses 88 km east to west and joins the arabian sea the data used in the study their spatial resolution time period sources are provided in table 1 in order to have reliable estimates of streamflow from any hydrologic model it is essential to provide rainfall dataset which is consistent with respect to observed streamflow data here we utilized two daily rainfall datasets india meteorological department imd and aphrodite datasets at 0 25 resolution imd data is available for the year 1901 to 2013 and aphrodite data from 1951 to 2007 the daily temperature from agmip dataset consisting of agmerra and agcfsr were averaged to obtain the temperature dataset the datasets at 0 25 were further interpolated to 0 05 using inverse distance method shepard 1968 daily potential evapotranspiration is estimated based on average daily temperature using the blaney criddle method blaney and criddle 1950 the streamflow data is collected from the central water commission the basin receives an average annual rainfall of 3200 mm from both southwest june september and northeast october december monsoons the mean annual daily temperature is around 27 c in this study vamanapuram river basin is represented by 546 square grids each of 1 km resolution and 31 river links fig 1b represents the elevation of the study area upscaled to 1 km grid resolution with river network running along the edges of grid squares and the three observation wells located in different elevation zones the soil texture map derived from the harmonized world soil database hwsd and upscaled to 1 km represents topsoil at 0 3 m and subsurface soil at

study comprising of top middle and bottom layers depth of top and middle soil layers are taken directly from the hwsd database the thickness of the bottom layer was decided based on soil depth map prepared by interpolating litholog data of 14 dug wells to 1 km shetran grids using inverse distance method shepard 1968 fig s1 in supplementary information provides the prepared soil depth map ten land use types were represented by the land use map for the year 1985 with plantation 68 which include tea eucalyptus and rubber and evergreen forest 17 being the predominant types fig 1d all forest

basin received is around 311 mm during the south west monsoon period june september and 268 mm during northeast monsoon october december maximum temperature is highest during months from february to april with an average value of 31 9 c fig 1e the observation well w1 located at high elevation 509 m above msl is maintained by central groundwater board government of india for which only quarterly months january april august and november water table depths are available observation wells w2 and w3 are located at 374 m and 26 m respectively above msl the observation wells are dug wells used only for domestic purposes the study area is divided into five zones based on elevation zone 1 above 200 m zone 2 between 150 and 200 m zone 3 between 100 and 150 m zone 4 between 50 and 100 m zone 5 50 m topsoil texture 0 30 cm and subsoil texture 30 100 cm for each shetran grid square are obtained from hwsd dataset the decadal land use maps by national remote sensing centre are capable of representing changes at a regional scale with an accuracy of 90 and were validated using ground truth data and other high resolution satellite images roy et al 2015 4 sensitivity analysis model calibration and validation the parameters for sensitivity analysis in this study were chosen based on previous studies which specified important parameters as strickler overland coefficient aet pet ratio at field capacity related with land use and soil depth saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention ewen and parkin 1996 bathurst et al 2004 2011 birkinshaw et al 2011 zhang et al 2013b sreedevi and eldho 2019 the values of soil parameters such as the horizontal and vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity saturated water content residual water content van genuchten n van genuchten α and land use parameter aet pet used for sensitivity analysis were taken from reference manual of shetran model shetran 2013 the model parameters along with the parameter ranges considered for sensitivity analysis are presented in table 2 three soil layers were considered in the model with separate parameter ranges provided for each layer strickler overland coefficient the reciprocal of manning s roughness coefficient is used as a land use parameter in the model the value of this parameter was chosen based on chow 1959 the sensitivity analysis was carried out in two stages in the first stage we analyzed model parameter sensitivity considering only streamflow to arrive at the best model parameter sets no spatial variation in soil parameters were included and in the next stage the applicability of the best parameter values obtained in first stage was tested for coupled simulation of streamflow and depth to water table depth to water table refers to the distance from the surface of the ground to the level of water table beneath the surface further we examined the model parameter sensitivity to both streamflow and depth to water table and applied an elevation based spatial variation to most significant model parameters for obtaining good simulation considering both streamflow and depth to water table the methodology of sensitivity analysis and model calibration validation carried out in two stages are shown in fig 2 4 1 stage i streamflow simulations for the first stage two sensitivity analysis methods comprising of morris screening morris 1991 and local sensitivity by varying one parameter at a time were implemented the shetran model parameters were ranked in the order of significance for streamflow generation by morris method and further one parameter was varied at a time to evaluate the influence of each parameter towards streamflow generation quantitatively the local sensitivity analysis characterizes the direction of change in output due to changes in inputs 4 1 1 morris sensitivity analysis the morris method involves perturbing model parameters one at a time morris 1991 corresponding to each perturbation the elementary effect ee is given by the relative difference of the model output with and without perturbation δ of the ith factor as follows 1 ee i f x 1 x i δ i x k f x δ i where f x is the function evaluation at the prior point in the trajectory and δ is the predefined sampling increment given by p 2 p 1 where p represents the number of levels to be specified saltelli et al 2004 recommends value of p between 4 and 10 within the parameter space ee is calculated at different locations for r number of replications a model with k parameters will have a sample size of r k 1 the recommended value of r is in the range 10 50 campolongo et al 2007 herman et al 2013 however increasing this value will only provide more reliability to sensitivity analysis results kelleher et al 2015 in order to attain proper parameter ranking using the morris method the repetition number greater than 20 is noted in previous studies ruano et al 2011 gan et al 2014 sreedevi and eldho 2019 higher value of repetition number is an indication for a highly nonlinear behavior of the system or a large uncertainty in input in this study the original sampling approach proposed by morris 1991 is utilized the morris sensitivity measures for each factor x i is given by µi mean of elementary effects and σi standard deviation of elementary effects which provides the degree of parameter sensitivity and the parameter interaction extent campolongo and saltelli 1997 proposed the use of µ mean of absolute value of elementary effects to avoid chances of the positive and negative values of µ to get cancelled for nonmonotonic models saltelli et al 2006 in this study we used the measure µ to rank the parameters and identify the significant model parameters from the non influential parameters 2 μ i 1 r j 1 r ee i j an open source sensitivity package in r software was used for implementing the morris method in this study pujol et al 2015 table 2 gives the 31 model parameters with the range of values used for sensitivity analysis in this study a uniform distribution of parameters between the ranges was assumed due to lack of information on the type of distribution with the aim to eliminate a type i error false positive identifying a factor which is non important as significant or a type ii error false negative identifying factor which is important as not significant ruano et al 2011 highlighted the importance of determining the optimal repetition number for each study hence in this study for a constant grid level p 32 the optimal value of r has been searched yang 2011 reported morris parameter rankings to be more distinguishable at p values greater than 10 hence in this study we chose higher grid levels p various replication numbers r 20 40 60 and 80 were used to attain a stable ranking of model parameters thus the sample sizes generated for each repetition number were r 31 1 640 1280 1920 2560 here we computed an index position factor pf r i r j proposed by ruano et al 2012 to evaluate the convergence of ranking i e stability in ranking numerically for ranking obtained from two samples ri and rj position factor index is given as follows 3 pf r i r j k 1 k p k i p k j μ p k i p k j where p k i is the position of the kth parameter in the ranking obtained by ri and μ p k i p k j is the average of the kth parameter positions in the ranking obtained by ri and rj the difference in parameter rankings with samples of size ri and rj is indicated by position factor index position of parameters in the ranking is not subjected to change with sample sizes if the position factor index value is low thus in the present study parameter ranking is considered to be stable when low values are found for a range of sample sizes tested in order to investigate if the model parameter rankings would significantly differ depending on dry or wet year morris analysis was carried out separately for wet dry year and a mixed period of dry wet year the year 1986 with 50 annual rainfall less than the average annual rainfall for the period 1980 to 2009 was regarded as a dry year and year 2005 with 20 rainfall more than the average annual rainfall for the period 1980 to 2009 was regarded as a wet year years 1986 and 1987 were chosen as dry wet mixed period no single objective function is efficient enough to capture all the hydrograph characteristics for example most widely used objective function nash sutcliffe efficiency nse or correlation based measures r are oversensitive to extreme values legates and mccabe 1999 whereas selecting relative volume error re as an objective function may not capture peak flow and shape of hydrograph properly but result in a good performance on total volume hence for evaluating the morris analysis results a multi objective approach was adopted in this study moussa and chahinian 2009 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and relative error of volumetric fit revf for streamflow were used to evaluate results of morris analysis 4 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 5 rmse i 1 n q obs q sim 2 n 6 revf 1 i 1 n q sim i i 1 n q obs i where q obs i and q sim i is the observed and simulated discharge at time step i q obs and q sim is the mean of the observed and simulated discharge respectively n is the total number of observations morris method helps in ranking model parameters qualitatively and screening out the insignificant parameters with less computational cost compared to other global sensitivity analysis methods however it should be noted that morris analysis is incapable of quantifying the influence of parameters on the output hence the local sensitivity method is applied further in this study to provide a quantitative estimate of the sensitivity of each model parameter on streamflow the standard version v4 4 5 of the shetran model was run automatically using matlab software for the sensitivity analysis 4 1 2 local sensitivity analysis the sensitivity to total discharge was assessed in this study by varying each model parameter one at a time local sa is applied to determine the nature of model parameter contribution to streamflow whether an increase or decrease due to changes in their values taking into account the high number of shetran parameters the local sa method is not computationally expensive unlike other quantitative global sa methods like glue or sobol song et al 2015 it is advantageous to perform local sa as a preliminary step to more computationally demanding methods moreover local sa helps to determine whether an increase in parameter values results in an increase or decrease in streamflow the 31 model parameters were perturbed within the range of values presented in table 2 to generate a total of 166 samples shetran model set up at 1 km resolution was run for the time period 1980 to 1990 on a daily scale with the year 1980 taken as warm up period and land use data corresponding to the year 1985 for the local sensitivity analysis 4 1 3 parameter estimation for streamflow simulation from the morris samples corresponding to optimal repetition identified r for the dry wet mixed period 1986 to1987 we selected those samples which yielded highest value of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and lowest value of root mean square error rmse relative error of volumetric fit revf for the daily streamflow simulation the values of parameters found to be non influential in streamflow generation were fixed based on these selected morris samples the parameters identified as most significant using morris sa are only considered for calibration manually the maximum and minimum values of calibrated parameters defining the boundary values were used to develop boundary envelopes of streamflow hydrographs within which the simulated hydrographs having the best match with the observed hydrograph could be determined for the time period 1980 to 1994 with year 1980 considered as warmup period for the upper boundary increase the parameters which cause an increase in streamflow and decrease others which cause a decrease in streamflow for the lower envelope decrease the parameter values which cause an increase in streamflow and increase parameter values which cause a decrease in streamflow in addition to the objective functions mentioned in section 4 1 1 rmse observations standard ratio rsr and correlation coefficient r were also considered to assess the model performance for streamflow calibration on both daily and monthly scale eqs 7 and 8 according to moriasi et al 2007 the streamflow simulations can be regarded as very good nse 0 5 pbias 10 or revf 0 1 and rsr 0 5 for monthly scale gupta et al 1998 reported that the calibration method taking into account multi objectives can aid in apprehending model limitations all parameter sets thus obtained by fine tuning which resulted in daily nse 0 5 and revf 0 1 were found out these parameter sets were used in the second stage for preliminary evaluation of model performance in terms of both streamflow and depth to water table it should be noted that the final calibrated model parameters for streamflow in the first stage do not account their spatial variation in model parameters to save the computational time for running the shetran model 7 r s r r m s e s t d e v q o b s 8 r i 1 n q o b s i q o b s i q s i m i q s i m i i 1 n q o b s i q o b s i

n is the total number of observations 4 2 stage ii coupled simulations of streamflow and groundwater table depth the observed depth to water table data is unavailable for the time period 1980 to 1994 considered for only streamflow simulations in the stage i hence the second stage of sensitivity analysis considering both streamflow and depth to water table as output was performed for a time period outside the stage i simulation period i e the year 2003 to 2007 for which observed data of both streamflow and depth to water table were available we also checked whether the calibrated model parameters from stage i are applicable to a different time period years 2003 to 2007 before proceeding to coupled simulations calibrating the model precisely for depth to water table is difficult since pumping and irrigation are not accounted for as well as mismatch exists in the spatial scale between model and observed water table depth data in the present study hence this study examines only if the model can capture temporal trends in the observed water table along with good streamflow simulation the streamflow calibrated model parameters in the first stage assumed no spatial variation in model soil parameters and hence capturing depth to water table temporal pattern would be difficult the dominant factors controlling groundwater dynamics and streamflow differ depending upon the study catchment groundwater levels can be driven mainly by topography without much influence of spatial variation in hydraulic conductivities in catchments with low permeability soils doppler et al 2014 while a combined influence of soil properties and topography might exert stronger control in catchments with high permeability soils bachmair and weiler 2012 mcdonnell 1990 meerveld et al 2007 uchida et al 2003a b for the coupled simulations as a first step we evaluated the model performance using the best model parameters from stage i with the aim of identifying the most significant parameters and quantifying the influence of all model parameters on streamflow and depth to water table global and local sensitivity analyses was performed for a second time due to lack of fully distributed field data the most significant model parameters for both model output i e streamflow and depth to water table identified using sa was spatially varied according to elevation zones as given in table 3 we compared the shetran model performance with the test cases of no spatial variation in soil parameters and spatially varying soil properties according to elevation zones the soil properties in each elevation zone were varied until the model performed well for predicting streamflow and depth to water table pattern simultaneously the effect of elevation based change in model parameters on streamflow and depth to water table were assessed based on visual comparison of simulated and observed water table depth together with correlation coefficient r values as well as objective functions for streamflow simulation mentioned in section 4 1 1 here r gives the degree of linear relationship between observed and simulated data 5 results 5 1 sensitivity analysis for streamflow simulation 5 1 1 morris analysis the sensitivity measures μ and σ at grid level 32 for different numbers of replications r 20 40 60 80 using nse rmse and revf as objective functions as shown in tables s1 s3 in supplementary information the sensitivity measure values µ and σ are scaled between 0 and 1 it can be noted that on increasing the replication times r the sensitivity measure values of model parameters tend to be closer in similarity table 4 shows the position factor index computed for each pair of compared rankings to quantitatively evaluate the parameter rankings the higher values of replication times r result in the position factor index pf r i r j values to decrease indicating that the positions of the parameters in the compared rankings are closely similar the computed position factor index value is lowest upon increasing the r value from 60 to 80 thus for this study r 80 is chosen as the optimal replication time the overall model runs are therefore 2560 simulations r k 1 with k 31 r 80 the computational cost of one simulation daily scale is around 10 min using a pc with 3 2 ghz intel pentium processor the morris sensitivity measures can be shown graphically by screening plots which have as the x and y axes the mean µ denoting parameter sensitivity and standard deviations σ denoting nonlinearity and parameter interaction respectively fig 3 represents the scatter plot of morris sensitivity indices for three objective functions and three periods i e dry wet and mixed the numbers shown in the scatter plot represent the order of the parameters as in table 2 the sensitive red numbers and insensitive blue numbers labels are decided based on the threshold value of μ 0 05 the parameter is considered to be significant if the value of sensitivity measure μ is high while insignificant parameters can be identified as those with a μ value of zero a high value of σ indicates parameter interaction or a nonlinear effect on the output saltelli et al 2004 the value of absolute mean μ only is taken into account in order to rank the streamflow influential model parameters in shetran the parameter rankings for the three objective functions considered namely nse rmse and revf description given in section 4 1 1 are shown in table 5 parameters identified as most significant considering all the three periods dry wet and mixed are soil properties mainly horizontal and vertical saturated hydraulic conductivities specific storage and vegetation parameters actual potential evapotranspiration ratio and strickler overland coefficient the order of highest ranked model parameters did not differ significantly between the three periods however it can be noted that during dry year the vegetation parameters aet pet and strickler overland coefficient had a significant control in streamflow generation compared to the soil parameters rankings based on nse and rmse are similar for all three periods however for the objective function revf irrespective of the period considered dry wet or mixed year parameter aet pet of dominant land use type i e plantations occupy the highest rank indicating the key role of this parameter for a good water balance within the studied catchment belonging to wet humid tropic region it can be also noted that in addition to the soil parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity and specific storage the residual soil moisture content and van genuchten alpha also found a position in the ranking for revf as objective function the relevance of the parameter strickler overland coefficient is justified on the grounds that it is a major factor affecting variable source areas as noted by lee and delleur 1976 previous studies by putty and prasad 1994 in the western ghats region suggested that runoff processes in this region can be described using the variable source area theory dunne and black 1970 hewlett and troendle 1975 because the infiltration excess overland flow is negligibly small in this region nse tends to emphasize the timing and magnitude of peak flows and be influenced by extreme values of the error kelleher et al 2015 legates and mccabe 1999 the parameter ranking taking into account only nse for the wet year indicates that subsurface soil properties kx kz and ss have a dominant control on streamflow generation along with vegetation parameters str and aet pet the high σ value as shown in fig 3 of the parameter vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity kz of the middle soil layer and aet pet indicate that these have strong interaction or non linearities with the value of other parameters sensitivity analysis results of parameters depend on various factors like climate soil land use characteristics of the catchments and hence transferring its results between basins is considered to be infeasible van griensven et al 2006 consequently morris analysis results presented here pertain to wet mountainous catchment in tropics out of the 31 model parameters considered for sensitivity analysis nine parameters were identified to be most sensitive to streamflow generation fixing the values of non influential parameters identified using morris analysis can help to simplify the shetran calibration procedure 5 1 2 local sensitivity analysis fig 4 shows the variation of total discharge due to change in parameter values one at a time the increase in parameter values that contribute to an increase in total discharge are horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity and strickler overland coefficient increase in parameter values of vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity θsat θres difference between saturated and residual moisture content van genuchten parameters n and α specific storage and actual potential evapotranspiration ratio result in a decrease in total discharge the percentage change in total discharge due to the change in parameter values one at a time are shown in fig 5 it can be observed that an increase in strickler overland coefficient of the dominant land use type i e plantation from 0 05 to 2 m1 3s 1 result in a 6 increase in total discharge whereas the variation in values of other land use types contribute to less than 1 increase in total discharge fig 5a the increase of aet pet at field capacity value for the land use types plantation and forest by values of 0 6 and 0 5 cause total discharge to decrease by 11 and 1 respectively the increase in parameter horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity of bottom and middle soil layer by 6 m day and 25 m day result in 0 1 and 1 3 increase in total discharge respectively whereas top layer horizontal hydraulic conductivity change has only negligible effect fig 5b corresponding to an increase in vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity of top middle bottom layers by 10 m d 5 m d and 2 m d the total discharge shows a decrease of 2 4 and 0 8 respectively the changes in all other soil parameters i e ss van genuchten n van genuchten α and θsat θres difference between saturated and residual moisture content produce less than 1 change to total discharge fig 5c the quantitative estimates from local sa revealed the highest individual contribution to streamflow due to change in the model parameters namely strickler overland coefficient actual potential evapotranspiration vertical and horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity local sa application helped to quantify as well as to determine the nature of parameter contribution an increase or decrease on streamflow which the morris method is incapable of providing 5 2 parameter estimation for streamflow simulation the values of parameters identified as non influential in simulating streamflow i e strickler overland coefficient of land use types other than plantation and forest soil parameters ss topsoil layer van genuchten n van genuchten α θsat θres topsoil hydraulic conductivities which are fixed based on the morris samples corresponding to optimal repetition identified r 80 sample size 2560 for the dry wet mixed period 1986 to1987 yielding highest value of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and lowest value of root mean square error rmse relative error of volumetric fit revf are shown in table 2 the significant model parameters identified using morris analysis i e horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities middle and bottom soil layer specific storage middle and bottom soil layers aet pet at field capacity plantations and forest strickler overland coefficient plantations mixed trees boundary were adjusted to obtain boundary envelopes of streamflow upper and lower as shown in fig s2 supplementary information the model parameters of hydrologic component resulting in an increase in streamflow are used to establish the upper boundary envelope of hydrograph the lower values of aet pet ss kz and θsat θres and the upper values of kx ky and str plantations and forest the lower boundary envelope is determined by model parameters causing a decrease in streamflow the higher values of aet pet ss kz θsat θres and the upper values of kx ky and str plantations and forest a set of 20 model parameter sets satisfying the criterion for only two objective functions i e nse 0 5 and revf 0 1 for daily streamflow simulation during the period 1980 to 1988 by adjusting their values within the boundary ranges is arrived additional objective functions i e r and rsr see section 4 1 3 the criterion by moriasi et al 2007 and visual inspection of simulated hydrographs with observed are taken into account to fix the model parameter values which are optimal for generating streamflow table 2 it should be noted here that these parameter values are not spatially varying considering spatial variations in soil parameters apart from the vertical variations along depth would have required more model runs for sensitivity analysis hence the streamflow calibrated parameter values of soil parameters obtained are uniform irrespective of soil type the calibration period selected is from 1980 to 1994 with 1980 regarded as a warmup period for model initialization and validation period 1989 to 1994 only streamflow data is available for this period hence model performance for streamflow is assessed and presented in table 6 the monthly streamflow simulations obtained in both calibration and validation period shows nse 0 75 rsr 0 5 and revf 0 1 and hence can be regarded as very good according to the guidelines by moriasi et al 2007 gupta et al 1999 reported that a positive value of pbias indicates model underestimation bias and negative value indicates model overestimation bias accordingly the positive value of revf obtained in the calibration period shows model underestimation bias whereas the negative revf value indicates model bias towards overestimation hydrograph during calibration and validation period are shown in fig 6 the hydrographs are found to be well simulated in both calibration and validation periods 5 3 coupled streamflow and groundwater simulations 5 3 1 model parameter application outside calibration validation period in order to evaluate the performance of shetran model to simulate both streamflow and water table depth a different time period year 2002 to 2007 had to be chosen for which both streamflow and depth to water table data were available it is worth emphasizing that the aim of this study is only to check if the temporal trend in groundwater levels could be captured by the model along with a good streamflow simulation the comparison of monthly average rainfall and temperature of the two time periods calibration from year 1981 to 1988 and 2000 to 2007 did not show any marked difference in climate between these two periods see fig s3 and fig s4 in supplementary information the model performance in terms of streamflow and depth to water table is evaluated by applying best model parameter sets which produced nse 0 5 and revf 0 1 from stage i for only streamflow simulation it is observed that no parameter sets could provide correlation coefficient 0 5 for depth to water table considering the three observation wells individually although satisfactory streamflow simulation daily nse 0 5 and revf 0 1 is attained this clearly is an indication of the inconsistency in the model if calibrated only considering streamflow as model output and highlights the significance of evaluating model performance for more than one output as reported earlier by blasone et al 2008 a possible reason for poor simulation of water table dynamics could be that spatial variation of soil properties is neglected the studied catchment vamanapuram river basin belongs to the western ghats region which has highly heterogeneous soil and land use characteristics a study by dai et al 2010 indicated that distributed parameter values should be expected in areas of high spatial heterogeneity especially for those parameters that influence water table dynamics the model performance indicators for streamflow simulation for the time period 2003 2007 year 2002 taken as warmup period using optimal values of model parameters arrived at stage i are shown in table 6 for a monthly time step the nse rmse observations standard ratio rsr and relative error of volumetric fit revf values obtained indicate very good simulation of streamflow according to guidelines mentioned by moriasi et al 2007 the calibrated model parameters for the time period 1980 to 1988 are thus found to be applicable to a different time period from 2003 to 2007 to simulate only streamflow however the simulated water table depths from 2003 to 2007 using the streamflow only calibrated parameters do not reproduce the temporal trends in observed water table depths fig s5 in supplementary information hence a more rigorous parameterization approach is needed to capture both streamflow and depth to water table outputs simultaneously 5 3 2 sensitivity of model parameters to coupled simulations of streamflow and groundwater with an optimal repetition number r 80 the position factor index calculated is lowest among other repetition numbers of 20 40 and 60 for both model outputs ensuring parameter ranking stability position factor index values for coupled simulations during the time period 2003 to 2007 are shown in tables s4 of supplementary information the values of morris sensitivity measures for each repetition number are presented in tables s5 s7 morris sensitivity analysis considering all model parameters for coupled simulations of streamflow and depth to water table is shown in fig 7 the model parameter ranking for coupled simulations are presented in table 7 the most significant model parameters controlling both model outputs i e streamflow and depth to water table identified are vegetation parameters aet pet strickler overland coefficient and soil properties saturated hydraulic conductivity horizontal and vertical specific storage of middle and bottom soil layer vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity of the middle soil layer and aet pet has a high σ value indicating strong interaction or non linearities with other parameters see tables s5 s7 in supplementary information further all model parameters are varied between their maximum and minimum values as in table 2 one at a time and its effect on streamflow and depth to water table are analyzed simultaneously for the period 2003 to 2007 an increase in values of horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity result in an increase in streamflow and increase in depth to water table values strickler overland coefficient affects streamflow increase in total streamflow by 56 mm yr fig 8 a but shows little effect on water table depth fig 8e aet pet has a significant influence on streamflow and negligible effect on water table depth total discharge decrease by 145 39 mm yr and 19 87 mm yr respectively corresponding to increase in aet pet of plantation by 0 6 and forest by 0 4 fig 8d and fig 8h the change in horizontal hydraulic conductivity of middle and bottom soil by 25 m day and 6 m day contribute to an increase in streamflow by 36 mm yr and 6 mm yr respectively fig 8 b the average depth to water table increase from 0 95 m to 2 1 m corresponding to an increase in kxm value from 0 001 m day to 25 m day the value of kxb increase from 0 0001 m day to 6 m day cause average depth to water table to increase from 1 3 m to 3 29 m fig 8 f the topsoil layer kx value kxt has a negligible influence on the streamflow and depth to water table increase in vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity values of top middle and bottom soil layer by 10 m day 5 m day and 2 m day result in streamflow values to decrease by 13 mm yr 26 mm yr and 6 mm yr respectively fig 8 c average depth to water table values reduce by 0 02 m 0 42 m and 0 017 m corresponding to increase in kz values of the three soil layers by 10 m day 5 m day and 2 m day fig 8 g a slight reduction in streamflow mm yr values and an increase in depth to water table values are observed as a result of an increase in specific storage values the streamflow values decrease by 2 mm yr 5 4 mm yr and 5 mm yr whereas depth to water table increase only slightly upon increase in specific storage of top middle and bottom soil layers by 0 04 0 16 and 0 57 m respectively effect of soil parameters such as van genuchten α van genuchten n θsat θres and specific storage ss is not predominant in streamflow and depth to water table simulation for the studied catchment fig 9 from the analysis results it can be noted that horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity kxm kxb of the middle and bottom soil layer is a critical parameter affecting both streamflow and depth to water table in comparison to other model parameters vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity and specific storage also have substantial influence on the two model outputs 5 3 3 effect of spatial variation of soil properties on streamflow and groundwater simulations to effectively capture depth to water table variations in the highly heterogeneous watershed lacking fully distributed field data the model was tested for different cases three cases were tested by running the model using no spatial variation in soil properties with only middle and bottom soil layer horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity kxm kxb identified as most sensitive model parameter in section 5 3 1 and 5 3 2 varied corresponding to each elevation zone and with the three soil properties kx kz ss varied specifically for each elevation zone for the three soil layers for more details refer to section s 1 in supplementary information table 8 gives the values of significant model parameters for the case with no spatial variation obtained for calibrating only streamflow a simulation of streamflow and depth to water table using no spatial variation in soil properties for the time period 2002 2007 with 2002 regarded as warmup period result in very good simulation of streamflow according to moriasi et al 2007 daily nse 0 543 rmse 22 74 cumecs and revf 0 039 given in table 9 although no spatial variation simulation results in a high correlation coefficient 0 61 and 0 48 at w1 and w3 a negative correlation at w2 indicates that assumption of homogeneous soil properties fails to capture water table dynamics within the catchment moreover simulated water table depths shows a rise to the ground surface during most of the simulation periods in w1 and northeast monsoon periods in w2 w3 indicated by zero values of depth to water table in fig 10 a possible reason for this could be the unique hydrologic process within the studied catchment belonging to humid tropical western ghat region observations from the field in this region indicate that lateral flow through the soil occurs mainly through pipes and not through the soil matrix during heavy rainfall events putty and prasad 2000a pipeflow had been identified to have a significant impact on the effective hydraulic conductivity barcelo and nieber 1982 montgomery and dietrich 1995 uchida et al 2003a b the initial range of saturated hydraulic conductivity given for middle and bottom soil layer i e 0 001 25 0 0001 6 m d is hence increased to values as given in table 3 the elevation based variation in kxm and kxb yielded significant improvement in streamflow simulations daily nse 0 548 rmse 22 618 cumecs and revf 0 047 no significant improvement in correlation coefficient at the three observation wells is noted in spite of varying kxm and kxb spatially in comparison to the case of no spatial variation table 9 however it is possible to attain non zero depth to water table during wet seasons using elevation based kx variation in model parameterization while water table depth increased considerably in w1 only a slight increase is noted in w2 and w3 fig 10 further optimal parameter set is obtained as shown in table 8 by varying kx kz and ss of three soil layers for each elevation zone to yield good simulations for both streamflow and depth to water table by analyzing the nse values of simulated streamflow and r value of depth to water table with respect to observed simultaneously in the high elevation zone having well w1 kxm and kz of all layers had to be increased with respect to the case where no spatial variation is considered for the mid elevation zone kx and kz of all soil layers had to be reduced with respect to no spatial variation case the lowest elevation zone with well w3 required its kx all soil layers kz middle and bottom to be reduced and kz top soil layer increased with respect to no spatial variation case details on this test case can be found in the supplementary information section s 1 a combination of parameters arrived at for each elevation zone is shown in 3d scatter plot supplementary figs s6 s8 a significant improvement in the correlation coefficient value r 0 36 at depth to water table in mid elevation well is obtained by incorporating spatially varying soil parameters table 9 there is a good correlation 0 56 between simulated and observed water table depths at w1 and w3 as well the temporal variation of depth to water table for the best parameter set spatially varying with elevation zones shows that during southwest monsoon june sept and northeast monsoon oct dec simulated depth to water table values are almost zero indicating a rise in water level to surface as shown in fig 10 however the rise and fall of the simulated water table is in correspondence to the pattern of the observed water table though the introduction of spatial heterogeneity in the model significantly improved streamflow and the depth to water table dynamics simulations during southwest and northeast monsoon seasons the water table continued to be simulated near the surface the inability of the model to simulate the sudden fluctuations in water table depth as observed during monsoon period necessitate the incorporation of flow processes that account for sudden withdrawal of water from the upper soil layers there are studies which show that in humid tropical areas such preferential flow paths play a significant role in discharge recharge conditions further we assessed the model performance using a high value of specific storage ss at middle and bottom soil layer 0 01 m 1 at high elevation zones and 0 5 m 1 at mid and low elevation zones as a test case it should be noted that the typical range of values for specific storage ss is 0 01 0 000001 m 1 the correlation coefficient values are improved slightly at the three wells but nse daily streamflow reduced upon increasing specific storage values table 9 the simulated water table dynamics shows a close match with the observed fig 10 for this case the significant improvement in the simulation of water table depth while using physically unrealistic high value of ss reveals the need for incorporating the preferential flow processes in the shetran model the high ss value allow the soil to drain water much faster from soil columns and enable the model to capture the sudden fluctuations in water table and peak flow during monsoon the study highlights the need to incorporate pipeflow phenomenon while applying shetran model in humid tropical catchments and possibility of misrepresentation of model parameters for attaining better flow and water depth simulations as observed in a study by shrestha et al 2017 which applied shetran to capture water table dynamics in kathmandu valley using a high value of ss 0 2 m 1 the monthly streamflow simulated matched well with the observed streamflow for the three cases no spatial variation only kxm and kxb spatially varied and three parameters kx kz ss varied as shown in fig 11 the simulation with high ss value however resulted in under prediction of peaks the short length of observed water table depth data is another major constraint in assessing the model performance moreover it should be noted here that the point observation well data is compared against shetran 1 km model grid estimates of water table depth consequently an exact match of simulated water table depths with observed cannot be expected 6 discussion in this study we have tried to set up the shetran model by realistically representing the spatial heterogeneity in land use and soil of a tropical humid catchment within the western ghats region at 1 km model grid resolution the subsurface is modelled by incorporating variable soil depth at each 1 km grid obtained by interpolating lithology data within the study area the model also incorporates variability in soil properties along depth by considering three soil layers a multi objective sensitivity analysis of the model parameters in simulating streamflow of the vamanapuram river is performed using the morris screening method for the statistical metrics nse and rmse controlling hydrograph shape and trends with the simulated and measured flows strickler coefficient controlling overland flow subsurface soil parameters horizontal and vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity the specific storage and aet pet ratio were most sensitive the model performance assessed using hydrologic metric relative error of volumetric fit revf for the long term water balance indicates parameter controlling et losses in watershed i e actual potential evapotranspiration aet pet to be most sensitive the different objective functions used in sensitivity analysis result in only a slight difference in the order of parametric ranking this difference in parameter sensitivity can be attributed to the fact that each objective function focus on a different functional behavior of the basin zhang et al 2013a the parameter sensitivity for model output depth to water table indicate the subsurface soil parameters kx and kz of middle and bottom soil layer to be highly influential the characteristic feature of streamflow in the western ghats region is the dominance of subsurface flow putty and prasad 2000a which depends on infiltration rates the aquifer storage capacity and the hydraulic conductivities chaitra et al 2015 the model parameter sensitivity results from the present investigation demonstrates that subsurface soil parameters together with land use based parameters aet pet and strickler overland coefficient control streamflow and depth to water table morris analysis results also revealed the strong interaction of parameters vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity and aet pet with the values of other parameters in the shetran model the complex parameter interactions in shetran model was previously reported by anderton et al 2002a a possible explanation for the stability of model parameter rankings considering dry and wet year separately could be that the parameters considered were related to soil and land use which may not be altered to a large extent due to change in rainfall amount local sensitivity analysis further assists in quantifying the influence of each model parameter on streamflow a comparison of model sensitivity results from the present study with other case studies would be difficult due to the difference in the structure of models applied a few studies performed in the western ghat region which applied semi distributed hydrologic model swat reported baseflow controlling parameters available water capacity effective hydraulic conductivity along with the surface parameter scs runoff curve number to be most relevant in streamflow generation raneesh and santosh 2011 sinha and eldho 2018 it should be noted that model parameter sensitivities may differ significantly based on region to which the analysed catchment belongs to arid semi arid or tropical for example the study by zhang et al 2013b found saturated hydraulic conductivity to be insensitive while all other soil parameters aet pet ratio and strickler overland flow resistance coefficient were sensitive for streamflow simulation shetran application in a tropical basin of west africa found that aet pet ratio strongly influences total discharge and the roughness parameter affected maximum discharge op de hipt et al 2017 the results shown in this study mainly pertain to wet tropical humid catchments the parameter space to consider for model calibration could be reduced using the detailed sensitivity analysis performed the significant shetran model parameters were further fine tuned to produce very good simulations for streamflow in the vamanapuram river basin no spatial variation of soil properties is considered in order to reduce the computational time for running the shetran model during sensitivity analysis and the first stage of calibration for only streamflow as model output it was noted that the depth to water table simulated using best model parameter sets identified based on statistical indices criterion nse 0 5 and revf 0 1 applied for only streamflow failed to reproduce the temporal trend in observed water table depth this implies that the same model parameter values may not necessarily yield good simulations for the two model responses considered a similar observation was reported by anderton et al 2002a that optimal model parameters occur in different regions of parameter space depending on the model response variable spatial distribution to various aspects of the model like its input structure or parameters can result in improvement of distributed model performance the effect of different cases i e no spatial variation in model parameter i e soil properties and an elevation based spatial distribution of model parameter soil on streamflow and depth to water table simulations was investigated in this study with the aim of capturing both model variables simultaneously no significant improvements in streamflow simulation were noticeable by incorporating the spatial distribution in soil properties in shetran for this river basin a study by boyle et al 2001 on a semi distributed sac sma model also reported that model performance in terms of streamflow forecasts was improved as a result of the spatial distribution in model input and streamflow routing rather than spatial variability of soil properties model parameters the simulated water table had a tendency to rise to surface during the monsoon periods in the no spatial variation case to find a reason for this behavior we checked if the wells are located close to the river network generated at 1 km fig s9 in supplementary information showing well location clearly ruled out this possibility in an attempt to further improve the water table dynamics simulation in the absence of fully distributed field data two cases of heterogeneity in soil properties based on elevation was tested in this study the application of such test cases is justified on the grounds that conducting field experiments to obtain hydraulic properties in such a diverse region would be difficult however topographic attributes like slope elevation are easily captured from dem and hence effectively used as predictors for soil hydraulic properties at catchment scale leij et al 2004 the first test case of heterogeneity by varying only the middle and bottom soil layer horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity according to elevation zones of study area did not significantly improve water table depth simulations in comparison to no spatial variation case indicated by poor correlation coefficient values however non zero water table depth attained in this simulation highlighted the importance of including spatially distributed horizontal hydraulic conductivity with increasing value from low to high elevation furthermore three soil properties kx kz and ss identified as most sensitive shetran model parameters were varied for each elevation zone resulting in better prediction of water table depths in high medium and low elevation zones in terms of correlation coefficient besides a satisfactory streamflow simulation streamflow predictions did not have any significant improvement due to spatially varying soil properties however simulated water table dynamics showed rise to the surface during monsoon period even after introducing spatially varying soil properties internal processes within the catchment such as flow through macropores or pipes could be a possible reason for the unsatisfactory water table depth simulation evidence of such pipe networks and its significant contribution towards runoff within catchments in western ghats has been revealed by field surveys putty and prasad 1994 putty and prasad 2000b in areas with pipeflow saturated hydraulic conductivity may be at an order of magnitude greater than that measured for the soil matrix using small undisturbed soil cores du et al 2007 hence the middle soil layer horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity values were given values in the range of 20 50 m day varying with elevation zones there are limited field studies on the pipe flow in humid tropics bonell and balek 1993 putty and prasad 2000b to know their spatial extent and hence its role in controlling the hydrologic processes within a catchment lacks clarity chappell 2010 jones and connelly 2002 emphasized that for accurate sub surface flow simulation within a catchment with pipe flow the hydrological functioning of pipe systems should also be included an improved water table depth simulation is obtained with a better match of simulated water table depths with respect to observed using another test case conducted with a physically unrealistic high value of specific storage a possible explanation for the use of a physically unrealistic value of specific storage to capture water table dynamics could be the limitation of the shetran model to incorporate preferential flow or flow through macropores explicitly ewen et al 2000 the short length of observed water table depth record and the mismatch of scale in comparing shetran model grid 1 km estimates of water table depth to point well data are the limitations of this study here the study attempts to capture only the temporal trend in simulated water table depths along with satisfactory streamflow simulation it has been already shown by zhang 2015 that temporal resolution of inputs would have more influence than spatial resolution on shetran model results moreover a study which employed similar grid scale shrestha et al 2017 has shown good correlation between observed and simulated water table depths hence in our study after considering a daily scale temporal resolution as per available data to reduce the run time without compromising on model accuracy and available spatial resolution of model input data a comparatively coarser grid resolution is chosen the shortcomings in shetran model performance in the studied catchment vamanapuram river basin can be due to the exclusion of preferential flow a dominant hydrologic process in this region physically based hydrologic models are based on the darcy richards equation e g ewen et al 2000 qu and duffy 2007 ivanov et al 2008 richard s equation is inadequate to represent the flow process in soil with macropores in which assumption of matrix space continuity is not valid and thus making boundary conditions for the flow equation extremely complex beven and germann 1982 hence the application of traditional hydrologic models of soil hydrology using richards s equation neglecting the role of preferential flow has been criticized beven and germann 2013 further work is required to overcome the deficiency of shetran model performance in representing water table dynamics in catchments belonging to western ghats as highlighted in the present study by incorporating subsurface preferential flow the approach presented in this study of fine tuning soil properties corresponding to each elevation zones proved to be effective in estimating parameters satisfying streamflow and depth to water table simulations for the selected watershed vamanapuram however in order to generalize the applicability of such an elevation based model parameterization approach further testing in basins of similar characteristics might be required the application of shetran model provided a realistic representation of the soil and sub soil systems of the complex terrain considered the model parameter ranking using global sa method helped to identify significant parameters and also revealed the interaction between the parameters adopting a multi response evaluation of shetran model considering both streamflow and depth to water table helped in reducing compensating errors in the model by rejecting the alternative parameters which give similar results for only streamflow 7 conclusions a methodological framework of qualitative and quantitative sensitivity analysis has been presented in this study to identify the most relevant parameters influencing the streamflow and groundwater simulations in a medium sized catchment belonging to wet humid tropical climate the morris global sensitivity analysis method employed in this study revealed the parameter interactions within the shetran model with few model evaluations vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity and aet pet showed strongest interaction with other parameters which means that the values of these parameters are bound to change in accordance with values taken by other parameters for streamflow and water table depth simulations the order of model parameter rankings did not differ significantly based on the choice of objective functions in morris sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis method comprising of morris and local sensitivity methods assisted in identifying nine relevant model parameters horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity specific storage of the middle and bottom soil layers as well as strickler overland coefficient and actual potential et out of the initial 31 model parameters considered for streamflow and groundwater simulations the insignificant model parameter values could be fixed during calibration process resulting in a simplified model calibration procedure the results also showed that the optimal parameter values would differ based on model responses examined hence evaluating the shetran model using the two model responses streamflow and depth to water table could be a possible solution to model parameter equifinality although the model parameterization approach by varying soil properties based on elevation zones were tested for a specific region the methodology presented could be utilized in the application of the distributed model to watersheds of similar characteristics the model performance improved considerably in terms of water table depth upon incorporating spatial variability in soil properties based on elevation in comparison to the cases with no spatial variation in soil properties however the rise of water table to surface during monsoon seasons despite incorporating spatially distributed parameter values highlights the need for incorporating flow through macropores in the model hence physically more meaningful results can be expected with the inclusion of subsurface pipe flows which is possible in the shetran model however such an approach is challenging as it requires extensive field investigation within the studied catchment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

6087,there are multiple relationship curves between watershed socioeconomic development and water environmental conservation the goal of this paper is to present a theoretical pattern of economic activities and water environmental improvement by incorporating their bidirectional causality relationship the environmental kuznets curve ekc has been useful in connecting economic and environmental concepts thus becoming an important tool for evaluating watershed sustainability the high governance cost makes water pollution intensive goods relatively expensive to produce according to the ekc there is an inverted u shaped relationship between water environment deterioration and the level of social and economic improvement based on ekc hypothesis we studied the coordinated relationship between environmental protection of water and economic and social sustainable development in the huntai river watershed from 2003 to 2012 by means of a panel threshold data the ekc is an empirical curve that describes the relationship between economic restructuring and water environmental conditions improvement the green environmental kuznets curve gekc is used to describe the relationship among watershed pollution emissions the environmental quality and income per capita however according to the gekc u shaped relationship exists between the coordination of water environmental protection and the level of social economic development sed the gekc is affected by water resource consumption the regional trade situation t the per capita gross domestic product level y and controls on the total amount of water pollution discharge we try to adjust to the type of gekc curve and apply dataset of water pollutant emission reduction cost control to fit main characteristic of equilibrium cost in accordance with fully modified ordinary least squares fmols and dynamic ordinary least squares dols data statistical analysis the value of the gekc regression equation independent variables y y2 per capita water resources consumption e t adding value of production avp and modified socioeconomic development index msdi were 1 988 0 150 0 720 0 216 0 070 and 1 890 respectively in the long term the correlation formula of watershed per capita sewage discharge c to y was 2 090 0 300y for every 1 increase in e t avp and msdi c increased by approximately 0 720 0 216 0 072 and 1 890 respectively the e t and msdi are key factors in developing an effective way to control the levels of water pollution discharge pollution is endogenous so water environment pollution is not necessarily caused by economic growth according to the total amount control of water pollution discharge the gekc equilibrium optimization calculation results can be used to effectively control watershed pollutant emissions and improve water environmental quality through the adjustment of industrial structure or industrial transformation and technological progress it is possible to change the relationship between current economic growth and water environment with gekc related curve characteristic and indicator classes it is possible to realize harmonious and sustainable development of regional economy and society in the huntai river watershed keywords green environmental kuznets curve equilibrium optimization calculation sustainable development sewage discharge huntai river watershed 1 introduction in the paper we try to supply a green development pattern incorporating the coordinated development concept of watershed economic activities and water environmental improvement along with the public s deeper understanding of the characteristics of sustainable development environmental health has become an important factor in restricting the realization of beautiful china s construction the systematic analysis of the relationship between environmental quality and social and economic growth has become increasingly important the environmental kuznets curve ekc ideal was proposed in the 1990s based on the research results of the north american free trade agreement mäler 2001 we focused on the optimization problem faced by a benevolent social planner allocating resources in a centralized economy ekc is a theoretical hypothesis in this field of research and is widely used to study the relationship between watershed socioeconomic development and water environmental improvement ekc provides a reference for coordinating economic development and comprehensive decision making on water environmental improvement george et al 2015 song et al 2008 carried out an empirical study on data series from 1985 to 2005 in 29 provinces of china indicating that the emissions of waste gas wastewater and industrial solid waste were consistent with gdp and that there was an inverted u shaped relationship brock and taylor 2010 elaborated on the technological progress in pollution abatement and ekc is a response model to economic development and water environmental issues recent literature has shown that the watershed trade situation t education and development fairness human capital investment technological progress industrial structure and urbanization levels and water resource consumption are also key factors in water environmental degradation farhani et al 2014a b yuan et al 2016 the level of regional social economic development sed has always been regarded as the key driving factor of social progress and the construction of ekc model was largely affected by changes in the sed dimensions costantini and martini 2006 ong and sek 2013 to describe the sustainable development of a regional ecological socio economic system ekc theory and empirical investigation are used to correlate watershed economic and social development with water environmental carrying capacity carrying capacity can support the social water cycle with regional scale water resources and environmental conditions zhang et al 2019 therefore the intention of the manuscript is to build a modified ekc in order to consider a wider concept of development rather than pure economic growth at present the application of the ekc curve has been widely studied but the practicality and operability of model under sustainable development conditions have not been fully explained the economic development is not fit for development conditions therefore we would slow down the gdp development rate beckerman 1992 grossman 1995 however the u shaped of the ekc suggesting there is causal two way relationship between watershed development and water environmental damage keho 2017 based on the relevant literature farhani et al 2014a b babu and datta 2013 du et al 2018 chen et al 2019 we supplied an improvement method for deficiencies in the previous studies and proposed the concept of the green environmental kuznets curve gekc we evaluated the pure environmental pressure in the alternative standard ekc by changing the dependent variable as well as using the stress that characterizes the deterioration of the environment babu and datta 2013 based on the resource curse assumption the abundant resources will not only become an advantage of watershed development but will have a negative impact we proposed an equilibrium model to study the ekc which introduced the sustainability dimension of the people s well being and the social development process to realize coordinated relationship between environmental protection of water and economic and social sustainable development drawing on relevant research this paper used the panel threshold model fmols and dols to estimate gekc parameters that control the heterogeneity and nonlinearity between variables costantini and monni 2008 rashid et al 2018 within the time dimension the choice of panel dataset dimensions should include as many computational elements c y e t gs sdi and rl as possible for the huntai river watershed to control water quality and resolve the conflicts between dischargers an optimization method for water quality management based on stackelberg game was given zhang et al 2018 ekc has already been used to explore different ideas on pollutants emissions we used the modified coordinated test method proposed by pedroni to analyse the panel data on the 10 control units of the huntai river watershed from 2003 to 2012 to verify the long term equilibrium relationship between watershed socio economic sustainable development and water environmental protection data pedroni 2004 based on the characteristics of ekc the gekc indicated the inverted u shaped relationship curve was found between income structure water resources consumption and pollutants discharge reduction in many countries by using an optimization calculation model brock and taylor 2010 we used per capita gdp y per capita water resource consumption e regional trade situation t the adding value of production avp and the modified socioeconomic development index msdi as explanatory variables for the ekc model sewage discharge was considered a dependent variable the sdi water consumption regional trade exchange and pollutant discharge regulations rl were used as explanatory variables for the gekc in this paper negative gross domestic product level gs was recorded as gs on this basis the researcher used the panel data based on fmols and dols to estimate the variables in the gekc models with the help of the nonlinear panel data sequence causality test to eliminate interference between variables phillips and hansen 1990 stock and watson 1993 preliminary tests of the model s equilibrium calculation were investigated using data from the huntai river watershed the use of the gekc instead of the ekc is based mainly on two principles in terms of demand if the environment is no longer a luxury in areas with poor economic development the need to formulate total pollutant discharge control policies to alleviate water environmental degradation plays a leading role on the other hand if technological innovation and production structure are adjusted and water pollution emissions increase the watershed industrial structure transformation plays an important role in the construction of the economic system water pollution reduction technologies with higher initial investment costs can reduce the enthusiasm for implementing pollution reduction control policies in economically underdeveloped areas of the watershed but the increasing scale benefits have increased the promotion of emission reduction technologies andreoni and levinson 2001 xu et al 2017 the gekc approach to equilibrium cost aims to present a theoretical pattern incorporating the coordinated development of economic activities and water environmental improvement with gekc related indicators it is entirely possible to realize the inverted u type green between current economic growth and pollution therefore the evaluation of gekc factor relevance of the nature society dualistic systems has become an important gripper to realize green development and ecological civilization of huntai river watershed we gave a comprehensive systematic structure to study the coordinated relationship between regional water environmental damage and water consumption regional trade exchange per capita gdp level and total pollutant discharge control the framework of this manuscript is elaborated as follows 1 introduction describing on the characteristic of ekc and the application condition to achieve social sustainability and water environmental improvement 2 data and methods including 1 region and data 2 gekc model structure and 3 econometric methodology panel unit root test analysis panel data conformity testing fmols and dols parameter estimation and granger causality test 3 results and discussion data characteristics and results description cointegration and causal analysis and equilibrium cost constraints discussion and 4 conclusions 2 data and methods 2 1 region and data the data sequences studied from 2003 to 2012 and space contained 10 control units table 1 the control unit is the water resources division within the county the huntai river watershed is located in north eastern china geographical area in liaoning province and the total area is 27 thousand km2 which covers 20 of the area of liaoning province the huntai river watershed is an important economic and industrial development area in liaoning province and has been threatened by severe structural and functional degradation of river ecosystems in recent years the huntai river watershed consists of two river systems the hunhe river and the taizi river which flows through major industrial cities such as fushun liaoyang anshan and benxi the watershed is seriously disturbed by human activities the mountainous area accounts for approximately 70 of the total basin area the forest land area in the huntai river watershed is the highest accounting for 47 of the basin area located in the eastern of daliao river followed by farmland accounting for 39 06 of the total area concentrated in the middle and lower reaches of the taizi river fig 1 to meet the needs of the watershed equilibrium development process rather than single economic growth the system of welfare and sustainability was emphasized during the process of building the ekc and gekc models in view of the relationship between ekc and gekc the manuscript expounded the main influencing factors which was useful for analysing the relationship between the economic and social development level and water environmental protection ekc the per capita sewage discharge c is measured in t person year the economic income y is measured in per capita gdp the msdi is the sum of the initial situation and the secondary education in the study period but it does not include income gdp y to avoid multiple collinearity gekc the negative gdp level is gs the sdi is expressed as msdi including the research cycle education level and economic income and water pollutant discharge regulations rl are an important basis for controlling pollutant discharge that exceeds standards ekc and gekc water consumption is expressed as the amount of water consumed in the production process of unit value products the regional trade situation is analysed by the percentage of gdp engendered by intermediate amount avp is analysed using the percentage of gdp engendered we used statistical analysis software spss16 0 to research the elements correlation between watershed economic growth and environmental pollution table 2 elaborated the parameters name and definition unit of variables data collection and the length of the data series the meaning and role of many variables have been elaborated in the previous paragraphs such as water resource consumption intensity and levels of economic development the other new variables such as adding value of production modified socioeconomic development index industrial revolution were considered in gekc the high technology application and high skill labour make a significant impact on economic growth and regional social progress to realize coordinated development of social economic and eco environment the manuscript used statistical bulletins yearbooks regional development plans watershed protection goals and water ecological health data to seek optimal economic development models and ecological protection strategies through optimization method of digitalization 2 2 gekc model structure the gekc introduced the income independent variable of the original ekc model with the modified socioeconomic development index msdi in the gekc we replaced the environmental deterioration with sustainability and also introduced the pollutant emissions with the actual income level il to improve il such as per capita gross domestic product level regional trade situation can be a measure of sustainability of regional socio economic development in accordance with ekc hypothesis the relationship between total water consumption and regional gdp and per capita income level followed the approach balado naves et al 2018 danish et al 2017 and du et al 2018 the long standing relationship between water pollution discharge c gdp per capita y and water resource consumption e is given as follows 1 c α 0 α 1 y α 2 y 2 α 3 e ε in addition antweiler et al 2001 considered that it is feasible to incorporate interregional trade flows into the quantification of the models the impact of t on the water environment depends on the effectiveness of the experience of dealing with water pollution problems therefore scholars consider that the interactions among trading mechanism of pollutant discharge rights regional economic growth and water consumption should be viewed as a scheme for solving the deficiency of neglecting primary variables in social development farhani et al 2014a b aslan et al 2018 the manuscript supplied an improved ekc formula covering c y e and t 2 c δ 0 δ 1 y δ 2 y 2 δ 3 e δ 4 t ε related studies have shown that adding control variables to the ekc formula is conducive to reflecting interregional trade manufacturing development and improving social well being which has a positive impact on improving the public s sense of fairness democracy law abidingness and their participation in other systems costantini and monni 2008 apergis and payne 2010 the range of numerical model effects the potential application fields data integrity and effectiveness of computational solution to study how differences in deep parameters affect ekc the influence of parameters determination in sdi avp and rates of technological progress was been thought out at first the functional form of the improved gekc model is 3 c δ 0 δ 1 y δ 2 y 2 δ 3 e δ 4 a v p δ 5 s d i ε eq 3 indicates that the nonlinear relationship for c and y can be expressed by means of the msdi and the sdi is replaced by an msdi that is not involved in the income distribution process and is re formulated in addition there is no gdp index in the msdi which avoids the coincidence of the corresponding factors between y and msdi unlike the increase of explanatory variables scholars use the sdi as an explanatory variable for pollution emissions focusing on constructing gekc models and even determining inverted u shaped curves based on development concepts abou ali and abdelfattah 2013 berk et al 2018 the internal relevance among economic development social progress and water environmental improvement is under dynamic changes we used a more functionally oriented measure to analyse the potential effects of industrial layout across the watershed economic or the impact of socioeconomic development sd on pollution i e using the sdi instead of income factor gdp while other control variables remained unchanged in addition in order to adapt to the needs of the research framework for sustainable development the dependent variable related to water environmental pollution was replaced by gs the gs formula is expressed as 4 gs k f r f r r f r r b d f r g b e where k is the regional development investment rmy r is the water resource exploitation rate g is the water resource recovery rate fr is the water resource value rmy fr is the water resource exploitation marginal cost rmy b is the marginal cost of wastewater emissions rmy e is the discharge rate of wastewater d is the natural rate of reduction of pollution by water bodies in view of the sustainable improvement of eco environment quality hypothesis and is often used as a basis for determining development status when gs 0 sustainable development mark as gs gs 0 development risk and gs 0 unsustainable development mark as gs based on the above the relationship among water pollutant discharge c gdp y and water consumption e appearing in the current ekc could be redetermined by the gekc gs is used as the representation of unsustainable development to substitute the dependent variable c and gdp y is replaced with sdi in addition the added value of the gekc analysis is use of the water consumption and functional degradation values include the parameter of gs comparing with the linear consideration of pollutant discharges in the existing ekc literatures brock and taylor 2010 therefore avp is an essential variable effect on the application of the gekc method sun 2011 to achieve a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between watershed economic development and water pollution the gekc function based on empirical data was expressed as 5 g s κ 0 κ 1 s d i κ 2 s d i 2 κ 3 t κ 4 avp κ 5 rl μ the generalized level indicates that the final functional form of the ekc and the gekc was presented by eq 6 6 c i j γ 0 j γ 1 i y i

and η represent region time economic output and white noise terms respectively the parameters γ 1 i γ 2 i γ 3 i γ 4 i γ 5 i and γ 6 i are respectively relative elasticity to income income squared water resource consumption regional trade situation adding value of production and msdi pollutant long term emission parameters δ 1 i δ 2 i δ 3 i δ 4 i δ 5 i and δ 6 i are relative to long term gs elasticity of sdi sdi squared water consumption regional trade situation avp and regulations in eq 6 the marks γ 1 i and δ 1 i are positive and γ 2 i and δ 2 i are negative which are the key parameters to ensure the ekc line type as the increase in water consumption may increase the size of the economy and increase the discharge of sewage the markers γ 3 i and δ 3 i are positive marking γ 4 i and δ 4 i will be both positive and negative which is closely related to the regional economic structure and consumption level for areas under a higher level of socialization and better ambient conditions due to the elimination of certain pollution intensive products and other regions that have more relaxed water environmental laws for similar imported products the mark is negative for areas with a level of low economic and social development the mark is positive because more industries with a larger proportion of pollutants are distributed throughout the area mäler 2001 since the two regulatory variables production and sdi labelling increase water pollutant emissions levels the causal relationship between the msdi and gs were combined along with economic growth and water environmental damage with the sd dimension and sustainability in the gekc in addition the total water environment capacity represented by rl is the coercive force for economic growth and sustainable development under normal circumstances the analysis of total pollutant discharge control has an intrinsic correlation with rl and rl is an important governance dimension of water environmental pollution control industrial restructuring transformation upgrading and technological progress can promote the formation of inverted u curve of gekc the curves may appear as u n and inverted n richmond and kaufmann 2006 we introduce environmental pollution into endogenous economic growth variables analyze the conditions for sustained economic growth under natural resource constraints we examine the model coherence with the aid of two diagrams under the constraints of ecological resources the conditions for sustained economic growth are increasing investment in physical capital and reducing water pollution activities when the physical capital stock and the water pollution loading reduction activity capital stock reach the pareto optimal the economic growth rate is constant the fig 2 indicated that with the upgrading and optimization of industrial structure per capita income has further increased and environmental pollution has decreased making the relationship between water eco environment and economic development an inverted u shaped curve huntai river watershed s per capita industrial wastewater and per capita gdp data samples are in line with the gekc hypothesis but the inverted u shaped curve relationship between economic growth and water environmental pollution is not formed naturally and requires active human effort we use the partial derivative function to determine the optimal water pollutant emissions and achieve the water environmental quality improvement in the context of the economic development 8 e p 0 m 0 z 0 α 0 e g k t k α g k m n g e where p 0 m 0 and z 0 were original values gk was the change interval of pollutant emission rate the m n shows the complementary effect between the water eco environment and economic growth and which is also the optimal path for regional development the water pollutant emissions change dynamically over space time the optimization formula is as follows 9 k e g k α φ e α 1 1 z μ m n the negative slope change line of eq 9 is called the cost trajectory it is given by αφe α 1 1 z and moves according to cost changes rate φ the cost trajectory is gradually decreasing to zero at infinity e gradually increases the cost trajectory intersects the water pollutant emission trendline at points i and l the vertical dimension between αφe α 1 1 z and α μ m n is about α times the curves intersection equilibrium point l is the optimal cost e needed to improve water environment quality when e approaches the equilibrium point e the level of water pollution decreases as income rises the vertical distance between cost trajectory αφe α 1 1 z and the height α μ m n gk shows the improvement level of water pollution remediation the fig 2 indicates that if the technological progress of water pollutant loading removal is endogenous the growth rate of long term income will increase and the level of watershed short term output and economic growth will decline with the improvement of watershed socialization level water environmental pollutants first increase and then decrease and the turning point has a certain relationship with the regional economic development level e therefore the cost effective approach can help cost efficiently improve watershed water quality liu et al 2019 2 3 econometric methodology econometrics is the quantitative application of statistical and mathematical models using data to develop theories or test existing hypotheses in economics and to forecast future trends from historical data from media bias fact check web of science scopus science direct and pubmed et al econometric analyses data use statistical methods in order to test or develop economic theory we present a three step empirical approach to econometrics step 1 uses a panel of unit root tests to investigate the reliability of individual series in the panel dataset step 2 builds a long term relationship with appropriate panel long term estimates such as fmols and dols step 3 estimates the panel of vector error correction model vecm that describes granger causality bai and ng 2010 2 3 1 panel unit root test analysis we estimate the influences of the major economic and institutional determinants for investment and other productive economic activities by local government to evaluate the reliability of the variables we test and calculate the three types of panel unit roots ramirez 2008 the calculation formula is 10 w i t π i t n 1 k 1 γ in λ x i t n τ it according to eq 10 the test sample data statistics is given based on the hypothesis h 0 n 1 k 1 γ in 1 and the associated condition for optimal computation is supplied by h 1 n 1 k 1 γ in 1 the wit is assumed to be fixed with the conversion vectors the following test statistic is w i a w i w i 1 w i 2 w it x i

homogenous levin et al 2002 the assumptions based on the augmented dickey fuller adf test are expressed as 12 λ x it π i γ i x i t 1 δ it n 1 k γ in λ x i t n v it where λ is the first derivative xit is the independent variable of regression analysis δit is the acoustic disturbances i 1 2 n represents the number of regions t 1 2 n t represents calculation period we also assume that h 0 γi 0 h 1 γi 0 the alternative hypothesis corresponding to yit is fixed the data checking of statistical evaluation is 13 τ γ i γ i σ γ i where γ i is the parameter estimation of ols model σ γ i is the sample standard deviation the sample statistics of panel data effectively improves the accuracy of estimation result comparing to the single estimation from adf test therefore we limit βi by using eq 12 based on the inference 14 h 0 γ 1 γ 2 γ 0 h 1 γ 1 γ 2 γ 0 according to the method based on mean calculation of panel data im et al 2003 the z statistic calculated using the average statistic of eq 12 15 ξ χ v χ t f χ χ 1 t i 1 t χ γ i where v χ and f χ are the average value and variance of variables χγi respectively and ξ represents the ideal value of random data based on standardized normal distribution calculation 2 3 2 panel data conformity testing based on the logical function smooth transfer algorithm the nonlinear panel unit root test is established and the critical value is given by monte carlo simulation to study the data sample properties we calculated the hypothesis statistics based on the panel number data of the region number n the observation value t and the regression amount m according to the cointegration regression residual algorithm given by engle and granger 1987 and pedroni 1999 16 w it α i t λ it j 1 m β j i x j i t ξ it in the formula wit and xj it are the first order self products of each level two sets of panels conformity test methods were given by pedroni 2004 the first group is known as the static panel data model in view of the intradimensional method including statistical variables of statistical testing v zv statistical testing pp zpp and statistical testing adf zadf we selected the panel data modelling and used the cointegration theory and econometric forecasting analysis software eviews 8 0 to analyse the data consistency the second group is called the group average panel cointegration test based on the interdimensional method including dynamic statistic testing rho z ρ and dynamic statistic testing pp z pp in order to avoid spurious regression we took advantage of panel data for co integration analysis first of all the panel unit root test was used as the stability test of the variable after testing if the variable sequence is stable regression analysis can be performed directly if it is not stable use the first order difference to determine whether it is smooth co integration and cointegration regression can be performed when the variables are smooth after the first order difference since the wit sequence is not related to the panel data of the section the unit root test of the im pesaran shin ips panel can be used to determine the stationarity of the sequence wit because the wit sequence borrows the constructing principles of ips test statistic its threshold limit value table can directly adopt the normal distribution table pedroni 2004 pointed out that when t and n and the following conditions are satisfied all statistics are independent of brownian motion and are in a standard normal distribution the limit distribution of the test statistic t nt is a normal distribution 17 z nt n t nt 1 n i 1 n e t it 1 n i 1 n var t it n n 0 1 where tit is the test statistic for individual adf which is assumed to be independently and identically distributed in the ips test and have a finite mean and variance 2 3 3 fmols and dols parameter estimation the co integration equation is estimated after there is a cointegration relationship between the test variables in this paper the cointegration vector is tested using an effective estimation method such as using a fmols estimator or dols estimator phillips and hansen 1990 stiglitz 2000 for panel data kao and chiang 2001 demonstrated that the two methods obey the normal distribution although the ols and fmols estimators have small sample biases the performance characteristics of dols estimators are better than these two estimators the most commonly used co integration estimation method is ols but if the explanatory variable is endogenous or the regression error term is sequences correlation the ols estimated parameter is biased in order to solve the problem caused by ols parameter estimation pedroni 1999 used the non parametric method fmols to correct the ols estimator the non parametric method is used to correct the ols estimator

statistical causality test to study the relationship between social development level watershed economic growth and water pollutant emissions in this paper the granger causality test is carried out on the estimated value of the panel vecm and the two step procedure given by the vecm panel is used to study the dynamic relationship between short term and long term parameters engle and granger 1987

estimates may result in instability of the unit root it is necessary to determine the existence of the unit root of all variables before performing the metrological analysis the unit root test of panel data mainly includes five methods such as levin lin chu test llc breitung ips adf fisher and pp fisher the first two methods are applicable to the homogenous panel unit root test and the latter three methods are suitable for heterogeneous panel unit root inspection the theoretical model is difficult to conduct empirical validation because of the simplification and assumption of the complex interaction between social economy and environment stern 2004 believes that identifying the environmental stress indicator variable driving factor through factor decomposition helps to quantitatively explain the gekc formation mechanism at present the log mean divisia index lmdi of factor decomposition analysis is used in the correlation analysis of economic and environmental parameters because it has no residual analysis and steady state ang 2015 shang et al 2017 in order to analyse the gekc shape we used the huntai river watershed 2003 2012 panel data to build hierarchical independent component and locally weighted scatterplot smoothing model the mechanism of gekc formation was quantitatively analysed by using the lmdi method to measure the influence degree of pollutant emission driving factors using the four parameter logistic curve to analyse the wastewater treatment efficiency and the level of social and economic development this study analysed the water environmental pollution and economic growth among regions by gekc for a panel data of 10 control units during the period of 2003 2012 when testing the level values of each variable the original hypothesis of the existence of unit roots cannot be rejected that is each variable is a non stationary process when the first order difference values of each variable are tested the test results reject the null hypothesis at the 1 significant level that is the first order differential time series of each variable is a stationary process the results of the panel unit root test table 3 indicated that some of the variables are in an unstable state but after passing the first order difference all variables are in a stable state at the 1 level therefore the seven time series variables are all first order single integral i 1 processes and theoretically cointegration test and cointegration regression can be performed panel data unit root test mainly reflects data stationarity we assumed that the simultaneous cross section data is independent and the pedroni 1999 test is selected based on the residual panel cointegration test method since the first order difference between the panel ekc and the panel gekc is fixed we use the pedroni correlation formula for the cointegration test table 4 presents the results of the pedroni cointegration test the panel of v rho pp and adf is the panel statistic within dimension and group of rho pp and adf is the group statistic between dimension the statistic based on within dimension is homogeneous and the inter group statistics based on between dimension are heterogeneous the paper selected both the intercept term and the trend term for inspection the probability of group statistic panel v panel pp panel adf and inter group statistic group pp group adf is less than the given 0 01 significance level the other 2 are not significant in other words the test rejects the null hypothesis of the non cooperative relationship according to the heterogeneous panel cointegration test it indicates that there is a cointegration relationship between these variables of gekc the results show that all statistics have the necessary existence 3 2 cointegration and causal analysis the autoregressive coefficient in the different regions for the cointegration test is the key factor for estimating the relationship between two way long term and one way short term causality across the huntai river watershed co integration of resource consumption and economic development indicates that there may be a long term relationship between variables but the direction of causality cannot be determined we use a two step method to test long term causality the first step is to estimate the long term model residual the second step is to put the fitting residual as an independent variable into the dynamic error correction model since there is a long term two way causal relationship between water environmental improvement and economic growth heterogeneous panel model is estimated in y e t avp and msdi in order to perform fmols and dols with co integration restrictions tables 5 and 6 provide fmols and dols estimation results for the panels of ekc and gekc respectively these parameters have a significant effect on the overall results at a 1 significance level the verification results of the standard gekc hypothesis indicate that the gekc model i e eq 5 has a per capita wastewater discharge and per capita economic development index and is between the per capita actual income level gs and sdi of the gekc model i e eq 6 therefore the assumptions of the ekc and gekc models are verified there is cross interplay between social development and ecological condition improvement the verification results of panel co integration show that variable sequences per capita wastewater discharge per capita consumption level and its square have stochastic correlation the credibility of coupling coordination coefficient is not high approximately 50 of the ekc variable coefficients are cointegrated but most of these have first order autoregressive measurement error we used the wiener process to describe the performance change of the product and introduced a first order autoregressive model to characterize the measurement error with autocorrelation when there is autocorrelation in the general linear regression model without the lag variable the transformation of this linear regression model into an autoregressive distribution lag model can eliminate the autocorrelation under the condition that the explanatory variable is a fixed value the autoregressive distributed lag model is applied to the fmols dols estimation reducing the water pollutant emission intensity of economic growth although this does not change the shape of the gekc curve it can change the inflection point of the curve this paper used stata software to perform regression analysis on water environmental control indicators and per capita watershed development economic index and the significance level of results reached 99 therefore the paper divided the calculation unit data according to the panel threshold regression to solve the problem of heterogeneity to check if the gekc turning point of the panel unit root appears under existing water environmental management the independent variables of e t avp rl sdi and cr were used to construct multivariate auto regression model 3 3 discussion based on the gekc hypothesis this paper used the economic and water environmental data of huntai river watershed from 2003 to 2012 and used the regression model to empirically test the relationship between water environmental pollution and economic activities in order to obtain the net effect of the economic development and water environmental pollution of huntai river watershed this paper skipped the impact factors such as water environmental control technical level and industrial structure and chose to establish a simplified formal equation of water pollution emission economic growth social development level the paper used gekc test method and model to consider the influence and feedback between different calculation units and explored the maintenance strategy of long term equilibrium dynamic relationship between water environmental improvement and economic growth from the perspective of the whole basin to empirically investigate the nonlinear effects of economic growth on water environmental quality improvement cole 2003 revealed the relationship between water environmental quality and the level of economic development put forward the gekc is useful to analyse the interdependence between the economic development and water environmental pollution of huntai river watershed for the panel ekc model shown in table 4 the panel fmols estimation coefficients for y y2 e t avp and msdi are 2 097 0 152 0 726 0 218 0 074 and 1 683 respectively based on the results of the econometric model analysis the

0 074 for every 1 increase in msdi per capita sewage discharge increases by 1 683 the panel dols estimation coefficients for y y2 e t avp and msdi are 2 083 0 149 0 714 0 214 0 069 and 2 117 respectively in the long term the per capita pollution of wastewater discharge per capita real gdp elasticity is 2 083 0 298y dc dy α 1 2α 2 y per capita water resource consumption increases by 1 per capita sewage discharge increases by 0 714 the regional trade situation increases by 1 and per capita pollution wastewater discharge increases by 0 214 for every 1 increase in the adding value of production per capita sewage discharge increases by 0 069 for every 1 increase in msdi per capita wastewater discharge increases by 2 117 the results of the analysis will vary due to different data and index selections different time periods transmission effects of inter regional pollutants and changes in the state s efforts to control the pollution of the huntai river watershed at present the economic development of huntai river watershed is in a steadily rising stage we should reduce the curvature of gekc to realize the rapidly development of eco economic to solve water environmental problems well though economic structure of countries and regional trade situation may be important in some areas but the function display requires a long time series so which only have a certain impact on the simulation results use of econometric methodology scholars have conducted in depth discussions from different angles such as samples inflection points and paths and concluded that the degree of industrialization income level and regional location are different and the gekc curve shape will have a large difference environmental awareness plays an influential role in determining water environmental expenditure chen et al 2019 for the panel gekc model shown in table 5 the panel fmols estimation coefficients for sdi sdi2 e t avp and rl are 1 897 1 025 1 175 0 226 0 066 and 0 015 respectively in the long term the per capita gs sdi elasticity is 1 897 2 050sdi per capita water consumption increases by 1 per capita gs increases by 1 175 the trade exchange degree increases by 1 and per capita gs increases by 0 226 for every 1 increase in the adding value production the per capita gs increases by 0 066 for every 1 increase in rl the per capita gs decreases by 0 015 the panel dols estimation coefficients for sdi sdi2 e t avp and rl are 2 096 1 020 1 125 0 280 0 068 and 0 020 respectively in the long term the per capita gs and sdi elasticity is 2 096 2 040sdi per capita water consumption increases by 1 per capita gs increases by 1 125 the trade exchange degree increases by 1 and per capita gs increases by 0 280 for every 1 increase in the adding value production the per capita gs increases by 0 068 for every 1 increase in rl the per capita gs decreases by 0 020 for ekc the average of the fmols and dols coefficients for y y2 e t avp and msdi are 2 090 0 150 0 720 0 216 0 072 and 1 890 respectively in the long term the elasticity between per capita wastewater discharge and the per capita gdp is 2 090 0 300y per capita water resource consumption increases by 1 per capita sewage discharge increases by approximately 0 720 the regional trade exchange increases by 1 and per capita sewage discharge increases by approximately 0 216 for every 1 increase in the adding value of production per capita wastewater discharge increases by approximately 0 072 for every 1 increase in msdi per capita wastewater discharge increases by approximately 1 890 the ekc regression variables test shows that per capita economic indicator per capita water use drainage trade resources exchange degree and the adding value of production msdi have a greater impact on per capita wastewater discharge in addition ect pass the autocorrelation test at the 1 significance level statistical variables now exhibit the positive effect of regional economic adjustment on the agglomeration of environmental pollution huntai river watershed environmental pollution originates from environmental pollution in neighboring areas and also comes from the sagittal impact of structural differences between regions its specific manifestations are water environmental factors such as water environmental awareness and urbanization which will aggravate water environmental pollution however the space factors of industrial structure and degree of openness which will improve the quality of the water environment the gekc model estimates show that sdi water value trade exchange adding value of production and rl have an impact on per capita gs in addition ect is available at the 1 significance level because all variables now exhibit a smooth change rate to elaborate the relationship between water environmental pollution and economic growth the gekc metrology verification reveals that the convergence of the economic growth path of the huntai river watershed to the coordinated development of the water eco environment and the economy is not spontaneous therefore the government should adopt a systematic regulation and policy to reduce water environmental pressure the gekc equilibrium optimization calculation results can be used to effectively control pollutant emissions and improve water environmental quality for the study of the relationship between water environmental quality and economic growth most scholars have expanded from ekc this paper also used the ekc hypothesis for verification analysis and gradually extended from the ordinary linear regression model to the spatial measurement model with lagging variables the gekc equilibrium optimization calculation results can be used to effectively control pollutant emissions and improve water environmental quality the gekc test model constructed in this paper satisfied the requirements of dynamic equilibrium hypothesis at present most of the research objectives are to verify whether ekc is inverted u shaped and to find many factors affecting water environmental quality ignoring the impact of inter regional economic activity on the formation mechanism of ekc in different regions bruvoll and medin 2003 the existence of gekc has a lot to do with the choice of water environmental indicators the more environmental indicators can represent the real water pollution status the more the relationship with economic growth is in line with the gekc law whether or not readers agree with the idea we hope to have persuaded them of the utility of our addition to the correlation and unit root examination cointegration and causal analysis tricks for thinking about the gekc phenomenon 4 conclusion the objective of this manuscript was to provide a theoretical pattern incorporating the coordinated development concept of economic activities and water environmental improvement using the factors of y t e avp msdi c sed il gs and rl for a panel consisting of 10 control units the period 2003 2012 we used two models to study the equilibrium cost between regional sustainable development and water pollutant emissions the gekc introduced the income independent variable of the original ekc model with the modified socioeconomic development index correlating per capita negative gs sdi per capita water consumption regional trade exchange adding value of production and total pollutant discharge control regulations based on the results of this study the regional water environmental protection status is affected by the level of social and economic development and pollutant discharge water environmental protection is a comprehensive systematic project within the tolerance of water environment capacity it focuses on the study of regional water environmental damage and water consumption regional trade exchange per capita gdp level and total pollutant discharge control constraints and interactions for the gekc model should focus on the impact of economic index and resource consumption starting with the intrinsic influence mechanism that causes the curve to change the potential of water environmental protection is further explored and the

6087,there are multiple relationship curves between watershed socioeconomic development and water environmental conservation the goal of this paper is to present a theoretical pattern of economic activities and water environmental improvement by incorporating their bidirectional causality relationship the environmental kuznets curve ekc has been useful in connecting economic and environmental concepts thus becoming an important tool for evaluating watershed sustainability the high governance cost makes water pollution intensive goods relatively expensive to produce according to the ekc there is an inverted u shaped relationship between water environment deterioration and the level of social and economic improvement based on ekc hypothesis we studied the coordinated relationship between environmental protection of water and economic and social sustainable development in the huntai river watershed from 2003 to 2012 by means of a panel threshold data the ekc is an empirical curve that describes the relationship between economic restructuring and water environmental conditions improvement the green environmental kuznets curve gekc is used to describe the relationship among watershed pollution emissions the environmental quality and income per capita however according to the gekc u shaped relationship exists between the coordination of water environmental protection and the level of social economic development sed the gekc is affected by water resource consumption the regional trade situation t the per capita gross domestic product level y and controls on the total amount of water pollution discharge we try to adjust to the type of gekc curve and apply dataset of water pollutant emission reduction cost control to fit main characteristic of equilibrium cost in accordance with fully modified ordinary least squares fmols and dynamic ordinary least squares dols data statistical analysis the value of the gekc regression equation independent variables y y2 per capita water resources consumption e t adding value of production avp and modified socioeconomic development index msdi were 1 988 0 150 0 720 0 216 0 070 and 1 890 respectively in the long term the correlation formula of watershed per capita sewage discharge c to y was 2 090 0 300y for every 1 increase in e t avp and msdi c increased by approximately 0 720 0 216 0 072 and 1 890 respectively the e t and msdi are key factors in developing an effective way to control the levels of water pollution discharge pollution is endogenous so water environment pollution is not necessarily caused by economic growth according to the total amount control of water pollution discharge the gekc equilibrium optimization calculation results can be used to effectively control watershed pollutant emissions and improve water environmental quality through the adjustment of industrial structure or industrial transformation and technological progress it is possible to change the relationship between current economic growth and water environment with gekc related curve characteristic and indicator classes it is possible to realize harmonious and sustainable development of regional economy and society in the huntai river watershed keywords green environmental kuznets curve equilibrium optimization calculation sustainable development sewage discharge huntai river watershed 1 introduction in the paper we try to supply a green development pattern incorporating the coordinated development concept of watershed economic activities and water environmental improvement along with the public s deeper understanding of the characteristics of sustainable development environmental health has become an important factor in restricting the realization of beautiful china s construction the systematic analysis of the relationship between environmental quality and social and economic growth has become increasingly important the environmental kuznets curve ekc ideal was proposed in the 1990s based on the research results of the north american free trade agreement mäler 2001 we focused on the optimization problem faced by a benevolent social planner allocating resources in a centralized economy ekc is a theoretical hypothesis in this field of research and is widely used to study the relationship between watershed socioeconomic development and water environmental improvement ekc provides a reference for coordinating economic development and comprehensive decision making on water environmental improvement george et al 2015 song et al 2008 carried out an empirical study on data series from 1985 to 2005 in 29 provinces of china indicating that the emissions of waste gas wastewater and industrial solid waste were consistent with gdp and that there was an inverted u shaped relationship brock and taylor 2010 elaborated on the technological progress in pollution abatement and ekc is a response model to economic development and water environmental issues recent literature has shown that the watershed trade situation t education and development fairness human capital investment technological progress industrial structure and urbanization levels and water resource consumption are also key factors in water environmental degradation farhani et al 2014a b yuan et al 2016 the level of regional social economic development sed has always been regarded as the key driving factor of social progress and the construction of ekc model was largely affected by changes in the sed dimensions costantini and martini 2006 ong and sek 2013 to describe the sustainable development of a regional ecological socio economic system ekc theory and empirical investigation are used to correlate watershed economic and social development with water environmental carrying capacity carrying capacity can support the social water cycle with regional scale water resources and environmental conditions zhang et al 2019 therefore the intention of the manuscript is to build a modified ekc in order to consider a wider concept of development rather than pure economic growth at present the application of the ekc curve has been widely studied but the practicality and operability of model under sustainable development conditions have not been fully explained the economic development is not fit for development conditions therefore we would slow down the gdp development rate beckerman 1992 grossman 1995 however the u shaped of the ekc suggesting there is causal two way relationship between watershed development and water environmental damage keho 2017 based on the relevant literature farhani et al 2014a b babu and datta 2013 du et al 2018 chen et al 2019 we supplied an improvement method for deficiencies in the previous studies and proposed the concept of the green environmental kuznets curve gekc we evaluated the pure environmental pressure in the alternative standard ekc by changing the dependent variable as well as using the stress that characterizes the deterioration of the environment babu and datta 2013 based on the resource curse assumption the abundant resources will not only become an advantage of watershed development but will have a negative impact we proposed an equilibrium model to study the ekc which introduced the sustainability dimension of the people s well being and the social development process to realize coordinated relationship between environmental protection of water and economic and social sustainable development drawing on relevant research this paper used the panel threshold model fmols and dols to estimate gekc parameters that control the heterogeneity and nonlinearity between variables costantini and monni 2008 rashid et al 2018 within the time dimension the choice of panel dataset dimensions should include as many computational elements c y e t gs sdi and rl as possible for the huntai river watershed to control water quality and resolve the conflicts between dischargers an optimization method for water quality management based on stackelberg game was given zhang et al 2018 ekc has already been used to explore different ideas on pollutants emissions we used the modified coordinated test method proposed by pedroni to analyse the panel data on the 10 control units of the huntai river watershed from 2003 to 2012 to verify the long term equilibrium relationship between watershed socio economic sustainable development and water environmental protection data pedroni 2004 based on the characteristics of ekc the gekc indicated the inverted u shaped relationship curve was found between income structure water resources consumption and pollutants discharge reduction in many countries by using an optimization calculation model brock and taylor 2010 we used per capita gdp y per capita water resource consumption e regional trade situation t the adding value of production avp and the modified socioeconomic development index msdi as explanatory variables for the ekc model sewage discharge was considered a dependent variable the sdi water consumption regional trade exchange and pollutant discharge regulations rl were used as explanatory variables for the gekc in this paper negative gross domestic product level gs was recorded as gs on this basis the researcher used the panel data based on fmols and dols to estimate the variables in the gekc models with the help of the nonlinear panel data sequence causality test to eliminate interference between variables phillips and hansen 1990 stock and watson 1993 preliminary tests of the model s equilibrium calculation were investigated using data from the huntai river watershed the use of the gekc instead of the ekc is based mainly on two principles in terms of demand if the environment is no longer a luxury in areas with poor economic development the need to formulate total pollutant discharge control policies to alleviate water environmental degradation plays a leading role on the other hand if technological innovation and production structure are adjusted and water pollution emissions increase the watershed industrial structure transformation plays an important role in the construction of the economic system water pollution reduction technologies with higher initial investment costs can reduce the enthusiasm for implementing pollution reduction control policies in economically underdeveloped areas of the watershed but the increasing scale benefits have increased the promotion of emission reduction technologies andreoni and levinson 2001 xu et al 2017 the gekc approach to equilibrium cost aims to present a theoretical pattern incorporating the coordinated development of economic activities and water environmental improvement with gekc related indicators it is entirely possible to realize the inverted u type green between current economic growth and pollution therefore the evaluation of gekc factor relevance of the nature society dualistic systems has become an important gripper to realize green development and ecological civilization of huntai river watershed we gave a comprehensive systematic structure to study the coordinated relationship between regional water environmental damage and water consumption regional trade exchange per capita gdp level and total pollutant discharge control the framework of this manuscript is elaborated as follows 1 introduction describing on the characteristic of ekc and the application condition to achieve social sustainability and water environmental improvement 2 data and methods including 1 region and data 2 gekc model structure and 3 econometric methodology panel unit root test analysis panel data conformity testing fmols and dols parameter estimation and granger causality

and data the data sequences studied from 2003 to 2012 and space contained 10 control units table 1 the control unit is the water resources division within the county the huntai river watershed is located in north eastern china geographical area in liaoning province and the total area is 27 thousand km2 which covers 20 of the area of liaoning province the huntai river watershed is an important economic and industrial development area in liaoning province and has been threatened by severe structural and functional degradation of river ecosystems in recent years the huntai river watershed consists of two river systems the hunhe river and the taizi river which flows through major industrial cities such as fushun liaoyang anshan and benxi the watershed is seriously disturbed by human activities the mountainous area accounts for approximately 70 of the total basin area the forest land area in the huntai river watershed is the highest accounting for 47 of the basin area located in the eastern of daliao river followed by farmland accounting for 39 06 of the total area concentrated in the middle and lower reaches of the taizi river fig 1 to meet the needs of the watershed equilibrium development process rather than single economic growth the system of welfare and sustainability was emphasized during the process of building the ekc and gekc models in view of the relationship between ekc and gekc the manuscript expounded the main influencing factors which was useful for analysing the relationship between the economic and social development level and water environmental protection ekc the per capita sewage discharge c is measured in t person year the economic income y is measured in per capita gdp the msdi is the sum of the initial situation and the secondary education in the study period but it does not include income gdp y to avoid multiple collinearity gekc the negative gdp level is gs the sdi is expressed as msdi including the research cycle education level and economic income and water pollutant discharge regulations rl are an important basis for controlling pollutant discharge that exceeds standards ekc and gekc water consumption is expressed as the amount of water consumed in the production process of unit value products the regional trade situation is analysed by the percentage of gdp engendered by intermediate amount avp is analysed using the percentage of gdp engendered we used statistical analysis software spss16 0 to research the elements correlation between watershed economic growth and environmental pollution table 2 elaborated the parameters name and definition unit of variables data collection and the length of the data series the meaning and role of many variables have been elaborated in the previous paragraphs such as water resource consumption intensity and levels of economic development the other new variables such as adding value of production modified socioeconomic development index industrial revolution were considered in gekc the high technology application and high skill labour make a significant impact on economic growth and regional social progress to realize coordinated development of social economic and eco environment the manuscript used statistical bulletins yearbooks regional development plans watershed protection goals and water ecological health data to seek optimal economic development models and ecological protection strategies through optimization method of digitalization 2 2 gekc model structure the gekc introduced the income independent variable of the original ekc model with the modified socioeconomic development index msdi in the gekc we replaced the environmental deterioration with sustainability and also introduced the pollutant emissions with the actual income level il to improve il such as per capita gross domestic product level regional trade situation can be a measure of sustainability of regional socio economic development in accordance with ekc hypothesis the relationship between total water consumption and regional gdp and per capita income level followed the approach balado naves et al 2018 danish et al 2017 and du et al 2018 the long standing relationship between water pollution discharge c gdp per capita y and water resource consumption e is given as follows 1 c α 0 α 1 y α 2 y 2 α 3 e ε in addition antweiler et al 2001 considered that it is feasible to incorporate interregional trade flows into the quantification of the models the impact of t on the water environment depends on the effectiveness of the experience of dealing with water pollution problems therefore scholars consider that the interactions among trading mechanism of pollutant discharge rights regional economic growth and water consumption should be viewed as a scheme for solving the deficiency of neglecting primary variables in social development farhani et al 2014a b aslan et al 2018 the manuscript supplied an improved ekc formula covering c y e and t 2 c δ 0 δ 1 y δ 2 y 2 δ 3 e δ 4 t ε related studies have shown that adding control variables to the ekc formula is conducive to reflecting interregional trade manufacturing development and improving social well being which has a positive impact on improving the public s sense of fairness democracy law abidingness and their participation in other systems costantini and monni 2008 apergis and payne 2010 the range of numerical model effects the potential application fields data integrity and effectiveness of computational solution to study how differences in deep parameters affect ekc the influence of parameters determination in sdi avp and rates of technological progress was been thought out at first the functional form of the improved gekc model is 3 c δ 0 δ 1 y δ 2 y 2 δ 3 e δ 4 a v p δ 5 s d i ε eq 3 indicates that the nonlinear relationship for c and y can be expressed by means of the msdi and the sdi is replaced by an msdi that is not involved in the income distribution process and is re formulated in addition there is no gdp index in the msdi which avoids the coincidence of the corresponding factors between y and msdi unlike the increase of explanatory variables scholars use the sdi as an explanatory variable for pollution emissions focusing on constructing gekc models and even determining inverted u shaped curves based on development concepts abou ali and abdelfattah 2013 berk et al 2018 the internal relevance among economic development social progress and water environmental improvement is under dynamic changes we used a more functionally oriented measure to analyse the potential effects of industrial layout across the watershed economic or the impact of socioeconomic development sd on pollution i e using the sdi instead of income factor gdp while other control variables remained unchanged in addition in order to adapt to the needs of the research framework for sustainable development the dependent variable related to water environmental pollution was replaced by gs the gs formula is expressed as 4 gs k f r f r r f r r b d f r g b e where k is the regional development investment rmy r is the water resource exploitation rate g is the water resource recovery rate fr is the water resource value rmy fr is the water resource exploitation marginal cost rmy b is the marginal cost of wastewater emissions rmy e is the discharge rate of wastewater d is the natural rate of reduction of pollution by water bodies in view of the sustainable improvement of eco environment quality hypothesis and is often used as a basis for determining development status when gs 0 sustainable development mark as gs gs 0 development risk and gs 0 unsustainable development mark as gs based on the above the relationship among water pollutant discharge c gdp y and water consumption e appearing in the current ekc could be redetermined by the gekc gs is used as the representation of unsustainable development to substitute the dependent variable c and gdp y is replaced with sdi in addition the added value of the gekc analysis is use of the water consumption and functional degradation values include the parameter of gs comparing with the linear consideration of pollutant discharges in the existing ekc literatures brock and taylor 2010 therefore avp is an essential variable effect on the application of the gekc method sun 2011 to achieve a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between watershed economic development and water pollution the gekc function based on empirical data was expressed as 5 g s κ 0 κ 1 s d i κ 2 s d i 2 κ 3 t κ 4 avp κ 5 rl μ the generalized level indicates that the final functional form of the ekc and the gekc was presented by eq 6 6 c i j γ 0 j γ 1 i y i

elasticity of sdi sdi squared water consumption regional trade situation avp and regulations in eq 6 the marks γ 1 i and δ 1 i are positive and γ 2 i and δ 2 i are negative which are the key parameters to ensure the ekc line type as the increase in water consumption may increase the size of the economy and increase the discharge of sewage the markers γ 3 i and δ 3 i are positive marking γ 4 i and δ 4 i will be both positive and negative which is closely related to the regional economic structure and consumption level for areas under a higher level of socialization and better ambient conditions due to the elimination of certain pollution intensive products and other regions that have more relaxed water environmental laws for similar imported products the mark is negative for areas with a level of low economic and social development the mark is positive because more industries with a larger proportion of pollutants are distributed throughout the area mäler 2001 since the two regulatory variables production and sdi labelling increase water pollutant emissions levels the causal relationship between the msdi and gs were combined along with economic growth and water environmental damage with the sd dimension and sustainability in the gekc in addition the total water environment capacity represented by rl is the coercive force for economic growth and sustainable development under normal circumstances the analysis of total pollutant discharge control has an intrinsic correlation with rl and rl is an important governance dimension of water environmental pollution control industrial restructuring transformation upgrading and technological progress can promote the formation of inverted u curve of gekc the curves may appear as u n and inverted n richmond and kaufmann 2006 we introduce environmental pollution into endogenous economic growth variables analyze the conditions for sustained economic growth under natural resource constraints we examine the model coherence with the aid of two diagrams under the constraints of ecological resources the conditions for sustained economic growth are increasing investment in physical capital and reducing water pollution activities when the physical capital stock and the water pollution loading reduction activity capital stock reach the pareto optimal the economic growth rate is constant the fig 2 indicated that with the upgrading and optimization of industrial structure per capita income has further increased and environmental pollution has decreased making the relationship between water eco environment and economic development an inverted u shaped curve huntai river watershed s per capita industrial wastewater and per capita gdp data samples are in line with the gekc hypothesis but the inverted u shaped curve relationship between economic growth and water environmental pollution is not formed naturally and requires active human effort we use the partial derivative function to determine the optimal water pollutant emissions and achieve the water environmental quality improvement in the context of the economic development 8 e p 0 m 0 z 0 α 0 e g k t k α g k m n g e where p 0 m 0 and z 0 were original values gk was the change interval of pollutant emission rate the m n shows the complementary effect between the water eco environment and economic growth and which is also the optimal path for regional development the water pollutant emissions change dynamically over space time the optimization formula is as follows 9 k e g k α φ e α 1 1 z μ m n the negative slope change line of eq 9 is called the cost trajectory it is given by αφe α 1 1 z and moves according to cost changes rate φ the cost trajectory is gradually decreasing to zero at infinity e gradually increases the cost trajectory intersects the water pollutant emission trendline at points i and l the vertical dimension between αφe α 1 1 z and α μ m n is about α times the curves intersection equilibrium point l is the optimal cost e needed to improve water environment quality when e approaches the equilibrium point e the level of water pollution decreases as income rises the vertical distance between cost trajectory αφe α 1 1 z and the height α μ m n gk shows the improvement level of water pollution remediation the fig 2 indicates that if the technological progress of water pollutant loading removal is endogenous the growth rate of long term income will increase and the level of watershed short term output and economic growth will decline with the improvement of watershed socialization level water environmental pollutants first increase and then decrease and the turning point has a certain relationship with the regional economic development level e therefore the cost effective approach can help cost efficiently improve watershed water quality liu et al 2019 2 3 econometric methodology econometrics is the quantitative application of statistical and mathematical models using data to develop theories or test existing hypotheses in economics and to forecast future trends from historical data from media bias fact check web of science scopus science direct and pubmed et al econometric analyses data use statistical methods in order to test or develop economic theory we present a three step empirical approach to econometrics step 1 uses a panel of unit root tests to investigate the reliability of individual series in the panel dataset step 2 builds a long term relationship with appropriate panel long term estimates such as fmols and dols step 3 estimates the panel of vector error correction model vecm that describes granger causality bai and ng 2010 2 3 1 panel unit root test analysis we estimate the influences of the major economic and institutional determinants for investment and other productive economic activities by local government to evaluate the reliability of the variables we test and calculate the three types of panel unit roots ramirez 2008 the calculation formula is 10 w i t π i t n 1 k 1 γ in λ x i t n τ it according to eq 10 the test sample data statistics is given based on the hypothesis h 0 n 1 k 1 γ in 1 and the associated condition for optimal computation is supplied by h 1 n 1 k 1 γ in 1 the wit is assumed to be fixed with the conversion vectors the following test statistic is w i a w i w i 1 w i 2 w it x i a x i x i 1 x i 2 x it 11 λ i 1 n w i x i 1 σ i 2 i 1 n x i a a x i based on the unit root testing and panel data cointegration testing the autoregressive coefficients of the panel units are homogenous levin et al 2002 the assumptions based on the augmented dickey fuller adf test are expressed as 12 λ x it π i γ i x i t 1 δ it n 1 k γ in λ x i t n v it where λ is the first derivative xit is the independent variable of regression analysis δit is the acoustic disturbances i 1 2 n represents the number of regions t 1 2 n t represents calculation period we also assume that h 0 γi 0 h 1 γi 0 the alternative hypothesis corresponding to yit is fixed the data checking of statistical evaluation is 13 τ γ i γ i σ γ i where γ i is the parameter estimation of ols model σ γ i is the sample standard deviation the sample statistics of panel data effectively improves the accuracy of estimation result comparing to the single estimation from adf test therefore we limit βi by using eq 12 based on the inference 14 h 0 γ 1 γ 2 γ 0 h 1 γ 1 γ 2 γ 0 according to the method based on mean calculation of panel data im et al 2003 the z statistic calculated using the average statistic of eq 12

distribution calculation 2 3 2 panel data conformity testing based on the logical function smooth transfer algorithm the nonlinear panel unit root test is established and the critical value is given by monte carlo simulation to study the data sample properties we calculated the hypothesis statistics based on the panel number data of the region number n the observation value t and the regression amount m according to the cointegration regression residual algorithm given by engle and granger 1987 and pedroni 1999 16 w it α i t λ it j 1 m β j i x j i t ξ it in the formula wit and xj it are the first order self products of each level two sets of panels conformity test methods were given by pedroni 2004 the first group is known as the static panel data model in view of the intradimensional method including statistical variables of statistical testing v zv statistical testing pp zpp and statistical testing adf zadf we selected the panel data modelling and used the cointegration theory and econometric forecasting analysis software eviews 8 0 to analyse the data consistency the second group is called the group average panel cointegration test based on the interdimensional method including dynamic statistic testing rho z ρ and dynamic statistic testing pp z pp in order to avoid spurious regression we took advantage of panel data for co integration analysis first of all the panel unit root test was used as the stability test of the variable after testing if the variable sequence is stable regression analysis can be performed directly if it is not stable use the first order difference to determine whether it is smooth co integration and cointegration regression can be performed when the variables are smooth after the first order difference since the wit sequence is not related to the panel data of the section the unit root test of the im pesaran shin ips panel can be used to determine the stationarity of the sequence wit because the wit sequence borrows the constructing principles of ips test statistic its threshold limit value table can directly adopt the normal distribution table pedroni 2004 pointed out that when t and n and the following conditions are satisfied all statistics are independent of brownian motion and are in a standard normal distribution the limit distribution of the test statistic t nt is a normal distribution 17 z nt n t nt 1 n i 1 n e t it 1 n i 1 n var t it n n 0 1 where tit is the test statistic for individual adf which is assumed to be independently and identically distributed in the ips test and have a finite mean and variance 2 3 3 fmols and dols parameter estimation the co integration equation is estimated after there is a cointegration relationship between the test variables in this paper the cointegration vector is tested using an effective estimation method such as using a fmols estimator or dols estimator phillips and hansen 1990 stiglitz 2000 for panel data kao and chiang 2001 demonstrated that the two methods obey the normal distribution although the ols and fmols estimators have small sample biases the performance characteristics of dols estimators are better than these two estimators the most commonly used co integration estimation method is ols but if the explanatory variable is endogenous or the regression error term is sequences correlation the ols estimated parameter is biased in order to solve the problem caused by ols parameter estimation pedroni 1999 used the non parametric method fmols to correct the ols estimator the non parametric method is used to correct the ols estimator which is useful to eliminate non central biases pedroni 2004 solved the endogeneity problem between regressions with the relevant estimator and the construction equation is 18 w it k k i k α i β i x i

order eit is the random error wit and xit have a cointegration relationship with the slope βi and the slope may be evenly or unevenly distributed in i we increase the cointegration regression by controlling the hysteresis difference of the regression amount using the endogenous feedback effect and give the formula 19 w i t α i β i x i t k k i ki γ i k δ x i t k e i t fmols and dols estimate the long term stability relationship between variables through the self correlation of the residual space as the long term covariance of the vector solution process the parameter estimator of fmols is

including the ex ante and delaying values δx i t in the cointegration calculation dols uses normal distribution and standard deviation to detect whether the variables have statistical significance the

statistical causality test to study the relationship between social development level watershed economic growth and water pollutant emissions in this paper the granger causality test is carried out on the estimated value of the panel vecm and the two step procedure given by the vecm panel is used to study the dynamic relationship between short term and long term parameters engle and granger 1987 based on the panel data correlation analysis using spss statistical software the manuscript performed granger causal analysis with eviews software we used vecm to build the model as follows 22 δ y it k 1 k δ y i t 1 x i t 1 u q it where δ is the differential value between the two variables x and y k is lag order i t 1 is the error correction u is the error correction factors qit is the mode residual we examined the short term causal relationship between economic and social economy development and water pollutant emissions based on the fixed effect panel model and the granger statistical test of heterogeneous panels based on the analysis of data requirements and the advantages and disadvantages of different nonlinear granger methods the paper proposed the overall framework and research paradigm of granger causality test linear nonlinear 23 y it k 1 k β i k k 1 k e i k e it where y is the fixed variable β i k is the regression parameter e i k is the slope of regression

strong causal relationship is determined for eq 1 h 0 β 12 k 0 β 13 0 or eq 2 h 0 β 22 k 0 β 23 0 for consistency we used the wald test the estimated lag residuals in eqs 3 and 5 are defined as the

estimates may result in instability of the unit root it is necessary to determine the existence of the unit root of all variables before performing the metrological analysis the unit root test of panel data mainly includes five methods such as levin lin chu test llc breitung ips adf fisher and pp fisher the first two methods are applicable to the homogenous panel unit root test and the latter three methods are suitable for heterogeneous panel unit root inspection the theoretical model is difficult to conduct empirical validation because of the simplification and assumption of the complex interaction between social economy and environment stern 2004 believes that identifying the environmental stress indicator variable driving factor through factor decomposition helps to quantitatively explain the gekc formation mechanism at present the log mean divisia index lmdi of factor decomposition analysis is used in the correlation analysis of economic and environmental parameters because it has no residual analysis and steady state ang 2015 shang et al 2017 in order to analyse the gekc shape we used the huntai river watershed 2003 2012 panel data to build hierarchical independent component and locally weighted scatterplot smoothing model the mechanism of gekc formation was quantitatively analysed by using the lmdi method to measure the influence degree of pollutant emission driving factors using the four parameter logistic curve to analyse the wastewater treatment efficiency and the level of social and economic development this study analysed the water environmental pollution and economic growth among regions by gekc for a panel data of 10 control units during the period of 2003 2012 when testing the level values of each variable the original hypothesis of the existence of unit roots cannot be rejected that is each variable is a non stationary process when the first order difference values of each variable are tested the test results reject the null hypothesis at the 1 significant level that is the first order differential time series of each variable is a stationary process the results of the panel unit root test table 3 indicated that some of the variables are in an unstable state but after passing the first order difference all variables are in a stable state at the 1 level therefore the seven time series variables are all first order single integral i 1 processes and theoretically cointegration test and cointegration regression can be performed panel data unit root test mainly reflects data stationarity we assumed that the simultaneous cross section data is independent and the pedroni 1999 test is selected based on the residual panel cointegration test method since the first order difference between the panel ekc and the panel gekc is fixed we use the pedroni correlation formula for the cointegration test table 4 presents the results of the pedroni cointegration test the panel of v rho pp and adf is the panel statistic within dimension and group of rho pp and adf is the group statistic between dimension the statistic based on within dimension is homogeneous and the inter group statistics based on between dimension are heterogeneous the paper selected both the intercept term and the trend term for inspection the probability of group statistic panel v panel pp panel adf and inter group statistic group pp group adf is less than the given 0 01 significance level the other 2 are not significant in other words the test rejects the null hypothesis of the non cooperative relationship according to the heterogeneous panel cointegration test it indicates that there is a cointegration relationship between these variables of gekc the results show that all statistics have the necessary existence 3 2 cointegration and causal analysis the autoregressive coefficient in the different regions for the cointegration test is the key factor for estimating the relationship between two way long term and one way short term causality across the huntai river watershed co integration of resource consumption and economic development indicates that there may be a long term relationship between variables but the direction of causality cannot be determined we use a two step method to test long term causality the first step is to estimate the long term model residual the second step is to put the fitting residual as an independent variable into the dynamic error correction model since there is a long term two way causal relationship between water environmental improvement and economic growth heterogeneous panel model is estimated in y e t avp and msdi in order to perform fmols and dols with co integration restrictions tables 5 and 6 provide fmols and dols estimation results for the panels of ekc and gekc respectively these parameters have a significant effect on the overall results at a 1 significance level the verification results of the standard gekc hypothesis indicate that the gekc model i e eq 5 has a per capita wastewater discharge and per capita economic development index and is between the per capita actual income level gs and sdi of the gekc model i e eq 6 therefore the assumptions of the ekc and gekc models are verified there is cross interplay between social development and ecological condition improvement the verification results of panel co integration show that variable sequences per capita wastewater discharge per capita consumption level and its square have stochastic correlation the credibility of coupling coordination coefficient is not high approximately 50 of the ekc variable coefficients are cointegrated but most of these have first order autoregressive measurement error we used the wiener process to describe the performance change of the product and introduced a first order autoregressive model to characterize the measurement error with autocorrelation when there is autocorrelation in the general linear regression model without the lag variable the transformation of this linear regression model into an autoregressive distribution lag model can eliminate the autocorrelation under the condition that the explanatory variable is a fixed value the autoregressive distributed lag model is applied to the fmols dols estimation reducing the water pollutant emission intensity of economic growth although this does not change the shape of the gekc curve it can change the inflection point of the curve this paper used stata software to perform regression analysis on water environmental control indicators and per capita watershed development economic index and the significance level of results reached 99 therefore the paper divided the calculation unit data according to the panel threshold regression to solve the problem of heterogeneity to check if the gekc turning point of the panel unit root appears under existing water environmental management the independent variables of e t avp rl sdi and cr were used to construct multivariate auto regression model 3 3 discussion based on the gekc hypothesis this paper used the economic and water environmental data of huntai river watershed from 2003 to 2012 and used the regression model to empirically test the relationship between water environmental pollution and economic activities in order to obtain the net effect of the economic development and water environmental pollution of huntai river watershed this paper skipped the impact factors such as water environmental control technical level and industrial structure and chose to establish a simplified formal equation of water pollution emission economic growth social development level the paper used gekc test method and model to consider the influence and feedback between different calculation units and explored the maintenance strategy of long term equilibrium dynamic relationship between water environmental improvement and economic growth from the perspective of the whole basin to empirically investigate the nonlinear effects of economic growth on water environmental quality improvement cole 2003 revealed the relationship between water environmental quality and the level of economic development put forward the gekc is useful to analyse the interdependence between the economic development and water environmental pollution of huntai river watershed for the panel ekc model shown in table 4 the panel fmols estimation coefficients for y y2 e t avp and msdi are 2 097 0 152 0 726 0 218 0 074 and 1 683 respectively based on the results of the econometric model analysis the per capita pollution of wastewater discharge per capita real gdp elasticity is 2 097 0 304y dc dy α 1 2α 2 y per capita water resource consumption increases by 1 per capita sewage discharge increases by 0 726 the regional trade situation increases by 1 and per capita sewage discharge increases by 0 218 for every 1 increase in the adding value of production per capita sewage discharge increases by 0 074 for every 1 increase in msdi per capita sewage discharge increases by 1 683 the panel dols estimation coefficients for y y2 e t avp and msdi are 2 083 0 149 0 714 0 214 0 069 and 2 117 respectively in the long term the per capita pollution of wastewater discharge per capita real gdp elasticity is 2 083 0 298y dc dy α 1 2α 2 y per capita water resource consumption increases by 1 per capita sewage discharge increases by 0 714 the regional trade situation increases by 1 and per capita pollution wastewater discharge increases by 0 214 for every 1 increase in the adding value of production per capita sewage discharge increases by 0 069 for every 1 increase in msdi per capita wastewater discharge increases by 2 117 the results of the analysis will vary due to different data and index selections different time periods transmission effects of inter regional pollutants and changes in the state s efforts to control the pollution of the huntai river watershed at present the economic development of huntai river watershed is in a steadily rising stage we should reduce the curvature of gekc to realize the rapidly development of eco economic to solve water environmental problems well though economic structure of countries and regional trade situation may be important in some areas but the function display requires a long time series so which only have a certain impact on the simulation results use of econometric methodology scholars have conducted in depth discussions from different angles such as samples inflection points and paths and concluded that the degree of industrialization income level and regional location are different and the gekc curve shape will have a large difference environmental awareness plays an influential role in determining water environmental expenditure chen et al 2019 for the panel gekc model shown in table 5 the panel fmols estimation coefficients for sdi sdi2 e t avp and rl are 1 897 1 025 1 175 0 226 0 066 and 0

1 and per capita gs increases by 0 226 for every 1 increase in the adding value production the per capita gs increases by 0 066 for every 1 increase in rl the per capita gs decreases by 0 015 the panel dols estimation coefficients for sdi sdi2 e t avp and rl are 2 096 1 020 1 125 0 280 0 068 and 0 020 respectively in the long term the per capita gs and sdi elasticity is 2 096 2 040sdi per capita water consumption increases by 1 per capita gs increases by 1 125 the trade exchange degree increases by 1 and per capita gs increases by 0 280 for every 1 increase in the adding value production the per capita gs increases by 0 068 for every 1 increase in rl the per capita gs decreases by 0 020 for ekc the average of the fmols and dols coefficients for y y2 e t avp and msdi are 2 090 0 150 0 720 0 216 0 072 and 1 890 respectively in the long term the elasticity between per capita wastewater discharge and the per capita gdp is 2 090 0 300y per capita water resource consumption increases by 1 per capita sewage discharge increases by approximately 0 720 the regional trade exchange increases by 1 and per capita sewage discharge increases by approximately 0 216 for every 1 increase in the adding value of production per capita wastewater discharge increases by approximately 0 072 for every 1 increase in msdi per capita wastewater discharge increases by approximately 1 890 the ekc regression variables test shows that per capita economic indicator per capita water use drainage trade resources exchange degree and the adding value of production msdi have a greater impact on per capita wastewater discharge in addition ect pass the autocorrelation test at the 1 significance level statistical variables now exhibit the positive effect of regional economic adjustment on the agglomeration of environmental pollution huntai river watershed environmental pollution originates from environmental pollution in neighboring areas and also comes from the sagittal impact of structural differences between regions its specific manifestations are water environmental factors such as water environmental awareness and urbanization which will aggravate water environmental pollution however the space factors of industrial structure and degree of openness which will improve the quality of the water environment the gekc model estimates show that sdi water value trade exchange adding value of production and rl have an impact on per capita gs in addition ect is available at the 1 significance level because all variables now exhibit a smooth change rate to elaborate the relationship between water environmental pollution and economic growth the gekc metrology verification reveals that the convergence of the economic growth path of the huntai river watershed to the coordinated development of the water eco environment and the economy is not spontaneous therefore the government should adopt a systematic regulation and policy to reduce water environmental pressure the gekc equilibrium optimization calculation results can be used to effectively control pollutant emissions and improve water environmental quality for the study of the relationship between water environmental quality and economic growth most scholars have expanded from ekc this paper also used the ekc hypothesis for verification analysis and gradually extended from the ordinary linear regression model to the spatial measurement model with lagging variables the gekc equilibrium optimization calculation results can be used to effectively control pollutant emissions and improve water environmental quality the gekc test model constructed in this paper satisfied the requirements of dynamic equilibrium hypothesis at present most of the research objectives are to verify whether ekc is inverted u shaped and to find many factors affecting water environmental quality ignoring the impact of inter regional economic activity on the formation mechanism of ekc in different regions bruvoll and medin 2003 the existence of gekc has a lot to do with the choice of water environmental indicators the more environmental indicators can represent the real water pollution status the more the relationship with economic growth is in line with the gekc law whether or not readers agree with the idea we hope to have persuaded them of the utility of our addition to the correlation and unit root examination cointegration and causal analysis tricks for thinking about the gekc phenomenon 4 conclusion the objective of this manuscript was to provide a theoretical pattern incorporating the coordinated development concept of economic activities and water environmental improvement using the factors of y t e avp msdi c sed il gs and rl for a panel consisting of 10 control units the period 2003 2012 we used two models to study the equilibrium cost between regional sustainable development and water pollutant emissions the gekc introduced the income independent variable of the original ekc model with the modified socioeconomic development index correlating per capita negative gs sdi per capita water consumption regional trade exchange adding value of production and total pollutant discharge control regulations based on the results of this study the regional water environmental protection status is affected by the level of social and economic development and pollutant discharge water environmental protection is a comprehensive systematic project within the tolerance of water environment capacity it focuses on the study of regional water environmental damage and water consumption regional trade exchange per capita gdp level and total pollutant discharge control constraints and interactions for the gekc model should focus on the impact of economic index and resource consumption starting with the intrinsic influence mechanism that causes the curve to change the potential of water environmental protection is further explored and the

however their effectivity is generally poor in semiarid and semihumid areas because of the complexity of hydrological processes and pollutant transport processes in this paper a pollution load module was combined with the well established hims hydro informatic modelling system model for the purpose of simulating the processes of pollution generation and transport and quantifying the pollution load in semiarid and semihumid areas the model has the advantages of a simple structure and low data requirement and can simulate dissolved and solid phase nitrogen and phosphorus as a demonstration the hims pollution load hims pl model was respectively tested for three semiarid and semihumid basins in china the liuhe and the yixunhe river basins two sub basins of the luanhe river basin and the chaohe river basin model simulations of streamflow and pollution loads at monthly time step accurately matched the observed streamflow with nses 0 77 0 95 and res 0 53 11 24 and pollution load with nses 0 54 0 83 and res 2 45 12 72 for total nitrogen loads and with nses 0 51 0 79 and res 2 22 19 70 for total phosphorus loads in comparison with hspf and gwlf models the hims pl model performed better than the gwlf model in all of the above mentioned basins and better than the hspf model in some of the basins overall the proposed model is generally suitable for simulating streamflow and pollution load in semiarid and semihumid regions keywords watershed model pollution load model hims system semiarid and semihumid area 1 introduction the water pollution issue has become increasingly prominent worldwide shen et al 2012 given that pollutant generation and transport are affected by hydrometeorological factors such as rainfall runoff and infiltration natural geographical factors such as basin landform soil and vegetation and human factors such as social economy and culture pollution is characterized by random and intermittent occurrence complex mechanisms and processes uncertain discharge channels and amounts spatial and temporal variability and difficulties in monitoring and control these characteristics lead to difficulties in accurately simulating the watershed pollution load watershed models are popular tools for predicting watershed pollution loads and for use in management efforts to reduce nutrient and sediment loads watershed process based models study the characteristics of form and intensity of non point source pollutants into surface water and groundwater systems for the basin as research unit and combine hydrological soil erosion and pollutant transport processes to form a relatively complete model system these models describe the internal mechanism of the pollution process and are capable of simulating spatial characteristic distributions there are various physically based models designed to simulate hydrological processes nutrient transport through surface runoff interflow and groundwater flow as well as further in stream nutrient turnover at a small or large scale the creams model knisel 1980 developed by the agricultural research institute of the united states department of agriculture was the first model to systematically simulate the hydrological erosion and pollutant transport processes of non point source pollution subsequently many lumped models such as gleams leone et al 2009 gwlf sha et al 2014 distributed watershed models such as przm adriaanse et al 2017 annagnps zhao and qiu 2012 swat liu et al 2017 swmm kong et al 2017 hspf kim et al 2014 storm singh 1995 answers bouraoui and dillaha 1996 mike she liu et al 2007 and some large watershed management systems such as basins whittemore 1998 emerged the application of these process based watershed scale models to estimate the pollution loads in various basins reservoirs and lakes has recently received a great deal of attention however these models share certain problems that reduce their effectiveness in semiarid and semihumid regions owing to the complexity of watershed hydrological processes and pollution transport processes some of these models e g gwlf agnps creams storm and swat apply the popular scs model to determine amounts of infiltration and surface runoff the scs model is a practical rainfall runoff forecast model while has several disadvantages liu et al 2015a b for example the assumption that the ratio of actual runoff and the maximum potential runoff is equal to the ratio of actual infiltration amount and the maximum possible infiltration quantity is quite subjective and has been questioned maidment 1993 moreover the scs model was developed based on a rain event mainly heavy rain thus the model is best suited to storm runoff estimation rather than small rainfall events in semiarid regions rainfall is low and concentrated and runoff rises up and falls down steeply which will affect the simulation results of these models moreover some models such as gwlf only contain the simulation of surface runoff and underground runoff without interflow calculation in semiarid areas interflow is a key component of the hydrological processes and its lateral flow forms the dry season flow meanwhile interflow has important influence on the output characteristics of nutrients therefore models applied to semiarid and semihumid areas need to contain an interflow simulation module finally complex watershed models such as swat hspf and basins require a large amount of input data however because of the enormous number of parameters and limited available information it is difficult to calibrate and validate these models which restricts their use for large scale regions an increased amount of input data will also lead to the input uncertainty thus reducing the simulation accuracy in china semiarid and semihumid regions account for approximately 52 of the whole land area however the accuracy of european and american models in these areas is not high and the researches of sediment movement and pollution transport does not typically contain sufficient data for precipitation and runoff processes liu et al 2008 thus it is necessary to build a model with a simple structure a low requirement for input data and a suitable mechanism of runoff and pollutant generation specifically for semiarid and semihumid areas the pollutant generation and transport are mainly caused by runoff erosion events driven by precipitation therefore accurate estimation of the hydrological process is the foundation of water quality modelling grayson et al 1999 newham et al 2004 runoff generation in semiarid and semihumid area involves two different mechanisms infiltration excess and saturation excess scoging 1979 gallart et al 1994 taha et al 1997 rainfall runoff modelling of semiarid catchments is a challenging task wheater et al 2007 because of the delicate hydrological balance and different mix of hydrological processes pilgrim et al 1988 the hydro informatic modelling system hims model was developed by liu et al 2006 2008 based on the energy conservation law and water balance equation and includes two runoff mechanisms infiltration excess and saturation excess the model can be applied to hydrological simulations flood frequency analyses and hydraulic engineering design the model has proven very efficient in simulating streamflow for many basins wu et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 shang et al 2014 yang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 jiang et al 2015a b applied the model for streamflow simulation of the luanhe river watershed to indicate its suitability for semiarid and semihumid areas here we present development of a computationally efficient watershed pollution load model which extends the hims model by implementing a pollutant transport module to simulate pollution load we named it the hims pl model the developed model has a relatively simple model structure and modest data input requirement but at the same time is sufficiently complex to provide descriptions of the main watershed hydrology and water quality processes the capabilities of hims pl were demonstrated by conducting simulations for the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins to test its applicability in semiarid and semihumid areas this study had the following three objectives 1 to describe the development of the watershed pollution load model including its hydrological process soil erosion and sediment generating processes and pollution load simulation process 2 to conduct a sensitivity analysis for the input parameters and determine the key parameters of the proposed model and 3 to evaluate the suitability of the present model in semiarid and semihumid basins 2 methods and materials 2 1 model framework we selected the hims model as the framework for this study because of its computational efficient and distributed routing module that has been identified as suitable for semiarid and semihumid basins jiang et al 2015a however the hims model was only designed as a runoff generation scheme and does not include nutrient simulation therefore we extended the hims model to integrate the soil erosion and sediment module and the pollution load simulation module to explicitly represent the rainfall runoff pollutant process the methods for estimating non point source nutrient in streamflow include export coefficient average concentration and chemical simulation methods the expert coefficient method is a mathematical model for calculating the annual average pollution load of a watershed expert coefficients are average annual unit area nutrient loads associated with watershed land uses but cannot determine seasonal loads the chemical simulation method can provide the most complete descriptions of nutrient production transportation and loss but it is data intensive the average concentration method involves a compromise between the empiricism of export coefficient and the complexity of chemical simulation methods according to the synchronous monitoring data of water quantity and water quality in each rainfall runoff process the average concentration of pollutants from non point sources in each rainstorm is calculated first and then the weighted average concentration is obtained by taking the runoff generated by each rainstorm as the weight therefore this approach is applied to estimate non point source nutrient loads in the hims pl model the proposed hims pl model is a distributed parameter model with a simple structure low input data and a suitable mechanism for runoff and pollutant generation it can quickly and efficiently estimate streamflow sediment and nutrient loads from watersheds with varied land use characteristics the model consists of three parts the hydrological cycle the sediment cycle and the nutrient cycle based on topological relationships of channel network and properties of soil vegetation and land use a basin is divided into a set of sub basins runoff sediment and pollution load are first simulated in different land use types of each sub basin and then routed down the channels to the main basin outlet in the sediment module soil erosion is computed using the modified universal soil loss equation and the sediment yield is the product of the erosion and sediment delivery ratio in the nutrient module the average concentration method is used to simulate non point source pollution load the concentrations of sediment and nutrient are assumed to be constant regardless of the channel loss and transformation process the nutrient module can simulate dissolved and solid phase nitrogen and phosphorus the dissolved nutrient loads include the loads migrated in surface runoff from numerous source areas interflow and baseflow and the loads produced by rural life and livestock breeding point source nitrogen and phosphorus are assumed to be dissolved the nutrient loads of impervious areas are assumed to be entirely solid phase the impervious surface mainly refers to urban land use remaining solid phase nutrients are transported in eroded soil from numerous source areas the total nitrogen tn or phosphorus tp output is simply the sum of solid and dissolved nutrients here we describe the calculations for dissolved and solid phase nutrients the hydrological sediment and nutrient cycles of each grid or sub basin in the hims pl model are shown in fig 1 a block diagram of the hims pl model operation is shown in fig 2 2 1 1 hydrological cycle in the hims pl model the hydrological module solves the coupled water and energy balances and evapotranspiration infiltration surface runoff interflow and baseflow liu et al 2006 li and mao 2008 liu et al 2010 two runoff generation mechanisms infiltration excess and saturation excess are considered rainfall exceeding the infiltration capacity modeled using an empirical relationship becomes the infiltration excess flow with the increase of accumulated infiltration amount saturation excess flow occurs according to the runoff generation mechanism and spatial variability of watershed characteristics interflow and groundwater recharge are estimated as linear functions of soil moisture baseflow is simulated based on the linear reservoir assumption nash 1960 in which the relationship between groundwater storage and outflow is linear evapotranspiration is estimated using a conceptual model which is related to soil moisture storage storage capacity and potential evapotranspiration channel routing is achieved by applying the muskingum method to successive subreaches here we briefly describe the calculations for evapotranspiration infiltration surface runoff interflow baseflow groundwater recharge and channel routing the liu infiltration formula liu and wang 1980 is applied to calculate infiltration which can be described as follows 1 f kt r k p t r k where f kt is infiltration mm for source area k on day t and p t is precipitation mm and r k and r k are infiltration parameters for source area k surface runoff r s kt mm for source area k on day

respectively smsc is the maximum value of soil moisture storage capacity mm sm s kt is actual soil moisture storage mm for source area k on day t g w t is groundwater storage mm on day t and l a r c k b and smsc are parameters the hydrological module considers the underlying watershed surface as a whole and evapotranspiration is consumed from soil water potential evapotranspiration e t 0 mm and actual evaporation e t a mm are described as follows 7 e t 0 a r a max l t 17 8 t max t min b 8 e t a k t e t 0 t 1 1 sm s kt smsc ε where a and b are empirical parameters r a max is maximum radiation

water conservation law water moisture storage and groundwater storage are estimated as 9 sm s k t 1 s m s kt f kt r i kt r e c t e t kt 10 g w t 1 g w t r e c t r g t finally the muskingum method franchini and lamberti 1994 is used for flow concentration of river channels the muskingum formula is 11 q out 2 c 1 q in 2 c 2 q in 1 c 3 q out 1 where c 1 c 2 c 3 1 q in 1 and q in 2 are flows into the river at the beginning and end of a time step m3 s 1 respectively q out 1 and q out 2 are flows out of river at the beginning and end of a time step m3 s 1 respectively and c 1 and c 2 are two routing parameters 2 1 2 sediment cycle the sediment module simulates sediment generation and transport process in the hims pl model soil erosion is computed using the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams and berndt 1977 for different land use types the sediment yield is the product of erosion and sediment delivery ratio erosion e k from source area k t is given by 12 e k 11 8 r

k are the standard values for soil erodibility t ha h mj 1 ha 1 mm 1 topographic cover and management and supporting practice factors for the calculation method for each factor refer to williams et al 1983 and hao et al 2006 in the hims pl model the sediment transport amount was simulated using the schneiderman algorithm schneiderman et al 2002 based on two well established empirical relationships the first basic empirical relationship is that long term average annual sediment yield y ann t from a watershed is expressed as a fraction the sediment delivery ratio sdr of long term average annual erosion e ann t in the watershed 13 y ann e ann s d r the second basic empirical relationship is that daily sediment yield y t t is expressed as a fraction p of daily sediment transport capacity t c t of the stream 14 y t p t c t where t c t is calculated as surface runoff r s t to a power 5 3 meyer and wischmeier 1969 t c t r s t 5 3 the long term annual average sediment yield y ann t is then calculated by 15 y ann p tc ann where tc ann is the average annual transport capacity over a long term multi year period combining the above functions the final equation for calculating daily sediment yield y t t is derived by 16 y t e ann s d r t c t tc ann 2 1 3 nutrient cycle the pollution load module can simulate dissolved and solid phase nitrogen and phosphorus the dissolved nutrient loads migrated in surface runoff from numerous source areas interflow and baseflow are obtained using the average concentration method the dissolved nutrient loads produced by rural life and livestock breeding are calculated using the export coefficient method urban nutrient loads are modeled by the mean concentration method remaining solid phase nutrients are transported in eroded soil from numerous source areas which are given by the product of sediment yield and average sediment nutrient concentrations here we describe the calculations for dissolved and solid phase nutrients 2 1 3 1 surface runoff dissolved nutrient load surface runoff dissolved loads of nutrient i are calculated by multiplying surface runoff by dissolved concentrations from numerous source areas 17 l s ikt c s ik r s kt a r k where l s ikt is the dissolved load of nutrient i from source area k on day t kg c s ik is the dissolved concentration of nutrient i from source area k mg l 1 and r s kt is the surface runoff for source area k on day t mm 2 1 3 2 interflow dissolved nutrient load interflow dissolved load of nutrient i is calculated by multiplying interflow by dissolved concentrations from numerous source areas 18 l i ikt c i ik r i kt a r k where l i ikt is the dissolved load of nutrient i from source area k on day t kg c i ik is the dissolved concentration of nutrient i from source area k mg l 1 and r i kt is the interflow for source area k on day t mm 2 1 3 3 baseflow dissolved nutrient load the baseflow dissolved load of nutrient i is calculated by multiplying interflow by dissolved concentrations 19 l g it c g i r g t a r where l g it is the dissolved load of nutrient i on day t mg c g i is the dissolved concentration of nutrient i mg l 1 and r g t is the baseflow on day t mm 2 1 3 4 rural domestic and livestock breeding nutrient load in this module the export coefficient method johnes 1996 is used to calculate the yearly nutrient loads of the two kinds of pollution sources which is then allocated to daily nutrient loads according to the proportion of daily rural runoff accounted of annual runoff rural domestic pollution generally includes rural life sewage rural domestic waste and human feces and urine livestock types include large livestock pigs sheep and poultry for different pollution sources different export coefficient and loss rates into the river are used to calculate the nutrient loads the export coefficient formula is adopted as follows 20 l v i d i j 1 m a j e ij where l v i is loss of nutrient i kg a j is a number of livestock type j or of rural people e ij kg a 1 is the export coefficient of nutrient i for nutrient source j and d i is the loss rate into river of nutrient i in general the number of rural population and livestock can be gained by region statistical yearbook the export coefficient and loss rate into the river can be gained through the literature and general references rainfall and runoff represent the motive force for non point source production especially under the condition of strong rainfall runoff events when a large amount of pollutants are transported into the water therefore according to the daily runoff accounted for the proportion of annual runoff we can allocate the yearly nutrient loads to the daily load the calculation expression is as follows 21 l v it r s t r s a d i j 1 m a j e ij where l v it is the daily loss of nutrient i on day t kg and r s t and r s a are daily rural runoff and yearly rural runoff respectively 2 1 3 5 sediment solid phase nutrient load the sediment solid phase nutrient load ls s it kg of nutrient i on day t is calculated from daily sediment yield y t t and an average sediment nutrient concentration css mg kg 1 22 ls s it 10 6 c s s i y t where cs s i can generally be estimated by the watershed soil nitrogen and phosphorus content and enrichment coefficient 2 1 3 6 urban runoff solid phase nutrient load the urban runoff nutrient load simulation was based on the general accumulation and wash off relationships proposed by amy et al 1974 and sartor and boyd 1972 nutrients accumulate on urban surfaces during dry periods and are washed off by runoff events the exponential accumulation function and the wash off function overton and meadows 1976 are used in the module supposing the urban runoff nutrient load w t is the accumulated nutrient load on impervious surface a r u on day t kg ha 1 then the daily urban runoff load s u it of nutrient i on day t kg is thus given by 23 s u it w it a r u where w t is the first order wash off function suggested by amy et al 1974 24 w t 1 e 1 81 r u t where r u t is the urban runoff on impervious surface a r u on day t which is computed using the runoff coefficient method 2 2 model parameters and input and output data the hims pl model includes three kinds of parameters hydrological parameters sediment parameters and pollutant parameters the description of parameters and the potential range of values are presented in table 1 in which the infiltration coefficient r r and the dissolved concentration cs c i are calibrated respectively according to the different land use type the sediment parameters k l s c p do not require calibration and can be calculated directly according to the underlying surface situation from the source area watershed spatial and attribute data are required to run the hims pl

areal extent the areas of the various rural and urban runoff sources the soil data are necessary for sediment load calculations the attribute data include various meteorological and precipitation data in addition the point source pollution data and numbers of livestock type and of rural people are required for nutrient load calculations daily streamflow monthly sediment and monthly water quality data are required to calibrate the model parameters table 2 summarizes the data employed within the hims pl model table 3 summarizes the major simulation processes for commonly used watershed pollution load models and the hims pl model the hims pl model can estimate daily and monthly streamflow monthly dissolved nitrogen and tn and dissolved phosphorus and tp loads in streamflow in addition the model can provide actual evapotranspiration infiltration surface runoff interflow baseflow groundwater recharge channel routing soil erosion and sediment yield values 2 3 study area and

structure of the model is determined the successful application of model depends on how well the parameters are calibrated most watershed models are highly complex and the number of parameters is large thus calibration may lead to a high computational cost and only produce a local optimal solution therefore it is necessary to conduct a sensitivity analysis of parameters before calibration which can reduce uncertainty and lead to a more satisfactory simulation sensitivity analysis is defined as the study of how uncertainty in model output can be apportioned to different sources of input saltelli et al 2004 global sensitivity analysis especially the morris screening method morris 1991 and the sobol method sobol 1993 have become widely used in recent years shin et al 2013 used the morris and sobol methods to analyze model parameter sensitivities of ihacres gr4j sacramento and simhyd models therefore we applied the morris method with low computational cost to conduct the global sensitivity analysis in the current study consider a model with k independent inputs x i i 1 2 k collectively by the k element row vector x the output f x is a target function of the parameter value x for a given value of x the elementary effect of the i th input factor is defined as 25 d i x f x 1 x 2 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k f x δ where δ is value in 1 p 1 2 p 1 1 1 p 1 and p is the number of levels x x 1 x 2 x i 1 x i x i 1 x k is a random sample in the parameter space so that the transformed point x 1 x 2 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k is still within the parameter space the d i calculation is repeated a number of times r the mean μ and standard deviation σ values of the r samples of d i are used as sensitivity indices by morris 1991 campolongo et al 2007 proposed an improved measure μ in place of μ using the following formulas 26 μ i 1 r j 1 r d x x j 27 σ i 1 r j 1 r d x x j 1 r j 1 r d x x j 2 the μ i and σ i indicate the influence of each parameter on the target function a high μ i value implies that a parameter has an important overall influence on the target function and a high σ i value implies that a parameter has strong interactions with other parameters or that the effect of the parameter is nonlinear van griensven et al 2006 neumann 2012 touhami et al 2013 2 5 model calibration and assessment criteria calibration is used to modify input parameters to a numerical model until the output from the model matches the observed data jiang et al 2015a analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the parameter calibration methods that have become widely used in recent years and proposed a new method to calibrate model parameters master slave swarms a shuffling evolution algorithm based on self adaptive dynamic particle swarm optimization msse sdpso the calibration can be executed via an automatic process and this process continues until a condition is satisfied the termination criterion is determined according to whether the maximum iteration is reached in the current study msse sdpso was used to calibrate the model against observed data to achieve the smallest possible objection function which was defined as the sum of squares of the differences between observed and calculated results including streamflow sediment and nutrient data to avoid the influence of randomicity the calibration took 10 trials and the average of all solutions was selected as the optimal parameter set we firstly calibrated hydrological parameters and then sediment parameters the nutrient parameters were calibrated last a general flowchart for calibration process using msse sdpso for the hims pl hydrological model is presented in fig 5 the data for a 5 year period 1 january 2004 to 31 december 2007 were used for calibration in liuhe river basin for which daily data of

2013 proposed direct and indirect methods for characterizing the performance of environmental models in this study the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the cumulative relative error re given by eqs 28 and 29 were used as error metrics of the hims pl model the range of nse is fro to 1 where 1 indicates a perfect model and the optimal value of nse is expected to be near 1 dawson et al 2007 the re measures the tendency of the simulated output to over predict or under predict relative to the observed data the optimal value of re is expected to be

semiarid and semihumid basins before calibration a sensitivity analysis of parameters was made in this case only sensitivity parameters were calibrated with the other parameters fixed to test the performance of the hims pl model it was compared with the gwlf and hspf models for the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins du et al 2014 used the gwlf model to simulate monthly streamflow and nutrient loads in the liuhe river watershed the calibration period was from 2004 to 2007 and the validation period was from 2008 to 2011 which is consistent with the periods of calibration and validation of this paper the hspf model was used for the yixunhe river basin by wang 2013 in which the calibration period was from 1998 to 2004 and the validation period was from 2005 to 2009 the hspf model was also used for the chaohe river basin by geng et al 2016 in which the calibration period was from 2000 to 2005 and the validation period was from 2006 to 2010 in both cases the calibration period were regularly consistent but the verification period were longer than that of this paper 3 1 sensitivity analysis this study selected the nse as the target function to make parameter sensitivity analysis a typical setting with p 4 δ p 2 p 1 2 3 and r 10 was applied neumann 2012 so a total of n 10 k 1 simulations was required table 4 presents the results of average μ and the associated ranking of the three basins for nse objective function considering the hims pl model parameters in table 1 the morris screening measures can be shown graphically by screening plots which have as the x and y axes the modified means μ and standard deviations σ respectively zhang et al 2013 fig 6 shows the global sensitivity analysis results of the three basins for the parameters of different modules and reveal how strongly an output variable was influenced by the parameters table 4 and fig 6 show that infiltration coefficients r and r evapotranspiration coefficient c and interflow coefficient la in hydrological cycle were the sensitive parameters for all basins in the liuhe river basin the land use mainly includes forest grassland and garden thus the infiltration coefficients for these land uses were sensitive moreover in the yixunhe river and chaohe river basins the land use mainly includes forest grassland and farmland thus the infiltration coefficients for these land uses were sensitive at the same time in the chaohe river basin routing parameters c 1 and c 2 were also sensitive in the nutrient cycling module the parameters cs ci cg and css were all sensitive therefore all of the above sensitivity parameters must be calibrated carefully whereas the insensitive parameters can be fixed 3 2 validation of hydrology simulations the proposed hims pl model was applied to the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins to evaluate the effectiveness of the conceptual framework of the model statistical and visual comparisons of observed and simulated streamflow were performed the daily streamflow hydrograph for these basins in the calibration and validation periods fig 7 indicates that the trends of the observed streamflow hydrograph were satisfactorily simulated by the developed model statistical performance measures for model simulations of daily and monthly streamflow are presented in table 5 alongside the statistics of simulations by the gwlf and hspf models the values indicate good model performance with nses of 0 61 0 74 and res of 2 97 17 34 for daily streamflow and with nses 0 77 0 95 and res 0 53 11 24 for monthly streamflow in both the calibration and validation period for the three basins moriasi et al 2007 except for the simulation of monthly streamflow in the chaohe river basin the hims pl model predictions of streamflow in the liuhe and yixunhe river basins were superior to those of gwlf and hspf models in the calibration and validation periods table 5 also shows that monthly performance measures were better than the daily values a result which can be visualized by the monthly flow hydrographs in fig 8 for the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins and is often observed in hydrological model applications rathjens et al 2015 vema and sudheer 2017 at the same time the simulation accuracy of liuhe river basin was better than that of yixunhe and chaohe river basins in general the non uniform degree is bigger for a larger basin area however a set of model parameters cannot reflect the non uniform degree of variables such as topography soil type land use and climate which reduces the simulation effect the areas of the yixunhe and chaohe river basins are bigger than that of liuhe river basin and the average annual precipitations are less than that of liuhe river basin and thus the model performance was poorer to evaluate model capabilities for simulating the dynamics of streamflow series simulated streamflow was analyzed and correlated with the observed values using a linear regression equation a scatter plot and regression results are shown in fig 9 this figure shows that hims pl model predictions correlated well with observed values giving coefficients of determination r 2 of 0 75 0 638 and 0 716 at the 0 01 significance level for the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins respectively runoff simulation error showed the same regularity in the three basins namely observed data points located above the 1 1 line for small runoff events and streamflow in these basins were overestimated however for large runoff events observed data points located below the 1 1 line and streamflow were underestimated the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins are mountain basins with a large average slope and soil sediment concentration and poor water retention when small rainfall events occur the soil permeability is relatively large and thus little runoff is produced however for rainstorm events the poor soil retention ability produces large surface runoff and interflow leading to rapid production of large streamflow and flood peaks in the basin outlet this may also be driven by the low effectiveness of the simulation of baseflow by the model which affects the saturation level of the soil and the delay in reaching the groundwater 3 3 validation of sediment simulations the comparison of measured and simulated yearly sediment loads for the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins are given in table 6 an positive correlation was observed between yearly sediment loads and average annual streamflow because the influence factors of sediment such as streamflow vegetation coverage dem soil corrosion land use surface slope and soil and water conservation measures are relatively complex the simulation relative error was high however it can be controlled within 55 which is considered to be a satisfactory performance moriasi et al 2007 table 6 shows that the sediment simulation values in most years were lower than the measured values and the sediment simulation effect in years with large runoff was less than that in years with small runoff this is because the heavy rainfall in high flow years causes a considerable difference of the underlying surface parameters such as soil erosion and vegetation cover from those in low flow years but the parameters adopted in the model are averages the model cannot capture the difference between high and low flow years these findings clearly indicate that the accuracy of sediment simulation is lower than that of streamflow there was a strong correlation between sediment and runoff but they were relatively independent for sediment events and runoff events the reasons for the low sediment simulation precision may include model design flaws the accuracy of data and model evaluation method the hims pl model does not consider the sediment yield from baseflow whereas this cannot be ignored in practice in addition the sediment transport in the river network was not considered in further research we should add this transport process to the sediment simulation owing to the limitations of the monitoring method sediment data may contain large errors or mistakes the measurement results for sediment load are greatly influenced by external factors especially heavy rain and river diversions sediment cannot be monitored in the low water period and output of sediment loads was small in the flat water period however in the abundant water period output of sediment loads was large suggesting a large release of sediment into the river especially after a storm if the observation error is bigger in the abundant water period it will lead to a large error in the observation data throughout the whole year simulated monthly sediment loads for the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins are shown in fig 10 the sediment loads of flood season accounted for 75 18 83 48 and 85 97 of the total sediment loads for the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins respectively which conforms to the characteristics of sediment transport in these three basins 3 4 validation of pollution load simulations statistical and visual comparisons of observed and simulated nutrient loads were performed to evaluate performances of the proposed model observed and simulated tn and tp loads for the three basins in the calibration and validation periods are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively statistical performance measures for the model simulations of tn and tp loads are presented in table 7 table 7 also summarized the statistics of simulations by the gwlf and hspf models the values indicate good model performance with nses of 0 54 0 82 and res of 2 45 12 72 for tn loads and nses of 0 51 0 79 and res of 2 22 19 70 for tp loads in both the calibration and validation periods for all the three basins the simulated nutrient loads are consistent with the trend of the observed values comparison with the gwlf and hspf models revealed that except for the simulation of tp in the chaohe river basin hims pl model predictions of tn and tp were superior to those of gwlf and hspf model not only in the calibration period but also in the validation period overall hims pl model predictions of streamflow were superior to those of the gwlf and hspf models the simulation results for tn and tp table 7 reveal that the simulation performance for the liuhe river basin was superior to those for yixunhe and chaohe river basins in both the calibration period and the validation period this is consistent with the simulation results for streamflow which directly affect the simulation results of nutrient loads in addition the performance of tn load simulation was superior to that of tp load simulation other relevant literature also revealed this conclusion li et al 2010 chen et al 2017 for some months in the flood season the peak nutrient simulations were significantly lower than the measured values for all the three basins because the hims pl model is a daily model when short duration and high intensity rainfall events occur the simulations of streamflow sediment loads and pollution loads may be underestimated other daily models such as the swat model also underestimate peak value indicating that this is a disadvantage of the daily model shang et al 2012 the results of this study show that the monthly precision of nutrient simulations was considerably lower than that of streamflow tables 5 and 7 there are many potential causes of low nutrient simulation precision such as errors in the monitoring data system and errors in the model parameter values the accumulation errors of streamflow and sediment simulation will also affect the accuracy of nutrient simulation in general the yield loads of non point source tn and tp from hillslopes should be greater than those of the measured values from the basin outlet this is because dissolved non point source pollutants produced from hillslopes in the process of transport under the action of rainfall erosion are affected by many factors including interception of soil and vegetation biochemical reaction emanation to the atmosphere seepage to groundwater channel deposition and sediment adsorption the combined effect of these factors may indicate that the nutrients do not arrive at the control section of the basin outlet and thereby transport losses of nutrient loads should be considered in the model therefore in further research calculation of the transport process of nutrient pollutants should be included in the nutrient load simulation 4 discussion 4 1 model structure evaluation the output process of pollutants especially non point source pollution has the characteristics of a complex formation process large randomness ambiguous mechanism wide distribution and complex influencing factors the pollution load model is an important tool for quantitative simulation and assessment of pollutants however common watershed models e g swat and the hspf model are complex in structure with a high number of parameters and high requirement for input data which can limit the application of such models especially in a data scarce region as the model structure is considerably complex and the number of model parameters is excessive the uncertainty of model simulation can be expected to increase it is therefore of great importance to balance the complexity of the pollution process and the simplicity of model structure when constructing a watershed pollution load model in this paper we presented the development of the hims pl watershed pollution load model which aimed to improve simulations of streamflow and pollution load in semiarid and semihumid regions the new model provided a considerable boost in model performance for validation watersheds tables 5 and 7 non point source pollution is mainly caused by rainfall runoff driven by rainfall events accurate hydrological simulation is the key to accurate simulation of pollution load the hims model was proposed via analysis of data measured in a number of small experimental watersheds in china liu 1978 liu and wang 1980 it has the advantages of simple structure and low data requirement the hims pl model was created to extend the hims model by implementing a pollutant transport process module to simulate pollution load in the pollution load module the average concentration method and output coefficient method were used to simulate pollution load therefore the proposed hims pl model solves the coupled water and energy balances with a simple model structure and modest data input requirement in comparison with the hspf and gwlf models the hims pl model performed better than the gwlf model in all three basins and better than hspf model in some basins tables 5 and 7 although the structure of the proposed model is simple its simulation effect is as good as or better than complex models 4 2 suitability evaluation the core of the hims model is the infiltration formula the lcm model which contains infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff mechanisms and has good applicability li et al 2014 compared the lcm and scs models and found that scs model is a linear representation of the lcm model it has been used successfully in the yellow river and in the heihe river basin an arid continental basin wu et al 2012 and luanhe river basin a semiarid and semihumid basin jiang et al 2015a moreover the model has been proven very efficient for many humid basins in australia liu et al 2008 the hims pl was developed based on the basis of the hims model although the purpose of this paper was to propose the hims pl model for semi arid and semi humid watersheds it may also be applicable in arid and humid regions which should be determined in future studies the hims pl model should also be validated in more catchments to support a sound conclusion moreover because the model system has only been preliminarily established many details must be considered and researched in the further study to improve this model for example the hims pl model cannot capture the difference between high and low flow years how to solve this problem needs further study meanwhile in further research calculation of the transport process of nutrient pollutants should be included in the nutrient load simulation 4 3 parameter calibration the successful application of a hydrological model depends on how well the parameters are calibrated duan et al 1992 in automatic calibration parameters are adjusted automatically according to a specified search scheme and numerical measures of the goodness of fit madsen 2000 in the literature jiang et al 2015a the value of nse was 0 73 for the yixunhe river basin for daily streamflow in the validation period 2005 2008 however in this paper the value of nse was 0 64 for river in this period the simulation effect of daily streamflow is therefore substantially lower in this paper than in the literature there may be two reasons for this first the calibration period 1995 2004 in the literature is 10 years for the two basins covering all kinds of hydrological years with normal flow wet and dry years normally the more comprehensive the data used to calibrate parameters the better the forecast accuracy secondly the infiltration parameters r and r that need to be calibrated are classified according to land use types in the hims pl model which leads to an increase in the parameter numbers needed to be calibrated in this paper we applied an optimization technique to calibrate parameters automatically the increase of the optimization decision variables will cause a dimension disaster to obtain the optimal parameter values therefore the optimization performance decreased substantially with increase of the variables therefore in further research a better method should be developed for parameter calibration or the test method should be used to obtain key parameters that better conform to the basin characteristics 5 conclusions this study had the following main aims 1 development of a watershed pollution load hims pl model 2 analysis of model parameter sensitivities and 3 suitability of the hims pl model for semiarid and semihumid basins the model has a relatively simple structure and modest data input requirement but was sufficiently able to describe the processes of hydrological sediment and nutrient cycles in all three study basins r r c la cs ci cg and css were the sensitive parameters however in the chaohe river basin c1 and c2 were also sensitive parameters streamflow sediment and nutrients in the three study basins were well simulated by the hims pl model compared with the gwlf and hspf models the hims pl model is therefore suitable for simulating streamflow sediment and pollution load in semiarid and semihumid regions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

6088,modeling pollutant processes in soil and water is helpful to better understand a pollutant s potential adverse impacts on an environmental system there are many watershed pollution load models however their effectivity is generally poor in semiarid and semihumid areas because of the complexity of hydrological processes and pollutant transport processes in this paper a pollution load module was combined with the well established hims hydro informatic modelling system model for the purpose of simulating the processes of pollution generation and transport and quantifying the pollution load in semiarid and semihumid areas the model has the advantages of a simple structure and low data requirement and can simulate dissolved and solid phase nitrogen and phosphorus as a demonstration the hims pollution load hims pl model was respectively tested for three semiarid and semihumid basins in china the liuhe and the yixunhe river basins two sub basins of the luanhe river basin and the chaohe river basin model simulations of streamflow and pollution loads at monthly time step accurately matched the observed streamflow with nses 0 77 0 95 and res 0 53 11 24 and pollution load with nses 0 54 0 83 and res 2 45 12 72 for total nitrogen loads and with nses 0 51 0 79 and res 2 22 19 70 for total phosphorus loads in comparison with hspf and gwlf models the hims pl model performed better than the gwlf model in all of the above mentioned basins and better than the hspf model in some of the basins overall the proposed model is generally suitable for simulating streamflow and pollution load in semiarid and semihumid regions keywords watershed model pollution load model hims system semiarid and semihumid area 1 introduction the water pollution issue has become increasingly prominent worldwide shen et al 2012 given that pollutant generation and transport are affected by hydrometeorological factors such as rainfall runoff and infiltration natural geographical factors such as basin landform soil and vegetation and human factors such as social economy and culture pollution is characterized by random and intermittent occurrence complex mechanisms and processes uncertain discharge channels and amounts spatial and temporal variability and difficulties in monitoring and control these characteristics lead to difficulties in accurately simulating the watershed pollution load watershed models are popular tools for predicting watershed pollution loads and for use in management efforts to reduce nutrient and sediment loads watershed process based models study the characteristics of form and intensity of non point source pollutants into surface water and groundwater systems for the basin as research unit and combine hydrological soil erosion and pollutant transport processes to form a relatively complete model system these models describe the internal mechanism of the pollution process and are capable of simulating spatial characteristic distributions there are various physically based models designed to simulate hydrological processes nutrient transport through surface runoff interflow and groundwater flow as well as further in stream nutrient turnover at a small or large scale the creams model knisel 1980 developed by the agricultural research institute of the united states department of agriculture was the first model to systematically simulate the hydrological erosion and pollutant transport processes of non point source pollution subsequently many lumped models such as gleams leone et al 2009 gwlf sha et al 2014 distributed watershed models such as przm adriaanse et al 2017 annagnps zhao and qiu 2012 swat liu et al 2017 swmm kong et al 2017 hspf kim et al 2014 storm singh 1995 answers bouraoui and dillaha 1996 mike she liu et al 2007 and some large watershed management systems such as basins whittemore 1998 emerged the application of these process based watershed scale models to estimate the pollution loads in various basins reservoirs and lakes has recently received a great deal of attention however these models share certain problems that reduce their effectiveness in semiarid and semihumid regions owing to the complexity of watershed hydrological processes and pollution transport processes some of these models e g gwlf agnps creams storm and swat apply the popular scs model to determine amounts of infiltration and surface runoff the scs model is a practical rainfall runoff forecast model while has several disadvantages liu et al 2015a b for example the assumption that the ratio of actual runoff and the maximum potential runoff is equal to the ratio of actual infiltration amount and the maximum possible infiltration quantity is quite subjective and has been questioned maidment 1993 moreover the scs model was developed based on a rain event mainly heavy rain thus the model is best suited to storm runoff estimation rather than small rainfall events in semiarid regions rainfall is low and concentrated and runoff rises up and falls down steeply which will affect the simulation results of these models moreover some models such as gwlf only contain the simulation of surface runoff and underground runoff without interflow calculation in semiarid areas interflow is a key component of the hydrological processes and its lateral flow forms the dry season flow meanwhile interflow has important influence on the output characteristics of nutrients therefore models applied to semiarid and semihumid areas need to contain an interflow simulation module finally complex watershed models such as swat hspf and basins require a large amount of input data however because of the enormous number of parameters and limited available information it is difficult to calibrate and validate these models which restricts their use for large scale regions an increased amount of input data will also lead to the input uncertainty thus reducing the simulation accuracy in china semiarid and semihumid regions account for approximately 52 of the whole land area however the accuracy of european and american models in these areas is not high and the researches of sediment movement and pollution transport does not typically contain sufficient data for precipitation and runoff processes liu et al 2008 thus it is necessary to build a model with a simple structure a low requirement for input data and a suitable mechanism of runoff and pollutant generation specifically for semiarid and semihumid areas the pollutant generation and transport are mainly caused by runoff erosion events driven by precipitation therefore accurate estimation of the hydrological process is the foundation of water quality modelling grayson et al 1999 newham et al 2004 runoff generation in semiarid and semihumid area involves two different mechanisms infiltration excess and saturation excess scoging 1979 gallart et al 1994 taha et al 1997 rainfall runoff modelling of semiarid catchments is a challenging task wheater et al 2007 because of the delicate hydrological balance and different mix of hydrological processes pilgrim et al 1988 the hydro informatic modelling system hims model was developed by liu et al 2006 2008 based on the energy conservation law and water balance equation and includes two runoff mechanisms infiltration excess and saturation excess the model can be applied to hydrological simulations flood frequency analyses and hydraulic engineering design the model has proven very efficient in simulating streamflow for many basins wu et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 shang et al 2014 yang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 jiang et al 2015a b applied the model for streamflow simulation of the luanhe river watershed to indicate its suitability for semiarid and semihumid areas here we present development of a computationally efficient watershed pollution load model which extends the hims model by implementing a pollutant transport module to simulate pollution load we named it the hims pl model the developed model has a relatively simple model structure and modest data input requirement but at the same time is sufficiently complex to provide descriptions of the main watershed hydrology and water quality processes the capabilities of hims pl were demonstrated by conducting simulations for the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins to test its applicability in semiarid and semihumid areas this study had the following three objectives 1 to describe the development of the watershed pollution load model including its hydrological process soil erosion and sediment generating processes and pollution load simulation process 2 to conduct a sensitivity analysis for the input parameters and determine the key parameters of the proposed model and 3 to evaluate the suitability of the present model in semiarid and semihumid basins 2 methods and materials 2 1 model framework we selected the hims model as the framework for this study because of its computational efficient and distributed routing module that has been identified as suitable for semiarid and semihumid basins jiang et al 2015a however the hims model was only designed as a runoff generation scheme and does not include nutrient simulation therefore we extended the hims model to integrate the soil erosion and sediment module and the pollution load simulation module to explicitly represent the rainfall runoff pollutant process the methods for estimating non point source nutrient in streamflow include export coefficient average concentration and chemical simulation methods the expert coefficient method is a mathematical model for calculating the annual average pollution load of a watershed expert coefficients are average annual unit area nutrient loads associated with watershed land uses but cannot determine seasonal loads the chemical simulation method can provide the most complete descriptions of nutrient production transportation and loss but it is data intensive the average concentration method involves a compromise between the empiricism of export coefficient and the complexity of chemical simulation methods according to the synchronous monitoring data of water quantity and water quality in each rainfall runoff process the average concentration of pollutants from non point sources in each rainstorm is calculated first and then the weighted average concentration is obtained by taking the runoff generated by each rainstorm as the weight therefore this approach is applied to estimate non point source nutrient loads in the hims pl model the proposed hims pl model is a distributed parameter model with a simple structure low input data and a suitable mechanism for runoff and pollutant generation it can quickly and efficiently estimate streamflow sediment and nutrient loads from watersheds with varied land use characteristics the model consists of three parts the hydrological cycle the sediment cycle and the nutrient cycle based on topological relationships of channel network and properties of soil vegetation and land use a basin is divided into a set of sub basins runoff sediment and pollution load are first simulated in different land use types of each sub basin and then routed down the channels to the main basin outlet in the sediment module soil erosion is computed using the modified universal soil loss equation and the sediment yield is the product of the erosion and sediment delivery ratio in the nutrient module the average concentration method is used to simulate non point source pollution load the concentrations of sediment and nutrient are assumed to be constant regardless of the channel loss and transformation process the nutrient module can simulate dissolved and solid phase nitrogen and phosphorus the dissolved nutrient loads include the loads migrated in surface runoff from numerous source areas interflow and baseflow and the loads produced by rural life and livestock breeding point source nitrogen and phosphorus are assumed to be dissolved the nutrient loads of impervious areas are assumed to be entirely solid phase the impervious surface mainly refers to urban land use remaining solid phase nutrients are transported in eroded soil from numerous source areas the total nitrogen tn or phosphorus tp output is simply the sum of solid and dissolved nutrients here we describe the calculations for dissolved and solid phase nutrients the hydrological sediment and nutrient cycles of each grid or sub basin in the hims pl model are shown in fig 1 a block diagram of the hims pl model operation is shown in fig 2 2 1 1 hydrological cycle in the hims pl model the hydrological module solves the coupled water and energy balances and evapotranspiration infiltration surface runoff interflow and baseflow liu et al 2006 li and mao 2008 liu et al 2010 two runoff generation mechanisms infiltration excess and saturation excess are considered rainfall exceeding the infiltration capacity modeled using an empirical relationship becomes the infiltration excess flow with the increase of accumulated infiltration amount saturation excess flow occurs according to the runoff generation mechanism and spatial variability of watershed characteristics interflow and groundwater recharge are estimated as linear functions of soil moisture baseflow is simulated based on the linear reservoir assumption nash 1960 in which the relationship between groundwater storage and outflow is linear evapotranspiration is estimated using a conceptual model which is related to soil moisture storage storage capacity and potential evapotranspiration channel routing is achieved by applying the muskingum method to successive subreaches here we briefly describe the calculations for evapotranspiration infiltration surface runoff interflow baseflow groundwater recharge and channel routing the liu infiltration formula liu and wang 1980 is applied to calculate infiltration which can be described as follows 1 f kt r k p t r k where f kt is infiltration mm for source area k on day t and p t is precipitation mm and r k and r k are infiltration parameters for source area k surface runoff r s kt mm for source area k on day

respectively smsc is the maximum value of soil moisture storage capacity mm sm s kt is actual soil moisture storage mm for source area k on day t g w t is groundwater storage mm on day t and l a r c k b and smsc are parameters the hydrological module considers the underlying watershed surface as a whole and evapotranspiration is consumed from soil water potential evapotranspiration e t 0 mm and actual evaporation e t a mm are described as follows 7 e t 0 a r a max l t 17 8 t max t min b 8 e t a k t e t 0 t 1 1 sm s kt smsc ε where a and b are empirical parameters r a max is maximum radiation

water conservation law water moisture storage and groundwater storage are estimated as 9 sm s k t 1 s m s kt f kt r i kt r e c t e t kt 10 g w t 1 g w t r e c t r g t finally the muskingum method franchini and lamberti 1994 is used for flow concentration of river channels the muskingum formula is 11 q out 2 c 1 q in 2 c 2 q in 1 c 3 q out 1 where c 1 c 2 c 3 1 q in 1 and q in 2 are flows into the river at the beginning and end of a time step m3 s 1 respectively q out 1 and q out 2 are flows out of river at the beginning and end of a time step m3 s 1 respectively and c 1 and c 2 are two routing parameters 2 1 2 sediment cycle the sediment module simulates sediment generation and transport process in the hims pl model soil erosion is computed using the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams and berndt 1977 for different land use types the sediment yield is the product of erosion and sediment delivery ratio erosion e k from source area k t is given by 12 e k 11 8 r

k are the standard values for soil erodibility t ha h mj 1 ha 1 mm 1 topographic cover and management and supporting practice factors for the calculation method for each factor refer to williams et al 1983 and hao et al 2006 in the hims pl model the sediment transport amount was simulated using the schneiderman algorithm schneiderman et al 2002 based on two well established empirical relationships the first basic empirical relationship is that long term average annual sediment yield y ann t from a watershed is expressed as a fraction the sediment delivery ratio sdr of long term average annual erosion e ann t in the watershed 13 y ann e ann s d r the second basic empirical relationship is that daily sediment yield y t t is expressed as a fraction p of daily sediment transport capacity t c t of the stream 14 y t p t c t where t c t is calculated as surface runoff r s t to a power 5 3 meyer and wischmeier 1969 t c t r s t 5 3 the long term annual average sediment yield y ann t is then calculated by 15 y ann p tc ann where tc ann is the average annual transport capacity over a long term multi year period combining the above functions the final equation for calculating daily sediment yield y t t is derived by 16 y t e ann s d r t c t tc ann 2 1 3 nutrient cycle the pollution load module can simulate dissolved and solid phase nitrogen and phosphorus the dissolved nutrient loads migrated in surface runoff from numerous source areas interflow and baseflow are obtained using the average concentration method the dissolved nutrient loads produced by rural life and livestock breeding are calculated using the export coefficient method urban nutrient loads are modeled by the mean concentration method remaining solid phase nutrients are transported in eroded soil from numerous source areas which are given by the product of sediment yield and average sediment nutrient concentrations here we describe the calculations for dissolved and solid phase nutrients 2 1 3 1 surface runoff dissolved nutrient load surface runoff dissolved loads of nutrient i are calculated by multiplying surface runoff by dissolved concentrations from numerous source areas 17 l s ikt c s ik r s kt a r k where l s ikt is the dissolved load of nutrient i from source area k on day t kg c s ik is the dissolved concentration of nutrient i from source area k mg l 1 and r s kt is the surface runoff for source area k on day t mm 2 1 3 2 interflow dissolved nutrient load interflow dissolved load of nutrient i is calculated by multiplying interflow by dissolved concentrations from numerous source areas 18 l i ikt c i ik r i kt a r k where l i ikt is the dissolved load of nutrient i from source area k on day t kg c i ik is the dissolved concentration of nutrient i from source area k mg l 1 and r i kt is the interflow for source area k on day t mm 2 1 3 3 baseflow dissolved nutrient load the baseflow dissolved load of nutrient i is calculated by multiplying interflow by dissolved concentrations 19 l g it c g i r g t a r where l g it is the dissolved load of nutrient i on day t mg c g i is the dissolved concentration of nutrient i mg l 1 and r g t is the baseflow on day t mm 2 1 3 4 rural domestic and livestock breeding nutrient load in this module the export coefficient method johnes 1996 is used to calculate the yearly nutrient loads of the two kinds of pollution sources which is then allocated to daily nutrient loads according to the proportion of daily rural runoff accounted of annual runoff rural domestic pollution generally includes rural life sewage rural domestic waste and human feces and urine livestock types include large livestock pigs sheep and poultry for different pollution sources different export coefficient and loss rates into the river are used to calculate the nutrient loads the export coefficient formula is adopted as follows 20 l v i d i j 1 m a j e ij where l v i is loss of nutrient i kg a j is a number of livestock type j or of rural people e ij kg a 1 is the export coefficient of nutrient i for nutrient source j and d i is the loss rate into river of nutrient i in general the number of rural population and livestock can be gained by region statistical yearbook the export coefficient and loss rate into the river can be gained through the literature and general references rainfall and runoff represent the motive force for non point source production especially under the condition of strong rainfall runoff events when a large amount of pollutants are transported into the water therefore according to the daily runoff accounted for the proportion of annual runoff we can allocate the yearly nutrient loads to the daily load the calculation expression is as follows 21 l v it r s t r s a d i j 1 m a j e ij where l v it is the daily loss of nutrient i on day t kg and r s t and r s a are daily rural runoff and yearly rural runoff respectively 2 1 3 5 sediment solid phase nutrient load the sediment solid phase nutrient load ls s it kg of nutrient i on day t is calculated from daily sediment yield y t t and an average sediment nutrient concentration css mg kg 1 22 ls s it 10 6 c s s i y t where cs s i can generally be estimated by the watershed soil nitrogen and phosphorus content and enrichment coefficient 2 1 3 6 urban runoff solid phase nutrient load the urban runoff nutrient load simulation was based on the general accumulation and wash off relationships proposed by amy et al 1974 and sartor and boyd 1972 nutrients accumulate on urban surfaces during dry periods and are washed off by runoff events the exponential accumulation function and the wash off function overton and meadows 1976 are used in the module supposing the urban runoff nutrient load w t is the accumulated nutrient load on impervious surface a r u on day t kg ha 1 then the daily urban runoff load s u it of nutrient i on day t kg is thus given by 23 s u it w it a r u where w t is the first order wash off function suggested by amy et al 1974 24 w t 1 e 1 81 r u t where r u t is the urban runoff on impervious surface a r u on day t which is computed using the runoff coefficient method 2 2 model parameters and input and output

structure of the model is determined the successful application of model depends on how well the parameters are calibrated most watershed models are highly complex and the number of parameters is large thus calibration may lead to a high computational cost and only produce a local optimal solution therefore it is necessary to conduct a sensitivity analysis of parameters before calibration which can reduce uncertainty and lead to a more satisfactory simulation sensitivity analysis is defined as the study of how uncertainty in model output can be apportioned to different sources of input saltelli et al 2004 global sensitivity analysis especially the morris screening method morris 1991 and the sobol method sobol 1993 have become widely used in recent years shin et al 2013 used the morris and sobol methods to analyze model parameter sensitivities of ihacres gr4j sacramento and simhyd models therefore we applied the morris method with low computational cost to conduct the global sensitivity analysis in the current study consider a model with k independent inputs x i i 1 2 k collectively by the k element row vector x the output f x is a target function of the parameter value x for a given value of x the elementary effect of the i th input factor is defined as 25 d i x f x 1 x 2 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k f x δ where δ is value in 1 p 1 2 p 1 1 1 p 1 and p is the number of levels x x 1 x 2 x i 1 x i x i 1 x k is a random sample in the parameter space so that the transformed point x 1 x 2 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k is still within the parameter space the d i calculation is repeated a number of times r the mean μ and standard deviation σ values of the r samples of d i are used as sensitivity indices by morris 1991 campolongo et al 2007 proposed an improved measure μ in place of μ using the following formulas 26 μ i 1 r j 1 r d x x j 27 σ i 1 r j 1 r d x x j 1 r j 1 r d x x j 2 the μ i and σ i indicate the influence of each parameter on the target function a high μ i value implies that a parameter has an important overall influence on the target function and a high σ i value implies that a parameter has strong interactions with other parameters or that the effect of the parameter is nonlinear van griensven et al 2006 neumann 2012 touhami et al 2013 2 5 model calibration and assessment criteria calibration is used to modify input parameters to a numerical model until the output from the model matches the observed data jiang et al 2015a analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the parameter calibration methods that have become widely used in recent years and proposed a new method to calibrate model parameters master slave swarms a shuffling evolution algorithm based on self adaptive dynamic particle swarm optimization msse sdpso the calibration can be executed via an automatic process and this process continues until a condition is satisfied the termination criterion is determined according to whether the maximum iteration is reached in the current study msse sdpso was used to calibrate the model against observed data to achieve the smallest possible objection function which was defined as the sum of squares of the differences between observed and calculated results including streamflow sediment and nutrient data to avoid the influence of randomicity the calibration took 10 trials and the average of all solutions was selected as the optimal parameter set we firstly calibrated hydrological parameters and then sediment parameters the nutrient parameters were calibrated last a general flowchart for calibration process using msse sdpso for the hims pl hydrological model is presented in fig 5 the data for a 5 year period 1 january 2004 to 31 december 2007 were used for calibration in liuhe river basin for which daily data of precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and catchment streamflow and yearly data for sediment and monthly data for tn and tp were available the data for a 4 year period 1 january 2008 to 31 december 2011 were used for validation in yixunhe river basin the calibration period of the model was set from january 1998 to december 2004 and the validation period was set from january 2005 to december 2008 in the chaohe river basin the calibration period of model was set from january 2000 to december 2005 and the validation period was set from january 2006 to december 2008 bennett et al 2013 proposed direct and indirect methods for characterizing the performance of environmental models in this study the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the cumulative relative error re given by eqs 28 and 29 were used as error metrics of the hims pl model the range of nse is fro to 1 where 1 indicates a perfect model and the optimal value of nse is expected to be near 1 dawson et al 2007 the re measures the tendency of the simulated output to over predict or under predict relative to the observed data the optimal value of re is expected to be near zero for an accurate model simulation moriasi et al 2007 28 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 29 re q obs q sim q obs 100 where qobs i and qsim i are measured and simulated data respectively and n is the number of the time series 3 results and analysis this study mainly aimed to present a watershed pollution load model hims pl to simulate runoff and pollution processes in semiarid and semihumid basins before calibration a sensitivity analysis of parameters was made in this case only sensitivity parameters were calibrated with the other parameters fixed to test the performance of the hims pl model it was compared with the gwlf and hspf models for the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins du et al 2014 used the gwlf model to simulate monthly streamflow and nutrient loads in the liuhe river watershed the calibration period was from 2004 to 2007 and the validation period was from 2008 to 2011 which is consistent with the periods of calibration and validation of this paper the hspf model was used for the yixunhe river basin by wang 2013 in which the calibration period was from 1998 to 2004 and the validation period was from 2005 to 2009 the hspf model was also used for the chaohe river basin by geng et al 2016 in which the calibration period was from 2000 to 2005 and the validation period was from 2006 to 2010 in both cases the calibration period were regularly consistent but the verification period were longer than that of this paper 3 1 sensitivity analysis this study selected the nse as the target function to make parameter sensitivity analysis a typical setting with p 4 δ p 2 p 1 2 3 and r 10 was applied neumann 2012 so a total of n 10 k 1 simulations was required table 4 presents the results of average μ and the associated ranking of the three basins for nse objective function considering the hims pl model parameters in table 1 the morris screening measures can be shown graphically by screening plots which have as the x and y axes the modified means μ and standard deviations σ respectively zhang et al 2013 fig 6 shows the global sensitivity analysis results of the three basins for the parameters of different modules and reveal how strongly an output variable was influenced by the parameters table 4 and fig 6 show that infiltration coefficients r and r evapotranspiration coefficient c and interflow coefficient la in hydrological cycle were the sensitive parameters for all basins in the liuhe river basin the land use mainly includes forest grassland and garden thus the infiltration coefficients for these land uses were sensitive moreover in the yixunhe river and chaohe river basins the land use mainly includes forest grassland and farmland thus the infiltration coefficients for these land uses were sensitive at the same time in the chaohe river basin routing parameters c 1 and c 2 were also sensitive in the nutrient cycling module the parameters cs ci cg and css were all sensitive therefore all of the above sensitivity parameters must be calibrated carefully whereas the insensitive parameters can be fixed 3 2 validation of hydrology simulations the proposed hims pl model was applied to the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins to evaluate the effectiveness of the conceptual framework of the model statistical and visual comparisons of observed and simulated streamflow were performed the daily streamflow hydrograph for these basins in the calibration and validation periods fig 7 indicates that the trends of the observed streamflow hydrograph were satisfactorily simulated by the developed model statistical performance measures for model simulations of daily and monthly streamflow are presented in table 5 alongside the statistics of simulations by the gwlf and hspf models the values indicate good model performance with nses of 0 61 0 74 and res of 2 97 17 34 for daily streamflow and with nses 0 77 0 95 and res 0 53 11 24 for monthly streamflow in both the calibration and validation period for the three basins moriasi et al 2007 except for the simulation of monthly streamflow in the chaohe river basin the hims pl model predictions of streamflow in the liuhe and yixunhe river basins were superior to those of gwlf and hspf models in the calibration and validation periods table 5 also shows that monthly performance measures were better than the daily values a result which can be visualized by the monthly flow hydrographs in fig 8 for the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins and is often observed in hydrological model applications rathjens et al 2015 vema and sudheer 2017 at the same time the simulation accuracy of liuhe river basin was better than that of yixunhe and chaohe river basins in general the non uniform degree is bigger for a larger basin area however a set of model parameters cannot reflect the non uniform degree of variables such as topography soil type land use and climate which reduces the simulation effect the areas of the yixunhe and chaohe river basins are bigger than that of liuhe river basin and the average annual precipitations are less than that of liuhe river basin and thus the model performance was poorer to evaluate model capabilities for simulating the dynamics of streamflow series simulated streamflow was analyzed and correlated with the observed values using a linear regression equation a scatter plot and regression results are shown in fig 9 this figure shows that hims pl model predictions correlated well with observed values giving coefficients of determination r 2 of 0 75 0 638 and 0 716 at the 0 01 significance level for the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins respectively runoff simulation error showed the same regularity in the three basins namely observed data points located above the 1 1 line for small runoff events and streamflow in these basins were overestimated however for large runoff events observed data points located below the 1 1 line and streamflow were underestimated the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins are mountain basins with a large average slope and soil sediment concentration and poor water retention when small rainfall events occur the soil permeability is relatively large and thus little runoff is produced however for rainstorm events the poor soil retention ability produces large surface runoff and interflow leading to rapid production of large streamflow and flood peaks in the basin outlet this may also be driven by the low effectiveness of the simulation of baseflow by the model which affects the saturation level of the soil and the delay in reaching the groundwater 3 3 validation of sediment simulations the comparison of measured and simulated yearly sediment loads for the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins are given in table 6 an positive correlation was observed between yearly sediment loads and average annual streamflow because the influence factors of sediment such as streamflow vegetation coverage dem soil corrosion land use surface slope and soil and water conservation measures are relatively complex the simulation relative error was high however it can be controlled within 55 which is considered to be a satisfactory performance moriasi et al 2007 table 6 shows that the sediment simulation values in most years were lower than the measured values and the sediment simulation effect in years with large runoff was less than that in years with small runoff this is because the heavy rainfall in high flow years causes a considerable difference of the underlying surface parameters such as soil erosion and vegetation cover from those in low flow years but the parameters adopted in the model are averages the model cannot capture the difference between high and low flow years these findings clearly indicate that the accuracy of sediment simulation is lower than that of streamflow there was a strong correlation between sediment and runoff but they were relatively independent for sediment events and runoff events the reasons for the low sediment simulation precision may include model design flaws the accuracy of data and model evaluation method the hims pl model does not consider the sediment yield from baseflow whereas this cannot be ignored in practice in addition the sediment transport in the river network was not considered in further research we should add this transport process to the sediment simulation owing to the limitations of the monitoring method sediment data may contain large errors or mistakes the measurement results for sediment load are greatly influenced by external factors especially heavy rain and river diversions sediment cannot be monitored in the low water period and output of sediment loads was small in the flat water period however in the abundant water period output of sediment loads was large suggesting a large release of sediment into the river especially after a storm if the observation error is bigger in the abundant water period it will lead to a large error in the observation data throughout the whole year simulated monthly sediment loads for the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins are shown in fig 10 the sediment loads of flood season accounted for 75 18 83 48 and 85 97 of the total sediment loads for the liuhe yixunhe and chaohe river basins respectively which conforms to the characteristics of sediment transport in these three basins 3 4 validation of pollution load simulations statistical and visual comparisons of observed and simulated nutrient loads were performed to evaluate performances of the proposed model observed and simulated tn and tp loads for the three basins in the calibration and validation periods are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively statistical performance measures for the model simulations of tn and tp loads are presented in table 7 table 7 also summarized the statistics of simulations by the gwlf and hspf models the values indicate good model performance with nses of 0 54 0 82 and res of 2 45 12 72 for tn loads and nses of 0 51 0 79 and res of 2 22 19 70 for tp loads in both the calibration and validation periods for all the three basins the simulated nutrient loads are consistent with the trend of the observed values comparison with the gwlf and hspf models revealed that except for the simulation of tp in the chaohe river basin hims pl model predictions of tn and tp were superior to those of gwlf and hspf model not only in the calibration period but also in the validation period overall hims pl model predictions of streamflow were superior to those of the gwlf and hspf models the simulation results for tn and tp table 7 reveal that the simulation performance for the liuhe river basin was superior to those for yixunhe and chaohe river basins in both the calibration period and the validation period this is consistent with the simulation results for streamflow which directly affect the simulation results of nutrient loads in addition the performance of tn load simulation was superior to that of tp load simulation other relevant literature also revealed this conclusion li et al 2010 chen et al 2017 for some months in the flood season the peak nutrient simulations were significantly lower than the measured values for all the three basins because the hims pl model is a daily model when short duration and high intensity rainfall events occur the simulations of streamflow sediment loads and pollution loads may be underestimated other daily models such as the swat model also underestimate peak value indicating that this is a disadvantage of the daily model shang et al 2012 the results of this study show that the monthly precision of nutrient simulations was considerably lower than that of streamflow tables 5 and 7 there are many potential causes of low nutrient simulation precision such as errors in the monitoring data system and errors in the model parameter values the accumulation errors of streamflow and sediment simulation will also affect the accuracy of nutrient simulation in general the yield loads of non point source tn and tp from hillslopes should be greater than those of the measured values from the basin outlet this is because dissolved non point source pollutants produced from hillslopes in the process of transport under the action of rainfall erosion are affected by many factors including interception of soil and vegetation biochemical reaction emanation to the atmosphere seepage to groundwater channel deposition and sediment adsorption the combined effect of these factors may indicate that the nutrients do not arrive at the control section of the basin outlet and thereby transport losses of nutrient loads should be considered in the model therefore in further research calculation of the transport process of nutrient pollutants should be included in the nutrient load simulation 4 discussion 4 1 model structure evaluation the output process of pollutants especially non point source pollution has the characteristics of a complex formation process large randomness ambiguous mechanism wide distribution and complex influencing factors the pollution load model is an important tool for quantitative simulation and assessment of pollutants however common watershed models e g swat and the hspf model are complex in structure with a high number of parameters and high requirement for input data which can limit the application of such models especially in a data scarce region as the model structure is considerably complex and the number of model parameters is excessive the uncertainty of model simulation can be expected to increase it is therefore of great importance to balance the complexity of the pollution process and the simplicity of model structure when constructing a watershed pollution load model in this paper we presented the development of the hims pl watershed pollution load model which aimed to improve simulations of streamflow and pollution load in semiarid and semihumid regions the new model provided a considerable boost in model performance for validation watersheds tables 5 and 7 non point source pollution is mainly caused by rainfall runoff driven by rainfall events accurate hydrological simulation is the key to accurate simulation of pollution load the hims model was proposed via analysis of data measured in a number of small experimental watersheds in china liu 1978 liu and wang 1980 it has the advantages of simple structure and low data requirement the hims pl model was created to extend the hims model by implementing a pollutant transport process module to simulate pollution load in the pollution load module the average concentration method and output coefficient method were used to simulate pollution load therefore the proposed hims pl model solves the coupled water and energy balances with a simple model structure and modest data input requirement in comparison with the hspf and gwlf models the hims pl model performed better than the gwlf model in all three basins and better than hspf model in some basins tables 5 and 7 although the structure of the proposed model is simple its simulation effect is as good as or better than complex models 4 2 suitability evaluation the core of the hims model is the infiltration formula the lcm model which contains infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff mechanisms and has good applicability li et al 2014 compared the lcm and scs models and found that scs model is a linear representation of the lcm model it has been used successfully in the yellow river and in the heihe river basin an arid continental basin wu et al 2012 and luanhe river basin a semiarid and semihumid basin jiang et al 2015a moreover the model has been proven very efficient for many humid basins in australia liu et al 2008 the hims pl was developed based on the basis of the hims model although the purpose of this paper was to propose the hims pl model for semi arid and semi humid watersheds it may also be applicable in arid and humid regions which should be determined in future studies the hims pl model should also be validated in more catchments to support a sound conclusion moreover because the model system has only been preliminarily established many details must be considered and researched in the further study to improve this model for example the hims pl model cannot capture the difference between high and low flow years how to solve this problem needs further study meanwhile in further research calculation of the transport process of nutrient pollutants should be included in the nutrient load simulation 4 3 parameter calibration the successful application of a hydrological model depends on how well the parameters are calibrated duan et al 1992 in automatic calibration parameters are adjusted automatically according to a specified search scheme and numerical measures of the goodness of fit madsen 2000 in the literature jiang et al 2015a the value of nse was 0 73 for the yixunhe river basin for daily streamflow in the validation period 2005 2008 however in this paper the value of nse was 0 64 for river in this period the simulation effect of daily streamflow is therefore substantially lower in this paper than in the literature there may be two reasons for this first the calibration period 1995 2004 in the literature is 10 years for the two basins covering all kinds of hydrological years with normal flow wet and dry years normally the more comprehensive the data used to calibrate parameters the better the forecast accuracy secondly the infiltration parameters r and r that need to be calibrated are classified according to land use types in the hims pl model which leads to an increase in the parameter numbers needed to be calibrated in this paper we applied an optimization technique to calibrate parameters automatically the increase of the optimization decision variables will cause a dimension disaster to obtain the optimal parameter values therefore the optimization performance decreased substantially with increase of the variables therefore in further research a better method should be developed for parameter calibration or the test method should be used to obtain key parameters that better conform to the basin characteristics 5 conclusions this study had the following main aims 1 development of a watershed pollution load hims pl model 2 analysis of model parameter sensitivities and 3 suitability of the hims pl model for semiarid and semihumid basins the model has a relatively simple structure and modest data input requirement but was sufficiently able to describe the processes of hydrological sediment and nutrient cycles in all three study basins r r c la cs ci cg and css were the sensitive parameters however in the chaohe river basin c1 and c2 were also sensitive parameters streamflow sediment and nutrients in the three study basins were well simulated by the hims pl model compared with the gwlf and hspf models the hims pl model is therefore suitable for simulating streamflow sediment and pollution load in semiarid and semihumid regions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

6089,satellite rainfall estimates sres can provide rainfall information at finer spatial and temporal resolutions however their performance varies with respect to gauged precipitation data in different climatic regions a limited number of studies investigated the performance of sres for spatio temporal regional drought analysis which is a key component for developing tools for regional drought planning and management in this study the performance of two recent sres data length 30 years which includes artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr and the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep are selected for spatio temporal drought assessment over different climatic regions located in iran firstly the accuracy of sres was evaluated for deriving standardized precipitation index spi at different time scales 1 3 6 9 and 12 months for four climatic regions during the period of 1983 2012 secondly the performance of sres was evaluated for regional drought assessment based on the concept of the severity areal frequency saf curves it was observed that the performance of sres can be different with respect to gauge data in terms of quantifying drought characteristics e g severity duration and frequency identification of major historical droughts and a significant difference can be observed based on the saf analysis for example the number of drought events based on shorter time scales spi 1 and 3 found to be greater for sres in comparison to gauge information for all climatic regions while investigating the major historical droughts discrepancies can be observed between these two types of data sets for example gauge data suggests wetness i e spi 3 0 5 near southern iran whereas sres show droughts spi 1 0 in the same spatial domain the performance of sres with respect to gauge data varies largely in terms of quantifying the frequency component embedded in the saf curves for selected climatic regions located in iran our research findings can be useful for drought assessment in ungagged basins as well as to develop regional drought management plans to improve water security by integrating multivariate nature of drought events keywords regional drought assessment satellite rainfall estimates sres severity area frequency saf curves 1 introduction droughts are triggered by reduction in the amount of precipitation over an extended period of time e g season year additional variables such as temperatures low relative humidity and distribution of rainy days play a significant role in the occurrence of droughts mishra and singh 2010 the drought events are quantified based on different types of drought indices derived based on a combination of precipitation temperature and soil moisture deficits the drought indices considered to be a prime variable for monitoring and assessing the impact of drought as well as to characterize the droughts based on their intensity duration severity and spatial extent typically a longer time series 30 years of hydro climatic variables are required for deriving drought indices to quantify the drought for different time scales e g month to season mishra and singh 2010 these drought indices are generally normalized with respect to a long term climatology which allows the results to be compared at different locations over different climatic regimes mckee et al 1993 mishra and singh 2010 sahoo et al 2015 the most commonly used meteorological drought indices are the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 an overview of different drought indices along with their strength and weakness are discussed in heim 2002 and mishra and singh 2010 drought events are multivariate in nature and they can be better quantified by integrating duration severity area and frequency based on the concept of spatio temporal analysis or in other words regional drought analysis mishra and singh 2009

frequency curves alegria and watkin 2007 severity area duration sad curves anderias et al 2005 and spatial and temporal variability of droughts shin and salas 2000 using this severity area frequency saf curves several studies investigated the regional droughts using spi based on gauged precipitation kim et al 2002 loukas and vasiliades 2004 mishra and desai 2005 mishra and singh 2008 bonaccroso et al 2015 cai et al 2015 the information on regional droughts is critical for short as well as long term water resources management therefore there is a need for further research on the regional or spatial behavior of droughts rossi et al 1992 panu and sharma 2002 mishra and singh 2011 bonaccorso et al 2015 especially for data scarce regions mishra and singh 2011 one of the major limitations of regional drought analysis is lack of high quality rainfall data to capture adequate spatial and temporal coverage mishra and singh 2011 the long term historical time series of precipitation data are often limited in many developing countries in addition establishing a gauge station can be expensive as well as difficult task in inaccessible regions such as deserts and mountains on the other hand satellite datasets can be reliable alternative sources for drought assessments in un gauged basins with the availability of comparatively long term up to 30 years satellite rainfall estimators sres products such as persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 and mswep beck et al 2016 it is now possible to investigate whether these products can capture the regional drought information accurately the performance of sres for estimating the rainfall are widely investigated in different part of the world alijanian et al 2017 dinku et al 2009 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 guo et al 2016 lockhoff et al 2014 nastos et al 2016 salio et al 2015 smith et al 2006 tian et al 2009 and relatively a few studies on drought assessment sahoo et al 2015 guo et al 2016b for instance zambrano et al 2017 evaluated the performances of persiann cdr 1983 2015 and chirps 2 0 1981 2015 for deriving spis and compared with indices from in situ rainfall stations over chile they found that sres can perform well for deriving spis for time scales of 1 3 and 6 months to date the performance sres were evaluated with respect to the ground based rain gauge data for multiple hydro climate related studies such as extreme event analysis streamflow simulation using hydrologic models crop yield simulations data assimilation and water quality assessment even though a number of studies evaluated the performance of sre s for grid gauged based temporal drought analysis a limited number of studies evaluated the spatio temporal drought analysis which is a key component for developing tools for regional drought planning and management however to the best of our knowledge we are not aware of any prior studies that used sres for regional drought analysis specifically using drought saf curves therefore it is important to quantitatively investigate the performance of sre s relative to the gauge based precipitation data sets the overall objectives of this study are a to evaluate the performance of sres persiann cdr and mswep for regional drought analysis for iran using a 30 year time period 1983 2012 b to investigate and compare the saf curves generated by sres and gauge datasets in eight different climatic zones in iran and c to compare the performance of sres in quantifying spatio temporal pattern of four major historical severe drought events over the climatic regions based on drought saf curves the remaining structure of the paper is organized as follows methodology is provided in section 2 study area and the data sets used in this study are discussed in section 3 results are discussed in section 4 and the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 standardized precipitation index the drought indices are used as proxy to quantify a drought event in terms of their intensity duration severity as well as spatial extent mishra and singh 2010 various drought indices have been derived in recent decades in this study spi hayes et al 1999 mckee et al 1993 was selected due to its advantages such as a spi can be derived based on rainfall alone so sres can be used for drought assessment without considering other meteorological data and b its variable timescale allows describing drought conditions for a range of meteorological hydrological and agricultural applications the standardization of spi ensures that the frequencies of extreme events are consistent independent of space and time table 1 shows drought severity classification using spi hayes et al 1999 spi is computed using following steps guttman 1998 a identify a suitable probability density function that describes the long term time series of rainfall b depending on the timescale of interest select the base time of rainfall observation series for example running time series of total rainfall corresponding to 1 3 and 6 months were used to generate corresponding spi 1 spi 3 and spi 6 respectively c fit the cumulative probability to the precipitation time series generated for different time scales and d the inverse normal gaussian function zero mean and variance equals to one is then applied to the cumulative probability distribution function to generate spi time series in this study kolmogorov smirnov test k s test was used to select the best probability density function among normal log normal gamma ev i and ev iii functions for each pixel based on prior studies reddy and ganguli 2011 chen et al 2011 kwak et al 2012 chen et al 2013 and our analysis both gamma and ev iii distribution were identified as the most acceptable distributions for all the pixels 2643 pixels over the country 2 2 severity area frequency saf curves the spatio temporal regional characterization of drought events can be improved by integrating frequency with severity duration and the percentage of area influenced by droughts this concept was previously applied to derive drought severity area frequency saf curves using observed rainfall data mishra and desai 2005 mishra and singh 2008 however there are no prior studies that investigated the performance of sres for analysis of spatio temporal patterns of extreme drought events the steps used for deriving saf curves to investigate the regional drought patterns for different climatic regions of iran is provided in fig 1 and they are briefly described in the following section 1 the study area was divided in to pixels similar to the spatial resolution available for the sres 0 25 0 25 the inverse distance weighting idw loukas and vasiliades 2004 mishra and desai 2005 bonaccorso et al 2015 and cai et al 2015 approach was applied to interpolate monthly observed in situ rainfall values spatially at the center of sres pixels in order to compare regional droughts based on these two types of data in situ and sres the concept of idw eq 1 is based on the assumption that the attribute value of an un sampled location is the weighted average of known values within its neighborhood and the weights are inversely related to the distances between the prediction location and the sampled locations lu and wong 2008 1 λ i 1 d i p j 1 n 1 d j p where λi is the weight of valued point i with distance di from the unvalued point the number of valued points utilized during the interpolation process is shown by n the power for p is typically equal to 2 that represent the inverse distance squared method garcia et al 2008 2 after interpolating the observed precipitation data for each pixel the spi time series for each pixel are calculated for different time scales 1 3 6 9 and 12 months that results in spi 1 spi 3 spi 6 spi 9 and spi 12 respectively both observed precipitation and sres datasets are used to construct spis at selected temporal scale 3 the annual drought severity is calculated for each pixel using theory of run sum of spis 1 within a given year these annual drought severities are used for frequency analysis based on different return periods in our case 30 annual drought severity values 1983 2012 were obtained for each spi time series and used for the frequency analysis in this regard the drought severity values were fitted with normal log normal gamma extreme value type 1 ev i or gumbel and extreme value type 3 ev iii or weibull probability distributions for both sres and in situ datasets the standard k s test was used at 5 significance level to find the best distribution for different climatic zones and for each spi timescale in case of in situ datasets it was observed that gamma and weibull ev iii distributions performed well for most of the pixels weibull ev iii distribution reflected slightly better accuracies in comparison to gamma distribution and it is also recommended for drought frequency analysis chow et al 1988 a similar result was found when sres data were utilized for frequency analysis 4 the areal thresholds are calculated based on the percentage of area affected by droughts of different severity it is expected that the areal thresholds will be different based on the spi s for different time scales 5 the best probability density function weibull distribution is selected to conduct the frequency analysis of annual drought severity for each pixel in this study the frequency analysis of annual drought severity was carried out using 5 10 25 and 50 year return periods 6 perform the frequency analysis using the selected probability distribution for drought severity of different areal extents to associate drought severity with respect to different return periods finally the drought severity area frequency saf curves was constructed for the watershed under consideration 3 study area and data 3 1 study area iran the oldest civilization in the middle east is located between 25 40 eastern latitude and 43 5 63 5 northern longitude the caspian sea is located on the north and both persian gulf and oman sea lies on the southern boundaries fig 2 the two major mountain ranges zagros mountains with the highest altitude of 3500 m and alborz mountains with altitudes 5600 m are located along its western and northern borders respectively in addition to that mediterranean low pressure system entering from the west siberian high pressure system siberian high dropping from the north and sudan tropical low pressure sudan low flowing in from southeastern boundaries impact on iran s climatic conditions golestani et al 2000 because of the various features and climatic conditions iran may be a suitable case study to evaluate the performance of sres for regional drought analysis for instance the highest monthly rainfall is observed along zagros mountains on the west and the shores of northern sea caspian sea during the months of december to april in addition the average temperature along both western and northern mountains are less than 2 c between december to april razeie 2017 fick and hijmans 2017 for the rest of the year may to october the precipitation is expected mostly on the northern part of the country while the temperature is commonly high over most parts of the country razeie 2017 fick and hijmans 2017 overall iran is spatially divided into eight climatic zones fig 2 right kasmaiee 1992 the northern region between alborz mountains and caspian sea are classified as moderate rainy and semi moderate rainy climate with a mean annual rainfall of 800 1400 mm the southern shores of the country witness very hot and humid climate mainly influenced by persian gulf and oman sea air flows the aridity increases from the shoreline toward interior part of the country leading to very hot dry and hot dry climatic regions next to the shoreline climate two major deserts dasht e lut and dasht e kavir are located in semi arid regions in central part of iran the other two regions cold and very cold regions are mainly located along the mountains using koppen geuger classification raziei 2017 table 2 iran is classified into four major climatic types arid steppe bs arid dessert bw cold areas with dry summer ds and temperate c by combining these two types of classification iran can be grouped into four climatic regions a zone 1 2 arid steppe b zone 3 4 arid desert condition c zone 5 6 located along the mountains and is generally classified as cold areas with dry summer and d zone 7 8 located in northern iran near caspian sea witness temperate climatic condition in our study we selected these four types of climate groups the evaluation the performance of sres for spatio temporal drought assessment 3 2 satellite rainfall estimates sres datasets long term data at least 30 year is preferred for spatio temporal drought analysis mishra and singh 2011 although more than ten satellite rainfall products liu et al 2011 are available few of them have a longer dataset the longer datasets are available for persiann cdr and mswep since 1983 and 1979 respectively in this research we selected two sres persiann cdr and mswep for spatio temporal drought analysis and compare its performance with in situ gauge data based on our prior study alijanian et al 2017 these two sres comparatively performed well in capturing the observed precipitation pattern for iran for example the correlation coefficients of 0 82 and 0 72 was observed for persiann cdr and mswep rainfall products with respect to in situ data located in south and southwest shores of persian gulf regions that witness very hot and humid climate persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 is obtained from the national climatic data center ncdc climate data record cdr program of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa this dataset is a multi satellite high resolution precipitation product that provides daily precipitation estimates at 0 25 spatial resolution since 1983 the model is based on persiann algorithm sorooshian et al 2000 using ir satellite data from global geosynchronous satellites as the primary source of precipitation information to calibrate persiann the model is pre trained using the national centers for environmental prediction ncep stage iv hourly precipitation data then the model is run for gridsat b1 ir data knapp 2008 the estimates are then adjusted using the gpcp monthly 2 5 precipitation products for bias reduction ashouri et al 2015 mswep is a new product beck et al 2016 which merges available gauge satellite and reanalysis data with a 3 hourly and 0 25 global gridded precipitation dataset covering 1979 present the long term mean of mswep is based on the recently released climate hazards group precipitation climatology chpclim dataset funk et al 2015 which is derived based on both gauge observations and satellite data the bias correction is introduced using catchment average precipitation from stream flow observations at 13 762 stations over the globe the temporal variability of mswep is determined by weighted average of precipitation anomalies from seven datasets two based on interpolation of gauge observations cpc unified and gpcc three on satellite remote sensing cmorph gsmap mvk and 3b42rt and two on atmospheric model reanalysis era interim and jra 55 both sres datasets persiann cdr and mswep have the similar spatial resolution of a quarter degree with matching grid cells the entire area of iran is divided into 2643 quarter degree pixels based on sres spatial resolution with the number of pixels 510 1142 913 and 78 are located in climatic zones of 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 8 respectively the spis of different time scales are calculated for each pixel based on the observed and sres precipitation time series for the period of 1983 2012 3 3 in situ gauge data in situ rain gauge data are collected from two different sources a six hourly data available from synoptic gauge network data center managed by iran meteorological organization and b daily rainfall data available by ministry of energy the number of operating gauges varies from 421 at 1983 to 2541 at 2012 gauges with missing data unrecorded are removed from the dataset table 3 shows number of operating gauges gauges with missing data and gauges with complete dataset over iran and its climatic zones during the study period 1983 2012 in addition the spatial distribution of gauges over iran and its climatic zones are illustrated in fig 3 based on table 3 and fig 3 the number of gauges after the year of 2000 increased over the climatic regions showing almost one gauge for every two pixels generally more number of gauges are available over the mountainous areas zone 5 6 and the ratio of number of gauges to number of pixels increased from 0 13 1983 to 0 51 1994 and later to 1 14 after 2000 table 3 and fig 3 the inverse distance weighting idw method was used to interpolate the observed precipitation at the center of each sres pixel utilizing gauges datasets further the rainfall data may have lost their homogeneity properties due to source of errors coming from various sources the double mass curve analysis dmca technique was widely used for detecting and correcting inconsistent precipitation data linsley et al 1982 singh 1994 ponce 2014 the consistency of rainfall data is made by comparing data for a single station with that of a pattern composed of the data from several other stations in the area before estimating the precipitation at the center of each pixel based on neighboring gauges i e 10 nearest gauges dmca was carried out and incompatible gauges were corrected based on eq 2 2 p c p m c m a where p represents the original inconsistency dataset mc is the corrected slope for the double mass curve ma is the slope for the inconsistency data records and pc is the corrected precipitation dataset singh 1994 4 results and discussions 4 1 temporal and spatial distribution of droughts the spis of different time scales were used to investigate the temporal and spatial distribution of drought the spi 1 spi 3 spi 6 spi 9 and spi 12 time series were calculated based on gauge in situ persiann cdr and mswep datasets over iran during the study period of 1983 2012 fig 4 the temporal pattern of spis based on these three datasets behaves similar and generally close to each other however the temporal pattern for mswep data seems slightly closer to the gauge measurements especially for spi 9 and spi 12 fig 4 d and 4 e a moderate to higher drought severity period can be defined when the magnitude of spi remains below a threshold of 1 0 mishra and desai 2005 applying this definition the number of drought periods events their duration months and number of drought months while spi 1 0 for all three datasets are shown in table 4 it was observed that number of drought events based on shorter spi time scales spi 1 and spi 3 is generally greater for sres than those based on observed data for all climatic regions this is more apparent for persiann cdr which may be due to underestimation of rainfall over study area alijanian et al 2017 however for longer spi time scales 6 months the observed drought events based on sres matches well with gauge information table 4 as shown in fig 4 and table 4 when the spi timescales increase from 1 to 12 the number of drought months generally increase and the number of drought events decrease for all datasets and the maximum drought duration increases as well for example in the case of gauge observations when the spi timescale increases from 1 to 12 months the maximum drought duration increases over climatic zones a 4 to 59 months over zone 1 2 hot and humid regions close to persian gulf and b 6 to 28 months over zone 3 4 hot and dry regions at the center of the country the performance of sres for drought characterization varies with respect to climatic pattern the number of drought events based on both sres over climatic zone 1 2 decreases from 18 to 6 months for spi 1 to spi 12 while the corresponding drought events based on gauge information vary from 9 to 6 table 4 in addition for shorter spi timescales spi 1 and spi 3 the maximum duration of drought based on sres are closer to the ones shown by gauge data for example the maximum drought duration for spi 3 is 11 months for sres and 8 months for the gauge datasets however in the case of longer spi timescales i e spi 12 the maximum drought durations vary and the maximum drought duration found to be 59 40 and 46 months based on gauge persiann cdr and mswep data sets respectively it was observed that the sres able to perform well in capturing the drought durations at shorter spi timescales however for the number of drought events sres perform better at longer spi timescales and no particular trend was observed in terms of total number of drought months the average drought duration based on the three rainfall datasets for central part of iran zone 3 4 are almost similar to climatic zone 1 2 based on all spis except spi 12 the average drought duration for spi 12 vary widely with 10 67 11 4 and 7 8 months for gauge persian cdr and mswep respectively for zone 3 4 over mountainous areas with cold climatic conditions zone 5 6 the average drought duration for spis with short timescales 12 months are typically less than 4 83 months however the drought durations for spi 12 seems to be longer and differs among datasets with 10 5 12 33 and 10 months for gauge persiann cdr and mswep respectively while for the climatic zone 7 8 moderate and rainy located in northern part of iran shores of caspian sea similar average drought duration 4 45 was observed for all spis less than 12 months however only one drought was detected for spi 12 by gauge data which continues for 25 months while persiann cdr and mswep data indicated 4 and 6 drought events with average duration of 13 25 and 10 months respectively the performance of sres for drought assessment with respect to gauge data is further assessed using statistical criteria such as correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse for different spis over iran and its various climatic zones table 5 as shown mswep data generally reflects better ccs compared to persiann cdr for all spis over iran and its climatic regions among the spis best ccs are associated with spi 3 and spi 6 for all climatic regions ranging from 0 43 zone 7 8 to 0 88 zone 1 2 also rmse for mswep is generally less in comparison to persiann cdr reflecting a better accuracy for mswep in drought assessments comparing spis for different timescales it was observed that shorter timescales 6 months show higher ccs and lower rmses resulting in better assessments across the country and sres the average annual spi spi 3 and spi 6 values are further compared between sres and gauge data for climatic zones for the study period of 1983 2012 fig 5 generally the yearly averaged spis for sres matched well with gauge data at higher values of both positive and negative spis this indicates that sres may accurately assess the droughts as well as wet spells it was also observed that the sres based drought indicators can be able to identify four most severe drought events during 1985 1990 2000 and 2008 fig 5 the spatial distributions of drought based on spi 3 for severe drought years 1985 1990 2000 and 2008 are illustrated in fig 6 both sres persiann cdr and mswep performed comparatively well in capturing the drought during 1985 however the difference was noticed between sres and in situ gauge datasets for zone 1 2 for example gauge data suggests wetness i e spi 3 0 5 near southern iran whereas sres show droughts spi 1 0 in the same spatial domain in addition this issue was observed in mountain regions of northwestern iran the severe droughts during 1990 that spread across northern part of iran were not captured by sres similarly the spatial droughts observed in central part of iran during 2000 were not captured by sres although the sres nearly detect the spatial distribution of drought in dryer regions zones 1 to 4 both sres indicated wet spells during 2008 whereas the observed data indicated droughts in several parts of iran 4 2 spatio temporal drought analysis using saf curves 4 2 1 comparison between sres and gauge data the performance of sres was investigated to study regional droughts using saf curves by quantitatively connecting severity area and frequency using return periods of 10 50 100 years for illustration purpose we derived saf curves based on spi 3 as short term drought and spi 12 long term drought using sres and gauge datasets for climatic regions of iran figs 7 and 8 where x and y axes represent percentage of area affected by drought and annual drought severity sum of negative spi values in dry spells with different return period respectively for spi 3 saf curves based on both sres datasets match well with frequency curves related to gauge data over the southern part of the country zone 1 2 where the low magnitude droughts affected more than 50 of the region fig 7 a over the central part of iran located in semi arid regions zone 3 4 and the mountains regions zone 5 6 the saf curves derived based on sres matches well with gauges data especially for droughts with lower return periods fig 7 b and 7 c over the moderate region located on shores of caspian sea zone 7 8 the saf curves of sres do not matches to each other and the frequency curve remains below the observed data for example all the sres frequency curves based on the return period of 50 and 100 year are illustrated between the saf curves for gauge data with return periods of 10 and 50 year for example all sres curves with the return period of 50 and 100 year are illustrated between the saf curves for gauge data with return periods of 10 and 50 year this result show that short term droughts durations less than 3 months with low severity annual spi values around 6 often return periods of 10 years occur over iran the difference among drought severity was observed for zone 1 2 based on 50 and 100 year return period between observed and sres data fig 7 a for example the drought severity based on observed data varies between 6 and 22 whereas it is between 8 and 18 for sres products based on 100 year return period similarly in this region over more than 40 percent of the area the drought severity was higher for sres data persiann cdr and mswep compared to observed data at all frequencies fig 7 a in contrast both the severity and the percentage of area affected by drought at different return periods matches well between observed and two sres products for climate zone 3 4 fig 7 b however for lower return period comparatively better performance was observed by sres products fig 7 b similar pattern was observed for other climatic regions zone5 6 and zone7 8 fig 7 c and 9 d respectively where the observed data typically has higher magnitude across whole spatial area specifically at higher return periods compared to sres products fig 8 illustrates saf curves for long term droughts spi 12 over iran s climatic regions overall a wide variation in terms of drought severity was found between observed data and sres datasets persiann cdr and mswep especially for regions with less aridity mountains and the northerner areas zone 5 6 and zone 7 8 fig 8 c and 8 d respectively interestingly at 10 year return period the saf curves remain flat which indicates that the drought affected whole study area with equal magnitude and both observed and sres datasets agrees well at this return period typically the observed data indicates that the study area is affected by higher drought magnitude compared to remote sensing products at 50 and 100 year return periods remarkably for dryer regions zone 1 2 and zone 3 4 the drought magnitude remains same for observed and remote sensing products at higher return periods 50 and 100 year for about 30 to 50 of area fig 8 a and 8 b however for the rest of the country zone 5 6 and zone 7 8 there is a large difference between observed and sres products in terms of severity across whole study domain based on 100 year return period however these gaps reduced in the case of 50 year return period fig 8 c and 8 d in addition for droughts with lower frequencies 50 and 100 year return periods persiann cdr curves show better match to gauge ones compared to mswep all around the country especially over dryer regions of zone 1 2 and zone 3 4 fig 8 a and 10 b it may be concluded that sres datasets specifically persiann cdr have acceptable accuracies in assessing long term regional droughts over iran 4 2 2 evaluation of major historical droughts using saf curves the performance of sres based saf curves was evaluated in detecting the spatio temporal pattern of major historical drought events occurred in 1985 1990 2000 and 2008 the performance of sres was compared with gauge datasets in terms of severity area and frequency associated with major historical droughts for illustration purpose the drought assessment is performed over dryer regions due to the critical needs of managing water resources the saf curves are constructed for the southern part zone 1 2 with arid steppe bs and central part of iran zone 3 4 with arid dessert bw climatic conditions are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively here we used spi 3 for short term and spi 12 for long term drought analysis mishra and singh 2009 and these two indices were used for deriving saf curves the saf curves were derived based on rses and gauge data based on spi 3 based on the saf curves for the southern part of iran zone 1 2 fig 9 a c the variations of drought severity from 8 to 20 based on the observed data are more in comparison to the severity associated with both sres ranging from 7 to 16 based on the observed data the most severe drought occurred in the year 2000 is associated with a return period that varies from less than 10 to 50 years fig 9 a while less than 20 of this region was affected by a drought with return period of 25 50 years and more than 60 of the area experienced the drought with a return period of around 10 years the frequency curves based on the observed data indicates that the drought event occurred during the years 1985 1995 and 2008 witnessed a return period of less than 10 years over the entire region of zone 1 2 figure 911 a in contrast to the gauged data sets the saf curves based on persiann cdr indicates that the most severe drought occurred in 1990 in comparison to the year 2000 fig 9 b and the similar results to the observed data can be observed for mswep fig 9 c based on saf curves the drought severity over the central part of iran zone 3 4 are comparatively less in comparison to the southern parts zone 1 2 it can be observed that the saf curves for zone 3 4 indicates higher drought severity based on the observed data in comparison to sres fig 9 d f in addition based on all the three data sets the more severe drought was occurred in 2000 with a return period that varies between 10 and 50 years at different spatial domains for the given climatic zones the second most severe observed drought occurred in 2008 whereas the sres datasets depicted it as the least severe drought over the central part of iran with arid climate zone 3 4 this issue was also similar to results on zone 1 2 similar to spi 3 analysis the saf curves were also derived based on rses and gauge data based on spi 12 to investigate long term droughts over southern zone 1 2 and central zone 3 4 part of iran fig 10 a d it can be observed from the figure that for all the datasets in situ and sres the saf curves remains flat for high frequency droughts especially 5 and 10 year return period this aspect indicates that the high frequency droughts can typically spread all over the regions and indicates less difference in the precipitation variability among the grids within the basin the two most severe droughts occurred in 2000 and 2008 affected 50 and 30 area of the zone 1 2 the hot regions close to persian gulf with a return period between 10 and 25 year fig 10 a over this region the sres datasets persiann cdr and mswep suggests that drought in 2000 can be very severe that covered around 40 and 70 of the area with a return period between 10 and 30 year respectively fig 10 b and 10 c for the other three drought events the saf curves related to mswep are mostly similar to the ones related to observed datasets based on persiann cdr dataset all these three drought events 1985 2000 and 2008 have the same severity and areal extent over the shores of persian gulf based on the saf analysis using spi 12 it can be observed that over the central part of the iran zone 3 4 the drought occurred in 2008 spread over 50 of the area with a return period between 10 and 20 years while rest of the area witness a lower return period fig 10 d although the major drought events 1985 1990 2000 and 2008 derived based on the gauge data sets differs based on the frequency as well as their spatial extents in zone 3 4 the similar characteristics was not observed based on persiann cdr data based on persiann cdr the saf curve patterns for historical droughts were close to each other affecting about 40 of the central part of the iran with a return period around 10 years fig 10 e in the case of mswep data sets the most severe drought was observed in 2000 affected about 70 area and the curves for other historical events varies in terms of frequency and spatial extents fig 10 f overall mswep data set performs well in capturing the spatio temporal pattern of major historical droughts in comparison to persiann cdr over central part of iran 5 conclusion the spatio temporal regional drought analysis are often challenging due to the lack of high quality precipitation data sets for different parts of the globe the advancement made in satellite based precipitation estimates can add new capability for spatio temporal or regional drought analysis as well as it can be a reliable alternative source for drought assessments in un gauged basins although sres can provide rainfall information at finer spatial and temporal resolutions their performance is not consistent with respect to gauged rainfall data in different climatic regions the regional drought analysis requires long term rainfall data sets which can be a key limitation for sres as only few products have long term data sets therefore it is important to investigate whether long term sres products can provide the regional drought information accurately in this study new generations of sres such as persiann cdr and mswep with long term more than 30 years data sets are used to construct saf curves for regional drought assessment by integrating drought severity s areal extent a and frequency f components for different climatic zones located in iran the following conclusions can be drawn from this study a drought events and their durations detected by sres and in situ datasets were compared over four different climatic regions based on spi at different timescales 1 3 6 9 and 12 months overall the number of drought events based on shorter time scales spi 1 and 3 found to be greater for sres in comparison to gauge information for all climatic regions this is more significant for persiann cdr which may be attributed to its underestimation of rainfall over the iran however for longer time scales 6 months the number of drought events based on sres matches well with gauge data b based on the shorter timescales spi 1 and spi 3 the maximum duration of drought based on sres found to be closer to the gauge datasets and mswep comparatively performed well in comparison to persiann cdr although the spatial pattern excluding magnitude of both sres persiann cdr and mswep captures the major historical droughts 1985 1990 2000 and 2008 illustrated by gauge datasets but a significant difference was noticed between both sres and gauge datasets in zone1 2 for 1985 drought event for example gauge data suggests wetness i e spi 3 0 5 near southern iran whereas sres show droughts spi 1 0 in the same spatial domain the severe droughts during 1990 that spreads across northern part of iran were not captured by sres c the saf curves derived based on sres matches well with gauges data especially for droughts with lower return periods over the moderate region located on shores of caspian sea zone 7 8 the sres based saf curves do not matches to each other and the frequency curve remains below the observed data for dryer regions zone 1 to 4 the drought magnitude remains same for observed and remote sensing products at higher return periods 50 and 100 year for about half of the land area however for the remaining climatic zones 5 to 8 there is a large difference between observed and sres products in terms of severity based on 100 year return period in comparison to 50 year return period d the saf curves derived based on spi 12 for rses and gauge data sets over southern zone 1 2 and central zone 3 4 part of iran remains flat for high frequency droughts especially 5 and 10 year return period this aspect indicates that the high frequency droughts can typically spread all over the regions and indicates less difference in the precipitation variability among the grids within the basin overall mswep data sets performs well in capturing the spatio temporal pattern of major historical droughts based on spi 12 in comparison to persiann cdr over central part of iran declaration of

6089,satellite rainfall estimates sres can provide rainfall information at finer spatial and temporal resolutions however their performance varies with respect to gauged precipitation data in different climatic regions a limited number of studies investigated the performance of sres for spatio temporal regional drought analysis which is a key component for developing tools for regional drought planning and management in this study the performance of two recent sres data length 30 years which includes artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr and the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep are selected for spatio temporal drought assessment over different climatic regions located in iran firstly the accuracy of sres was evaluated for deriving standardized precipitation index spi at different time scales 1 3 6 9 and 12 months for four climatic regions during the period of 1983 2012 secondly the performance of sres was evaluated for regional drought assessment based on the concept of the severity areal frequency saf curves it was observed that the performance of sres can be different with respect to gauge data in terms of quantifying drought characteristics e g severity duration and frequency identification of major historical droughts and a significant difference can be observed based on the saf analysis for example the number of drought events based on shorter time scales spi 1 and 3 found to be greater for sres in comparison to gauge information for all climatic regions while investigating the major historical droughts discrepancies can be observed between these two types of data sets for example gauge data suggests wetness i e spi 3 0 5 near southern iran whereas sres show droughts spi 1 0 in the same spatial domain the performance of sres with respect to gauge data varies largely in terms of quantifying the frequency component embedded in the saf curves for selected climatic regions located in iran our research findings can be useful for drought assessment in ungagged basins as well as to develop regional drought management plans to improve water security by integrating multivariate nature of drought events keywords regional drought assessment satellite rainfall estimates sres severity area frequency saf curves 1 introduction droughts are triggered by reduction in the amount of precipitation over an extended period of time e g season year additional variables such as temperatures low relative humidity and distribution of rainy days play a significant role in the occurrence of droughts mishra and singh 2010 the drought events are quantified based on different types of drought indices derived based on a combination of precipitation temperature and soil moisture deficits the drought indices considered to be a prime variable for monitoring and assessing the impact of drought as well as to characterize the droughts based on their intensity duration severity and spatial extent typically a longer time series 30 years of hydro climatic variables are required for deriving drought indices to quantify the drought for different time scales e g month to season mishra and singh 2010 these drought indices are generally normalized with respect to a long term climatology which allows the results to be compared at different locations over different climatic regimes mckee et al 1993 mishra and singh 2010 sahoo et al 2015 the most commonly used meteorological drought indices are the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 an overview of different drought indices along with their strength and weakness are discussed in heim 2002 and mishra and singh 2010 drought events are multivariate in nature and they can be better quantified by integrating duration severity area and frequency based on the concept of spatio temporal analysis or in other words regional drought analysis mishra and singh 2009 mishra and singh 2011 in order to analyze regional drought over a specific area drought indices as well as hydro climatic variables such as rainfall stream flow and soil moisture are commonly used sadeghipour and dracup 1985 clausen and pearson 1995 hisdal et al 2001 mishra and singh 2009 dabanli et al 2017 the spatio temporal drought analysis typically combines more than one drought characteristics for example total areal deficit and maximum deficit intensity tase 1976 combination of probability distributions of drought duration intensity and area santos 1983 intensity duration frequency curves alegria and watkin 2007 severity area duration sad curves anderias et al 2005 and spatial and temporal variability of droughts shin and salas 2000 using this severity area frequency saf curves several studies investigated the regional droughts using spi based on gauged precipitation kim et al 2002 loukas and vasiliades 2004 mishra and desai 2005 mishra and singh 2008 bonaccroso et al 2015 cai et al 2015 the information on regional droughts is critical for short as well as long term water resources management therefore there is a need for further research on the regional or spatial behavior of droughts rossi et al 1992 panu and sharma 2002 mishra and singh 2011 bonaccorso et al 2015 especially for data scarce regions mishra and singh 2011 one of the major limitations of regional drought analysis is lack of high quality rainfall data to capture adequate spatial and temporal coverage mishra and singh 2011 the long term historical time series of precipitation data are often limited in many developing countries in addition establishing a gauge station can be expensive as well as difficult task in inaccessible regions such as deserts and mountains on the other hand satellite datasets can be reliable alternative sources for drought assessments in un gauged basins with the availability of comparatively long term up to 30 years satellite rainfall estimators sres products such as persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 and mswep beck et al 2016 it is now possible to investigate whether these products can capture the regional drought information accurately the performance of sres for estimating the rainfall are widely investigated in different part of the world alijanian et al 2017 dinku et al 2009 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 guo et al 2016 lockhoff et al 2014 nastos et al 2016 salio et al 2015 smith et al 2006 tian et al 2009 and relatively a few studies on drought assessment sahoo et al 2015 guo et al 2016b for instance zambrano et al 2017 evaluated the performances of persiann cdr 1983 2015 and chirps 2 0 1981 2015 for deriving spis and compared with indices from in situ rainfall stations over chile they found that sres can perform well for deriving spis for time scales of 1 3 and 6 months to date the performance sres were evaluated with respect to the ground based rain gauge data for multiple hydro climate related studies such as extreme event analysis streamflow simulation using hydrologic models crop yield simulations data assimilation and water quality assessment even though a number of studies evaluated the performance of sre s for grid gauged based temporal drought analysis a limited number of studies evaluated the spatio temporal drought analysis which is a key component for developing tools for regional drought planning and management however to the best of our knowledge we are not aware of any prior studies that used sres for regional drought analysis specifically using drought saf curves therefore it is important to quantitatively investigate the performance of sre s relative to the gauge based precipitation data sets the overall objectives of this study are a to evaluate the performance of sres persiann cdr and mswep for regional drought analysis for iran using a 30 year time period 1983 2012 b to investigate and compare the saf curves generated by sres and gauge datasets in eight different climatic zones in iran and c to compare the performance of sres in quantifying spatio temporal pattern of four major historical severe drought events over the climatic regions based on drought saf curves the remaining structure of the paper is organized as follows methodology is provided in section 2 study area and the data sets used in this study are discussed in section 3 results are discussed in section 4 and the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 standardized precipitation index the drought indices are used as proxy to quantify a drought event in terms of their intensity duration severity as well as spatial extent mishra and singh 2010 various drought indices have been derived in recent decades in this study spi hayes et al 1999 mckee et al 1993 was selected due to its advantages such as a spi can be derived based on rainfall alone so sres can be used for drought assessment without considering other meteorological data and b its variable timescale allows describing drought conditions for a range of meteorological hydrological and agricultural applications the standardization of spi ensures that the frequencies of extreme events are consistent independent of space and time table 1 shows drought severity classification using spi hayes et al 1999 spi is computed using following steps guttman 1998 a identify a suitable probability density function that describes the long term time series of rainfall b depending on the timescale of interest select the base time of rainfall observation series for example running time series of total rainfall corresponding to 1 3 and 6 months were used to generate corresponding spi 1 spi 3 and spi 6 respectively c fit the cumulative probability to the precipitation time series generated for different time scales and d the inverse normal gaussian function zero mean and variance equals to one is then applied to the cumulative probability distribution function to generate spi time series in this study kolmogorov smirnov test k s test was used to select the best probability density function among normal log normal gamma ev i and ev iii functions for each pixel based on prior studies reddy and ganguli 2011 chen et al 2011 kwak et al 2012 chen et al 2013 and our analysis both gamma and ev iii distribution were identified as the most acceptable distributions for all the pixels 2643 pixels over the country 2 2 severity area frequency saf curves the spatio temporal regional characterization of drought events can be improved by integrating frequency with severity duration and the percentage of area influenced by droughts this concept was previously applied to derive drought severity area frequency saf curves using observed rainfall data mishra and desai 2005 mishra and singh 2008 however there are no prior studies that investigated the performance of sres for analysis of spatio temporal patterns of extreme drought events the steps used for deriving saf curves to investigate the regional drought patterns for different climatic regions of iran is provided in fig 1 and they are briefly described in the following section 1 the study area was divided in to pixels similar to the spatial resolution available for the sres 0 25 0 25 the inverse distance weighting idw loukas and vasiliades 2004 mishra and desai 2005 bonaccorso et al 2015 and cai et al 2015 approach was applied to interpolate monthly observed in situ rainfall values spatially at the center of sres pixels in order to compare regional droughts based on these two types of data in situ and sres the concept of idw eq 1 is based on the assumption that the attribute value of an un sampled location is the weighted average of known values within its neighborhood and the weights are inversely related to the distances between the prediction location and the sampled locations lu and wong 2008 1 λ i 1 d i p j 1 n 1 d j p where λi is the weight of valued point i with distance di from the unvalued point the number of valued points utilized during the interpolation process is shown by n the power for p is typically equal to 2 that represent the inverse distance squared method garcia et al 2008 2 after interpolating the observed precipitation data for each pixel the spi time series for each pixel are calculated for different time scales 1 3 6 9 and 12 months that results in spi 1 spi 3 spi 6 spi 9 and spi 12 respectively both observed precipitation and sres datasets are used to construct spis at selected temporal scale 3 the annual drought severity is calculated for each pixel using theory of run sum of spis 1 within a given year these annual drought severities are used for frequency analysis based on different return periods in our case 30 annual drought severity values 1983 2012 were obtained for each spi time series and used for the frequency analysis in this regard the drought severity values were fitted with normal log normal gamma extreme value type 1 ev i or gumbel and extreme value type 3 ev iii or weibull probability distributions for both sres and in situ datasets the standard k s test was used at 5 significance level to find the best distribution for different climatic zones and for each spi timescale in case of in situ datasets it was observed that gamma and weibull ev iii distributions performed well for most of the pixels weibull ev iii distribution reflected slightly better accuracies in comparison to gamma distribution and it is also recommended for drought frequency analysis chow et al 1988 a similar result was found when sres data were utilized for frequency analysis 4 the areal thresholds are calculated based on the percentage of area affected by droughts of different severity it is expected that the areal thresholds will be different based on the spi s for different time scales 5 the best probability density function weibull distribution is selected to conduct the frequency analysis of annual drought severity for each pixel in this study the frequency analysis of annual drought severity was carried out using 5 10 25 and 50 year return periods 6 perform the frequency analysis using the selected probability distribution for drought severity of different areal extents to associate drought severity with respect to different return periods finally the drought severity area frequency saf curves was constructed for the watershed under consideration 3 study area and data 3 1 study area iran the oldest civilization in the middle east is located between 25 40 eastern latitude and 43 5 63 5 northern longitude the caspian sea is located on the north and both persian gulf and oman sea lies on the southern boundaries fig 2 the two major mountain ranges zagros mountains with the highest altitude of 3500 m and alborz mountains with altitudes 5600 m are located along its western and northern borders respectively in addition to that mediterranean low pressure system entering from the west siberian high pressure system siberian high dropping from the north and sudan tropical low pressure sudan low flowing in from southeastern boundaries impact on iran s climatic conditions golestani et al 2000 because of the various features and climatic conditions iran may be a suitable case study to evaluate the performance of sres for regional drought analysis for instance the highest monthly rainfall is observed along zagros mountains on the west and the shores of northern sea caspian sea during the months of december to april in addition the average temperature along both western and northern mountains are less than 2 c between december to april razeie 2017 fick and hijmans 2017 for the rest of the year may to october the precipitation is expected mostly on the northern part of the country while the temperature is commonly high over most parts of the country razeie 2017 fick and hijmans 2017 overall iran is spatially divided into eight climatic zones fig 2 right kasmaiee 1992 the northern region between alborz mountains and caspian sea are classified as moderate rainy and semi moderate rainy climate with a mean annual rainfall of 800 1400 mm the southern shores of the country witness very hot and humid climate mainly influenced by persian gulf and oman sea air flows the aridity increases from the shoreline toward interior part of the country leading to very hot dry and hot dry climatic regions next to the shoreline climate two major deserts dasht e lut and dasht e kavir are located in semi arid regions in central part of iran the other two regions cold and very cold regions are mainly located along the mountains using koppen geuger classification raziei 2017 table 2 iran is classified into four major climatic types arid steppe bs arid dessert bw cold areas with dry summer ds and temperate c by combining these two types of classification iran can be grouped into four climatic regions a zone 1 2 arid steppe b zone 3 4 arid desert condition c zone 5 6 located along the mountains and is generally classified as cold areas with dry summer and d zone 7 8 located in northern iran near caspian sea witness temperate climatic condition in our study we selected these four types of climate groups the evaluation the performance of sres for spatio temporal drought assessment 3 2 satellite rainfall estimates sres datasets long term data at least 30 year is preferred for spatio temporal drought analysis mishra and singh 2011 although more than ten satellite rainfall products liu et al 2011 are available few of them have a longer dataset the longer datasets are available for persiann cdr and mswep since 1983 and 1979 respectively in this research we selected two sres persiann cdr and mswep for spatio temporal drought analysis and compare its performance with in situ gauge data based on our prior study alijanian et al 2017 these two sres comparatively performed well in capturing the observed precipitation pattern for iran for example the correlation coefficients of 0 82 and 0 72 was observed for persiann cdr and mswep rainfall products with respect to in situ data located in south and southwest shores of persian gulf regions that witness very hot and humid climate persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 is obtained from the national climatic data center ncdc climate data record cdr program of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa this dataset is a multi satellite high resolution precipitation product that provides daily precipitation estimates at 0 25 spatial resolution since 1983 the model is based on persiann algorithm sorooshian et al 2000 using ir satellite data from global geosynchronous satellites as the primary source of precipitation information to calibrate persiann the model is pre trained using the national centers for environmental prediction ncep stage iv hourly precipitation data then the model is run for gridsat b1 ir data knapp 2008 the estimates are then adjusted using the gpcp monthly 2 5 precipitation products for bias reduction ashouri et al 2015 mswep is a new product beck et al 2016 which merges available gauge satellite and reanalysis data with a 3 hourly and 0 25 global gridded precipitation dataset covering 1979 present the long term mean of mswep is based on the recently released climate hazards group precipitation climatology chpclim dataset funk et al 2015 which is derived based on both gauge observations and satellite data the bias correction is introduced using catchment average precipitation from stream flow observations at 13 762 stations over the globe the temporal variability of mswep is determined by weighted average of precipitation anomalies from seven datasets two based on interpolation of gauge observations cpc unified and gpcc three on satellite remote sensing cmorph gsmap mvk and 3b42rt and two on atmospheric model reanalysis era interim and jra 55 both sres datasets persiann cdr and mswep have the similar spatial resolution of a quarter degree with matching grid cells the entire area of iran is divided into 2643 quarter degree pixels based on sres spatial resolution with the number of pixels 510 1142 913 and 78 are located in climatic zones of 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 8 respectively the spis of different time scales are calculated for each pixel based on the observed and sres precipitation time series for the period of 1983 2012 3 3 in situ gauge data in situ rain gauge data are collected from two different sources a six hourly data available from synoptic gauge network data center managed by iran meteorological organization and b daily rainfall data available by ministry of energy the number of operating gauges varies from 421 at 1983 to 2541 at 2012 gauges with missing data unrecorded are removed from the dataset table 3 shows number of operating gauges gauges with missing data and gauges with complete dataset over iran and its climatic zones during the study period 1983 2012 in addition the spatial distribution of gauges over iran and its climatic zones are illustrated in fig 3 based on table 3 and fig 3 the number of gauges after the year of 2000 increased over the climatic regions showing almost one gauge for every two pixels generally more number of gauges are available over the mountainous areas zone 5 6 and the ratio of number of gauges to number of pixels increased from 0 13 1983 to 0 51 1994 and later to 1 14 after 2000 table 3 and fig 3 the inverse distance weighting idw method was used to interpolate the observed precipitation at the center of each sres pixel utilizing gauges datasets further the rainfall data may have lost their homogeneity properties due to source of errors coming from various sources the double mass curve analysis dmca technique was widely used for detecting and correcting inconsistent precipitation data linsley et al 1982 singh 1994 ponce 2014 the consistency of rainfall data is made by comparing data for a single station with that of a pattern composed of the data from several other stations in the area before estimating the precipitation at the center of each pixel based on neighboring gauges i e 10 nearest gauges dmca was carried out and incompatible gauges were corrected based on eq 2 2 p c p m c m a where p represents the original inconsistency dataset mc is the corrected slope for the double mass curve ma is the slope for the inconsistency data records and pc is the corrected precipitation dataset singh 1994 4 results and discussions 4 1 temporal and spatial distribution of droughts the spis of different time scales were used to investigate the temporal and spatial distribution of drought the spi 1 spi 3 spi 6 spi 9 and spi 12 time series were calculated based on gauge in situ persiann cdr and mswep datasets over iran during the study period of 1983 2012 fig 4 the temporal pattern of spis based on these three datasets behaves similar and generally close to each other however the temporal pattern for mswep data seems slightly closer to the gauge measurements especially for spi 9 and spi 12 fig 4 d and 4 e a moderate to higher drought severity period can be defined when the magnitude of spi remains below a threshold of 1 0 mishra and desai 2005 applying this definition the number of drought periods events their duration months and number of drought months while spi 1 0 for all three datasets are shown in table 4 it was observed that number of drought events based on shorter spi time scales spi 1 and spi 3 is generally greater for sres than those based on observed data for all climatic regions this is more apparent for persiann cdr which may be due to underestimation of rainfall over study area alijanian et al 2017 however for longer spi time scales 6 months the observed drought events based on sres matches well with gauge information table 4 as shown in fig 4 and table 4 when the spi timescales increase from 1 to 12 the number of drought months generally increase and the number of drought events decrease for all datasets and the maximum drought duration increases as well for example in the case of gauge observations when the spi timescale increases from 1 to 12 months the maximum drought duration increases over climatic zones a 4 to 59 months over zone 1 2 hot and humid regions close to persian gulf and b 6 to 28 months over zone 3 4 hot and dry regions at the center of the country the performance of sres for drought characterization varies with respect to climatic pattern the number of drought events based on both sres over climatic zone 1 2 decreases from 18 to 6 months for spi 1 to spi 12 while the corresponding drought events based on gauge information vary from 9 to 6 table 4 in addition for shorter spi timescales spi 1 and spi 3 the maximum duration of drought based on sres are closer to the ones shown by gauge data for example the maximum drought duration for spi 3 is 11 months for sres and 8 months for the gauge datasets however in the case of longer spi timescales i e spi 12 the maximum drought durations vary and the maximum drought duration found to be 59 40 and 46 months based on gauge persiann cdr and mswep data sets respectively it was observed that the sres able to perform well in capturing the drought durations at shorter spi timescales however for the number of drought events sres perform better at longer spi timescales and no particular trend was observed in terms of total number of drought months the average drought duration based on the three rainfall datasets for central part of iran zone 3 4 are almost similar to climatic zone 1 2 based on all spis except spi 12 the average drought duration for spi 12 vary widely with 10 67 11 4 and 7 8 months for gauge persian cdr and mswep respectively for zone 3 4 over mountainous areas with cold climatic conditions zone 5 6 the average drought duration for spis with short timescales 12 months are typically less than 4 83 months however the drought durations for spi 12 seems to be longer and differs among datasets with 10 5 12 33 and 10 months for gauge persiann cdr and mswep respectively while for the climatic zone 7 8 moderate and rainy located in northern part of iran shores of caspian sea similar average drought duration 4 45 was observed for all spis less than 12 months however only one drought was detected for spi 12 by gauge data which continues for 25 months while persiann cdr and mswep data indicated 4 and 6 drought events with average duration of 13 25 and 10 months respectively the performance of sres for drought assessment with respect to gauge data is further assessed using statistical criteria such as correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse for different spis over iran and its various climatic zones table 5 as shown mswep data generally reflects better ccs compared to persiann cdr for all spis over iran and its climatic regions among the spis best ccs are associated with spi 3 and spi 6 for all climatic regions ranging from 0 43 zone 7 8 to 0 88 zone 1 2 also rmse for mswep is generally less in comparison to persiann cdr reflecting a better accuracy for mswep in drought assessments comparing spis for different timescales it was observed that shorter timescales 6 months show higher ccs and lower rmses resulting in better assessments across the country and sres the average annual spi spi 3 and spi 6 values are further compared between sres and gauge data for climatic zones for the study period of 1983 2012 fig 5 generally the yearly averaged spis for sres matched well with gauge data at higher values of both positive and negative spis this indicates that sres may accurately assess the droughts as well as wet spells it was also observed that the sres based drought indicators can be able to identify four most severe drought events during 1985 1990 2000 and 2008 fig 5 the spatial distributions of drought based on spi 3 for severe drought years 1985 1990 2000 and 2008 are illustrated in fig 6 both sres persiann cdr and mswep performed comparatively well in capturing the drought during 1985 however the difference was noticed between sres and in situ gauge datasets for zone 1 2 for example gauge data suggests wetness i e spi 3 0 5 near southern iran whereas sres show droughts spi 1 0 in the same spatial domain in addition this issue was observed in mountain regions of northwestern iran the severe droughts during 1990 that spread across northern part of iran were not captured by sres similarly the spatial droughts observed in central part of iran during 2000 were not captured by sres although the sres nearly detect the spatial distribution of drought in dryer regions zones 1 to 4 both sres indicated wet spells during 2008 whereas the observed data indicated droughts in several parts of iran 4 2 spatio temporal drought analysis using saf curves 4 2 1 comparison between sres and gauge data the performance of sres was investigated to study regional droughts using saf curves by quantitatively connecting severity area and frequency using return periods of 10 50 100 years for illustration purpose we derived saf curves based on spi 3 as short term drought and spi 12 long term drought using sres and gauge datasets for climatic regions of iran figs 7 and 8 where x and y axes represent percentage of area affected by drought and annual drought severity sum of negative spi values in dry spells with different return period respectively for spi 3 saf curves based on both sres datasets match well with frequency curves related to gauge data over the southern part of the country zone 1 2 where the low magnitude droughts affected more than 50 of the region fig 7 a over the central part of iran located in semi arid regions zone 3 4 and the mountains regions zone 5 6 the saf curves derived based on sres matches well with gauges data especially for droughts with lower return periods fig 7 b and 7 c over the moderate region located on shores of caspian sea zone 7 8 the saf curves of sres do not matches to each other and the frequency curve remains below the observed data for example all the sres frequency curves based on the return period of 50 and 100 year are illustrated between the saf curves for gauge data with return periods of 10 and 50 year for example all sres curves with the return period of 50 and 100 year are illustrated between the saf curves for gauge data with return periods of 10 and 50 year this result show that short term droughts durations less than 3 months with low severity annual spi values around 6 often return periods of 10 years occur over iran the difference among drought severity was observed for zone 1 2 based on 50 and 100 year return period between observed and sres data fig 7 a for example the drought severity based on observed data varies between 6 and 22 whereas it is between 8 and 18 for sres products based on 100 year return period similarly in this region over more than 40 percent of the area the drought severity was higher for sres data persiann cdr and mswep compared to observed data at all frequencies fig 7 a in contrast both the severity and the percentage of area affected by drought at different return periods matches well between observed and two sres products for climate zone 3 4 fig 7 b however for lower return period comparatively better performance was observed by sres products fig 7 b similar pattern was observed for other climatic regions zone5 6 and zone7 8 fig 7 c and 9 d respectively where the observed data typically has higher magnitude across whole spatial area specifically at higher return periods compared to sres products fig 8 illustrates saf curves for long term droughts spi 12 over iran s climatic regions overall a wide variation in terms of drought severity was found between observed data and sres datasets persiann cdr and mswep especially for regions with less aridity mountains and the northerner areas zone 5 6 and zone 7 8 fig 8 c and 8 d respectively interestingly at 10 year return period the saf curves remain flat which indicates that the drought affected whole study area with equal magnitude and both observed and sres datasets agrees well at this return period typically the observed data indicates that the study area is affected by higher drought magnitude compared to remote sensing products at 50 and 100 year return periods remarkably for dryer regions zone 1 2 and zone 3 4 the drought magnitude remains same for observed and remote sensing products at higher return periods 50 and 100 year for about 30 to 50 of area fig 8 a and 8 b however for the rest of the country zone 5 6 and zone 7 8 there is a large difference between observed and sres products in terms of severity across whole study domain based on 100 year return period however these gaps reduced in the case of 50 year return period fig 8 c and 8 d in addition for droughts with lower frequencies 50 and 100 year return periods persiann cdr curves show better match to gauge ones compared to mswep all around the country especially over dryer regions of zone 1 2 and zone 3 4 fig 8 a and 10 b it may be concluded that sres datasets specifically persiann cdr have acceptable accuracies in assessing long term regional droughts over iran 4 2 2 evaluation of major historical droughts using saf curves the performance of sres based saf curves was evaluated in detecting the spatio temporal pattern of major historical drought events occurred in 1985 1990 2000 and 2008 the performance of sres was compared with gauge datasets in terms of severity area and frequency associated with major historical droughts for illustration purpose the drought assessment is performed over dryer regions due to the critical needs of managing water resources the saf curves are constructed for the southern part zone 1 2 with arid steppe bs and central part of iran zone 3 4 with arid dessert bw climatic conditions are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively here we used spi 3 for short term and spi 12 for long term drought analysis mishra and singh 2009 and these two indices were used for deriving saf curves the saf curves were derived based on rses and gauge data based on spi 3 based on the saf curves for the southern part of iran zone 1 2 fig 9 a c the variations of drought severity from 8 to 20 based on the observed data are more in comparison to the severity associated with both sres ranging from 7 to 16 based on the observed data the most severe drought occurred in the year 2000 is associated with a return period that varies from less than 10 to 50 years fig 9 a while less than 20 of this region was affected by a drought with return period of 25 50 years and more than 60 of the area experienced the drought with a return period of around 10 years the frequency curves based on the observed data indicates that the drought event occurred during the years 1985 1995 and 2008 witnessed a return period of less than 10 years over the entire region of zone 1 2 figure 911 a in contrast to the gauged data sets the saf curves based on persiann cdr indicates that the most severe drought occurred in 1990 in comparison to the year 2000 fig 9 b and the similar results to the observed data can be observed for mswep fig 9 c based on saf curves the drought severity over the central part of iran zone 3 4 are comparatively less in comparison to the southern parts zone 1 2 it can be observed that the saf curves for zone 3 4 indicates higher drought severity based on the observed data in comparison to sres fig 9 d f in addition based on all the three data sets the more severe drought was occurred in 2000 with a return period that varies between 10 and 50 years at different spatial domains for the given climatic zones the second most severe observed drought occurred in 2008 whereas the sres datasets depicted it as the least severe drought over the central part of iran with arid climate zone 3 4 this issue was also similar to results on zone 1 2 similar to spi 3 analysis the saf curves were also derived based on rses and gauge data based on spi 12 to investigate long term droughts over southern zone 1 2 and central zone 3 4 part of iran fig 10 a d it can be observed from the figure that for all the datasets in situ and sres the saf curves remains flat for high frequency droughts especially 5 and 10 year return period this aspect indicates that the high frequency droughts can typically spread all over the regions and indicates less difference in the precipitation variability among the grids within the basin the two most severe droughts occurred in 2000 and 2008 affected 50 and 30 area of the zone 1 2 the hot regions close to persian gulf with a return period between 10 and 25 year fig 10 a over this region the sres datasets persiann cdr and mswep suggests that drought in 2000 can be very severe that covered around 40 and 70 of the area with a return period between 10 and 30 year respectively fig 10 b and 10 c for the other three drought events the saf curves related to mswep are mostly similar to the ones related to observed datasets based on persiann cdr dataset all these three drought events 1985 2000 and 2008 have the same severity and areal extent over the shores of persian gulf based on the saf analysis using spi 12 it can be observed that over the central part of the iran zone 3 4 the drought occurred in 2008 spread over 50 of the area with a return period between 10 and 20 years while rest of the area witness a lower return period fig 10 d although the major drought events 1985 1990 2000 and 2008 derived based on the gauge data sets differs based on the frequency as well as their spatial extents in zone 3 4 the similar characteristics was not observed based on persiann cdr data based on persiann cdr the saf curve patterns for historical droughts were close to each other affecting about 40 of the central part of the iran with a return period around 10 years fig 10 e in the case of mswep data sets the most severe drought was observed in 2000 affected about 70 area and the curves for other historical events varies in terms of frequency and spatial extents fig 10 f overall mswep data set performs well in capturing the spatio temporal pattern of major historical droughts in comparison to persiann cdr over central part of iran 5 conclusion the spatio temporal regional drought analysis are often challenging due to the lack of high quality precipitation data sets for different parts of the globe the advancement made in satellite based precipitation estimates can add new capability for spatio temporal or regional drought analysis as well as it can be a reliable alternative source for drought assessments in un gauged basins although sres can provide rainfall information at finer spatial and temporal resolutions their performance is not consistent with respect to gauged rainfall data in different climatic regions the regional drought analysis requires long term rainfall data sets which can be a key limitation for sres as only few products have long term data sets therefore it is important to investigate whether long term sres products can provide the regional drought information accurately in this study new generations of sres such as persiann cdr and mswep with long term more than 30 years data sets are used to construct saf curves for regional drought assessment by integrating drought severity s areal extent a and frequency f components for different climatic zones located in iran the following conclusions can be drawn from this study a drought events and their durations detected by sres and in situ datasets were compared over four different climatic regions based on spi at different timescales 1 3 6 9 and 12 months overall the number of drought events based on shorter time scales spi 1 and 3 found to be greater for sres in comparison to gauge information for all climatic regions this is more significant for persiann cdr which may be attributed to its underestimation of rainfall over the iran however for longer time scales 6 months the number of drought events based on sres matches well with gauge data b based on the shorter timescales spi 1 and spi 3 the maximum duration of drought based on sres found to be closer to the gauge datasets and mswep comparatively performed well in comparison to persiann cdr although the spatial pattern excluding magnitude of both sres persiann cdr and mswep captures the major historical droughts 1985 1990 2000 and 2008 illustrated by gauge datasets but a significant difference was noticed between both sres and gauge datasets in zone1 2 for 1985 drought event for example gauge data suggests wetness i e spi 3 0 5 near southern iran whereas sres show droughts spi 1 0 in the same spatial domain the severe droughts during 1990 that spreads across northern part of iran were not captured by sres c the saf curves derived based on sres matches well with gauges data especially for droughts with lower return periods over the moderate region located on shores of caspian sea zone 7 8 the sres based saf curves do not matches to each other and the frequency curve remains below the observed data for dryer regions zone 1 to 4 the drought magnitude remains same for observed and remote sensing products at higher return periods 50 and 100 year for about half of the land area however for the remaining climatic zones 5 to 8 there is a large difference between observed and sres products in terms of severity based on 100 year return period in comparison to 50 year return period d the saf curves derived based on spi 12 for rses and gauge data sets over southern zone 1 2 and central zone 3 4 part of iran remains flat for high frequency droughts especially 5 and 10 year return period this aspect indicates that the high frequency droughts can typically spread all over the regions and indicates less difference in the precipitation variability among the grids within the basin overall mswep data sets performs well in capturing the spatio temporal pattern of major historical droughts based on spi 12 in comparison to persiann cdr over central part of iran declaration of
