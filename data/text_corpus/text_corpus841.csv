4205,the bed slope and the tailwater depth are two important ones among the factors that affect the propagation of the dam break flood and favre waves most previous studies have only focused on the macroscopic characteristics of the dam break flows or favre waves under the condition of horizontal bed rather than the internal movement characteristics in sloped channel the present study applies two numerical models namely large eddy simulation les and shallow water equations swes models embedded in the cfd software package flow 3d to analyze the internal movement characteristics of the dam break flows and favre waves such as water level the velocity distribution the fluid particles acceleration and the bed shear stress under the different bed slopes and water depth ratios the results under the conditions considered in this study show that there is a flow state transition in the flow evolution for the steep bed slope even in water depth ratio α 0 1 α is the ratio of the tailwater depth to the reservoir water depth the flow state transition shows that the wavefront changes from a breaking state to undular such flow transition is not observed for the horizontal slope and mild bed slope the existence of the favre waves leads to a significant increase of the vertical velocity and the vertical acceleration in this situation the swes model has poor prediction analysis reveals that the variation of the maximum bed shear stress is affected by both the bed slope and tailwater depth under the same bed slope e g s 0 0 02 the maximum bed shear stress position develops downstream of the dam when α 0 1 while it develops towards the end of the reservoir when α 0 7 for the same water depth ratio e g α 0 7 the maximum bed shear stress position always locates within the reservoir at s 0 0 02 while it appears in the downstream of the dam for s 0 0 and 0 003 after the flow evolves for a while the comparison between the numerical simulation and experimental measurements shows that the les model can predict the internal movement characteristics with satisfactory accuracy this study improves the understanding of the effect of both the bed slope and the tailwater depth on the internal movement characteristics of the dam break flows and favre waves which also provides a valuable reference for determining the flood embankment height and designing the channel bed anti

evolution of the dam break floods has attracted significant researchers and engineers attention primarily due to its huge destructive power to the human s lives and properties it is necessary to implement corresponding flood emergency plans during the dam design and operation in order to capture the propagation characteristic of the dam break flows effectively and accurately extensive studies have been carried out using various methods in the past decades stansby et al 1998 xia et al 2010 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2020a in addition favre waves will affect the navigation and transportation of ships and generate periodic pressure loads acting on the structures in the channel in the design of the tailwater channel of hydropower station such as the channel height and the bottom erosion prevention also need to consider the effect of favre waves the earliest systematic measurement was carried out by favre 1935 in a rectangular flume subsequently many researchers carried out further research on favre waves peregrine 1966 treske 1994 marche et al 1995 soares frazao and zech 2002 both dam break flow and favre waves can be generated by instantaneously lifting the gate in the channel as for which kind of flow phenomenon will appear it mainly depends on the relative relationship between the initially upstream and downstream water depths according to the review made by castro orgaz and chanson 2020 dam break flow will appear in the channel the main feature is that the wavefront is broken when the water depth ratio α 0 4 0 55 α is the ratio of the tailwater depth to the reservoir water depth and favre waves will occur in the channel the main feature is that the wavefront is undular when the water depth ratio α 0 4 0 55 however there are rarely studies on the internal movement characteristics of dam break flows or favre waves under the condition of sloping wet bed for the study of dam break waves experimental studies mainly focus on the changes in water depth miller and chaudhry 1989 lauber and hager 1998a lauber and hager 1998b propagation velocity leal et al 2006 marra et al 2011 and pressure load chen et al 2009 during the evolution of the dam break flows considering different boundary conditions kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2012 carried out laboratory experiment of the dam break flows with laterally contracted cross sections in their experiments the image processing technology was used to successfully capture the water depth change they found that the water depth would increase in the contraction section and the negative wave appeared after encountering the contraction section the speed of the negative wave increased with the increase of the initial tailwater depth wang et al 2019 used image processing technology to carry out laboratory experiments on both the rectangular and the triangular cross sections and compared the evolution pattern and water depth change of the dam break flows in the triangular and rectangular cross sections liu et al 2020 studied the propagation characteristics of the dam break flows water surface profile wave height wave speed etc for different bed slopes and tailwater depths through the image processing technology they found that the increase of the bed slope would accelerate the speed of shock wave and reduce the speed of the negative wave the previous numerical simulation studies mainly focused on capturing the free surface savic and holly 1993 chang et al 2011 marsooli and wu 2014 the sediment transport wu and wang 2007 khosronejad et al 2020a khosronejad et al 2020b and the change of the turbulence intensity park et al 2012 in the case of a horizontal bed shigematsu et al 2004 studied the change of the water surface profile and the distribution of velocity and turbulence intensity they found that the location with large turbulence intensity mainly appeared within the bottom boundary area biscarini et al 2010 compared the difference between the shallow water model and the full three dimensional calculation through the numerical simulation of the dam break flow the analysis indicated that the shallow water model can obtain the main characteristics of the flow but lose some three dimensional information due to the simplification in the model khosronejad et al 2019 used a coupled model to simulate the water surface and sediment transport in the dam break flow and presented that the coupled model can accurately capture the scour processes of the river bed and the variation of the water surface taking the bed slope into account fraccarollo and toro 1995 applied a shallow water model to analyze the water depth variation of the dam break flow they found that when there was a high free surface gradient in the dam break flow the calculated pressure and velocity distribution based on the shallow water model deviated greatly from the measurements for the research of favre waves peregrine 1966 used numerical simulation to successfully present the development process of favre waves the author pointed out that the maximum amplitude of the undulations is limited by breaking and most of the measured breaking waves have the amplitude of about 0 6 treske 1994 measured the water level elevations the wave amplitude the wave length and the frequencies of favre waves in rectangular and trapezoidal open channels he found that the primary wave undulations occur at froude number ranging between 1 1 and 1 25 and the frequencies of secondary waves in the rectangular channel are about two to three times than that in the trapezoidal channel for the same froude number soares frazao and zech 2002 generated favre waves in the flume by raising the gate instantaneously after comparing the experimental results with their numerical calculation results they found that the propagation of favre waves is a typical weak non hydrostatic flow and the undulations appear if the froude number ranges between 1 and 1 28 for higher froude number the wave front will break and lead to a steep front it can be seen that most of the above studies were carried out under the condition of either the horizontal bed or the slopping dry bed and the focus of the previous studies were mainly on the macroscopic characteristics of the flow however the actual dam break flows or favre waves are affected by both the bed slope and the tailwater wang et al 2017 wang et al 2020b the internal movement information such as velocity profile and bed shear stress distribution is not only important for assessing the potential channel erosion damage shigematsu et al 2004 but also a significant parameter for understanding and mitigating the impact of dam break flood and favre waves biscarini et al 2010 considering the limitation of the flume length liu et al 2020 and the difficulty of collecting the internal flow characteristics the purpose of this article is to better understand the internal characteristics of dam break flows and favre waves under the conditions of the sloping wet bed by numerical simulation the numerical model used in this article is systematically validated by comparing with available experimental data barnes and baldock 2006 larocque et al 2013a liu et al 2020 the dam break flow and favre waves under different bed slopes and tailwater depths are comprehensively analyzed in terms of water surface profile velocity distribution bed shear stress and fluid particles acceleration the present study will further guide the preparation of flood control plans and the development of flood management as well as the scheduling work in the channel and the design of the tailwater channel of hydropower station 2 numerical models the governing equations are discretized by the finite volume method in the commercial software flow 3d flow science inc 2016 and many turbulence models are provided such as prandtl mixing length model standard k ε model k ω model large eddy simulation model and so on the free water surface is captured using the volume of fluid vof method that can accurately capture the changes of free water surface and has been widely used in the numerical simulation of dam break flow in the past decades oertel and bung 2012 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 yang et al 2018a in this paper flow 3d is applied to calculate the dam break flow under different bed slopes and tailwater depths 2 1 navier stokes equations with large eddy simulation in flow 3d the continuity equation and momentum equations describing fluid motion have the following forms 1 u a x x v a y y w a z z 0 2 u t 1 v f u a x u x v a y u y w a z u z 1 ρ p x g x f x 3 v t 1 v f u a x v x v a y v y w a z v z 1 ρ p y g y f y 4 w t 1 v f u a x w x v a y w y w a z w z 1 ρ p z g z f z where u v w are the flow velocity in the

cell edge area in the x direction ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure vf is the volume fraction fraction of open volume in cell it means that the cell is fully open when vf equals to 1 gx gy gz are the body acceleration in the three directions y z respectively fx fy fz are the viscous acceleration in the three directions of y z respectively to better simulate the turbulent flow the computational grid is required to be sufficiently small to capture small vortex motion in the turbulent flow with reasonable computational cost in this regard the large eddy simulation les approach is one of the options since the les model can provide more details about the movement of the dam break flow and has been widely used for the dam break flow simulation bung et al 2008 larocque et al 2013a larocque et al 2013b khoshkonesh et al 2019 it is applied in this study the les model solves the turbulent motion that is larger than the grid scale directly through the navier stokes equations while the influence of the small scale vortex is simulated by establishing a model the so called sub grid scale closure 5 l δ x δ y δ z 1 3 6 τ ij 1 3 τ kk δ ij 2 μ t s ij 2 c s l 2 s ij s ij 7 s ij 1 2 u i

equations model for the comparison with the les predictions the shallow water equations swes model in flow 3d is also used in the study the swes are obtained by performing water depth averaging processing on the three dimensional incompressible navier stokes equations it can be used to describe the fluid flow when water depth is small comparing with the horizontal scales and has a very broad application scenario soares frazao and zech 2002 guo et al 2012 castro orgaz and chanson 2020 the swes model in flow 3d ignores the vertical acceleration of the flow and assumes that the movement of the flow satisfies the static pressure distribution the continuity and momentum equations under 1d conditions read kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 8 h h b t u h h b x 0 9 u t u u x 1 ρ p x g x f x where u is water depth averaging velocity hb is the height of bottom contour and h is the surface elevation measured from the bottom of the grid the swes model requires two layers of grids in the z direction and the height of the bottom layer of grids needs to be greater than the maximum height that appears during the evolution of flow the shallow water flow can reside in only one vertical layer of control volumes e g the bottom layer of cells in the z direction the pressure in an element containing a free surface is defined as follows 10 p p 0 ρ g h 11 h f v f δ z 1 v f δ z where p 0 is the atmospheric pressure on the free surface δ z is the cell size in the bottom layer f is the fluid fraction and vf is the volume fraction fraction of open volume in cell the sketch of related variables involved in the swes model in flow 3d is shown in the fig 1 the volume area blockages used in the favor fractional area volume obstacle representation method can describe the geometry and the water surface profile is tracked by the vof method flow science inc 2016 2 3 initial and boundary conditions the atmospheric pressure is specified at the free water surface the outlet of the flume is set to outflow ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2012 ozmen cagatay et al 2014 guo et al 2014 no slip condition is applied to all solid boundaries including the upstream end and bottom of the flume since no flux and shear of any property across the side wall the side wall of the flume is set as symmetry the water in the reservoir area and the downstream of the dam is initially at a static state while the corresponding water depth is set according to the designed working conditions 2 4 numerical model setup taking into account the length limitation of the flume mentioned in the experiment of liu et al 2020 the reservoir area is extended to 18 m and the downstream of the dam is extended to 19 m in the numerical simulation in the numerical calculations the upstream initial water depth hu is 0 4 m for the numerical simulation with the les model a solid gate is arranged at the dam position and the movement of the gate is controlled by the general moving objects gmo module in flow 3d the corresponding gate lifting speed is set to 2 m s after comparing with the experimental conditions of liu et al 2020 the initial water in the reservoir area and downstream of the dam is imported through stereo lithography stl files the history probe in flow 3d is used to realize the function of marking particles this kind of marking particles has no mass and will not affect the movement of the fluid after setting it to follow the movement of the fluid it is convenient to study the movement of a single fluid particle as such the internal motion characteristics of the dam break flows can be studied in details through analyzing its trajectory and the acceleration variation of particles the fluid particles with different position coordinates are set for analysis and the corresponding position coordinates are shown in table 1 the position of the fluid particles is the same under the same water depth ratio for different bed slopes the flume model in the numerical calculation is shown in fig 2 where hu and hd represent the initial upstream and downstream water depth respectively the grid sizes in the x and z directions are 0 02 m and 0 01 m respectively sensitivity analysis of the grid size in the y direction is mainly carried out in this study the calculation results of different grid size are shown in fig 3 with hu 0 4 m and hd 0 04 m it can be seen that the calculation results of the water surface profile and the velocity distribution have small difference considering the impact of calculation speed and accuracy δy 0 02 m is used in the subsequent numerical simulations the final total number of grids are 4349850 4812600 and 7681650 for s 0 0 0 003 and 0 02 respectively the time step is determined automatically in flow 3d which is based on the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion in the swes model the grid heights in the z direction are δz 1 δz 2 0 5 m δz 1 δz 2 0 7 m and δz 1 δz 2 1 m for s 0 0 0 003 and 0 02 respectively where δz 1 and δz 2 are respectively the height of the bottom and top grids in the z direction the horizontal grid δx and the lateral grid δy are 0 005 m in all simulation cases the calculation grids for the three bed slope cases are all 14800 and calculation time is about 130 s for the dam break flow evolution for 10 s the computational grid system is shown in table 2 3 model validation the accuracy of the numerical calculation results in terms of water surface profile velocity distribution and bed shear stress are validated by comparing with previous experimental measurement results the les model is mainly calibrated here in this section we mainly focus on comparing the calculated velocity distribution and bed shear stress with the measurements of larocque et al 2013a and barnes and baldock 2006 the comparison with liu et al 2020 will be discussed in the section 4 1 the first test case is an experimental conducted in the hydraulics laboratory university of south carolina in a smooth wooden flume larocque et al 2013a the experimental setup is shown in fig 4 the length of the reservoir area was 3 37 m and the downstream length of the dam was 3 94 m the flume was 0 18 m wide 0 42 m high and the bed slope was 0 93 the water depth was measured at different locations using a baumer ultrasonic distance measuring sensor and the velocity was measured using uvp the velocity distribution at different times for location 4 is used for calibration under the experimental condition of hu 0 3 m and hd 0 m the grid size used in the first case is δx δy δz 0 005 m with the total number of grids being 5368464 and the initial and boundary conditions are set as section 2 3 the second test case was conducted at the university of queensland uq gordon mckay hydraulics laboratory with a dam break flume barnes and baldock 2006 the main structure of the flume is shown in the fig 5 the length of the reservoir was 2 25 m and the downstream length of the dam was 1 75 m the width of the flume was 0 4 m and the height was 0 4 m the roughness height of the flume was about 0 1 mm the bed shear stress was measured using a novel shear plate at 0 45 m downstream of the dam for the dry horizontal bed case the water depth of the reservoir area was hu 0 2 m the grid size used in the second case is taken as δx δy δz 0 005 m and the corresponding total number of grids is 4352000 the initial and boundary conditions are also set as section 2 3 the relative root mean square error rrmse is used for estimating the difference between the results of the numerical simulation and experimental measurements 12 rrmse 1 n i 1 n s i e i e i 2 where n is the total number of all measured data points si is the numerical simulation value ei is the measured value the comparison result is shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the velocity distribution of the numerical simulated agrees well with the experimental results the velocity distribution along the water depth all presents the typical characteristics of a bottom shear layer and an upper stable layer analysis shows that the thickness of the shear layer roughly accounts for about 5 of the reservoir water depth which is generally consistent with the result of larocque et al 2013a the calculated bed shear stress is also in good agreement with the experimental measurements in the case of hu 0 2 m the maximum dimensionless bed shear stress is about 0 008 at x 0 45 m the results show that the les model can be used to simulate the dam break flow with satisfactory accuracy 4 results in order to facilitate the comparison and description of the propagation characteristics of the dam break flow the evolution area of the flow is generalized by different zones as shown in fig 7 in fig 7 zone 1 represents the area near the negative wavefront within the rarefaction wave zone 2 represents the area relatively far from the negative wavefront within the rarefaction wave zone 3 is the area affected by extra negative waves wang et al 2020c wang et al 2020d zone 4 is the shock wave area its wavefront shape is marked with a dotted line it mainly appears when the water depth ratio is relatively small e g α 0 1 and α 0 3 and at this time the wavefront presents a steep front state zone 5 is an area where there is no obvious fluctuation near the dam this area is not affected by extra negative waves or favre waves and zone 6 is the area affected by favre waves it mainly appears when the water depth ratio is relatively large i e α 0 5 and α 0 7 at this time favre waves appear in the wavefront 4 1 water surface profile the experimental results of liu et al 2020 are used to verify the accuracy of the numerical calculations in this section the variation of water surface profile is shown in fig 8 when α 0 1 the les results at t hu g 1 2 4 95 19 81 are consistent with the experimental measurements while it is seen that the swes model is unable to capture the jumping phenomenon of the flow at the initial stage of the dam break e g t hu g 1 2 4 95 and the swes model prediction deviates from the experimental result in zone 1 favre waves do not appear throughout the entire evolution time for s 0 0 0 003 however for s 0 0 02 favre waves gradually form in the late stage of the flow evolution e g t hu g 1 2 39 62 in addition it is worth noting that its movement pattern changes during the evolution of the dam break flows the propagation form of wave front changes from steep bore to undular bore and favre waves cannot be captured by using the swes model mohapatra and chaudhry 2004 found that when the water depth ratio is 0 4 the calculation results of the swes model are basically consistent with the results of the boussinesq type models nonhydrostatic pressure distribution models in the case of horizontal bed the present study found that when the bed slope is 0 02 even the water depth ratio is 0 4 e g the water depth ratio is 0 1 or 0 3 there are fluctuations near the wavefront the swes model underestimates the maximum water depth of the wavefront while it can still capture of the wavefront position fig 9 shows the variation of froude number for α 0 1 when analyzing the propagation characteristics of favre waves fr is calculated using the formula fr c a u 0 c 0 developed by treske 1994 where ca is the absolute speed of the wavefront c 0 is the celerity defined as c 0 g h 0 h 0 is water depth immediately in the wavefront u 0 is the speed of the base flow downstream equal to zero in this study it can be found that when the bed slope s 0 0 fr continues to decrease with the evolution of the flow for the bed slope s 0 0 02 the fr falls below 1 28 after t hu g 1 2 31 5 or xs hu 36 9 when the bed slope s 0 0 003 the fr is much 1 28 during the calculation period so the favre waves did not appear in this study the variation of water depth in α 0 3 is similar to that of α 0 1 and the main difference is that favre waves appear earlier when α 0 3 the reason may be that the increase of the water depth ratio will cause a significant decrease in fr liu et al 2020 when α 0 5 and 0 7 it is seen that the les model can better capture the variation of the extra negative waves and favre waves than the swes model the results provided by the swes model differ greatly from the experiment in the zone 3 and zone 6 though the calculated water level in zone 5 is in good agreement with the experiment the flow state of the wavefront is still broken at s 0 0 in the late stage of the flow evolution e g t hu g 1 2 39 62 but it can better maintain the wave shape and continue to propagate steady downstream at s 0 0 003 for α 0 5 this is consistent with the propagation state found by liu et al 2020 the flow patterns basically show similar movement characteristics under the three different bed slopes and favre waves propagate downstream in a stable form for α 0 7 4 2 dimensionless velocity profile the cross section positions for studying the velocity distribution under different bed slopes are shown in table 3 for t hu g 1 2 14 86 for the convenience of description each position is marked as p1 p6 according to the coordinate value soares frazao and zech 2002 found that ignoring the vertical velocity may be a reason that the swes model could not accurately describe the favre waves yang et al 2018b also found that the results near the negative wave front produced from the swes model greatly differed from the experimental measurements and they found this difference was mainly caused by the neglect of the vertical velocity however the previous analyses are all qualitative descriptions since there is no quantitative method for the proportion of the vertical velocity in the past this paper uses the following formulas 13 15 for the first time to quantify the proportion of the vertical velocity 13 β h w u 14 β p 0 h s β h d h h s 100 15 β x a x b β p d x x b x a where βh is the absolute value of the ratio of the vertical velocity over the horizontal velocity for a certain water depth at a fixed position hs is the local water depth at t hu g 1 2 14 86 βp is the depth averaged proportion for a certain fixed position xa is the lower limit of the zone xb is the upper limit of the zone and β is the average proportion of the vertical velocity within the zone table 4 lists the range of different zones the distribution of the dimensionless horizontal velocity ux u ghu 1 2 solid line and the dimensionless vertical velocity uz w ghu 1 2 scattered points is shown in fig 10 and the proportion of the vertical velocity is shown in fig 11 when the velocity profile deviates either to the left or to the right it means that the flow direction is opposite or the same as the positive direction of coordinate axis when α 0 1 the horizontal velocity of the reservoir area all presents the characteristic of the bottom shear layer and the upper stable layer and the vertical velocity presents a linear increase from the bottom to the water surface and the velocity profile all deviates to the left the velocity direction is negative the horizontal velocity at p6 presents the characteristic that the flow velocity of the upper water is obviously higher especially in s 0 0 02 the reason may be that the upper water is firstly driven by the interaction between the wavefront and the downstream stationary water and the flow velocity increases in a short time while the lower water needs longer time to gain energy via momentum and energy exchange in the meantime since the water depth at the downstream still water interacting with the wavefront increases with time at s 0 0 02 it takes longer for the velocity of the deep water to rise when α 0 3 the vertical velocity of p3 becomes positive which is just the opposite of p4 under the effect of the extra negative waves at t hu g 1 2 14 86 the velocity distribution characteristic at α 0 5 is similar to that at α 0 3 in general it can be observed that the variation of the vertical velocity at p2 p3 and p5 p6 are exactly the opposite for α 0 7 indicating that the extra negative waves and favre waves have the opposite effects on the variation of the vertical velocity the proportion of the vertical velocity in zone 1 is significantly larger than that in zone 2 and 4 for α 0 1 it may be the reason that the result based on the swes model can t match very well near the negative wave front although the water level at zone 3 is affected by the extra negative waves at t hu g 1 2 14 86 the proportion of the vertical velocity in zone 3 is still small for α 0 3 it can be seen from the fig 11 that the influence of the extra negative waves on the vertical velocity becomes more important as the water depth ratio increases the proportion of the vertical velocity in zone 3 increases at this time the zone 5 has the smallest proportion of the vertical velocity comparing to other zone when α 0 5 and 0 7 the proportion of the vertical velocity in zone 6 affected by favre waves shows a very large value and gradually rises with the bed slope increases it is obviously that the influence of the vertical velocity cannot be ignored at this moment from the above analysis it can be concluded that the distribution of the vertical velocity does not change uniformly along the water depth and the extra negative waves or favre waves will increase the proportion of the vertical velocity the movement characteristics of the flow are also affected by the vertical velocity at this time as such some assumptions in the shallow water model are no longer valid in this situation consequently the swes model is no longer applicable to describe the entire process of the dam break flow evolution marche et al 1995 soares frazao and zech 2002 soares frazao and guinot 2008 bristeau et al 2011 cantero chinchilla et al 2016 4 3 bed shear stress distribution fig 12 is the calculated bed shear stress distribution when α 0 1 the les results show that the bed shear stress in the wavefront has a high frequency oscillation phenomenon at s 0 0 0 003 this is because the downstream water is relatively shallow at this moment and the interaction between the wavefront and the downstream stationary water is very intensive however the interaction is relatively weaker at s 0 0 02 and its high frequency oscillation effect no longer appears after t hu g 1 2 4 95 flow 3d uses a quadratic law to evaluate the bed shear stress in the swes model and the formula is τ ρ c d u d 2 in the one dimensional case where u d is the depth averaged velocity in the direction and cd is a default value of 0 0026 in flow 3d it is used to characterize the influence of frictional resistance this value is adopted to obtain the bed friction relatively accurately in most cases according to the recommendation of flow 3d in general the swes model overestimates the bed shear stress the depth averaged velocity method does not seem to correctly predict the bed shear stress distribution when α 0 3 the les results show that there is a fluctuation bed shear stress in the reservoir area affected by the extra negative waves and the bed shear stress at the wavefront also exhibits fluctuations due to the appearance of favre waves at t hu g 1 2 39 62 for s 0 0 02 the swes predictions are basically similar to those at α 0 1 obvious fluctuation appears in both the upstream and downstream reaches of the dam when α 0 5 and 0 7 in the les results while the swes model cannot capture the fluctuation of the bed shear stress and underestimate the local bed shear stress in the fluctuating area therefore when the water depth ratio is relatively high in addition to considering the extra protection height of the embankment it is also necessary to consider the increase in the bed shear stress caused by the waves and take safer protection measures to prevent scouring there are obvious differences in the variation of the bed shear stress under different bed slopes particularly when the water depth is relatively large the impact of the bed slope is more significant the variation of the maximum bed shear stress position with time is shown in fig 13 when α 0 1 it is seen that the maximum bed shear stress always occurs near the dam site the variation of the maximum bed shear stress position with time is almost the same when t hu g 1 2 15 for three bed slopes however the position moves farther with the increase of the bed slope after t hu g 1 2 15 the maximum bed shear stress position appears downstream of the dam when t hu g 1 2 3 96 and moves into the reservoir area after t hu g 1 2 3 96 for α 0 3 after the gate is lifted the water in the reservoir area subducts downstream of the dam at a very fast speed in the early stage resulting in a relatively large bed shear stress in the downstream of the dam and then due to the adjustment of the flow velocity the maximum bed shear stress gradually developed towards the end of the reservoir when α 0 5 it can be found that the maximum bed shear stress firstly appears downstream near the dam and moves towards the reservoir area and it moves downstream of the dam again when t hu g 1 2 35 66 it can be found from fig 12 c that the maximum bed shear stress in the reservoir area is significantly greater than that in the downstream of the dam in the early stage of the dam break flow however because the maximum bed shear stress in the reservoir area continues to decrease over time the maximum bed shear stress in the downstream of the dam will exceed that in the reservoir area in the latter stage however for sloping bed i e s 0 0 003 and 0 02 the maximum bed shear stress always appears in the reservoir area for the case of s 0 0 003 as the water depth in the reservoir area is slightly reduced compared to the horizontal bed the maximum bed shear stress in the reservoir area decreases slowly compared to the horizontal bed simultaneously the bed shear stress in the downstream of the dam is reduced due to the increase in the water depth downstream of the dam therefore during the entire simulation period the location of the maximum bed shear stress is in the reservoir area as for s 0 0 02 the effect of water depth changes is more significant the maximum bed shear stress in the reservoir area has the characteristic of increasing over time while the bed shear stress downstream of the dam has dropped significantly in the case of α 0 7 the maximum bed shear stress occurs in the reservoir area when t hu g 1 2 5 94 and then develops towards downstream of the dam for s 0 0 and 0 003 while it continues to develop towards the end of the reservoir for s 0 0 02 for the condition of s 0 0 and 0 003 the appearance of favre waves increases the bed shear stress downstream of the dam but at s 0 0 02 the increase in the downstream water depth leads to a more significant decrease in the shear velocity at this time the bed shear stress still shows a downward trend fig 14 plots the time when the maximum bed shear stress appears at different positions when α 0 1 the bed shear stress has been rising during the simulated time period t hu g 1 2 39 62 at the reservoir position x hu 12 5 for s 0 0 and 0 003 so the time when the maximum bed shear stress appears at these locations is not shown here but when 12 5 x hu 0 it can be seen that the time when the maximum bed shear stress appears earlier at s 0 0 than that at s 0 0 003 for the same dimensionless position it can be seen from fig 14 c and 14 d that the large reduction of water depth in the reservoir area enables the shear velocity to be maintained at a higher level for a long duration when s 0 0 02 correspondingly the time when the maximum bed shear stress appears in the reservoir area is delayed as for the situation downstream of the dam the time when the maximum bed shear stress appears is later at s 0 0 02 than that at s 0 0 and 0 003 for the same dimensionless position when 0 x hu 17 5 while the situation is the opposite when x hu 17 5 when α 0 3 the time when the maximum bed shear stress appears at the reservoir location x hu 12 5 is earlier than that at α 0 1 it can be found that the furthest location of the reservoir area where the maximum bed shear stress can occur within the simulation time range is continuously developing toward the end of the reservoir as the water depth ratio increases the time when the maximum bed shear stress appears is later for larger bed slope at the same dimensionless position but for the situation of the downstream of dam the conclusion is the opposite for α 0 5 and 0 7 4 4 fluid particles movement trajectory and acceleration variation the analysis of the fluid particles movement trajectory can provide a deeper understanding of the internal characteristics of the flow the analysis of particles acceleration can provide a reference for the application of related simplified mathematical models such as the swes model fig 15 shows the movement characteristics of the fluid particles for different water depth ratios among them the top image represents the motion trajectory of the particles and the middle and bottom images are the dimensionless horizontal and vertical acceleration of the particles respectively and bx bx g bz bz g where bx and bz are horizontal and vertical acceleration of fluid particle respectively it is found that the movement characteristics e g acceleration changes of the particles s1 s2 and s3 in the reservoir area are basically the same so are the particles in the dam location particles s4 s5 and s6 and downstream of the dam particles s7 s8 and s9 for convenience only the movement of s2 s5 s8 is selected for analysis when α 0 1 the water level of the particle s2 in the reservoir area gradually recovers to stable state after falling for a period of time and its horizontal and vertical acceleration are very small the water level of the particle s5 at the dam location decreases sharply in a very short time and the horizontal and vertical accelerations at the initial stage are relatively large but only maintain for a very short time both the horizontal and the vertical accelerations decrease and approach to 0 after t hu g 1 2 4 95 the acceleration change of the particle s8 also has a similar feature to s5 when α 0 3 the water level of the particle s2 in the reservoir area has a minor fluctuations after t hu g 1 2 9 90 which is affected by the extra negative waves and the horizontal and the vertical accelerations are still small the horizontal and the vertical acceleration of the particle s5 at the dam location is similar to that when α 0 1 the water level of the particle s8 gradually stabilizes after rising slowly the acceleration variation characteristics is almost the same as that at α 0 1 when α 0 5 the water level of the particle s2 in the reservoir area appears a small fluctuations after a period of decline and the horizontal and the vertical accelerations also show weak fluctuations at this time the water level of the particle s5 at the dam location fluctuates after a rapid decline at s 0 0 and 0 003 while the water level continues to decrease in the later stage of the dam break flows at s 0 0 02 e g t hu g 1 2 9 90 the acceleration change of particle s5 is very similar under the three bed slopes with all having a big acceleration at the early short stage and reduces to near 0 in the later stage the water level of the particle s8 forms a steep peak when the dam break flow spreads to this location and it then gradually decreases and fluctuates again in the later stage t hu g 1 2 29 71 the horizontal and the vertical accelerations are maintained at large value when t hu g 1 2 9 90 and it appears a weak fluctuation in the later stage when α 0 7 the movement characteristic of the particle s2 and s5 is very similar to that at α 0 5 the main difference is the movement of particle s8 its water level affected by favre waves appears fluctuation and it gradually returns to stability after t hu g 1 2 19 81 the horizontal and the vertical accelerations also fluctuate when favre waves are formed and the magnitude of the vertical acceleration is roughly equal to the horizontal acceleration which means that the vertical acceleration can t be neglected in this moment this may be a reason that the swes model cannot accurately capture the free surface undulations in the wavefront 5 conclusions in this study flow 3d is applied to conduct detailed numerical simulation on the dam break flow under different bed slopes and water depth ratios the internal movement characteristics have been analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 for the dam break flow propagating along the steep wet bed e g s 0 0 02 the downstream static water depth that interacts with the wave front increases significantly so that the fr decreases with the evolution of the dam break flow liu et al 2020 even under the condition of the initial water depth ratio of 0 1 the phenomenon of favre waves will appear after a relatively long evolution time however this phenomenon does not appear for the horizontal and the mild bed slope i e s 0 0 and 0 003 in the present tests 2 the vertical velocity and vertical acceleration increase under the influence of favre waves it is found that the vertical velocity can reach about 26 1 of the horizontal velocity while the maximum vertical acceleration is approximately 74 1 of the maximum horizontal acceleration when α 0 7 this means that the vertical movement plays an important role in this moment this may be one of the reasons that the swes model cannot accurately describe this fluctuation phenomenon 3 the bed slope and the water depth have a coupling relationship in both the upstream and the downstream reservoir in current cases it is found that the water depth has a significant impact on the variation of the bed shear stress when α 0 7 the peak value of the bed shear stress in the reservoir area continues to rise with the evolution of the dam break flow at s 0 0 02 while it continues to decline for the horizontal and the mild bed slope i e s 0 0 and 0 003 for the downstream of dam the situation is opposite although the shallow water equations models failed to capture some detail of the flow movement the average results are generally acceptable considering that the 3d calculation requires more calculation costs it is feasible to use the calculation results of the shallow water equations models to guide the work when the water depth ratio and the bed slope are small but when the water depth ratio or the bed slope is larger especially when favre waves appear in the channel the swes models will ignore the influence of favre waves this study shows that flow state is significantly affected by the bed slope especially when the bed slope is large e g s 0 0 02 favre waves are formed at the later stage even in the small water depth ratio e g α 0 1 generally the actual bed slope is not so large but the occurrence of this phenomenon has an obviously temporal cumulative effect and favre waves will also appear as long as the evolution time is long enough even when the bed slope is small considering that favre waves will obviously increase the wavefront height and causes the difficulty of flood control the influence of the bed slope should be taken into account when selecting the height of the flood embankment in addition it is often necessary to use gates to adjust flow discharge in the canals because the maximum bed shear stress presents different characteristics under different bed slopes and tailwater depths it is necessary to take into account the influence of the bed slope and the water depth ratio at the same time for better formulating the riverbed anti

4205,the bed slope and the tailwater depth are two important ones among the factors that affect the propagation of the dam break flood and favre waves most previous studies have only focused on the macroscopic characteristics of the dam break flows or favre waves under the condition of horizontal bed rather than the internal movement characteristics in sloped channel the present study applies two numerical models namely large eddy simulation les and shallow water equations swes models embedded in the cfd software package flow 3d to analyze the internal movement characteristics of the dam break flows and favre waves such as water level the velocity distribution the fluid particles acceleration and the bed shear stress under the different bed slopes and water depth ratios the results under the conditions considered in this study show that there is a flow state transition in the flow evolution for the steep bed slope even in water depth ratio α 0 1 α is the ratio of the tailwater depth to the reservoir water depth the flow state transition shows that the wavefront changes from a breaking state to undular such flow transition is not observed for the horizontal slope and mild bed slope the existence of the favre waves leads to a significant increase of the vertical velocity and the vertical acceleration in this situation the swes model has poor prediction analysis reveals that the variation of the maximum bed shear stress is affected by both the bed slope and tailwater depth under the same bed slope e g s 0 0 02 the maximum bed shear stress position develops downstream of the dam when α 0 1 while it develops towards the end of the reservoir when α 0 7 for the same water depth ratio e g α 0 7 the maximum bed shear stress position always locates within the reservoir at s 0 0 02 while it appears in the downstream of the dam for s 0 0 and 0 003 after the flow evolves for a while the comparison between the numerical simulation and experimental measurements shows that the les model can predict the internal movement characteristics with satisfactory accuracy this study improves the understanding of the effect of both the bed slope and the tailwater depth on the internal movement characteristics of the dam break flows and favre waves which also provides a valuable reference for determining the flood embankment height and designing the channel bed anti

evolution of the dam break floods has attracted significant researchers and engineers attention primarily due to its huge destructive power to the human s lives and properties it is necessary to implement corresponding flood emergency plans during the dam design and operation in order to capture the propagation characteristic of the dam break flows effectively and accurately extensive studies have been carried out using various methods in the past decades stansby et al 1998 xia et al 2010 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2020a in addition favre waves will affect the navigation and transportation of ships and generate periodic pressure loads acting on the structures in the channel in the design of the tailwater channel of hydropower station such as the channel height and the bottom erosion prevention also need to consider the effect of favre waves the earliest systematic measurement was carried out by favre 1935 in a rectangular flume subsequently many researchers carried out further research on favre waves peregrine 1966 treske 1994 marche et al 1995 soares frazao and zech 2002 both dam break flow and favre waves can be generated by instantaneously lifting the gate in the channel as for which kind of flow phenomenon will appear it mainly depends on the relative relationship between the initially upstream and downstream water depths according to the review made by castro orgaz and chanson 2020 dam break flow will appear in the channel the main feature is that the wavefront is broken when the water depth ratio α 0 4 0 55 α is the ratio of the tailwater depth to the reservoir water depth and favre waves will occur in the channel the main feature is that the wavefront is undular when the water depth ratio α 0 4 0 55 however there are rarely studies on the internal movement characteristics of dam break flows or favre waves under the condition of sloping wet bed for the study of dam break waves experimental studies mainly focus on the changes in water depth miller and chaudhry 1989 lauber and hager 1998a lauber and hager 1998b propagation velocity leal et al 2006 marra et al 2011 and pressure load chen et al 2009 during the evolution of the dam break flows considering different boundary conditions kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2012 carried out laboratory experiment of the dam break flows with laterally contracted cross sections in their experiments the image processing technology was used to successfully capture the water depth change they found that the water depth would increase in the contraction section and the negative wave appeared after encountering the contraction section the speed of the negative wave increased with the increase of the initial tailwater depth wang et al 2019 used image processing technology to carry out laboratory experiments on both the rectangular and the triangular cross sections and compared the evolution pattern and water depth change of the dam break flows in the triangular and rectangular cross sections liu et al 2020 studied the propagation characteristics of the dam break flows water surface profile wave height wave speed etc for different bed slopes and tailwater depths through the image processing technology they found that the increase of the bed slope would accelerate the speed of shock wave and reduce the speed of the negative wave the previous numerical simulation studies mainly focused on capturing the free surface savic and holly 1993 chang et al 2011 marsooli and wu 2014 the sediment transport wu and wang 2007 khosronejad et al 2020a khosronejad et al 2020b and the change of the turbulence intensity park et al 2012 in the case of a horizontal bed shigematsu et al 2004 studied the change of the water surface profile and the distribution of velocity and turbulence intensity they found that the location with large turbulence intensity mainly appeared within the bottom boundary area biscarini et al 2010 compared the difference between the shallow water model and the full three dimensional calculation through the numerical simulation of the dam break flow the analysis indicated that the shallow water model can obtain the main characteristics of the flow but lose some three dimensional information due to the simplification in the model khosronejad et al 2019 used a coupled model to simulate the water surface and sediment transport in the dam break flow and presented that the coupled model can accurately capture the scour processes of the river bed and the variation of the water surface taking the bed slope into account fraccarollo and toro 1995 applied a shallow water model to analyze the water depth variation of the dam break flow they found that when there was a high free surface gradient in the dam break flow the calculated pressure and velocity distribution based on the shallow water model deviated greatly from the measurements for the research of favre waves peregrine 1966 used numerical simulation to successfully present the development process of favre waves the author pointed out that the maximum amplitude of the undulations is limited by breaking and most of the measured breaking waves have the amplitude of about 0 6 treske 1994 measured the water level elevations the wave amplitude the wave length and the frequencies of favre waves in rectangular and trapezoidal open channels he found that the primary wave undulations occur at froude number ranging between 1 1 and 1 25 and the frequencies of secondary waves in the rectangular channel are about two to three times than that in the trapezoidal channel for the same froude number soares frazao and zech 2002 generated favre waves in the flume by raising the gate instantaneously after comparing the experimental results with their numerical calculation results they found that the propagation of favre waves is a typical weak non hydrostatic flow and the undulations appear if the froude number ranges between 1 and 1 28 for higher froude number the wave front will break and lead to a steep front it can be seen that most of the above studies were carried out under the condition of either the horizontal bed or the slopping dry bed and the focus of the previous studies were mainly on the macroscopic characteristics of the flow however the actual dam break flows or favre waves are affected by both the bed slope and the tailwater wang et al 2017 wang et al 2020b the internal movement information such as velocity profile and bed shear stress distribution is not only important for assessing the potential channel erosion damage shigematsu et al 2004 but also a significant parameter for understanding and mitigating the impact of dam break flood and favre waves biscarini et al 2010 considering the limitation of the flume length liu et al 2020 and the difficulty of collecting the internal flow characteristics the purpose of this article is to better understand the internal characteristics of dam break flows and favre waves under the conditions of the sloping wet bed by numerical simulation the numerical model used in this article is systematically validated by comparing with available experimental data barnes and baldock 2006 larocque et al 2013a liu et al 2020 the dam break flow and favre waves under different bed slopes and tailwater depths are comprehensively analyzed in terms of water surface profile velocity distribution bed shear stress and fluid particles acceleration the present study will further guide the preparation of flood control plans and the development of flood management as well as the scheduling work in the channel and the design of the tailwater channel of hydropower station 2 numerical models the governing equations are discretized by the finite volume method in the commercial software flow 3d flow science inc 2016 and many turbulence models are provided such as prandtl mixing length model standard k ε model k ω model large eddy simulation model and so on the free water surface is captured using the volume of fluid vof method that can accurately capture the changes of free water surface and has been widely used in the numerical simulation of dam break flow in the past decades oertel and bung 2012 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 yang et al 2018a in this paper flow 3d is applied to calculate the dam break flow under different bed slopes and tailwater depths 2 1 navier stokes equations with large eddy simulation in flow 3d the continuity equation and momentum equations describing fluid motion have the following forms 1 u a x x v a y y w a z z 0 2 u t 1 v f u

cell edge area in the x direction ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure vf is the volume fraction fraction of open volume in cell it means that the cell is fully open when vf equals to 1 gx gy gz are the body acceleration in the three directions y z respectively fx fy fz are the viscous acceleration in the three directions of y z respectively to better simulate the turbulent flow the computational grid is required to be sufficiently small to capture small vortex motion in the turbulent flow with reasonable computational cost in this regard the large eddy simulation les approach is one of the options since the les model can provide more details about the movement of the dam break flow and has been widely used for the dam break flow simulation bung et al 2008 larocque et al 2013a larocque et al 2013b khoshkonesh et al 2019 it is applied in this study the les model solves the turbulent motion that is larger than the grid scale directly through the navier stokes equations while the influence of the small scale vortex is simulated by establishing a model the so called sub grid scale closure 5 l δ x δ y δ z 1 3 6 τ ij 1 3 τ kk δ ij 2 μ t s ij 2 c s l 2 s ij s ij 7 s ij 1 2 u i

equations model for the comparison with the les predictions the shallow water equations swes model in flow 3d is also used in the study the swes are obtained by performing water depth averaging processing on the three dimensional incompressible navier stokes equations it can be used to describe the fluid flow when water depth is small comparing with the horizontal scales and has a very broad application scenario soares frazao and zech 2002 guo et al 2012 castro orgaz and chanson 2020 the swes model in flow 3d ignores the vertical acceleration of the flow and assumes that the movement of the flow satisfies the static pressure distribution the continuity and momentum equations under 1d conditions read kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 8 h h b t u h h b x 0 9 u t u u x 1 ρ p x g x f x where u is water depth averaging velocity hb is the height of bottom contour and h is the surface elevation measured from the bottom of the grid the swes model requires two layers of grids in the z direction and the height of the bottom layer of grids needs to be greater than the maximum height that appears during the evolution of flow the shallow water flow can reside in only one vertical layer of control volumes e g the bottom layer of cells in the z direction the pressure in an element containing a free surface is defined as follows 10 p p 0 ρ g h 11 h f v f δ z 1 v f δ z where p 0 is the

involved in the swes model in flow 3d is shown in the fig 1 the volume area blockages used in the favor fractional area volume obstacle representation method can describe the geometry and the water surface profile is tracked by the vof method flow science inc 2016 2 3 initial and boundary conditions the atmospheric pressure is specified at the free water surface the outlet of the flume is set to outflow ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2012 ozmen cagatay et al 2014 guo et al 2014 no slip condition is applied to all solid boundaries including the upstream end and bottom of the flume since no flux and shear of any property across the side wall the side wall of the flume is set as symmetry the water in the reservoir area and the downstream of the dam is initially at a static state while the corresponding water depth is set according to the designed working conditions 2 4 numerical model setup taking into account the length limitation of the flume mentioned in the experiment of liu et al 2020 the reservoir area is extended to 18 m and the downstream of the dam is extended to 19 m in the numerical simulation in the numerical calculations the upstream initial water depth hu is 0 4 m for the numerical simulation with the les model a solid gate is arranged at the dam position and the movement of the gate is controlled by the general moving objects gmo module in flow 3d the corresponding gate lifting speed is set to 2 m s after comparing with the experimental conditions of liu et al 2020 the initial water in the reservoir area and downstream of the dam is imported through stereo lithography stl files the history probe in flow 3d is used to realize the function of marking particles this kind of marking particles has no mass and will not affect the movement of the fluid after setting it to follow the movement of the fluid it is convenient to study the movement of a single fluid particle as such the internal motion characteristics of the dam break flows can be studied in details through analyzing its trajectory and the acceleration variation of particles the fluid particles with different position coordinates are set for analysis and the corresponding position coordinates are shown in table 1 the position of the fluid particles is the same under the same water depth ratio for different bed slopes the flume model in the numerical calculation is shown in fig 2 where hu and hd represent the initial upstream and downstream water depth respectively the grid sizes in the x and z directions are 0 02 m and 0 01 m respectively sensitivity analysis of the grid size in the y direction is mainly carried out in this study the calculation results of different grid size are shown in fig 3 with hu 0 4 m and hd 0 04 m it can be seen that the calculation results of the water surface profile and the velocity distribution have small difference considering the impact of calculation speed and accuracy δy 0 02 m is used in the subsequent numerical simulations the final total number of grids are 4349850 4812600 and 7681650 for s 0 0 0 003 and 0 02 respectively the time step is determined automatically in flow 3d which is based on the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion in the swes model the grid heights in the z direction are δz 1 δz 2 0 5 m δz 1 δz 2 0 7 m and δz 1 δz 2 1 m for s 0 0 0 003 and 0 02 respectively where δz 1 and δz 2 are respectively the height of the bottom and top grids in the z direction the horizontal grid δx and the lateral grid δy are 0 005 m in all simulation cases the calculation grids for the three bed slope cases are all 14800 and calculation time is about 130 s for the dam break flow evolution for 10 s the computational grid system is shown in table 2 3 model validation the accuracy of the numerical calculation results in terms of water surface profile velocity distribution and bed shear stress are validated by comparing with previous experimental measurement results the les model is mainly calibrated here in this section we mainly focus on comparing the calculated velocity distribution and bed shear stress with the measurements of larocque et al 2013a and barnes and baldock 2006 the comparison with liu et al 2020 will be discussed in the section 4 1 the first test case is an experimental conducted in the hydraulics laboratory university of south carolina in a smooth wooden flume larocque et al 2013a the experimental setup is shown in fig 4 the length of the reservoir area was 3 37 m and the downstream length of the dam was 3 94 m the flume was 0 18 m wide 0 42 m high and the bed slope was 0 93 the water depth was measured at different locations using a baumer ultrasonic distance measuring sensor and the velocity was measured using uvp the velocity distribution at different times for location 4 is used for calibration under the experimental condition of hu 0 3 m and hd 0 m the grid size used in the first case is δx δy δz 0 005 m with the total number of grids being 5368464 and the initial and boundary conditions are set as section 2 3 the second test case was conducted at the university of queensland uq gordon mckay hydraulics laboratory with a dam break flume barnes and baldock 2006 the main structure of the flume is shown in the fig 5 the length of the reservoir was 2 25 m and the downstream length of the dam was 1 75 m the width of the flume was 0 4 m and the height was 0 4 m the roughness height of the flume was about 0 1 mm the bed shear stress was measured using a novel shear plate at 0 45 m downstream of the dam for the dry horizontal bed case the water depth of the reservoir area was hu 0 2 m the grid size used in the second case is taken as δx δy δz 0 005 m and the corresponding total number of grids is 4352000 the initial and boundary conditions are also set as section 2 3 the relative root mean square error rrmse is used for estimating the difference between the results of the numerical simulation and experimental measurements 12 rrmse 1 n i 1 n s i e i e i 2 where n is the total number of all measured data points si is the numerical simulation value ei is the measured value the comparison result is shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the velocity distribution of the numerical simulated agrees well with the experimental results the velocity distribution along the water depth all presents the typical characteristics of a bottom shear layer and an upper stable layer analysis shows that the thickness of the shear layer roughly accounts for about 5 of the reservoir water depth which is generally consistent with the result of larocque et al 2013a the calculated bed shear stress is also in good agreement with the experimental measurements in the case of hu 0 2 m the maximum dimensionless bed shear stress is about 0 008 at x 0 45 m the results show that the les model can be used to simulate the dam break flow with satisfactory accuracy 4 results in order to facilitate the comparison and description of the propagation characteristics of the dam break flow the evolution area of the flow is generalized by different zones as shown in fig 7 in fig 7 zone 1 represents the area near the negative wavefront within the rarefaction wave zone 2 represents the area relatively far from the negative wavefront within the rarefaction wave zone 3 is the area affected by extra negative waves wang et al 2020c wang et al 2020d zone 4 is the shock wave area its wavefront shape is marked with a dotted line it mainly appears when the water depth ratio is relatively small e g α 0 1 and α 0 3 and at this time the wavefront presents a steep front state zone 5 is an area where there is no obvious fluctuation near the dam this area is not affected by extra negative waves or favre waves and zone 6 is the area affected by favre waves it mainly appears when the water depth ratio is relatively large i e α 0 5 and α 0 7 at this time favre waves appear in the wavefront 4 1 water surface profile the experimental results of liu et al 2020 are used to verify the accuracy of the numerical calculations in this section the variation of water surface profile is shown in fig 8 when α 0 1 the les results at t hu g 1 2 4 95 19 81 are consistent with the experimental measurements while it is seen that the swes model is unable to capture the jumping phenomenon of the flow at the initial stage of the dam break e g t hu g 1 2 4 95 and the swes model prediction deviates from the experimental result in zone 1 favre waves do not appear throughout the entire evolution time for s 0 0 0 003 however for s 0 0 02 favre waves gradually form in the late stage of the flow evolution e g t hu g 1 2 39 62 in addition it is worth noting that its movement pattern changes during the evolution of the dam break flows the propagation form of wave front changes from steep bore to undular bore and favre waves cannot be captured by using the swes model mohapatra and chaudhry 2004 found that when the water depth ratio is 0 4 the calculation results of the swes model are basically consistent with the results of the boussinesq type models nonhydrostatic pressure distribution models in the case of horizontal bed the present study found that when the bed slope is 0 02 even the water depth ratio is 0 4 e g the water depth ratio is 0 1 or 0 3 there are fluctuations near the wavefront the swes model underestimates the maximum water depth of the wavefront while it can still capture of the wavefront position fig 9 shows the variation of froude number for α 0 1 when analyzing the propagation characteristics of favre waves fr is calculated using the formula fr c a u 0 c 0 developed by treske 1994 where ca is the absolute speed of the wavefront c 0 is the celerity defined as c 0 g h 0 h 0 is water depth immediately in the wavefront u 0 is the speed of the base flow downstream equal to zero in this study it can be found that when the bed slope s 0 0 fr continues to decrease with the evolution of the flow for the bed slope s 0 0 02 the fr falls below 1 28 after t hu g 1 2 31 5 or xs hu 36 9 when the bed slope s 0 0 003 the fr is much 1 28 during the calculation period so the favre waves did not appear in this study the variation of water depth in α 0 3 is similar to that of α 0 1 and the main difference is that favre waves appear earlier when α 0 3 the reason may be that the increase of the water depth ratio will cause a significant decrease in fr liu et al 2020 when α 0 5 and 0 7 it is seen that the les model can better capture the variation of the extra negative waves and favre waves than the swes model the results provided by the swes model differ greatly from the experiment in the zone 3 and zone 6 though the calculated water level in zone 5 is in good agreement with the experiment the flow state of the wavefront is still broken at s 0 0 in the late stage of the flow evolution e g t hu g 1 2 39 62 but it can better maintain the wave shape and continue to propagate steady downstream at s 0 0 003 for α 0 5 this is consistent with the propagation state found by liu et al 2020 the flow patterns basically show similar movement characteristics under the three different bed slopes and favre waves propagate downstream in a stable form for α 0 7 4 2 dimensionless velocity profile the cross section positions for studying the velocity distribution under different bed slopes are shown in table 3 for t hu g 1 2 14 86 for the convenience of description each position is marked as p1 p6 according to the coordinate value soares frazao and zech 2002 found that ignoring the vertical velocity may be a reason that the swes model could not accurately describe the favre waves yang et al 2018b also found that the results near the negative wave front produced from the swes model greatly differed from the experimental measurements and they found this difference was mainly caused by the neglect of the vertical velocity however the previous analyses are all qualitative descriptions since there is no quantitative method for the proportion of the vertical velocity in the past this paper uses the following formulas 13 15 for the first time to quantify the proportion of the vertical velocity 13 β h w u 14 β p 0 h s β h d h h s 100 15 β x a x b β p d x x b x a where βh is the absolute value of the ratio of the vertical velocity over the horizontal velocity for a certain water depth at a fixed position hs is the local water depth at t hu g 1 2 14 86 βp is the depth averaged proportion for a certain fixed position xa is the lower limit of the zone xb is the upper limit of the zone and β is the average proportion of the vertical velocity within the zone table 4 lists the range of different zones the distribution of the dimensionless horizontal velocity ux u ghu 1 2 solid line and the dimensionless vertical velocity uz w ghu 1 2 scattered points is shown in fig 10 and the proportion of the vertical velocity is shown in fig 11 when the velocity profile deviates either to the left or to the right it means that the flow direction is opposite or the same as the positive direction of coordinate axis when α 0 1 the horizontal velocity of the reservoir area all presents the characteristic of the bottom shear layer and the upper stable layer and the vertical velocity presents a linear increase from the bottom to the water surface and the velocity profile all deviates to the left the velocity direction is negative the horizontal velocity at p6 presents the characteristic that the flow velocity of the upper water is obviously higher especially in s 0 0 02 the reason may be that the upper water is firstly driven by the interaction between the wavefront and the downstream stationary water and the flow velocity increases in a short time while the lower water needs longer time to gain energy via momentum and energy exchange in the meantime since the water depth at the downstream still water interacting with the wavefront increases with time at s 0 0 02 it takes longer for the velocity of the deep water to rise when α 0 3 the vertical velocity of p3 becomes positive which is just the opposite of p4 under the effect of the extra negative waves at t hu g 1 2 14 86 the velocity distribution characteristic at α 0 5 is similar to that at α 0 3 in general it can be observed that the variation of the vertical velocity at p2 p3 and p5 p6 are exactly the opposite for α 0 7 indicating that the extra negative waves and favre waves have the opposite effects on the variation of the vertical velocity the proportion of the vertical velocity in zone 1 is significantly larger than that in zone 2 and 4 for α 0 1 it may be the reason that the result based on the swes model can t match very well near the negative wave front although the water level at zone 3 is affected by the extra negative waves at t hu g 1 2 14 86 the proportion of the vertical velocity in zone 3 is still small for α 0 3 it can be seen from the fig 11 that the influence of the extra negative waves on the vertical velocity becomes more important as the water depth ratio increases the proportion of the vertical velocity in zone 3 increases at this time the zone 5 has the smallest proportion of the vertical velocity comparing to other zone when α 0 5 and 0 7 the proportion of the vertical velocity in zone 6 affected by favre waves shows a very large value and gradually rises with the bed slope increases it is obviously that the influence of the vertical velocity cannot be ignored at this moment from the above analysis it can be concluded that the distribution of the vertical velocity does not change uniformly along the water depth and the extra negative waves or favre waves will increase the proportion of the vertical velocity the movement characteristics of the flow are also affected by the vertical velocity at this time as such some assumptions in the shallow water model are no longer valid in this situation consequently the swes model is no longer applicable to describe the entire process of the dam break flow evolution marche et al 1995 soares frazao and zech 2002 soares frazao and guinot 2008 bristeau et al 2011 cantero chinchilla et al 2016 4 3 bed shear stress distribution fig 12 is the calculated bed shear stress distribution when α 0 1 the les results show that the bed shear stress in the wavefront has a high frequency oscillation phenomenon at s 0 0 0 003 this is because the downstream water is relatively shallow at this moment and the interaction between the wavefront and the downstream stationary water is very intensive however the interaction is relatively weaker at s 0 0 02 and its high frequency oscillation effect no longer appears after t hu g 1 2 4 95 flow 3d uses a quadratic law to evaluate the bed shear stress in the swes model and the formula is τ ρ c d u d 2 in the one dimensional case where u d is the depth averaged velocity in the direction and cd is a default value of 0 0026 in flow 3d it is used to characterize the influence of frictional resistance this value is adopted to obtain the bed friction relatively accurately in most cases according to the recommendation of flow 3d in general the swes model overestimates the bed shear stress the depth averaged velocity method does not seem to correctly predict the bed shear stress distribution when α 0 3 the les results show that there is a fluctuation bed shear stress in the reservoir area affected by the extra negative waves and the bed shear stress at the wavefront also exhibits fluctuations due to the appearance of favre waves at t hu g 1 2 39 62 for s 0 0 02 the swes predictions are basically similar to those at α 0 1 obvious fluctuation appears in both the upstream and downstream reaches of the dam when α 0 5 and 0 7 in the les results while the swes model cannot capture the fluctuation of the bed shear stress and underestimate the local bed shear stress in the fluctuating area therefore when the water depth ratio is relatively high in addition to considering the extra protection height of the embankment it is also necessary to consider the increase in the bed shear stress caused by the waves and take safer protection measures to prevent scouring there are obvious differences in the variation of the bed shear stress under different bed slopes particularly when the water depth is relatively large the impact of the bed slope is more significant the variation of the maximum bed shear stress position with time is shown in fig 13 when α 0 1 it is seen that the maximum bed shear stress always occurs near the dam site the variation of the maximum bed shear stress position with time is almost the same when t hu g 1 2 15 for three bed slopes however the position moves farther with the increase of the bed slope after t hu g 1 2 15 the maximum bed shear stress position appears downstream of the dam when t hu g 1 2 3 96 and moves into the reservoir area after t hu g 1 2 3 96 for α 0 3 after the gate is lifted the water in the reservoir area subducts downstream of the dam at a very fast speed in the early stage resulting in a relatively large bed shear stress in the downstream of the dam and then due to the adjustment of the flow velocity the maximum bed shear stress gradually developed towards the end of the reservoir when α 0 5 it can be found that the maximum bed shear stress firstly appears downstream near the dam and moves towards the reservoir area and it moves downstream of the dam again when t hu g 1 2 35 66 it can be found from fig 12 c that the maximum bed shear stress in the reservoir area is significantly greater than that in the downstream of the dam in the early stage of the dam break flow however because the maximum bed shear stress in the reservoir area continues to decrease over time the maximum bed shear stress in the downstream of the dam will exceed that in the reservoir area in the latter stage however for sloping bed i e s 0 0 003 and 0 02 the maximum bed shear stress always appears in the reservoir area for the case of s 0 0 003 as the water depth in the reservoir area is slightly reduced compared to the horizontal bed the maximum bed shear stress in the reservoir area decreases slowly compared to the horizontal bed simultaneously the bed shear stress in the downstream of the dam is reduced due to the increase in the water depth downstream of the dam therefore during the entire simulation period the location of the maximum bed shear stress is in the reservoir area as for s 0 0 02 the effect of water depth changes is more significant the maximum bed shear stress in the reservoir area has the characteristic of increasing over time while the bed shear stress downstream of the dam has dropped significantly in the case of α 0 7 the maximum bed shear stress occurs in the reservoir area when t hu g 1 2 5 94 and then develops towards downstream of the dam for s 0 0 and 0 003 while it continues to develop towards the end of the reservoir for s 0 0 02 for the condition of s 0 0 and 0 003 the appearance of favre waves increases the bed shear stress downstream of the dam but at s 0 0 02 the increase in the downstream water depth leads to a more significant decrease in the shear velocity at this time the bed shear stress still shows a downward trend fig 14 plots the time when the maximum bed shear stress appears at different positions when α 0 1 the bed shear stress has been rising during the simulated time period t hu g 1 2 39 62 at the reservoir position x hu 12 5 for s 0 0 and 0 003 so the time when the maximum bed shear stress appears at these locations is not shown here but when 12 5 x hu 0 it can be seen that the time when the maximum bed shear stress appears earlier at s 0 0 than that at s 0 0 003 for the same dimensionless position it can be seen from fig 14 c and 14 d that the large reduction of water depth in the reservoir area enables the shear velocity to be maintained at a higher level for a long duration when s 0 0 02 correspondingly the time when the maximum bed shear stress appears in the reservoir area is delayed as for the situation downstream of the dam the time when the maximum bed shear stress appears is later at s 0 0 02 than that at s 0 0 and 0 003 for the same dimensionless position when 0 x hu 17 5 while the situation is the opposite when x hu 17 5 when α 0 3 the time when the maximum bed shear stress appears at the reservoir location x hu 12 5 is earlier than that at α 0 1 it can be found that the furthest location of the reservoir area where the maximum bed shear stress can occur within the simulation time range is continuously developing toward the end of the reservoir as the water depth ratio increases the time when the maximum bed shear stress appears is later for larger bed slope at the same dimensionless position but for the situation of the downstream of dam the conclusion is the opposite for α 0 5 and 0 7 4 4 fluid particles movement trajectory and acceleration variation the analysis of the fluid particles movement trajectory can provide a deeper understanding of the internal characteristics of the flow the analysis of particles acceleration can provide a reference for the application of related simplified mathematical models such as the swes model fig 15 shows the movement characteristics of the fluid particles for different water depth ratios among them the top image represents the motion trajectory of the particles and the middle and bottom images are the dimensionless horizontal and vertical acceleration of the particles respectively and bx bx g bz bz g where bx and bz are horizontal and vertical acceleration of fluid particle respectively it is found that the movement characteristics e g acceleration changes of the particles s1 s2 and s3 in the reservoir area are basically the same so are the particles in the dam location particles s4 s5 and s6 and downstream of the dam particles s7 s8 and s9 for convenience only the movement of s2 s5 s8 is selected for analysis when α 0 1 the water level of the particle s2 in the reservoir area gradually recovers to stable state after falling for a period of time and its horizontal and vertical acceleration are very small the water level of the particle s5 at the dam location decreases sharply in a very short time and the horizontal and vertical accelerations at the initial stage are relatively large but only maintain for a very short time both the horizontal and the vertical accelerations decrease and approach to 0 after t hu g 1 2 4 95 the acceleration change of the particle s8 also has a similar feature to s5 when α 0 3 the water level of the particle s2 in the reservoir area has a minor fluctuations after t hu g 1 2 9 90 which is affected by the extra negative waves and the horizontal and the vertical accelerations are still small the horizontal and the vertical acceleration of the particle s5 at the dam location is similar to that when α 0 1 the water level of the particle s8 gradually stabilizes after rising slowly the acceleration variation characteristics is almost the same as that at α 0 1 when α 0 5 the water level of the particle s2 in the reservoir area appears a small fluctuations after a period of decline and the horizontal and the vertical accelerations also show weak fluctuations at this time the water level of the particle s5 at the dam location fluctuates after a rapid decline at s 0 0 and 0 003 while the water level continues to decrease in the later stage of the dam break flows at s 0 0 02 e g t hu g 1 2 9 90 the acceleration change of particle s5 is very similar under the three bed slopes with all having a big acceleration at the early short stage and reduces to near 0 in the later stage the water level of the particle s8 forms a steep peak when the dam break flow spreads to this location and it then gradually decreases and fluctuates again in the later stage t hu g 1 2 29 71 the horizontal and the vertical accelerations are maintained at large value when t hu g 1 2 9 90 and it appears a weak fluctuation in the later stage when α 0 7 the movement characteristic of the particle s2 and s5 is very similar to that at α 0 5 the main difference is the movement of particle s8 its water level affected by favre waves appears fluctuation and it gradually returns to stability after t hu g 1 2 19 81 the horizontal and the vertical accelerations also fluctuate when favre waves are formed and the magnitude of the vertical acceleration is roughly equal to the horizontal acceleration which means that the vertical acceleration can t be neglected in this moment this may be a reason that the swes model cannot accurately capture the free surface undulations in the wavefront 5 conclusions in this study flow 3d is applied to conduct detailed numerical simulation on the dam break flow under different bed slopes and water depth ratios the internal movement characteristics have been analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 for the dam break flow propagating along the steep wet bed e g s 0 0 02 the downstream static water depth that interacts with the wave front increases significantly so that the fr decreases with the evolution of the dam break flow liu et al 2020 even under the condition of the initial water depth ratio of 0 1 the phenomenon of favre waves will appear after a relatively long evolution time however this phenomenon does not appear for the horizontal and the mild bed slope i e s 0 0 and 0 003 in the present tests 2 the vertical velocity and vertical acceleration increase under the influence of favre waves it is found that the vertical velocity can reach about 26 1 of the horizontal velocity while the maximum vertical acceleration is approximately 74 1 of the maximum horizontal acceleration when α 0 7 this means that the vertical movement plays an important role in this moment this may be one of the reasons that the swes model cannot accurately describe this fluctuation phenomenon 3 the bed slope and the water depth have a coupling relationship in both the upstream and the downstream reservoir in current cases it is found that the water depth has a significant impact on the variation of the bed shear stress when α 0 7 the peak value of the bed shear stress in the reservoir area continues to rise with the evolution of the dam break flow at s 0 0 02 while it continues to decline for the horizontal and the mild bed slope i e s 0 0 and 0 003 for the downstream of dam the situation is opposite although the shallow water equations models failed to capture some detail of the flow movement the average results are generally acceptable considering that the 3d calculation requires more calculation costs it is feasible to use the calculation results of the shallow water equations models to guide the work when the water depth ratio and the bed slope are small but when the water depth ratio or the bed slope is larger especially when favre waves appear in the channel the swes models will ignore the influence of favre waves this study shows that flow state is significantly affected by the bed slope especially when the bed slope is large e g s 0 0 02 favre waves are formed at the later stage even in the small water depth ratio e g α 0 1 generally the actual bed slope is not so large but the occurrence of this phenomenon has an obviously temporal cumulative effect and favre waves will also appear as long as the evolution time is long enough even when the bed slope is small considering that favre waves will obviously increase the wavefront height and causes the difficulty of flood control the influence of the bed slope should be taken into account when selecting the height of the flood embankment in addition it is often necessary to use gates to adjust flow discharge in the canals because the maximum bed shear stress presents different characteristics under different bed slopes and tailwater depths it is necessary to take into account the influence of the bed slope and the water depth ratio at the same time for better formulating the riverbed anti

4206,there is a highly coupled space time hydraulic connection between cascade hydropower stations chss therefore chss cannot stand alone in market competition symbiosis is a co twin way of alliance which helps to resist variable market risk factors thus this paper proposes a spot quotation alliance modeling method of chss based on symbiosis theory first based on the components explanation and symbiotic effect evaluation of the cascade hydropower symbiotic system chss a quotation alliance formation model with the goal of maximizing the symbiotic effect is built then in order to reduce blindness while retaining the autonomy of power producers a 5 stage power and price declaration strategy is proposed the case study with eight hydropower stations in sichuan province of china shows that the three stations can get an increase of 2 23 in market shares and 2 13 in power generation revenue when forming a quotation alliance and can help the grid save 16 900 yuan in power purchase cost at the same time it reveals that jointly participating in market competition with others can not only increase the alliance s market shares and power generation revenue but also reduce the total power purchase cost of the grid keywords cascade hydropower spot market quotation alliance symbiosis theory 1 introduction 1 1 background in 2015 china introduced competition on the power generation side and the power sales side and the chinese power market officially opened in 2017 the national development and reform commission and the national energy administration of china selected 8 regions including guangdong and sichuan province as the first batch of pilot projects for the construction of power spot markets one year later the guangdong spot market started trial operation marking a new stage in china s power market at present the first batch of 8 pilot areas in the country have all started trial operation of settlement including single day multi day weekly bi weekly full month or even multiple months as the only hydro dominated power market among the eight pilot regions greatly affected by the characteristics of the incoming water tan et al 2018 the supply and demand situation of sichuan province is very complicated there is much surplus water due to oversupply in flood period while the overall supply is tight during dry season in order to adapt to the characteristics of power supply sichuan province has established a spot electricity market with flood and dry seasons hydropower only participates in the spot market during wet periods and only thermal power is involved in the spot market during dry periods at present sichuan province has successively carried out the trial operation of power spot market settlement in two high water periods and three low water periods 1 2 significance with the gradual improvement of the power market power producers are faced with the choice of bidding methods that is independently or jointly with other producers to participate in the market joint bidding is necessary for cascade power stations which is driven by the following factors 1 trade of electricity in an increasingly free market the competition based market and the excessive supply of electricity have made joint bidding a useful tool for cascade hydropower stations to improve operation and power generation efficiency thus maximizing the overall benefits 2 improvement of competency working as an individual the cascade hydropower stations would bear higher cost as a result of internal conflicts it would be extremely difficult for hydropower stations of weaker competency to compete in the market on the other hand by forming alliance with other power stations the power stations would significantly improve the overall strength making them more competent in the market 3 take advantage of the coordination mechanism the joint bidding could improve the utilization of power stations at the upstream reservoir the coordination between power stations would optimize the power structure of downstream power stations improve efficiency of water resources enhance overall competency of the basin creating more benefits than power stations working alone 4 reduce operational risks the complicated relationship between cascade hydropower stations in the basin could cause waste of water resources and exerting negative effect on power generation of downstream hydropower stations the joint bidding of cascade power stations could lower the cost increase income reduce the violations of contracts on output and power generation caused by cost difference and interest conflict and enhance the abilities of power stations to perform the contract 5 avoid excessive competitions as power supply has far exceeded the demand excessive competitions among power stations would cause large scale drop in the price of electricity and deviation of its value it would be impossible for most power stations to profit from the long term equilibrium of the perfectly competitive market joint bidding among cascade power stations could lower the possibilities of irrational bidding and eliminate negative impacts from excessive competitions thus ensuring long term profits for power stations at each tier however complex characteristics of the basin like diversified investment entities overlapping power divisions and networked reservoir systems have caused the dilemma of choosing partners to form a quotation alliance for chss therefore exploring the modeling method of spot quotation alliance and the quotation effect is of great significance to the bidding decisions of power producers 1 3 literature the uncertain inflow of reservoirs increases the risk of chss participating in the market zhong et al 2013 at present the development of hydropower market in most countries and regions are still at the initial stage lin et al 2020 however scholars have conducted preliminary explorations on the related issues of chss participating in the spot market based on the operation characteristics of large scale hydropower system he et al 2020 summarized a series of key problems including optimization of chss the accommodation of hydropower in market environment and high head generating units with multiple vibration zones melo et al 2018 explored how much energy a hydropower project in brazil should be traded in the brazilian auction system and in the spot market based on stochastic simulation respectively xie et al 2020 proposed a model framework of transaction power decomposition under the mode of linking medium and long term with spot market liu and xie 2020 presented a transition approach for markets with high share renewables to connect the delivery of physical medium and long term market contracts with daily system operation considering the uncertainty of spot market prices and reservoir inflow aasgard et al 2014 built a bidding model for a multi reservoir system braun 2016 studied bidding strategies for spot and intraday auction market vlad et al 2015 presented a new method to improve the operation of the cascade in order to increase the economic efficiency on the spot market riddervold et al 2020 proposed a supervised learning approach to predict the optimal strategy in reservoir hydro for a given day to solve the problem of imbalance between bidding quantity and real quantity zhang et al 2018a built a day ahead market clearing model with multi operator chss in which the downstream station was a price taker with no need for declaring the power generation the above studies have achieved important results in spot market design yuan et al 2019 clearing models and mechanisms peng et al 2020 and cascade hydropower bidding strategies zhang et al 2018b but the spot quotation alliance modeling method of chss has not been studied yet the designation of industrial symbiosis has its genesis in biology in which symbiosis represents the association of individuals of different species in a relationship where there is mutual benefit schwarz and steininger 1997 industrial symbiosis which allows entities and companies that traditionally be separated to cooperate among them in the sharing of resources neves et al 2020 contributes to the increase of sustainability with environmental economic and social benefits yap and devlin 2017 yu et al 2015 until now there is a large amount of work on symbiosis pattern cutaia et al 2016 symbiosis benefit sokka et al 2015 liang et al 2013 symbiosis model chohaney et al 2016 and its stability wang et al 2013 wang et al 2019 based on companies such as automobiles and gas few studies have applied the symbiosis theory to cascade hydropower for example mo et al 2013a first found that symbiosis alliance could help increase the benefits of chss and the cascade symbiosis alliance in symmetry mutualisms pattern is most stable then discussed the symbiosis equilibrium stability range and revealed the symbiosis evolution law of multi owner chss mo et al 2013b however these studies lack the discussion on the components and the symbiotic effects evaluation of a chss 1 4 novelty and contribution the complex hydrologic hydraulic and electric connections tan et al 2020 force chss to seek alliance quotations while the general industrial symbiosis theory is not applicable to hydropower thus in this study we will propose a spot quotation alliance modeling method of chss based on symbiosis theory the main contributions of this work are as follows 1 based on the components explanation and symbiotic effect evaluation of a chss a quotation alliance model with the goal of maximizing the symbiotic effect is established and 2 in order to reduce blindness while retaining the autonomy of power producers a 5 stage power and price declaration strategy is proposed 1 5 paper organization the reminder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the spot quotation alliance modeling method a case study is shown in section 3 and conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methodology the methodology of this paper is mainly divided into two parts quotation alliance modeling method and bidding strategy and the main method framework is demonstrated in fig 1 2 1 spot quotation alliance modeling method 2 1 1 cascade hydropower symbiotic system in a market environment where power supply exceeds demand power producers have to compete for limited generation space due to the privacy of declaring strategies downstream stations cannot predict the bidding quantity and the amount of water discharged from the upstream stations thus failing to achieve generation autonomy this kind of competition dependence and restriction relationship between chss is similar to the dynamic symbiosis survival competition and evolutionary development of natural life therefore this paper introduces symbiosis theory to form a chss the chss is composed of 5 basic elements symbiotic unit substrate media environment and energy which are demonstrated in fig 2 symbiotic unit the basic material condition for forming a symbiotic body refers to the basic unit of energy production interaction and allocation that constitutes a symbiotic relationship in a chss each station is a symbiotic unit symbiotic environment a collection of other factors outside the symbiotic unit refers to factors of national policy socioeconomic ecological resource and power market in a chss the complementary resources are the symbiotic substrate of a chss which is the necessary condition for the symbiosis relationship symbiotic media is a collection of all the ways and mechanisms of the connections between symbiotic units which refers to the key elements to ensure the efficiency and stability of a chss such as cooperation agreement technical support system bidding strategy and revenue allocation mechanism between chss as a prerequisite for quality improvement and quantity expansion symbiotic energy is the manifestation of the survival and value added ability of the symbiotic system referring to the increase in energy production and generation revenue of a chss 2 1 2 quotation alliance model in theory all stations in a river basin form a large symbiotic system and a symbiotic system could be a quotation alliance however for large and medium sized river basins it is difficult to coordinate and manage the relationship between a large number of multi owner stations so chss can choose the symbiotic partners of the alliance maximizing the symbiotic energy is the final purpose and result of symbiosis but before the symbiosis how a station choose alliance partners is a key point this paper proposes the concept of symbiotic index which includes all aspects that may affect the symbiont and its symbiotic unit after symbiosis to help symbiotic unit to predict the effect of symbiosis before alliance the symbiotic index of a chss consists of four indicators cost competitiveness generation autonomy market power and allocation risk 1 cost competitiveness cost competitiveness is the competitive strength reflected by many participants through cost comparison the cost competitiveness of a symbiotic system is expressed by the comprehensive cost eq 1 the lower the cost the stronger the competitiveness 1 cs j s c j i c j j s i c j c m where j is the symbiotic unit index s is the symbiotic system index cs is the comprehensive generation cost of symbiotic system s c j is the per unit generation cost of symbiotic unit j i c j is the installed capacity of symbiotic unit j c m is the average generation cost of the whole market which could be replaced by benchmark price of thermal power when performing calculations 2 generation autonomy generation autonomy refers to the ability of a symbiotic system to generate electricity at its own will the process and capacity of hydropower generation are greatly affected by runoff uncertainty chen et al 2016 so the main factor considered for generation autonomy is the system s ability to regulate runoff the generation autonomy of a symbiotic system is expressed by the comprehensive storage factor eq 2 the bigger the factor the higher the autonomy 2 gs j s β j where gs represents the generation autonomy factor of symbiotic system s β j is the storage factor of symbiotic unit j the storage factor can be defined as 3 β j v j w j where v j w j represent the regulated storage and mean annual runoff of symbiotic unit j respectively 3 market power market power refers to the ability of power producers to change market prices and deviate them from the price level under full market competition under uniform clearing pricing method the price strategy of the marginal unit has an important influence on the clearing price of the whole market market power is related to the market share of each participant in the market as far as hydropower is concerned the market share can be expressed by installed capacity a symbiotic system with a larger installed capacity has a greater probability of taking on marginal units and thus has greater market power the market power of a chss can be calculated by eq 4 4 ms j s i c j tic where ms represents the market power of symbiotic system s tic equals the total installed capacity of all power producers participating in market competition 4 allocation risk allocation risk refers to the symbiotic energy allocation difficulty and risk between symbiotic units caused by the difference in installed capacity of different owners after a successful bidding the allocation risk of a chss can be expressed as 5 rs 0 o 1 i c o 1 i c o 2 o 2 0 5 o 1 o 2 o i c o 1 i c o 2 i c s o 3 where rs equals the allocation risk of symbiotic system s o is the total number of owners in the symbiotic system s o 1 o 2 are both the owner index the symbiotic index considers the combined effects of the above four factors therefore symbiotic index of a chss can be easily determined by eq 6 6 sis σ g s ς m s τ c s υ d s where sis is the symbiotic index of the symbiotic system s σ ς τ υ represent the weight coefficients of generation autonomy market power cost competitiveness and allocation risk respectively and the four coefficients shall meet the constraint below 7 σ ς τ υ 1 the entropy weight method is used to calculate the four weight coefficients mentioned above in this section entropy is the fundamental information theory quantity in information theory entropy is a measure of the uncertainty associated with a random variable the entropy weight method an objective weighting method determines the index weight according to the variation degree of each index value in a multi index decision making problem the greater the degree of variation of an indicator the smaller the information entropy and the greater the weight of the indicator let x x ij m n be the decision matrix of a multi attribute decision making problem with m schemes and n indicators the main steps of the entropy weight method are as follows a data preprocessing if there are negative numbers the data needs to be processed as non negative numbers in addition in order to avoid the meaninglessness of the logarithm when calculating the entropy value data translation is required the positive indicators are processed by eq 8 while the negative ones are processed by eq 9 8 r ij x ij x i min x i max x i min 1 9 r ij x i max x ij x i max x i min 1 where x ij represents the value of the i th indicator in the j th scheme x i max x i min equal the maximum and minimum of the i th indicator respectively r ij is the corresponding preprocessed value b indicator assimilation 10 f ij r ij i 1 m r ij where f ij is the dimensionless value of the i th indicator in the j th scheme c calculation of the entropy e i of each indicator 11 e i 1 ln m i 1 m f ij ln f ij d the entropy weight of evaluation indicators w j is calculated based on the following equation 12 w j 1 e j n j n e j taking all kinds of factors above into consideration the objective function of the spot quotation alliance formation model can be described by eq 8 that is to say chss will choose the quotation alliance partners with the goal of maximizing the symbiotic index 13 f max s i s 2 2 power and price declaration strategy 2 2 1 independent power producer according to the spot market rules in sichuan province of china power plants should declare a price for each output range and a maximum of 5 output ranges can be declared the output range should increase monotonically from the lowest technical output to the rated capacity the price of each output range should increase monotonously with the increase in output this implies that price and output should meet the constraints stated in eq 14 14 n t k j n t k 1 j p t k j p t k 1 j k k t t where t is the period index k represents the index of output range k t are the number of output range and period respectively p t k j n t k j equal the k th price and output declared of producer j at period t the original intention of staged declaration is to reduce market risk but it is challenging for power producers to declare the output and price of each stage this work proposes a differentiated declaration strategy based on the public information of the market and the private information of each power supplier 1 power declaration strategy assume that each hydropower generator declares five stages of output at each period first the producer decides the total electricity production declared for each stage within the day which would be medium and long term transaction power extreme generation capacity for the first and the fifth stage respectively as far as the total production of the middle three stages is concerned the producer could set three marketing goals named lower optimal and higher goals according to prediction accuracy of load and runoff and its own regulating performance second referring to typical decomposition curves the total production is broken down into various periods according to eq 16 based on the load curve the rules provide five typical curves d1 d5 for generators reference and this work proposes the sixth decomposition method d6 to completely track the load variation all of the six typical decomposition curves are listed in table 1 and power generators can choose any of 6 curves combined with their actual demand 15 e k j e l j 1 δ j e o j e o j 1 η j e o j e e j 16 n t k j α t k j e k j δ t t t k k where e k j is a k dimensional vector which designs the total electricity production of j th generator e l j e o j e e j represent the medium and long term transaction power optimal goals and extreme generation capacity of j th generator respectively δ j η j are the change rate of the lower and higher goals compared to the optimal goal e k j equals the total electricity production of the k th stage declared by j th generator α t k j is the k th power decomposition factor at t period of j th generator δ t is the time interval of period 2 price declaration strategy a price needs to be declared for each output range which is determined by taking the output declaration strategy market information and risk appetite of the producer into consideration the price of the first stage shall be the price floor of the market to completely consume the medium and long term transaction power in order to achieve the marketing goal the generator may declare the price of third stage according to the predicted clearing price and the price cap shall match the fifth output range this work sets up two quotation corridors for the second and fourth output ranges in which the generator could make freely choices when a price is quoted the two corridors decided by the producer according to its risk appetite are bordered by the predicted clearing price the floor of the second corridor represents the largest loss of generation revenue that a generator can withstand compared to the predicted clearing price generators have the right to determine the price cap of the fourth corridor according to the maximum additional revenue they expect to obtain compared to the predicted clearing price the second price floor shall be higher than the price floor of the market while the fourth price cap shall be lower than the price cap of the market 17 p t k j p t min r a n d 1 λ j p t f p t f p t f r a n d p t f 1 μ j p t f p t max where p t k j is a k dimensional vector which equals the declared price of jth generator at period t p t min p t max are the price floor and cap set by the rules p t f represents the predicted clearing price λ j μ j are the change rate of corridor boundaries of jth generator rand is a random sampling function 2 2 2 quotation alliance due to the difference in installed capacity regulating performance and generation cost each power producer may not have the same risk appetite and marketing goals therefore after forming a quotation alliance the producer still independently makes decisions on the output and price declaration strategy but the producers in an alliance will share relevant information including hydrological information before the decision and declaration strategies after the decision once the output and price declaration strategy of each producer is obtained the unified output and price for the alliance declared to the exchange center can be easily determined by combining eq 18 and eq 19 18 n t k a j a n t k j t t k k 19 p t k a j a p t k j n t k j n t k a t t k k where a is the index of quotation alliance n t k a p t k a are the k th output and price of quotation alliance a at period t the power and price declaration strategies for independent power producers and quotation alliances are shown in fig 3 3 case study 3 1 quotation alliance formation based on the sichuan power spot market we carry out a quotation simulation of eight hydropower generators the total installed capacity of which is up to 11070000 kw basic parameters of these stations are shown in table 2 and there are three stations a b and c that belong to the same river basin among these generators for the three stations that belong to the same basin a total of seven symbiotic subsystems can be formed in theory according to the symbiosis relationship between the chss and each symbiotic subsystem is an alternative quotation alliance for the spot market the results of symbiotic index of each symbiotic subsystem calculated by eq 6 are recorded in table 3 it is quite clear that the symbiotic index of the alliance which composed of stations a b and c is higher than other six alliances that is the three stations can get highest risk resisting capabilities when they jointly participate in market competition therefore the following analysis on the effect of the alliance s quotation will be carried out based on the alliance composed of all of the three stations 3 2 quotation effect this study divides a day into 96 periods in order to explore the quotation effect of an alliance based on the symbiotic index we set up two scenarios according to the quotation mode of the three stations in this section in scenario 1 a b and c are regarded as three independent power producers called independent quotation mode shortened to iqm and we call the scenario 2 joint quotation mode jqm which means the three stations participate in the market as an alliance the remaining 5 stations all participate in the market as independent power generators and the generators output and price declaration strategies stay the same as well as market information in both modes in order to simulate individual differences this study introduces a stochastic method on the basis of the strategy described in section 2 2 to form the power and price declaration curve of each power station for the power curve the typical decomposition curve of each generator is randomly selected from the six curves listed in table 1 and the second and fourth quotations are generated from the quotation corridors at random after the unified clearing is carried out according to the minimization of the total power purchase cost we can obtain the market share and generation revenue of each producer as well as the grid purchase cost and quotation effects on these three aspects are analyzed in detail below 3 2 1 market shares the power demand of users is often limited as a consequence each generation producer needs to obtain generation qualifications through competition especially in the current situation of oversupply of power therefore market share is an important factor affecting the revenue of power producers the structure of market shares under two quotation modes are given in fig 4 it can be seen that stations a b and c control almost 40 of the market comparing the electricity production of the eight producers won from the market under two quotation modes see table 4 it is found that stations a b and c bidding in an alliance significantly changed the structure of market shares alliance bidding has a positive effect on the total market shares of stations a b and c as well as that of station f which have risen by 2 23 and 0 14 respectively compared with iqm on the contrary the other five stations have smaller shares of the market under jqm especially station e whose market share decreased the most up to 814 53 mwh it can be easily drawn from the production and structure of the electricity that quotation in an alliance plays an obvious positive role in increasing the market share of the alliance judging from changes of the total winning output of the three stations by period as shown in fig 5 there is an increase during 44 periods and a decrease of 33 periods in the mode of alliance and the winning output for the remaining 19 periods remains unchanged in the two quotation modes as far as the increased period is concerned the winning output at the 78th period increases the most reaching 419 63 mw and the average increased output of the 44 periods is 70 02 mw there is an average change of 17 37 mw for the reduced 33 periods and the largest reduction which appears at the 84th period is 135 09 mw on the whole compared to iqm alliance quotation can increase the winning output at most periods thus improving the market shares of the alliance 3 2 2 generation revenue revenue is an important indicator that determines the success of a generator s bidding strategy table 5 and fig 6 compare the generation revenues under two quotation modes it can be easily found from fig 5 that the generation revenues of the alliance and station f under jqm are 2 13 and 0 06 higher than that under iqm respectively and the rest stations revenues have all been reduced due to the joint bidding of stations a b and c especially station e whose revenue dropped 192 800 yuan as given in table 5 the decrease is mainly due to the influence of the three stations quotation strategy when the three stations jointly participated in the market the market share of the three stations of abc increased significantly under the limited power generation space which squeezed the power generation space of other stations resulting in a significant reduction in the bid winning output of the four stations d e g and h according to the total revenue changes by period of stations a b and c in fig 7 along with the joint quotation of the three stations the total revenue during 58 periods has increased with an average of 4 100 yuan among which a largest of increase of 22 700 yuan appears at the 78th period fig 7 also indicates an average decrease of 1 200 yuan in revenue of 27 periods it is the 84th period that decreases most in revenue up to 8 600 yuan therefore with the obvious coordination function joint declaration strategy has promoted the generation revenue of the alliance and after allocation of the increased revenue each member of the alliance will inevitably obtain higher revenue than independent bidding 3 2 3 power purchase cost of the grid according to the clearing result of the grid the total power purchase costs of the grid under iqm and jqm are 34 324 200 and 34 307 300 yuan respectively which means the stations a b and c taking part in the market competition in alliance can help the grid save 16 900 yuan in power purchase cost there is no difference in load demand between the two modes so the change in market clearing price has a key impact on the total power purchase cost of the grid from the changes of market clearing price by period given in fig 8 it is obvious that there is an increase during 25 periods and a decrease during 38 periods due to the joint bidding strategy of stations a b and c for the increased periods an average change of 1 11 yuan mwh is obtained with a maximum change of 15 09 yuan mwh at fourth period the clearing price at the 23rd period has been reduced by 8 42 yuan mwh which is the largest reduction and the average reduction of 38 periods is 1 26 yuan mwh meanwhile it can be easily found that the clearing price for the rest 33 periods remains unchanged at the price cap of 253 72 yuan mwh the results of changes in market clearing price by period show that joint bidding can reduce the clearing price at most periods which is conducive to power purchase cost saving to sum up hydropower producers participating in the market with a quotation alliance formed on the basis of symbiosis theory not only can improve the market shares and generation revenue of the alliance but also can help the grid save power purchase cost 3 2 4 multi scenario quotation simulation in this study random sampling method is used to simulate the price declaration strategies of different hydropower generators at the second and fourth stages and to prove that the quotation effect is not accidental a multi scenario quotation simulation is conducted in this section a total of six price declaration strategies are set up in this section all the information is same in the six scenarios except for the price declaration strategy of the hydropower generators at the second and fourth stages wherein scenario ⅰ is the scenario described from the section 3 2 1 to section 3 2 3 the average price of the second and fourth quotations of each station is shown in fig 9 it can be seen from the figure that there are slight differences in the quotations of each power station in the six scenarios in order to express the competitive position of each power station s quotation in the market a special variable r j s k is set to represent the mapping relationship between the scenario number and the average price of the quotation r j s k r 11 k r 12 k r 1 s k r 1 s k r 21 k r 22 k r 2 s k r 2 s k r j 1 k r j 2 k r js k r js k r j 1 k r j 2 k r js k r js k where j s represent collection of hydropower stations participating in market competition and scenario collections respectively j s k equal station number scenario number and quotation stage number r js k represents the order of the average price of the k th stage of the quotation in the s th scenario of the j th power station in the market the larger the number the higher the price and the less market competitiveness in this study the order of the second stage and fourth stage quotations of the 8 power stations in the 6 scenarios is represented by r 8 6 2 and r 8 6 4 respectively in the 2nd and 4th quotations the order of the prices of the a e f and g power stations is relatively stable staying the same in the 6 scenarios among them station a has the highest quotation mainly due to the high construction cost of the high dam and large reservoir the quotation rankings of the four stations b c d and g fluctuate greatly taking the quotation at the second stage of b station as an example in scenario 1 4 and 6 station b s quotation was ranked third in scenario 2 it was fourth and in scenarios 3 and 5 it was ranked 5 r 8 6 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 3 4 5 3 5 3 6 3 3 4 3 5 5 5 6 5 4 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 4 6 4 6 6 6 r 8 6 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 6 3 5 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 4 6 5 6 6 6 5 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 4 5 3 4 6 5 table 6 illustrates the quotation effect of each quotation scenario it is obvious that in all scenarios winning power and generation revenue of the alliance composed of stations a b and c under jqm are higher than that under iqm rather power purchase cost of the grid under jqm is lower therefore joint bidding can simultaneously reduce the market risk of the alliance and the total power purchase cost of the grid which further proves the superiority and scientificity of spot quotation alliance modeling method of chss based on symbiosis theory 4 conclusions it remains challenging to make decisions on how to take part in the spot power market for chss due to the high forecast uncertainties and complex hydraulic connections between these cascade reservoirs this paper proposes a spot quotation alliance modeling method based on symbiosis theory and the spot market with eight hydropower generators from sichuan province in china is selected as a case study the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 there is a symbiotic relationship between chss particularly in the spot market environment a symbiotic index including cost competitiveness generation autonomy market power and allocation risk is proposed considering the risk of uncertainty factors such as runoff and market a spot quotation alliance model of chss is built on the basis of maximizing the symbiotic index 2 combining the public information of the market and the private information of power generators a power and price declaration strategy at five stages is proposed which reduces blindness and preserves the autonomy of generators the producer could make decisions on the power strategy according to its medium and long term transaction power marketing goals and extreme generation capacity and declare the price based on price floor and cap predicted clearing price and quotation corridors 3 according to the clearing result of the grid stations a b and c can make the total market share and generation revenue of the alliance increase by 2 23 and 2 13 respectively through joint bidding at the same time help the grid save 16 900 yuan in power purchase cost 4 the case study shows that hydropower producers participating in the market with a quotation alliance formed on the basis of symbiosis theory not only can improve the market shares and generation revenue of the alliance but also can help the grid save power purchase cost revealing the scientificity and superiority of the method proposed in this paper in this study a spot quotation alliance modeling method of chss based on symbiosis theory is proposed which is of great reference value for chss to choose quotation mode and partners mechanisms about alliance management revenue allocation and betrayal punishment need more research credit authorship contribution statement yanmei zhu writing

4206,there is a highly coupled space time hydraulic connection between cascade hydropower stations chss therefore chss cannot stand alone in market competition symbiosis is a co twin way of alliance which helps to resist variable market risk factors thus this paper proposes a spot quotation alliance modeling method of chss based on symbiosis theory first based on the components explanation and symbiotic effect evaluation of the cascade hydropower symbiotic system chss a quotation alliance formation model with the goal of maximizing the symbiotic effect is built then in order to reduce blindness while retaining the autonomy of power producers a 5 stage power and price declaration strategy is proposed the case study with eight hydropower stations in sichuan province of china shows that the three stations can get an increase of 2 23 in market shares and 2 13 in power generation revenue when forming a quotation alliance and can help the grid save 16 900 yuan in power purchase cost at the same time it reveals that jointly participating in market competition with others can not only increase the alliance s market shares and power generation revenue but also reduce the total power purchase cost of the grid keywords cascade hydropower spot market quotation alliance symbiosis theory 1 introduction 1 1 background in 2015 china introduced competition on the power generation side and the power sales side and the chinese power market officially opened in 2017 the national development and reform commission and the national energy administration of china selected 8 regions including guangdong and sichuan province as the first batch of pilot projects for the construction of power spot markets one year later the guangdong spot market started trial operation marking a new stage in china s power market at present the first batch of 8 pilot areas in the country have all started trial operation of settlement including single day multi day weekly bi weekly full month or even multiple months as the only hydro dominated power market among the eight pilot regions greatly affected by the characteristics of the incoming water tan et al 2018 the supply and demand situation of sichuan province is very complicated there is much surplus water due to oversupply in flood period while the overall supply is tight during dry season in order to adapt to the characteristics of power supply sichuan province has established a spot electricity market with flood and dry seasons hydropower only participates in the spot market during wet periods and only thermal power is involved in the spot market during dry periods at present sichuan province has successively carried out the trial operation of power spot market settlement in two high water periods and three low water periods 1 2 significance with the gradual improvement of the power market power producers are faced with the choice of bidding methods that is independently or jointly with other producers to participate in the market joint bidding is necessary for cascade power stations which is driven by the following factors 1 trade of electricity in an increasingly free market the competition based market and the excessive supply of electricity have made joint bidding a useful tool for cascade hydropower stations to improve operation and power generation efficiency thus maximizing the overall benefits 2 improvement of competency working as an individual the cascade hydropower stations would bear higher cost as a result of internal conflicts it would be extremely difficult for hydropower stations of weaker competency to compete in the market on the other hand by forming alliance with other power stations the power stations would significantly improve the overall strength making them more competent in the market 3 take advantage of the coordination mechanism the joint bidding could improve the utilization of power stations at the upstream reservoir the coordination between power stations would optimize the power structure of downstream power stations improve efficiency of water resources enhance overall competency of the basin creating more benefits than power stations working alone 4 reduce operational risks the complicated relationship between cascade hydropower stations in the basin could cause waste of water resources and exerting negative effect on power generation of downstream hydropower stations the joint bidding of cascade power stations could lower the cost increase income reduce the violations of contracts on output and power generation caused by cost difference and interest conflict and enhance the abilities of power stations to perform the contract 5 avoid excessive competitions as power supply has far exceeded the demand excessive competitions among power stations would cause large scale drop in the price of electricity and deviation of its value it would be impossible for most power stations to profit from the long term equilibrium of the perfectly competitive market joint bidding among cascade power stations could lower the possibilities of irrational bidding and eliminate negative impacts from excessive competitions thus ensuring long term profits for power stations at each tier however complex characteristics of the basin like diversified investment entities overlapping power divisions and networked reservoir systems have caused the dilemma of choosing partners to form a quotation alliance for chss therefore exploring the modeling method of spot quotation alliance and the quotation effect is of great significance to the bidding decisions of power producers 1 3 literature the uncertain inflow of reservoirs increases the risk of chss participating in the market zhong et al 2013 at present the development of hydropower market in most countries and regions are still at the initial stage lin et al 2020 however scholars have conducted preliminary explorations on the related issues of chss participating in the spot market based on the operation characteristics of large scale hydropower system he et al 2020 summarized a series of key problems including optimization of chss the accommodation of hydropower in market environment and high head generating units with multiple vibration zones melo et al 2018 explored how much energy a hydropower project in brazil should be traded in the brazilian auction system and in the spot market based on stochastic simulation respectively xie et al 2020 proposed a model framework of transaction power decomposition under the mode of linking medium and long term with spot market liu and xie 2020 presented a transition approach for markets with high share renewables to connect the delivery of physical medium and long term market contracts with daily system operation considering the uncertainty of spot market prices and reservoir inflow aasgard et al 2014 built a bidding model for a multi reservoir system braun 2016 studied bidding strategies for spot and intraday auction market vlad et al 2015 presented a new method to improve the operation of the cascade in order to increase the economic efficiency on the spot market riddervold et al 2020 proposed a supervised learning approach to predict the optimal strategy in reservoir hydro for a given day to solve the problem of imbalance between bidding quantity and real quantity zhang et al 2018a built a day ahead market clearing model with multi operator chss in which the downstream station was a price taker with no need for declaring the power generation the above studies have achieved important results in spot market design yuan et al 2019 clearing models and mechanisms peng et al 2020 and cascade hydropower bidding strategies zhang et al 2018b but the spot quotation alliance modeling method of chss has not been studied yet the designation of industrial symbiosis has its genesis in biology in which symbiosis represents the association of individuals of different species in a relationship where there is mutual benefit schwarz and steininger 1997 industrial symbiosis which allows entities and companies that traditionally be separated to cooperate among them in the sharing of resources neves et al 2020 contributes to the increase of sustainability with environmental economic and social benefits yap and devlin 2017 yu et al 2015 until now there is a large amount of work on symbiosis pattern cutaia et al 2016 symbiosis benefit sokka et al 2015 liang et al 2013 symbiosis model chohaney et al 2016 and its stability wang et al 2013 wang et al 2019 based on companies such as automobiles and gas few studies have applied the symbiosis theory to cascade hydropower for example mo et al 2013a first found that symbiosis alliance could help increase the benefits of chss and the cascade symbiosis alliance in symmetry mutualisms pattern is most stable then discussed the symbiosis equilibrium stability range and revealed the symbiosis evolution law of multi owner chss mo et al 2013b however these studies lack the discussion on the components and the symbiotic effects evaluation of a chss 1 4 novelty and contribution the complex hydrologic hydraulic and electric connections tan et al 2020 force chss to seek alliance quotations while the general industrial symbiosis theory is not applicable to hydropower thus in this study we will propose a spot quotation alliance modeling method of chss based on symbiosis theory the main contributions of this work are as follows 1 based on the components explanation and symbiotic effect evaluation of a chss a quotation alliance model with the goal of maximizing the symbiotic effect is established and 2 in order to reduce blindness while retaining the autonomy of power producers a 5 stage power and price declaration strategy is proposed 1 5 paper organization the reminder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the spot quotation alliance modeling method a case study is shown in section 3 and conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methodology the methodology of this paper is mainly divided into two parts quotation alliance modeling method and bidding strategy and the main method framework is demonstrated in fig 1 2 1 spot quotation alliance modeling method 2 1 1 cascade hydropower symbiotic system in a market environment where power supply exceeds demand power producers have to compete for limited generation space due to the privacy of declaring strategies downstream stations cannot predict the bidding quantity and the amount of water discharged from the upstream stations thus failing to achieve generation autonomy this kind of competition dependence and restriction relationship between chss is similar to the dynamic symbiosis survival competition and evolutionary development of natural life therefore this paper introduces symbiosis theory to form a chss the chss is composed of 5 basic elements symbiotic unit substrate media environment and energy which are demonstrated in fig 2 symbiotic unit the basic material condition for forming a symbiotic body refers to the basic unit of energy production interaction and allocation that constitutes a symbiotic relationship in a chss each station is a symbiotic unit symbiotic environment a collection of other factors outside the symbiotic unit refers to factors of national policy socioeconomic ecological resource and power market in a chss the complementary resources are the symbiotic substrate of a chss which is the necessary condition for the symbiosis relationship symbiotic media is a collection of all the ways and mechanisms of the connections between symbiotic units which refers to the key elements to ensure the efficiency and stability of a chss such as cooperation agreement technical support system bidding strategy and revenue allocation mechanism between chss as a prerequisite for quality improvement and quantity expansion symbiotic energy is the manifestation of the survival and value added ability of the symbiotic system referring to the increase in energy production and generation revenue of a chss 2 1 2 quotation alliance model in theory all stations in a river basin form a large symbiotic system and a symbiotic system could be a quotation alliance however for large and medium sized river basins it is difficult to coordinate and manage the relationship between a large number of multi owner stations so chss can choose the symbiotic partners of the alliance maximizing the symbiotic energy is the final purpose and result of symbiosis but before the symbiosis how a station choose alliance partners is a key point this paper proposes the concept of symbiotic index which includes all aspects that may affect the symbiont and its symbiotic unit after symbiosis to help symbiotic unit to predict the effect of symbiosis before alliance the symbiotic index of a chss consists of four indicators cost competitiveness generation autonomy market power and allocation risk 1 cost competitiveness cost competitiveness is the competitive strength reflected by many participants through cost comparison the cost competitiveness of a symbiotic system is expressed by the comprehensive cost eq 1 the lower the cost the stronger the competitiveness 1 cs j s c j i c j j s i c j c m where j is the symbiotic unit index s is the symbiotic system index cs is the comprehensive generation cost of symbiotic system s c j is the per unit generation cost of symbiotic unit j i c j is the installed capacity of symbiotic unit j c m is the average generation cost of the whole market which could be replaced by benchmark price of thermal power when performing calculations 2 generation autonomy generation autonomy refers to the ability of a symbiotic system to generate electricity at its own will the process and capacity of hydropower generation are greatly affected by runoff uncertainty chen et al 2016 so the main factor considered for generation autonomy is the system s ability to regulate runoff the generation autonomy of a symbiotic system is expressed by the comprehensive storage factor eq 2 the bigger the factor the higher the autonomy 2 gs j s β j where gs represents the generation autonomy factor of symbiotic system s β j is the storage factor of symbiotic unit j the storage factor can be defined as 3 β j v j w j where v j w j represent the regulated storage and mean annual runoff of symbiotic unit j respectively 3 market power market power refers to the ability of power producers to change market prices and deviate them from the price level under full market competition under uniform clearing pricing method the price strategy of the marginal unit has an important influence on the clearing price of the whole market market power is related to the market share of each participant in the market as far as hydropower is concerned the market share can be expressed by installed capacity a symbiotic system with a larger installed capacity has a greater probability of taking on marginal units and thus has greater market power the market power of a chss can be calculated by eq 4 4 ms j s i c j tic where ms represents the market power of symbiotic system s tic equals the total installed capacity of all power producers participating in market competition 4 allocation risk allocation risk refers to the symbiotic energy allocation difficulty and risk between symbiotic units caused by the difference in installed capacity of different owners after a successful bidding the allocation risk of a chss can be expressed as 5 rs 0 o 1 i c o 1 i c o 2 o 2 0 5 o 1 o 2 o i c o 1 i c o 2 i c s o 3 where rs equals the allocation risk of symbiotic system s o is the total number of owners in the symbiotic system s o 1 o 2 are both the owner index the symbiotic index considers the combined effects of the above four factors therefore symbiotic index of a chss can be easily determined by eq 6 6 sis σ g s ς m s τ c s υ d s where sis is the symbiotic index of the symbiotic system s σ ς τ υ represent the weight coefficients of generation autonomy market power cost competitiveness and allocation risk respectively and the four coefficients shall meet the constraint below 7 σ ς τ υ 1 the entropy weight method is used to calculate the four weight coefficients mentioned above in this section entropy is the fundamental information theory quantity in information theory entropy is a measure of the uncertainty associated with a random variable the entropy weight method an objective weighting method determines the index weight according to the variation degree of each index value in a multi index decision making problem the greater the degree of variation of an indicator the smaller the information entropy and the greater the weight of the indicator let x x ij m n be the decision matrix of a multi attribute decision making problem with m schemes and n indicators the main steps of the entropy weight method are as follows a data preprocessing if there are negative numbers the data needs to be processed as non negative numbers in addition in order to avoid the meaninglessness of the logarithm when calculating the entropy value data translation is required the positive indicators are processed by eq 8 while the negative ones are processed by eq 9 8 r ij x ij x i min x i max x i

factors above into consideration the objective function of the spot quotation alliance formation model can be described by eq 8 that is to say chss will choose the quotation alliance partners with the goal of maximizing the symbiotic index 13 f max s i s 2 2 power and price declaration strategy 2 2 1 independent power producer according to the spot market rules in sichuan province of china power plants should declare a price for each output range and a maximum of 5 output ranges can be declared the output range should increase monotonically from the lowest technical output to the rated capacity the price of each output range should increase monotonously with the increase in output this implies that price and output should meet the constraints stated in eq 14 14 n t k j n t k 1 j p t k j p t k 1 j k k t t where t is the period index k represents the index of output range k t are the number of output range and period respectively p t k j n t k j equal the k th price and output declared of producer j at period t the original intention of staged declaration is to reduce market risk but it is challenging for power producers to declare the output and price of each stage this work proposes a differentiated declaration strategy based on the public information of the market and the private information of each power supplier 1 power declaration strategy assume that each hydropower generator declares five stages of output at each period first the producer decides the total electricity production declared for each stage within the day which would be medium and long term transaction power extreme generation capacity for the first and the fifth stage respectively as far as the total production of the middle three stages is concerned the producer could set three marketing goals named lower optimal and higher goals according to prediction accuracy of load and runoff and its own regulating performance second referring to typical decomposition curves the total production is broken down into various periods according to eq 16 based on the load curve the rules provide five typical curves d1 d5 for generators reference and this work proposes the sixth decomposition method d6 to completely track the load variation all of the six typical decomposition curves are listed in table 1 and power generators can choose any of 6 curves combined with their actual demand 15 e k j e l j 1 δ j e o j e o j 1 η j e o j e e j 16 n t k j α t k j e k j δ t t t k k where e k j is a k dimensional vector which designs the total electricity production of j th generator e l j e o j e e j represent the medium and long term transaction power optimal goals and extreme generation capacity of j th generator respectively δ j η j are the change rate of the lower and higher goals compared to the optimal goal e k j equals the total electricity production of the k th stage declared by j th generator α t k j is the k th power decomposition factor at t period of j th generator δ t is the time interval of period 2 price declaration strategy a price needs to be declared for each output range which is determined by taking the output declaration strategy market information and risk appetite of the producer into consideration the price of the first stage shall be the price floor of the market to completely consume the medium and long term transaction power in order to achieve the marketing goal the generator may declare the price of third stage according to the predicted clearing price and the price cap shall match the fifth output range this work sets up two quotation corridors for the second and fourth output ranges in which the generator could make freely choices when a price is quoted the two corridors decided by the producer according to its risk appetite are bordered by the predicted clearing price the floor of the second corridor represents the largest loss of generation revenue that a generator can withstand compared to the predicted clearing price generators have the right to determine the price cap of the fourth corridor according to the maximum additional revenue they expect to obtain compared to the predicted clearing price the second price floor shall be higher than the price floor of the market while the fourth price cap shall be lower than the price cap of the market 17 p t k j p t min r a n d 1 λ j p t f p t f p t f

installed capacity regulating performance and generation cost each power producer may not have the same risk appetite and marketing goals therefore after forming a quotation alliance the producer still independently makes decisions on the output and price declaration strategy but the producers in an alliance will share relevant information including hydrological information before the decision and declaration strategies after the decision once the output and price declaration strategy of each producer is obtained the unified output and price for the alliance declared to the exchange center can be easily determined by combining eq 18 and eq 19 18 n t k a j a n t k j t t k k 19 p t k a j a p t k j n t k j n t k a t t k k where a is the index of quotation alliance n t k a p t k a are the k th output and price of quotation alliance a at period t the power and price declaration strategies for independent power producers and quotation alliances are shown in fig 3 3 case study 3 1 quotation alliance formation based on the sichuan power spot market we carry out a quotation simulation of eight hydropower generators the total installed capacity of which is up to 11070000 kw basic parameters of these stations are shown in table 2 and there are three stations a b and c that belong to the same river basin among these generators for the three stations that belong to the same basin a total of seven symbiotic subsystems can be formed in theory according to the symbiosis relationship between the chss and each symbiotic subsystem is an alternative quotation alliance for the spot market the results of symbiotic index of each symbiotic subsystem calculated by eq 6 are recorded in table 3 it is quite clear that the symbiotic index of the alliance which composed of stations a b and c is higher than other six alliances that is the three stations can get highest risk resisting capabilities when they jointly participate in market competition therefore the following analysis on the effect of the alliance s quotation will be carried out based on the alliance composed of all of the three stations 3 2 quotation effect this study divides a day into 96 periods in order to explore the quotation effect of an alliance based on the symbiotic index we set up two scenarios according to the quotation mode of the three stations in this section in scenario 1 a b and c are regarded as three independent power producers called independent quotation mode shortened to iqm and we call the scenario 2 joint quotation mode jqm which means the three stations participate in the market as an alliance the remaining 5 stations all participate in the market as independent power generators and the generators output and price declaration strategies stay the same as well as market information in both modes in order to simulate individual differences this study introduces a stochastic method on the basis of the strategy described in section 2 2 to form the power and price declaration curve of each power station for the power curve the typical decomposition curve of each generator is randomly selected from the six curves listed in table 1 and the second and fourth quotations are generated from the quotation corridors at random after the unified clearing is carried out according to the minimization of the total power purchase cost we can obtain the market share and generation revenue of each producer as well as the grid purchase cost and quotation effects on these three aspects are analyzed in detail below 3 2 1 market shares the power demand of users is often limited as a consequence each generation producer needs to obtain generation qualifications through competition especially in the current situation of oversupply of power therefore market share is an important factor affecting the revenue of power producers the structure of market shares under two quotation modes are given in fig 4 it can be seen that stations a b and c control almost 40 of the market comparing the electricity production of the eight producers won from the market under two quotation modes see table 4 it is found that stations a b and c bidding in an alliance significantly changed the structure of market shares alliance bidding has a positive effect on the total market shares of stations a b and c as well as that of station f which have risen by 2 23 and 0 14 respectively compared with iqm on the contrary the other five stations have smaller shares of the market under jqm especially station e whose market share decreased the most up to 814 53 mwh it can be easily drawn from the production and structure of the electricity that quotation in an alliance plays an obvious positive role in increasing the market share of the alliance judging from changes of the total winning output of the three stations by period as shown in fig 5 there is an increase during 44 periods and a decrease of 33 periods in the mode of alliance and the winning output for the remaining 19 periods remains unchanged in the two quotation modes as far as the increased period is concerned the winning output at the 78th period increases the most reaching 419 63 mw and the average increased output of the 44 periods is 70 02 mw there is an average change of 17 37 mw for the reduced 33 periods and the largest reduction which appears at the 84th period is 135 09 mw on the whole compared to iqm alliance quotation can increase the winning output at most periods thus improving the market shares of the alliance 3 2 2 generation revenue revenue is an important indicator that determines the success of a generator s bidding strategy table 5 and fig 6 compare the generation revenues under two quotation modes it can be easily found from fig 5 that the generation revenues of the alliance and station f under jqm are 2 13 and 0 06 higher than that under iqm respectively and the rest stations revenues have all been reduced due to the joint bidding of stations a b and c especially station e whose revenue dropped 192 800 yuan as given in table 5 the decrease is mainly due to the influence of the three stations quotation strategy when the three stations jointly participated in the market the market share of the three stations of abc increased significantly under the limited power generation space which squeezed the power generation space of other stations resulting in a significant reduction in the bid winning output of the four stations d e g and h according to the total revenue changes by period of stations a b and c in fig 7 along with the joint quotation of the three stations the total revenue during 58 periods has increased with an average of 4 100 yuan among which a largest of increase of 22 700 yuan appears at the 78th period fig 7 also indicates an average decrease of 1 200 yuan in revenue of 27 periods it is the 84th period that decreases most in revenue up to 8 600 yuan therefore with the obvious coordination function joint declaration strategy has promoted the generation revenue of the alliance and after allocation of the increased revenue each member of the alliance will inevitably obtain higher revenue than independent bidding 3 2 3 power purchase cost of the grid according to the clearing result of the grid the total power purchase costs of the grid under iqm and jqm are 34 324 200 and 34 307 300 yuan respectively which means the stations a b and c taking part in the market competition in alliance can help the grid save 16 900 yuan in power purchase cost there is no difference in load demand between the two modes so the change in market clearing price has a key impact on the total power purchase cost of the grid from the changes of market clearing price by period given in fig 8 it is obvious that there is an increase during 25 periods and a decrease during 38 periods due to the joint bidding strategy of stations a b and c for the increased periods an average change of 1 11 yuan mwh is obtained with a maximum change of 15 09 yuan mwh at fourth period the clearing price at the 23rd period has been reduced by 8 42 yuan mwh which is the largest reduction and the average reduction of 38 periods is 1 26 yuan mwh meanwhile it can be easily found that the clearing price for the rest 33 periods remains unchanged at the price cap of 253 72 yuan mwh the results of changes in market clearing price by period show that joint bidding can reduce the clearing price at most periods which is conducive to power purchase cost saving to sum up hydropower producers participating in the market with a quotation alliance formed on the basis of symbiosis theory not only can improve the market shares and generation revenue of the alliance but also can help the grid save power purchase cost 3 2 4 multi scenario quotation simulation in this study random sampling method is used to simulate the price declaration strategies of different hydropower generators at the second and fourth stages and to prove that the quotation effect is not accidental a multi scenario quotation simulation is conducted in this section a total of six price declaration strategies are set up in this section all the information is same in the six scenarios except for the price declaration strategy of the hydropower generators at the second and fourth stages wherein scenario ⅰ is the scenario described from the section 3 2 1 to section 3 2 3 the average price of the second and fourth quotations of each station is shown in fig 9 it can be seen from the figure that there are slight differences in the quotations of each power station in the six scenarios in order to express the competitive position of each power station s quotation in the market a special variable r j s k is set to represent the mapping relationship between the scenario number and the average price of the quotation r j s k r 11 k r 12 k r 1 s k r 1 s k r 21 k r 22 k r 2 s k r 2 s k r j 1 k r j 2 k r js k r js k r j 1 k r j 2 k r js k r js k where j s represent collection of hydropower stations participating in market competition and scenario collections respectively j s k equal station number scenario number and quotation stage number r js k represents the order of the average price of the k th stage of the quotation in the s th scenario of the j th power station in the market the larger the number the higher the price and the less market competitiveness in this study the order of the second stage and fourth stage quotations of the 8 power stations in the 6 scenarios is represented by r 8 6 2 and r 8 6 4 respectively in the 2nd and 4th quotations the order of the prices of the a e f and g power stations is relatively stable staying the same in the 6 scenarios among them station a has the highest quotation mainly due to the high construction cost of the high dam and large reservoir the quotation rankings of the four stations b c d and g fluctuate greatly taking the quotation at the second stage of b station as an example in scenario 1 4 and 6 station b s quotation was ranked third in scenario 2 it was fourth and in scenarios 3 and 5 it was ranked 5 r 8 6 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 3 4 5 3 5 3 6 3 3 4 3 5 5 5 6 5 4 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 4 6 4 6 6 6 r 8 6 4 8 8 8 8 8 8 6 3 5 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 4 6 5 6 6 6 5 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 4 5 3 4 6 5 table 6 illustrates the quotation effect of each quotation scenario it is obvious that in all scenarios winning power and generation revenue of the alliance composed of stations a b and c under jqm are higher than that under iqm rather power purchase cost of the grid under jqm is lower therefore joint bidding can simultaneously reduce the market risk of the alliance and the total power purchase cost of the grid which further proves the superiority and scientificity of spot quotation alliance modeling method of chss based on symbiosis theory 4 conclusions it remains challenging to make decisions on how to take part in the spot power market for chss due to the high forecast uncertainties and complex hydraulic connections between these cascade reservoirs this paper proposes a spot quotation alliance modeling method based on symbiosis theory and the spot market with eight hydropower generators from sichuan province in china is selected as a case study the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 there is a symbiotic relationship between chss particularly in the spot market environment a symbiotic index including cost competitiveness generation autonomy market power and allocation risk is proposed considering the risk of uncertainty factors such as runoff and market a spot quotation alliance model of chss is built on the basis of maximizing the symbiotic index 2 combining the public information of the market and the private information of power generators a power and price declaration strategy at five stages is proposed which reduces blindness and preserves the autonomy of generators the producer could make decisions on the power strategy according to its medium and long term transaction power marketing goals and extreme generation capacity and declare the price based on price floor and cap predicted clearing price and quotation corridors 3 according to the clearing result of the grid stations a b and c can make the total market share and generation revenue of the alliance increase by 2 23 and 2 13 respectively through joint bidding at the same time help the grid save 16 900 yuan in power purchase cost 4 the case study shows that hydropower producers participating in the market with a quotation alliance formed on the basis of symbiosis theory not only can improve the market shares and generation revenue of the alliance but also can help the grid save power purchase cost revealing the scientificity and superiority of the method proposed in this paper in this study a spot quotation alliance modeling method of chss based on symbiosis theory is proposed which is of great reference value for chss to choose quotation mode and partners mechanisms about alliance management revenue allocation and betrayal punishment need more research credit authorship contribution statement yanmei zhu writing

4207,flooding is one of the most challenging weather induced risks in urban areas however in a climate change perspective significant gaps can still be observed in literature addressing the key role of rainfall input and related variability within urban flood impact models the present research attempts to bridge this gap by investigating the effect of using a large ensemble of bias corrected euro cordex climate projections on flood hazard estimations with the goal of understanding the propagation of future climate variability in terms of flooding outputs for the urban environment with this aim a scenario analysis is performed for two return periods 10 and 200 years building on nineteen climate projections for future horizon 2071 2100 under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios by means of caddies caflood inundation model using a test case in the city of naples italy model outcomes are investigated and discussed in terms of relevant metrics and indicators available in literature targeting both general hazards evaluated in terms of runoff volumes and flooded areas and sectoral hazards specified by a number of relevant literature hazard classifications modelling outcomes are analysed and normalised with respect to baseline values representing current climate conditions to emphasize potential impacts of climate change results show that flood features increase more slowly than rainfall and the relationship between rainfall and flood increase is linear with decreasing slope with increasing return period furthermore the spread in rainfall input due to the use of different climate projections does not inflate through the impact modelling stages albeit a dependence on the indicators used to model flood impacts can be observed the outcomes of the research can be of aid to managers designers and policy makers to understand the impacts of climate change in flood prone urban areas and in perspective to adapt urban areas exploring the feasibility and effectiveness of solutions keywords caddies caflood climate change impact climate projections flood hazard flood modelling propagation of uncertainty 1 introduction flooding is one of the most challenging weather induced risks in urban areas due both to the typically high exposures in terms of people buildings and infrastructures ashley et al 2005 hlodversdottir et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 and to the uncertainties lying in the modelling of the involved physical processes kaspersen et al 2017 li et al 2019 alves et al 2020 the complexity of urban environments is so high that according to the specific focus of the analysis flood impacts are usually estimated either in general terms quantifying the extent and magnitude of flooded areas which should be only the first step of flood impact assessments according to hammond et al 2015 or targeting specific sub systems with tailored evaluations such as stage damage curves he et al 2020 and traffic disruption models forero ortiz et al 2020 kasmalkar et al 2020 detailed focus on the response of urban sub systems is often coupled with simplified approaches for flood estimation for instance it has been argued that there still exists a gap in research in giving sufficient consideration to the changes in rainfall at the urban level due to the effects of climate change and its direct effect on the change in vulnerability of transport systems metro network specifically at the local regional and global scales madsen et al 2014 forero ortiz et al 2020 in the framework of urban flood modelling accuracy and reliability of results are deeply affected by the amount and detail of data required by the adopted modelling tool cao et al 2020 costabile et al 2021 and by the spatial resolutions involved guidolin et al 2016 de almeida et al 2018 as well as by a general unavailability of flood impacts observations suitable for validation purposes wang et al 2018 macchione et al 2019 cao et al 2020 in this perspective meanwhile current literature is proactive in exploiting novel modelling tools able to reproduce flood features in the most accurate way wu et al 2020 simplified models are particularly appreciated for scenario analysis löwe et al 2017 palla et al 2018 webber et al 2019a 2019b cao et al 2020 in this case the focus is the effect of a single or a set of modelling parameters which is investigated with a comparative analysis in spite of the accuracy of each simulation this approach is particularly feasible for instance for selection screening or viability assessments of drainage solutions at pre design stage scenario analysis is particularly suitable to investigate the possible impacts of climate change whose estimation should account for the uncertainties lying in the adoption of different climate simulation chains as prescribed by the 5th assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 according to ipcc 2014 the frequency and or magnitude of precipitation events could be greatly impacted by the expected climate change donat et al 2016 papalexiou and montanari 2019 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020 tu et al 2020 primarily due to the increase in temperature entailing an increase in the atmospheric moisture retention capability however the effect of climate change on the rainfall regime of local areas is not straightforward but deeply depends on the particular local features such as latitude topography distance from the coast in this regard mediterranean area is recognized as a hot spot for climate change since climate projections are consistent in providing future drying trends that could exacerbate social and geopolitical tensions in severely water stressed regions such as north africa and middle east seager et al 2019 tuel and eltahir 2020 due to the very complex geomorphological features of the area the adoption of downscaling statistical or dynamical approaches is required to properly assess the atmospheric patterns and the associated variations under climate change zollo et al 2016 bucchignani et al 2018 jacob et al 2020 the complexity of climate modelling along with the identification of several possible future socio economic and greenhouse gas concentration scenarios representative concentration pathways rcp acting as the main forcing has generated a large number of climate projections for the next decades providing different possible scenarios for the evolution of extreme rainfall regime of local areas reder et al 2018 padulano et al 2019 as particularly concerns pluvial flooding of urban environments current scientific literature provides only a limited number of examples of impact analyses accounting for an ensemble of climate projections as described below the main difficulties mostly lie in the very large computational and storage requirements needed to deal with climate projections even more so considering the continuously increasing number of climate simulations made available to the public such as those included in the euro cordex initiative in the assumptions and post processing needed by those climate data to be made suitable for impact analyses particularly in terms of spatial and temporal scales maraun et al 2010 willems and vrac 2011 arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 and in the additional complexity required by climate models to correctly capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban climate ban et al 2021 nevertheless currently available spatial resolutions from raw climate models often prevent a reliable reproduction of precipitation patterns at very fine spatial and temporal scales sperotto et al 2016 provided a methodology for pluvial flood risk assessment in the city of venice italy in a context of climate change considering the results of a single raw climate projection under the rcp 8 5 scenario kaspersen et al 2017 considered an ensemble of ten euro cordex bias adjusted climate projections under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for a number of european cities pregnolato et al 2017 provided a framework for risk assessment due to traffic disruption simulating a climate change scenario in newcastle uk by means of a synthetic rainfall uplift assessment as provided by dale et al 2015 for the uk kaspersen and halsnæs 2017 investigated the effect of climate change on a number of urban sub systems buildings roads human health cultural assets in the city of odense denmark by using one single climate simulation chain under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios as well as the global 6 scenario martinez gomariz et al 2019 provided a wide methodology for the estimation of flood risk targeting pedestrian and vehicular traffic in badalona spain making use of one single climate projection included in euro cordex under rcp 8 5 zhou et al 2019 investigated the effect of climate change on flooding for a major city in northern china using an ensemble of low resolution bias adjusted global climate models gcms under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 gusain et al 2020 considered six gcms downscaled from their native low resolution and suitably bias adjusted in terms of both precipitation and temperature as input for hydrodynamic modelling and hazard analysis the focus is on a very large scale catchment with the main objective of building priority maps for flooded villages such a state of the art shows that on one hand the variability of climate modelling is seldom considered since only a limited number of climate projections are included in the analysis or alternatively a synthetic approach is preferred by means of the ensemble mean or relevant percentiles on the other hand the effects of such a variability are usually not the main focus of the analysis as they are often overlapped with other sources of uncertainty in the above mentioned literature the more specific is the target of the analysis for instance requiring additional post processing or modelling steps the narrower the ensemble of climate projections or scenarios adopted the proposed research attempts to bridge the gap between climate change modelling and urban flooding analysis by adopting a large ensemble of climate projections as input for urban flood modelling the goal of the analysis is that of understanding the propagation of climate variabilities in terms of flooding outputs with the particular purpose of estimating the impacts on a number of relevant urban sub systems with this aim nineteen climate projections suitably bias adjusted will be considered among those made available by the euro cordex initiative and used as input for a grid based inundation model guidolin et al 2016 different metrics and indicators will be used to analyse flood results providing information suitable for multi purpose and multi sectoral impact analysis and tailored information to quantify the response of urban services with respect to any changes in rainfall intensity as those possibly caused by climate change finally results of the involved modelling steps will be overlooked with a bird eye perspective to understand the overall propagation of the variability in climate change projections throughout the system the rest of the paper is organized as follows first for each stage of the analysis extreme climate modelling flood inundation modelling flood hazard evaluation an overview is presented to correctly position the research in the field literature and a full description of the adopted methodology is provided in order to highlight the rationale behind the choices made then a case study is presented and described along with relevant topographic and climate in situ data successively results of the consecutive modelling steps for the case study are presented finally a discussion of the impacts and limitations of the research is provided and relevant conclusions are drawn 2 rationale and methodology as fig 1 shows the workflow of the research is structured in three main modelling modules namely i the climate changes module ii the flood inundation module and iii the flood hazard module the first module builds on locally designed intensity duration frequency idf curves and spatially distributed rainfall datasets in order to identify the impacts of climate changes on the local extreme rainfall regime relying on cutting edge bias adjustment techniques the outcomes of the climate module are the main input of the second module which relies on a grid based flood inundation model with a degree of simplification acceptable for scenario analysis the third module translates flood features into relevant metrics for flood hazard estimations to investigate the potential effects of climate changes on flood risk conditions of urban environments the final step consists of integrating the results of the preceding modules to understand how the variability in the rainfall input due to the use of multiple climate projections propagates throughout the impact modelling system 2 1 climate change module raw daily precipitation data are returned by nineteen climate experiments included in the euro cordex ensemble https www euro cordex net where global climate models earth system models gcms ecms included in the 5th coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 are dynamically downscaled by using regional climate models rcms over a domain centred on europe with a horizontal resolution of 0 11 12 km currently euro cordex is the most used ensemble for impact analyses related to extreme climate due to the high number of included projections and to the added value in reproducing climate dynamics with respect to ensembles with lower horizontal resolutions jacob et al 2020 however although the increase in spatial resolution due to downscaling provides an improvement in the characterization of regional weather patterns structural uncertainties persist due for instance to the epistemic uncertainty in the knowledge of climate systems as well as to the modelling uncertainty related for example to the computationally allowable spatial resolutions and associated needed parametrizations for sub grid processes under such constraints the recognized biases in the different climate experiments prevent the adoption of raw climate outputs as inputs for impact analysis especially for extreme events where sub grid processes could play a relevant role to deal with these issues in recent years several statistical approaches have been proposed to reduce the biases assumed as systematic by adjusting climate outputs towards observed weather data used as reference over a common time period padulano et al 2019 proposed an innovative approach where the bias adjustment procedure is directly applied on idf curves which constitute the main instrument to deal with extreme rainfall chow et al 1988 wmo 2009 arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 the present research builds on the methodology proposed by padulano et al 2019 which allows for the estimation of novel intensity duration frequency curves updated to account for the effect of climate changes relying on quantile delta mapping qdm cannonet al 2015 for bias adjustment qdm is a parametric bias correction technique particularly appreciated to preserve the climate signal at all probability levels and especially for the extremes advantages are counterbalanced by the larger computational effort required to fit probability distribution models to the observations as well as to model simulation results in short qdm consists of scaling raw projected values by means of a probability dependent bias estimated as the ratio of observed to simulated for the reference period quantiles for the same probability level or return period t the governing formula for qdm applied to the annual maximum daily rainfall depth hd in mm is shown in equation 1 1 h d b c t h d p r o j t φ obs 1 t φ curr 1 t where subscripts obs curr and proj point to the annual maximum precipitation depth samples coming from the observations or alternatively from a locally available idf curve for the reference period from the model results for the same reference period and from the model results for a future horizon respectively subscript bc points to the final bias corrected values φ 1 stands for the inverse cumulative distribution of daily precipitation depths all terms refer to the same probability level or return period t in order to obtain idf curves for sub daily rainfall durations the storm index approach is applied viglione et al 2007 separately investigating the empirical dependence of mean annual maxima on rainfall duration and the probabilistic distribution of growth coefficients for the first term the same dependence estimated from the observations or alternatively from a locally available idf curve is retained assuming that it does not experience modifications in its structure due to climate changes for the second term results obtained from daily precipitation values are extended to all the durations under the assumption that annual maxima of daily rainfall are closely related to the annual maxima for a duration of 24 h accounting for those assumptions as demonstrated by padulano et al 2019 eq 1 can be rewritten as 2 h bc t t h obs t t δ m t where t points to any rainfall duration in h and hobs t t coincides with the observed or estimated by current locally available idf curves annual maximum rainfall depth for any rainfall duration t and return period t δ m is the scaling factor representing the effects of climate changes as provided by a climate projection m for example one within a larger ensemble expressed as a function of return period t in padulano et al 2019 an ensemble of nineteen climate projections was used and results were provided only in terms of ensemble mean and standard deviation instead in the present research the single members of the adopted ensemble of climate projections are retained individually in order to investigate the propagation of this source of variability through flood modelling and to better understand the effects in terms of flood features and flood hazard this also complies with recent literature suggesting that dealing with climate projections as they were independent realizations of a random variable i e analysing the ensemble as a statistical sample with a central value and a standard deviation tebaldi et al 2005 could be questioned because the different gcms rcms pairs often share assumptions and parametrizations possibly violating the assumption of statistical independence sanderson and knutti 2012 christiansen 2020 in other words although results provided by an ensemble of climate projections could cluster in a narrow space as will be demonstrated in the present research for the investigated case study this does not mean that single climate projections positioning far from the cluster should be considered as outliers namely less probable 2 2 flood inundation module caddies caflood is a flood modelling software relying on cellular automata ca and based on a square regular grid and von neumann neighbourhood ghimire et al 2013 gibson et al 2016 this model employs simple transition rules and a weight based system rather than shallow water equations to resolve the flow movement minimising the need for solving computationally expensive algorithms while maintaining high accuracy cao et al 2020 the simplified features result in significantly improved modelling efficiency ensuring reliable simulated water depths and velocities with model run times up to 8 times faster than tested benchmark models for real world applications guidolin et al 2016 caflood is able to account for spatially and temporally variant rainfall intensities and infiltration rates which must be manually fed by users as time series the main outputs consist of spatially and temporally distributed water depths and flow velocities the computational speed increase translating in no dramatic computational requirements is counterbalanced by the simplified representation of several underlying physical processes webber et al 2019b such as the effect of an artificial drainage network or the positioning of drainage interventions that can only be simulated through local cell water balance and roughness parameters such a degree of simplification makes caflood particularly useful for pre design evaluations and scenario analysis webber at al 2019a 2019b cao et al 2020 since at this stage no detailed data and information over the investigated areas are usually available moreover caflood was found to reproduce observations with fair accuracy despite the simplifying assumptions wang et al 2018 in particular the simplified representation of sewer system can be considered feasible and consistent with the usually poor availability of related data e g location and size of sewers other modelling tools share the same approach setting the infiltration rate due to the stormwater system to a reference value chosen arbitrarily cao et al 2020 or equal to the sewer network design rainfall kaspersen et al 2017 the code has been extensively validated using common benchmarks for flood propagation software packages guidolin et al 2016 although only a limited number of test cases involved purely pluvial flooding conditions 2 3 flood hazard module in case of extreme rainfall in urban contexts a cascade of adverse consequences can be identified consisting of the rainfall runoff transformation the flood and the interaction with urban sub systems such as buildings infrastructure and people in this perspective different levels of hazard can be identified stemming from different questions such as i how does the urban environment as a whole respond to extreme rainfall and ii how does a specific urban sub system respond to flooding in a climate change perspective such questions can be further attuned as i to what extent do flooding conditions change when extreme rainfall changes and ii to what extent does a service keep a certain operational level despite climate changes answering the first question requires modelling the rainfall runoff transformation process in order to understand changes e g in flooded areas flood depths and stormwater volumes this will be hereafter referred to as cumulative hazard answering the second question implies accounting for the features of the investigated sub system such as the transport network or pedestrian circulation and their interaction with flooding features this will be hereafter referred to as operational hazard although operational hazard can be regarded as a downstream effect of cumulative hazard rainfall runoff transformation models often include some urban sub systems showing a physical interaction with rainfall such as roads buildings or green areas given the complexity of modelling both processes a useful approach can consist in deriving from model simulations indicators and criteria suitable to be used as input for operational hazard estimation of the largest possible number of urban services and sub systems in the present paper cumulative and operational hazards are investigated exploiting quantities and indicators commonly adopted in the field of flood risk deployed in hazard classifications targeting one or multiple sectors as described below the simplest variables are water depth d mm and velocity v m s other variables such as flood duration will not be considered although they may have an effect on urban risks luu et al 2018 d and v are the raw output of flood modelling typically adopted to compare the outcomes of different scenarios or different modelling approaches strategies tools when the focus is on the rainfall runoff transformation indeed flood estimations focusing on flood model comparisons e g bermúdez et al 2018 on the performance of flood adaptation measures webber et al 2019a 2019b or on the impact of climate changes kaspersen et al 2017 typically compare baseline to updated scenarios by only means of water depth d or depth related variables such as flooded areas or flood volumes in such cases different arbitrary classes for d can be used according to the experienced variability interval ranging from a dry wet threshold usually set to 1 cm bermúdez et al 2018 5 cm kaspersen et al 2017 palla et al 2018 mei et al 2020 or 10 cm singh et al 2018 to a maximum value which is deeply affected by the local extreme rainfall regime and topography but mostly by the proximity to an open drainage river channel which usually causes larger flow features depth classes can be set arbitrarily by inspecting flood outcomes arrighi et al 2019 li et al 2019 he et al 2020 tanaka et al 2020 natural breaks can be used sperotto et al 2016 as well as deciles obtained inspecting the occurrence frequency of water depth within a flood map cao et al 2020 papilloud et al 2020 stretched values can also be adopted chen et al 2018 costabile et al 2020a water depth can also be used directly for hazard classification mei et al 2020 suggested six hazard classes the first in the range d 5 10 cm with incremental steps of 10 cm related to different levels of damage cao et al 2020 proposed three hazard classes starting from zero depth with incremental steps of 15 cm singh et al 2018 classified four flood severity levels as no flood 0 10 cm minor flood 10 50 cm moderate flood 50 100 cm and major flood 100 cm a similar classification is proposed by pregnolato et al 2017 but with lower thresholds 10 20 30 cm water depth d can provide focus on some operational hazards such as flood hazard for the transport services or buildings feeding threshold values for binary classifications identifying affected not affected assets for instance kramer et al 2016 suggested that roads inundated with a water depth of at least 50 cm should be closed for civil traffic for arrighi et al 2019 the threshold can be lowered to 30 cm kaspersen and halsnæs 2017 reported thresholds of 20 cm for buildings 5 cm for basements roads and railways 0 3 cm for health health issues are assumed to occur as soon as polluted storm water enters basements 20 cm for historical cultural assets incremental threshold values or hazard classes can be derived by stage damage curves such as those provided by van ootegem et al 2015 for buildings basements and related content water depth d alone or coupled with velocity related froude number fr is the main input of many investigations focused on the reduction in vehicle speed due to rainfall considered as one of the main sources of traffic disruption pregnolato et al 2017 evans et al 2020 as well as for the evaluation of flood risk for pedestrians and parked vehicles arrighi et al 2019 bocanegra et al 2018 martínez gomariz et al 2019 risk classifications can be successively derived based on the number of affected roads people or vehicles water depth d and velocity v often in terms of their combination u v d m2 s known as unit discharge feed a large number of hazard classifications targeting pedestrians russo et al 2013 and vehicles bocanegra et al 2018 a relevant example is the hazard classification proposed by the australian institute for disaster resilience aidr 2017 costabile et al 2020a identifying six hazard classes each relevant for a specific asset children elderly people vehicles buildings the total head h d v 2 2g is also adopted by kramer et al 2016 for flood hazard classification compared to a threshold of 30 cm and 60 cm for the safety of passenger cars and emergency vehicles respectively in the present paper different indicators and classifications will be adopted in order to understand the impact of climate changes at different return periods on a wide variety of outcomes targeting both cumulative and operational hazard table 1 considered interesting for the case study first a traffic oriented hazard classification will be adopted in accordance with evans et al 2020 fed by water depth d hazard model 1 second the well known u based hazard classification provided by aidr 2017 will be adopted targeting multiple assets for integrated risk assessment hazard model 2 third d will feed the threshold based classification provided by kaspersen and halsnæs 2017 again allowing for integrated risk assessment hazard model 3 however the health related threshold was removed to keep consistency with the wet dry threshold of 1 cm finally the classification based on total head h kramer et al 2016 will be considered as an alternative to the aidr classification combining depth and velocity information hazard model 4 prior to hazard evaluations two additional lumped indicators labelled runoff volume index rvi in m3 and flooded area index fai in will be analysed which aggregate information at the watershed level 3 rvi i 1 n w i d i a i 4 fai 1 s tot i 1 n w i a i where stot is the total extent of the study area n is the number of cells in the investigated area ai is the cell size di is the water depth in the cell and wi is a binary classificator assuming 0 value when di is lower than a wet dry threshold which is set to a value of 1 cm 1 otherwise in the present research both rvi and fai are only evaluated under peak conditions identified by subscript p in peak conditions each location of the case study attains its maximum water depth or velocity value experienced during the flood event which could not be concurrent in other words peak conditions do not correspond to a specific instant of the flood event but they maximize criticality for every location of the investigated area given their extremely aggregated nature those indicators are only suitable for cumulative hazard estimations and they can be used for quick preliminary understanding and comparison among different scenario outcomes peak conditions are also used for the evaluation of hazard models in table 1 with this aim the peak values of d u and h are needed the outcomes of hazard models in table 1 are represented by the area within the class awc metric expressed as a percentage of the inundable area of the case study in other words comparing the area extent where the considered indicator is within a range of predetermined values across multiple scenarios this approach has the main disadvantage of not accounting for the exact location of hazardous places in the study area however it was preferred to a cell by cell comparison due to the large number of scenarios to be simulated notice that the sum of awc across the classes of each hazard model equals faip 3 case study fuorigrotta is one of the administrative units of the city of naples located in the western part of the city fig 2 the pilot area chosen for the analysis is 2 1 km2 wide and it roughly coincides with the stormwater drainage catchment serving the neighbourhood which in turn is part of the complex and stratified combined sewer system of the city the pilot area is located along the edges of the campi flegrei volcanic system as such it can be described as a flat basin with steep edges on the north eastern side gently degrading towards the sea in south west direction fig 2 due to its peculiar topographic features the drainage efficiency of the sewer system in the area has always been limited and a large number of enhancements retrofitting and extraordinary maintenance interventions have been proposed the main concerns mostly regard the accumulation of surface runoff due to the very mild slopes in the central part of the pilot area which along with the overall poor maintenance conditions of gutters and drains makes the storm water collection difficult all the above mentioned issues have a deep influence on the rainfall runoff transformation exacerbating the flood hazard conditions of the area in turn flood risks are even more relevant considering the high exposure levels the census particles dated 2011 highlight the residential purpose of the pilot area with a population of about 40 000 and still growing and a number of highly relevant strategic assets such as the football stadium with all the satellite economic activities the railway infrastructure for public transport both local and extra urban with a large number of underground stations and the road network which is characterized by a large number of high traffic routes also in underpasses and tunnels connecting the area to the adjacent neighbourhoods and to the highway among all the above mentioned assets fig 3 the transport and road infrastructures proved to be the most vulnerable to pluvial flooding with cascading indirect damages due to service disruption caused by traffic jams potholes and railroad flooding limiting mobility both within the area and towards the city economical business centre relevant service disruptions can be observed both for small and for large return periods an example of this can be found in the very large underpass at the highway exit which is closed at every rainfall event as a precautionary measure even for small rainfall intensities with severe consequences for traffic moreover damages to underground facilities such as metro stations but also garages and basements are often experienced for those reasons this pilot area can be considered particularly interesting for pluvial flooding analysis and especially in a context of climate change in order to assess and map current and future hazard risk conditions as well as to plan adaptation strategies and measures 3 1 topographic data and land use maps different panels in fig 3 show the pilot area information that is needed for the modelling process namely i a lidar based digital terrain model http sit cittametropolitana na it lidar html providing soil elevation with a native horizontal resolution of 1 m remapped at a final resolution of 2 m considered suitable for pluvial flooding analyses wang et al 2018 and post processed to remove building footprints ii a land use classification derived from merging different land use land cover labels according to their surface drainage properties impervious areas such as roads and pedestrian areas green areas manmade pervious areas including railroads and sports facilities land use classes were assigned different roughness and infiltration rates consistently with wang et al 2018 considering for the impervious areas an infiltration rate coincident with the design extreme rainfall value for the sewer system with a return period of 2 years accounting at the same time for the sewer design return period usually 10 years and for the observed poor maintenance conditions moreover infiltration rates for green areas were differentiated according to slope referring to the fine sandy loam soil texture as suggested by kaspersen et al 2017 table 2 shows roughness and infiltration rate values for different land use classes and slopes it should be noted that the infiltration label is used consistently with software notation and related literature e g wang et al 2018 albeit it represents parametrized processes such as infiltration through green areas and sewer conveyance through drain inlets information shown in fig 3 and table 2 are used as input for the caddies caflood modelling tool coupled with extreme rainfall scenarios derived from the methodology discussed in previous section for the analyses two different return periods for the rainfall events are considered namely t 1 10 yr and t 2 200 yr consistently with the observation that urban flooding can be due to either low frequency events causing surcharge of the underground sewer systems with consequent overflowing or high frequency events caused by local unpredictable deficiencies of the drainage system palla et al 2018 urban drainage networks are usually designed for low return periods nonetheless it is quite common to understand consequences of highly extreme rainfall events in urban areas kaspersen et al 2017 martínez gomariz et al 2019 cao et al 2020 li and willems 2020 although the statistical meaning of return periods under changing climates should be carefully considered cooley 2013 3 2 rainfall data table 3 shows the members of the adopted ensemble of climate experiments exploiting six different gcm esms and eight different rcms in nineteen different combinations in case of experiments sharing same gcm esms and rcms e g members 5 and 8 in table 3 different configurations for instance in terms of parametrizations and or tuning can result in different outputs the local extreme rainfall regime for the case study under climate changes is provided by equation 2 using as observational reference the local design idf curve over the period 1971 2000 obtaining 19 idf curves expected in the future horizon 2071 2100 for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios as previously mentioned subsequent analyses focus on two relevant return periods t 1 10 yr and t 2 200 yr for a total number of 2 2 19 76 simulations under climate change plus two reference simulations under present climate conditions 4 results of the impact simulation chain 4 1 local extreme rainfall regime for the case study under climate change table 3 provides for each of the 19 climate projections the annual maximum 1 hr rainfall intensity obtained from equation 2 for the two reference return periods t 1 10 yr and t 2 200 yr and the two considered rcp scenarios the observed annual maximum 1 hr rainfall intensity provided by the design idf curve for the reference period 1971 2000 hereafter referred to as i 0 is equal to 40 4 mm h and 71 4 mm h for t 1 and t 2 respectively fig 4 shows the depth duration curves obtained by means of equation 2 for different rainfall durations as fig 4 as well as table 3 for 1 hr duration only shows variability of climate projections is a function of return period and concentration scenarios for fixed rcp scenario variability is the largest for the largest return period whereas for fixed t variability is the largest under the rcp 8 5 scenario with the effect of concentration scenario more pronounced than that of return period variability also shows an increasing dependence on rainfall duration under rcp 4 5 rainfall values appear uniformly distributed in the variability range whereas under rcp 8 5 rainfall values gather in the lower part of the range close to the reference idf curve for current climate showing a small number of significantly diverging values representing models 13 18 and 10 from the highest to the lowest rainfall depth in all cases the upper and lower bounds of the variability range correspond to models 13 and 1 respectively 1 also provides rainfall depth values lower than the observed one under rcp 4 5 for all rainfall durations 4 2 flood hazard evaluation 4 2 1 statistical features of flood related variables table 4 shows the main statistical features of the outcomes of the examined flood inundation models under peak conditions for each combination return period rcp scenario the statistical properties are referred to the complete ensemble of simulations including the baseline for each variable results are presented in terms of mean and median value standard deviation variability range skewness coefficient and variation coefficient as table 4 shows the water depth variable d exhibits a significantly skewed frequency closely followed by total head h and secondly by unit discharge u whereas flow velocity v only shows a limited although non negligible skewness coefficient consistently d and h show very small central values compared to the upper limit of the variability range and mean values roughly double than the 50th percentile mean median although to a lower extent maximum value and standard deviation uniformly increase moving from t 1 rcp 4 5 to t 2 rcp 8 5 conversely skewness shows an increasing behaviour for v but a decreasing behaviour for d and the opposite occurs for the coefficient of variation similar considerations for combined variables u and h suggest that the frequency distribution of total head is mostly affected by water depth d whereas distribution of u also accounts for the statistical features of variable v 4 2 2 cumulative hazard indicators fig 5 shows rvip and faip values for all the simulated scenarios for each return period t 1 10 years in green t 2 200 years in red rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios are identified by cross markers and triangle markers respectively however due to the distribution of simulated rainfall intensities most data points gather close to the respective baseline value represented by black markers which is also the minimum simulated rainfall value for rcp 8 5 and the second minimum value for rcp 4 5 with only a limited number of particularly high values representing climate projections 13 18 and 10 under rcp 8 5 for both metrics data points perfectly align along a regression curve with coefficient of determination r 2 98 for both indicators showing an increasing dependence of both runoff volume and flooded area on rainfall intensity faip values show that for the most critical rainfall scenario the study area is only flooded at about 40 with d 1 cm the structure of the dependence is power like in both cases with rvip and faip gradually increasing with i with a power of about 0 5 in both cases for about i 60 mm h the last part of both curves can be considered linear 4 2 3 operational hazard models fig 6 shows for each return period the amount of pilot area subject to hazard indicators d u and h classified according to the criteria identified in table 1 as a function of rainfall intensity i for each hazard model hazard classes are labelled from 1 which identifies the lowest hazard level to 3 highest hazard for the 3 class repartition criterium or 5 highest hazard for the 6 class repartition criterium where the sixth hazard class in table 1 was never attained consistently with table 3 and fig 5 moving from the lowest to the highest rainfall intensity in each panel of fig 6 corresponds to moving from rcp 4 5 to rcp 8 5 moving from left panel to right panel for each row of fig 6 corresponds to moving from t 1 to t 2 with data points gathering along the same curve partitioned in two panels to improve visual inspection for each hazard class similarly to rvip and faip in fig 5 the wide overlap between the two concentration scenarios for each of the investigated return periods makes the visual discrimination between rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 hardly possible in all the panels of fig 6 the baseline values are also shown as black markers pointing to the hazardous area values awc under present climate conditions for both return periods in all the examined scenarios the widest portion of the pilot area is subject to the lowest hazard with awc values always higher than 10 whereas the hazardous surface decreases with increasing hazard level for all the hazard models the dependence of awc on rainfall intensity is a function of the hazard class specifically all hazard classifications show a lowest class h1 corresponding to a low hazard condition where all the indicator values are lower than the minimum threshold with an almost constant awc value which is also the maximum among the classes implying that most of the pilot area with a percentage always higher than 10 is subject to the lowest hazard due to inundation despite experiencing a water depth 1 cm for increasing hazard level the hazardous area decreases on average and the dependence on rainfall increases for the highest hazard classes see for example awc 2 the amount of exposed pilot area attains very small values lower than 0 1 but the dependence on rainfall intensity is significant in the entire range of investigated rainfall scenarios the different hazard classifications show a relevant similarity especially in the estimation of the area exposed to a low hazard h1 the classifications based on water depth d hazard models 1 and 3 show a direct consistency with the statistical properties of water depth shown in table 4 so that the lower is the threshold the higher is the area characterized by a water depth lower or equal to the threshold for instance the amount of wet area exposed to d 10 cm h1 for hazard model 1 is larger than that exposed to d 5 cm h1 for hazard model 3 and the amount of wet area exposed to d 30 cm h3 for hazard model 1 is smaller than that exposed to d 20 cm h3 for hazard model 3 the classifications based on derived variables hazard models 2 and 4 show a different behaviour compared to the d based classifications especially in the estimation of higher hazard classes presumably due to the effect of the velocity parameter specifically the awc curves for h2 and h3 classes swap their position for the highest rainfall intensities under t 1 for hazard model 2 and for both return periods for hazard model 4 this happens because whereas awc values for h3 constantly increase with increasing i awc values for h2 increase at first with i and then they decrease or reach a plateau with increasing i for about i 50 mm h for t 1 and for about i 120 mm h for t 2 this behaviour should not be considered anomalous since both quantities h and u build on two variables d and v which are often opponent in each cell of the domain there usually are either high depths and low velocities or low depths and high velocities and the trend of their summation or product cannot be predicted a priori because it is very site specific for hazard model 2 in the range of t 2 the amount of pilot area exposed to h3 hazard is larger than that exposed to h2 hazard for every simulated rainfall intensity finally comparison of h1 h2 and h3 values between hazard models 2 and 4 shows that the two criteria are substantially coincident 4 3 analysis of normalized indicators as shown in the results section the raw outcomes of flood inundation modelling d v and related variables strictly depend on the rainfall intensity value used as input this is particularly evident in fig 5 for cumulative hazard metrics where the increase in rainfall intensity with respect to the baseline conditions is found to be the only predictor of the increase in peak runoff volumes and flooded areas however the present research is particularly oriented to understand if and to what extent flood hazard is affected by changes in climate conditions and this depends not only on the rainfall input but also on the hazard model adopted as shown by figs 6 and 7 for example the amount of area affected by any assigned level of flooding proves to be diversely affected by any increase in rainfall values compared to the baseline conditions in other words increases in rainfall values as those provided by climate change under the same return period provide different increase in the affected areas with this aim this section provides an analysis of normalized indicators in other words results shown in figs 5 7 are rearranged so that each metric x is represented by its normalized value x x x 0 where x 0 corresponds to baseline conditions 4 3 1 normalized cumulative hazard indicators fig 7 shows normalized peak indicators r v i p rvi p rvi p 0 and f a i p fai p fai p 0 as a function of normalized rainfall intensity i i i 0 for all the exploited scenarios which were dimensionally represented in fig 5 for fixed return periods moving from rcp 4 5 to rcp 8 5 implies increasing rainfall intensity values table 3 so that data points continuously develop along a line from the smallest to the largest abscissa however two different lines occur for the two investigated return periods due to the different reference conditions in the range of investigation the behaviour can be effectively considered linear with a coefficient of determination r 2 higher than 98 in all cases for fixed return period fig 7 shows that the transformation of rainfall into runoff can be represented by a linear relation between the considered normalized variables the equations for the regression lines shown in each panel are such that a unitary increase in rainfall does not imply a unitary change in flooding conditions in terms of either runoff volume or flooded area this confirms the recognized non linearity of the rainfall runoff transformation todini 1988 which is represented in fig 7 by means of the 1 1 line the functional form of the regression lines as well as the parameters values depend on the overall features of the case study judged relevant for the rainfall runoff transformation neglected or simplified processes such as the role of infiltration and the effect of the drainage network may alter observed linearity among the experienced return periods regression lines of t 2 data points show a lower slope implying that the more critical is the baseline scenario the lower can be the increase in criticality due to an increase in rainfall with respect to baseline this is particularly obvious for fai p since flooded area cannot overcome 100 although only two return periods are examined in the research it is expected that the slope of the regression line decreases with increasing return period the aspect and location of the regression line could be altered by modifying drainage characteristics for instance including adaptation measures in this perspective the diagram proposed in fig 8 could act as an abacus driving the selection of interventions and providing information about the feasibility and effectiveness of selected actions for example one or multiple interventions could be simulated with the desired effect of decreasing the slope of the regression line compared to the reference condition e g that referring to present climate and drainage settings so that extreme events would cause lower flood levels it is worth noting that as fig 7 shows normalized flooded area increases to a lower extent than runoff volume with increasing normalized rainfall intensity in other words when using diagrams such as the one proposed in fig 7 for viability analysis of adaptation measures the same performance in terms of slope reduction cannot be ensured for both indicators at the same time 4 3 2 normalized operational hazard model results fig 8 shows the same results shown in fig 6 but provides on the vertical axis normalized values awc namely the ratio of awc to the baseline value awc 0 whereas normalized intensity values are used for the horizontal axis for each hazard model and each hazard class two curves are provided corresponding to t 1 solid line and t 2 dashed line for each curve increasing i implies moving from rcp 4 5 to rcp 8 5 scenario in all cases for fixed i awc is always higher for the smaller return period this is expected since t 1 is characterized by smaller intensity values than t 2 corresponding to the lower branches of all curves in left panels of fig 6 where the change in awc with i is still non negligible compared to the flat curves in right panels of fig 6 for hazard models 1 and 3 for assigned normalized intensity and return period normalized awc increases with increasing hazard level in other words any increase in rainfall intensity causes an increase in the extent of exposed areas which is more significant for the highest hazard levels the behaviour is quite similar between models 1 and 3 with the evident exception of h3 class for t 1 scenarios where hazard model 1 provides a significantly larger inflation of exposed areas for instance for the t 1 scenario inflating rainfall intensity by 1 5 in other words increasing baseline intensity by 50 implies inflating areas exposed to h3 by 2 2 according to hazard model 1 by 1 7 according to hazard model 3 the classifications based on derived variables hazard models 2 and 4 roughly confirm the above mentioned results consistently with fig 6 h2 and h3 show an opposite trend in the range of t 1 intensity values with the h3 curve monotonically increasing and the h2 increasing but less than h3 and then slightly decreasing with increasing intensity which reflects in the elbow shown in fig 8 for both hazard models for hazard model 2 h4 and h5 curves in fig 8 show a very rapid increase in exposed areas with normalized intensity for instance more than triplicating with doubling rainfall intensity although with some erratic behaviours especially for the smaller i values probably due to the fact that awc 2 values for those classes are very small fig 6 and possibly affected by estimation errors and approximations 4 4 flood hazard mapping fig 9 shows the hazard maps provided by caddies caflood for the most critical rainfall scenario characterized by a return period t 2 200 years under the rcp 8 5 concentration scenario for the climate projection 13 corresponding to a rainfall intensity i 209 mm h in fig 9 only three flood hazard classifications are represented namely the classification based on unit discharge u hazard model 2 the classification based on water depth d hazard model 3 and the classification based on total head h hazard model 4 hazard model 1 can be considered redundant as already mentioned in previous sections lacking flood observations in the case study for validation purposes hazard maps in fig 9 should be only analysed in comparison among different rainfall scenarios however a fair significance of results can be assessed considering that the inundation model correctly captures critical spots such as the underpass the areas adjacent to the football stadium and the entrance of the railway station hazard model 2 particularly emphasizes critical conditions at the entrance of the underpass whereas hazard model 3 provides a non negligible high hazard level for the main railroad results of hazard model 4 can be considered similar to 2 but with the highest hazard levels condensed in a unique class the outcomes of flood hazard mapping show that for the case study the adopted criteria are poorly selective implying that most of the pilot area comes under the lowest hazard class whereas a very small portion of the domain is assigned to the highest hazard levels this is consistent with the statistical properties reported in table 4 compared to the threshold values for hazard models in table 1 with median values for all variables not far from the lowest thresholds coupled to a deeply skewed distribution 4 5 mapping the propagation of climate projections variability fig 10 shows for each return period and each concentration scenario and for each climate simulation chain the path of normalized variables representative of all the steps of the modelling chain i the climate change module it accounts for projection uncertainties e g ipcc socio economic and greenhouse gas concentration scenarios climate model assumptions parametrizations discretization as well as bias correction it is represented in fig 10 by normalized annual maximum 1 hr rainfall intensity i ii the flood inundation module it accounts for the uncertainties proper of the rainfall runoff transformation modelling assumptions parametrizations discretization along with previous variabilities among the investigated variables normalized mean µ and standard deviation σ of water depth d and flow velocity v occurring over the pilot area are considered in fig 10 iii the cumulative hazard modelling in fig 10 normalized fai p and rvi p are chosen these indicators can be considered representative of the inundation modelling as well since they only depend on water depth d iv the operational hazard modelling it accounts for the arbitrariness in the definition of threshold values for hazard classification along with previous variabilities normalized awc is chosen as representative with awc values computed for the lowest hazard class for each hazard model in table 1 shortened as h1 in fig 10 h1 class was preferred since it is the most represented hazard level for all hazard models the radar graph in fig 10 was considered the most effective tool to visually map and inspect results since it is acknowledged as particularly suitable to show multivariate data each of the normalized indicators identified in i iv is assigned an axis with a common origin at the center of the graph each line maps the main outcomes of each single flood simulation starting from rainfall intensity vertical axis i and entry point for the radar graph lines moving clockwise through raw flood features axes from µ d to σ v and cumulative hazard features axes fai p and rvi p and ending at the operational hazard features axis from h1 1 to h1 4 fig 10 shows that the spread in rainfall values used as input which is due to the use of an ensemble of climate experiments table 3 slightly reduces moving from climate change modelling to flood modelling implying a dampening effect of the flood modelling for all scenarios in other words a given increase in rainfall intensity with respect to present climate causes a lower increase in water depth features particularly in the mean values and in flow velocity features particularly in the standard deviation in turn moving towards hazard modelling causes variability to inflate with respect to flood modelling but keeping within a similar level with respect to rainfall variability among all the hazard metrics variability in rvi p proves to be the most inflated results of the four tested hazard models can be considered coincident variability in h1 along with variability in fai p attains values similar to variability in rainfall this is especially true for the rcp 4 5 scenarios which exhibit the lowest variability in rainfall increase with respect to the baseline with i always lower than 1 5 instead for the rcp 8 5 scenarios showing larger rainfall variability with maximum i almost equal to 2 and 3 for t 1 and t 2 respectively a dampening effect of the hazard modelling can be appreciated in addition to the mitigating effect of the rainfall runoff transformation the behaviour of single climate simulation chains is consistent throughout the process implying that the climate projections providing the highest increase in rainfall intensity also provide the highest increase in all the other metrics this is particularly visible for t 2 under rcp 8 5 where lines representing single climate experiments are concentric and never intersect finally as also shown in fig 7 and fig 8 for both rcp scenarios variability in normalized metrics is narrower for t 2 than for t 1 implying that alterations due to the effect of climate change are not evenly distributed for all magnitudes of rainfall events the hazard source so that more significant changes with respect to present climate should be expected for the less critical events as a final comment fig 10 shows that the total spread in all the considered normalized variables keeps within the circle corresponding to the maximum experienced i which is roughly equal to 1 3 for t 1 rcp 4 5 corresponding to an increase in rainfall intensity of 30 with respect to baseline 2 for t 1 rcp 8 5 corresponding to an increase of 100 1 3 for t 2 rcp 4 5 corresponding to an increase of 30 and 3 for t 2 rcp 8 5 corresponding to an increase of 200 the only exception being rvi p under rcp 4 5 scenarios within those circles normalized statistical properties exhibit a significantly narrower variability range for all the simulated scenarios 5 discussion 5 1 limitations of the work and future developments the choice of the flood modelling tool and related parametrizations including simplified infiltration process and sewer system conveyance may have an influence on the outcomes of the research that could constitute promising ground for further research comparing for instance the adopted flood model both to more complex tools explicitly accounting e g for the presence of a sewer system and to expeditious models usually only accounting for the elevation layout due to the lack of flood observations which is a very common situation in practical applications although usually accepted for scenario analyses as discussed in the introduction it was not possible to validate the accuracy of results for any rainfall event but it was only possible to check consistency of results basing on visual inspection of flood maps and expert judgment the observed skewness in flood depths resulting from the flood inundation model causes the extent of hazardous areas to significantly reduce with increasing hazard level resulting in very small areas exposed to the highest hazard under future as well as present climate although an asymmetric distribution skewed towards small depths should be generally expected the flat layout of the domain could deeply affect flood features because the distribution of water depths is significantly uniform with a limited number of outlying locations corresponding to specific elements of the built environment such as the underpass furthermore questions arise about the representativeness of the adopted hazard models for the pilot area most of the highly hazardous areas were expected such as the underpass however tangible experience of the site suggests that perceived hazard is higher even for rainfall events with lower frequency in addition some hazard models such as aidr 2017 fail to capture non negligible risks that are captured by others this could be explained noting that flood hazard models are often conceived for fluvial flooding with usually larger water depths and velocities and considerable damages to the exposed assets with highly critical consequences on their structural integrity e g closed streets or transport service instead purely pluvial flooding conditions may affect exposed assets especially at the operational level e g traffic jams delays and this may not be efficiently captured by those hazard models in any case propagation of variability due to the adoption of an ensemble of climate projections throughout the impact simulation chain was mapped using variables that were normalized by means of the corresponding baseline values referring to present climate this reasonably ensures that results shown in fig 10 as well as the overall methodology can be considered valuable despite the simplifications and possible inaccuracies caused by the flood inundation model governing equations numerical scheme parametrizations for simplified processes as well as by the particular choice of hazard metrics 5 2 potential impacts on the related literature despite the limitations highlighted in the previous section the main findings of this research may have several impacts on the related literature with specific reference to the estimation of climate change impacts on flooding and the use of flood modelling tool this paper proposes a multi purpose impact analysis based on cumulative and operational hazards indicators in this sense the work offers novel points of view for those lines of research involved in the development of flood indices to identify spatial patterns of flood risk within a given studied areas xu et al 2019 shadmehri toosi et al 2020 moreover some of the indicators considered here such as rvi and fai can be considered similar to other synthetic parameters analyzed in the literature see for example löschner et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 confirming their value when dealing with urban flood hazard assessment in a climate change context the outcomes of the research can be of aid to water infrastructure managers designers and policy makers when dealing with the impacts of climate change in flood prone urban areas and its relationship with the effects of increasing urbanization mahmoud and gan 2018 furthermore the impact simulation chain proposed in this paper can be further used for other purposes such as the quantification of benefits related to climate change adaption measures which have been devoted particular attention in the recent literature see for example zhou et al 2018 ghodsi et al 2020 it is also important to underline the potential impact of this research for urban flood modelers with particular reference to the application of caddies caflood model this numerical code was extensively applied for classic flood propagation situations guidolin et al 2016 and only recently it has been also used for rain on grid simulation wang et al 2018 where the rainfall input is directly considered within the hydrodynamic model it should be recalled that these simulations are very challenging from a numerical point of view cea and bladé 2015 and due to the increasing use in the literature for both basin scale i e ferraro et al 2020 and urban scale i e guo et al 2021 applications further evidence is required about the suitability of the software package for pluvial flooding costabile et al 2020b as finally concerns the climate change perspective in the field of urban flooding the paper presents a unique example of propagating the spread in rainfall coming from a large ensemble of climate projections throughout a comprehensive modelling chain from the quantification of local effects of climate change up to flood hazard evaluations the main difference with similar outcomes such as those shown by kaspersen et al 2017 lies in the decision of mapping the results of each flood simulation taking as input a specific rainfall value separately this approach stems from the assumption that each different climate projection provides an equiprobable future rainfall scenario rejecting the common idea that particularly high future extreme rainfall values are outliers and consequently less credible than the moderate ones 6 conclusions and lessons learnt a complete impact simulation chain was performed consisting of a climate change modelling module an urban flood modelling module and a flood hazard modelling module analyses were performed for two different return periods t 1 10 years and t 2 200 years for the test case of fuorigrotta city of naples italy the paper fills the current gap in the analysis of climate change impacts on urban flooding by relying on a full ensemble of climate projections reflecting the use of a large ensemble of climate experiments derived from different gcms esms coupled with different rcms under different rcp scenarios where single members were considered equiprobable in opposition to current impact literature usually targeting ensemble mean and standard deviation or relevant percentiles the main goal of the research consisted in understanding how the variability in the rainfall input propagated within the system and reflected onto the urban environment and related sub systems despite the above mentioned limitations the following conclusions can be drawn variability of climate projections is a function of return period and concentration scenarios for fixed rcp variability is the largest for the largest return period whereas for fixed t variability is the largest under rcp 8 5 with the effect of concentration scenario more pronounced than that of return period raw output variables of flood inundation model exhibit a considerably asymmetrical distribution with very large skewness coefficients for water depth closely followed by total head and unit discharge and smaller skewness values for flow velocity analysis of cumulative hazard indicators shows that runoff volumes and flooded areas increase with increasing rainfall with a power of about 0 5 this implies that with respect to current climate for a fixed increase in rainfall the increase in both flood indicators has a magnitude which decreases with increasing return period for the lower return period the increase in runoff volumes is roughly equal to the increase in rainfall whereas it is smaller for the higher return period the experienced increase in flooded areas is always smaller than the increase in rainfall probably due to the elevation features of the pilot area although this testifies the nonlinearity of the rainfall runoff transformation the relationship between rainfall increase and flood features increase was found to be linear for all return periods analysis of operational hazard indicators show that for increasing hazard level the extent of hazardous areas decreases and the dependence on rainfall becomes more marked for fixed hazard level hazardous areas are closely related to rainfall only for small intensities namely 10 yr return period under rcp 4 5 and then stabilize with respect to current climate for fixed return period the extent of hazardous areas increases more rapidly with increasing rainfall for higher than for lower hazard levels for fixed hazard inflation of hazardous areas is more evident for 10 yr than for 200 yr rainfall scenarios mapping the propagation of rainfall variability through the impact simulation chain in terms of normalized indicators shows that the spread in normalized rainfall input envelopes the variability range of all subsequent modelling steps including raw flood modelling outputs cumulative and operational hazard indicators the envelope spread is roughly equal to 1 3 for t 1 rcp 4 5 corresponding to an increase in rainfall intensity of 30 with respect to current climate 2 for t 1 rcp 8 5 increase of 100 1 3 for t 2 rcp 4 5 increase of 30 and 3 for t 2 rcp 8 5 increase of 200 on one hand this confirms that the higher the return period the lower the increase in flood indicators in comparison on the other hand this demonstrates that concentration scenarios play a predominant role in the allocation of variability in the input and as a consequence in the output with e g t 1 rcp 8 5 scenario providing a higher increase in flood criticality than t 2 rcp 4 5 in terms of input data computational effort and reliability and versatility of the outputs the adopted inundation model provides a balance between expeditious tools often relying on elevation only and comprehensive hydrodynamic models usually fed by a large amount of detailed input data this makes the impact simulation chain particularly suitable to be used for scenario analysis under climate change the research provides a methodological framework that can be tailored to meet specific requirements and needs adopting for instance different gcms rcms couplings or bias adjustment techniques different flood models or different hazard indicators as a future perspective this framework can be used to explore different uncertainty sources within the impact simulation chain as well as the feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation measures to reduce flood

4207,flooding is one of the most challenging weather induced risks in urban areas however in a climate change perspective significant gaps can still be observed in literature addressing the key role of rainfall input and related variability within urban flood impact models the present research attempts to bridge this gap by investigating the effect of using a large ensemble of bias corrected euro cordex climate projections on flood hazard estimations with the goal of understanding the propagation of future climate variability in terms of flooding outputs for the urban environment with this aim a scenario analysis is performed for two return periods 10 and 200 years building on nineteen climate projections for future horizon 2071 2100 under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios by means of caddies caflood inundation model using a test case in the city of naples italy model outcomes are investigated and discussed in terms of relevant metrics and indicators available in literature targeting both general hazards evaluated in terms of runoff volumes and flooded areas and sectoral hazards specified by a number of relevant literature hazard classifications modelling outcomes are analysed and normalised with respect to baseline values representing current climate conditions to emphasize potential impacts of climate change results show that flood features increase more slowly than rainfall and the relationship between rainfall and flood increase is linear with decreasing slope with increasing return period furthermore the spread in rainfall input due to the use of different climate projections does not inflate through the impact modelling stages albeit a dependence on the indicators used to model flood impacts can be observed the outcomes of the research can be of aid to managers designers and policy makers to understand the impacts of climate change in flood prone urban areas and in perspective to adapt urban areas exploring the feasibility and effectiveness of solutions keywords caddies caflood climate change impact climate projections flood hazard flood modelling propagation of uncertainty 1 introduction flooding is one of the most challenging weather induced risks in urban areas due both to the typically high exposures in terms of people buildings and infrastructures ashley et al 2005 hlodversdottir et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 and to the uncertainties lying in the modelling of the involved physical processes kaspersen et al 2017 li et al 2019 alves et al 2020 the complexity of urban environments is so high that according to the specific focus of the analysis flood impacts are usually estimated either in general terms quantifying the extent and magnitude of flooded areas which should be only the first step of flood impact assessments according to hammond et al 2015 or targeting specific sub systems with tailored evaluations such as stage damage curves he et al 2020 and traffic disruption models forero ortiz et al 2020 kasmalkar et al 2020 detailed focus on the response of urban sub systems is often coupled with simplified approaches for flood estimation for instance it has been argued that there still exists a gap in research in giving sufficient consideration to the changes in rainfall at the urban level due to the effects of climate change and its direct effect on the change in vulnerability of transport systems metro network specifically at the local regional and global scales madsen et al 2014 forero ortiz et al 2020 in the framework of urban flood modelling accuracy and reliability of results are deeply affected by the amount and detail of data required by the adopted modelling tool cao et al 2020 costabile et al 2021 and by the spatial resolutions involved guidolin et al 2016 de almeida et al 2018 as well as by a general unavailability of flood impacts observations suitable for validation purposes wang et al 2018 macchione et al 2019 cao et al 2020 in this perspective meanwhile current literature is proactive in exploiting novel modelling tools able to reproduce flood features in the most accurate way wu et al 2020 simplified models are particularly appreciated for scenario analysis löwe et al 2017 palla et al 2018 webber et al 2019a 2019b cao et al 2020 in this case the focus is the effect of a single or a set of modelling parameters which is investigated with a comparative analysis in spite of the accuracy of each simulation this approach is particularly feasible for instance for selection screening or viability assessments of drainage solutions at pre design stage scenario analysis is particularly suitable to investigate the possible impacts of climate change whose estimation should account for the uncertainties lying in the adoption of different climate simulation chains as prescribed by the 5th assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 according to ipcc 2014 the frequency and or magnitude of precipitation events could be greatly impacted by the expected climate change donat et al 2016 papalexiou and montanari 2019 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020 tu et al 2020 primarily due to the increase in temperature entailing an increase in the atmospheric moisture retention capability however the effect of climate change on the rainfall regime of local areas is not straightforward but deeply depends on the particular local features such as latitude topography distance from the coast in this regard mediterranean area is recognized as a hot spot for climate change since climate projections are consistent in providing future drying trends that could exacerbate social and geopolitical tensions in severely water stressed regions such as north africa and middle east seager et al 2019 tuel and eltahir 2020 due to the very complex geomorphological features of the area the adoption of downscaling statistical or dynamical approaches is required to properly assess the atmospheric patterns and the associated variations under climate change zollo et al 2016 bucchignani et al 2018 jacob et al 2020 the complexity of climate modelling along with the identification of several possible future socio economic and greenhouse gas concentration scenarios representative concentration pathways rcp acting as the main forcing has generated a large number of climate projections for the next decades providing different possible scenarios for the evolution of extreme rainfall regime of local areas reder et al 2018 padulano et al 2019 as particularly concerns pluvial flooding of urban environments current scientific literature provides only a limited number of examples of impact analyses accounting for an ensemble of climate projections as described below the main difficulties mostly lie in the very large computational and storage requirements needed to deal with climate projections even more so considering the continuously increasing number of climate simulations made available to the public such as those included in the euro cordex initiative in the assumptions and post processing needed by those climate data to be made suitable for impact analyses particularly in terms of spatial and temporal scales maraun et al 2010 willems and vrac 2011 arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 and in the additional complexity required by climate models to correctly capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban climate ban et al 2021 nevertheless currently available spatial resolutions from raw climate models often prevent a reliable reproduction of precipitation patterns at very fine spatial and temporal scales sperotto et al 2016 provided a methodology for pluvial flood risk assessment in the city of venice italy in a context of climate change considering the results of a single raw climate projection under the rcp 8 5 scenario kaspersen et al 2017 considered an ensemble of ten euro cordex bias adjusted climate projections under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for a number of european cities pregnolato et al 2017 provided a framework for risk assessment due to traffic disruption simulating a climate change scenario in newcastle uk by means of a synthetic rainfall uplift assessment as provided by dale et al 2015 for the uk kaspersen and halsnæs 2017 investigated the effect of climate change on a number of urban sub systems buildings roads human health cultural assets in the city of odense denmark by using one single climate simulation chain under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios as well as the global 6 scenario martinez gomariz et al 2019 provided a wide methodology for the estimation of flood risk targeting pedestrian and vehicular traffic in badalona spain making use of one single climate projection included in euro cordex under rcp 8 5 zhou et al 2019 investigated the effect of climate change on flooding for a major city in northern china using an ensemble of low resolution bias adjusted global climate models gcms under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 gusain et al 2020 considered six gcms downscaled from their native low resolution and suitably bias adjusted in terms of both precipitation and temperature as input for hydrodynamic modelling and hazard analysis the focus is on a very large scale catchment with the main objective of building priority maps for flooded villages such a state of the art shows that on one hand the variability of climate modelling is seldom considered since only a limited number of climate projections are included in the analysis or alternatively a synthetic approach is preferred by means of the ensemble mean or relevant percentiles on the other hand the effects of such a variability are usually not the main focus of the analysis as they are often overlapped with other sources of uncertainty in the above mentioned literature the more specific is the target of the analysis for instance requiring additional post processing or modelling steps the narrower the ensemble of climate projections or scenarios adopted the proposed research attempts to bridge the gap between climate change modelling and urban flooding analysis by adopting a large ensemble of climate projections as input for urban flood modelling the goal of the analysis is that of understanding the propagation of climate variabilities in terms of flooding outputs with the particular purpose of estimating the impacts on a number of relevant urban sub systems with this aim nineteen climate projections suitably bias adjusted will be considered among those made available by the euro cordex initiative and used as input for a grid based inundation model guidolin et al 2016 different metrics and indicators will be used to analyse flood results providing information suitable for multi purpose and multi sectoral impact analysis and tailored information to quantify the response of urban services with respect to any changes in rainfall intensity as those possibly caused by climate change finally results of the involved modelling steps will be overlooked with a bird eye perspective to understand the overall propagation of the variability in climate change projections throughout the system the rest of the paper is organized as follows first for each stage of the analysis extreme climate modelling flood inundation modelling flood hazard evaluation an overview is presented to correctly position the research in the field literature and a full description of the adopted methodology is provided in order to highlight the rationale behind the choices made then a case study is presented and described along with relevant topographic and climate in situ data successively results of the consecutive modelling steps for the case study are presented finally a discussion of the impacts and limitations of the research is provided and relevant conclusions are drawn 2 rationale and methodology as fig 1 shows the workflow of the research is structured in three main modelling modules namely i the climate changes module ii the flood inundation module and iii the flood hazard module the first module builds on locally designed intensity duration frequency idf curves and spatially distributed rainfall datasets in order to identify the impacts of climate changes on the local extreme rainfall regime relying on cutting edge bias adjustment techniques the outcomes of the climate module are the main input of the second module which relies on a grid based flood inundation model with a degree of simplification acceptable for scenario analysis the third module translates flood features into relevant metrics for flood hazard estimations to investigate the potential effects of climate changes on flood risk conditions of urban environments the final step consists of integrating the results of the preceding modules to understand how the variability in the rainfall input due to the use of multiple climate projections propagates throughout the impact modelling system 2 1 climate change module raw daily precipitation data are returned by nineteen climate experiments included in the euro cordex ensemble https www euro cordex net where global climate models earth system models gcms ecms included in the 5th coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 are dynamically downscaled by using regional climate models rcms over a domain centred on europe with a horizontal resolution of 0 11 12 km currently euro cordex is the most used ensemble for impact analyses related to extreme climate due to the high number of included projections and to the added value in reproducing climate dynamics with respect to ensembles with lower horizontal resolutions jacob et al 2020 however although the increase in spatial resolution due to downscaling provides an improvement in the characterization of regional weather patterns structural uncertainties persist due for instance to the epistemic uncertainty in the knowledge of climate systems as well as to the modelling uncertainty related for example to the computationally allowable spatial resolutions and associated needed parametrizations for sub grid processes under such constraints the recognized biases in the different climate experiments prevent the adoption of raw climate outputs as inputs for impact analysis especially for extreme events where sub grid processes could play a relevant role to deal with these issues in recent years several statistical approaches have been proposed to reduce the biases assumed as systematic by adjusting climate outputs towards observed weather data used as reference over a common time period padulano et al 2019 proposed an innovative approach where the bias adjustment procedure is directly applied on idf curves which constitute the main instrument to deal with extreme rainfall chow et al 1988 wmo 2009 arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 the present research builds on the methodology proposed by padulano et al 2019 which allows for the estimation of novel intensity duration frequency curves updated to account for the effect of climate changes relying on quantile delta mapping qdm cannonet al 2015 for bias adjustment qdm is a parametric bias correction technique particularly appreciated to preserve the climate signal at all probability levels and especially for the extremes advantages are counterbalanced by the larger computational effort required to fit probability distribution models to the observations as well as to model simulation results in short qdm consists of scaling raw projected values by means of a probability dependent bias estimated as the ratio of observed to simulated for the reference period quantiles for the same probability level or return period t the governing formula for qdm applied to the annual maximum daily rainfall depth hd in mm is shown in equation 1 1 h d b c t h d p r o j t φ obs 1 t φ curr 1 t where subscripts obs curr and proj point to the annual maximum precipitation depth samples coming from the observations or alternatively from a locally available idf curve for the reference period from the model results for the same reference period and from the model results for a future horizon respectively subscript bc points to the final bias corrected values φ 1 stands for the inverse cumulative distribution of daily precipitation depths all terms refer to the same probability level or return period t in order to obtain idf curves for sub daily rainfall durations the storm index approach is applied viglione et al 2007 separately investigating the empirical dependence of mean annual maxima on rainfall duration and the probabilistic distribution of growth coefficients for the first term the same dependence estimated from the observations or alternatively from a locally available idf curve is retained assuming that it does not experience modifications in its structure due to climate changes for the second term results obtained from daily precipitation values are extended to all the durations under the assumption that annual maxima of daily rainfall are closely related to the annual maxima for a duration of 24 h accounting for those assumptions as demonstrated by padulano et al 2019 eq 1 can be rewritten as 2 h bc t t h obs t t δ m t where t points to any rainfall duration in h and hobs t t coincides with the observed or estimated by current locally available idf curves annual maximum rainfall depth for any rainfall duration t and return period t δ m is the scaling factor representing the effects of climate changes as provided by a climate projection m for example one within a larger ensemble expressed as a function of return period t in padulano et al 2019 an ensemble of nineteen climate projections was used and results were provided only in terms of ensemble mean and standard deviation instead in the present research the single members of the adopted ensemble of climate projections are retained individually in order to investigate the propagation of this source of variability through flood modelling and to better understand the effects in terms of flood features and flood hazard this also complies with recent literature suggesting that dealing with climate projections as they were independent realizations of a random variable i e analysing the ensemble as a statistical sample with a central value and a standard deviation tebaldi et al 2005 could be questioned because the different gcms rcms pairs often share assumptions and parametrizations possibly violating the assumption of statistical independence sanderson and knutti 2012 christiansen 2020 in other words although results provided by an ensemble of climate projections could cluster in a narrow space as will be demonstrated in the present research for the investigated case study this does not mean that single climate projections positioning far from the cluster should be considered as outliers namely less probable 2 2 flood inundation module caddies caflood is a flood modelling software relying on cellular automata ca and based on a square regular grid and von neumann neighbourhood ghimire et al 2013 gibson et al 2016 this model employs simple transition rules and a weight based system rather than shallow water equations to resolve the flow movement minimising the need for solving computationally expensive algorithms while maintaining high accuracy cao et al 2020 the simplified features result in significantly improved modelling efficiency ensuring reliable simulated water depths and velocities with model run times up to 8 times faster than tested benchmark models for real world applications guidolin et al 2016 caflood is able to account for spatially and temporally variant rainfall intensities and infiltration rates which must be manually fed by users as time series the main outputs consist of spatially and temporally distributed water depths and flow velocities the computational speed increase translating in no dramatic computational requirements is counterbalanced by the simplified representation of several underlying physical processes webber et al 2019b such as the effect of an artificial drainage network or the positioning of drainage interventions that can only be simulated through local cell water balance and roughness parameters such a degree of simplification makes caflood particularly useful for pre design evaluations and scenario analysis webber at al 2019a 2019b cao et al 2020 since at this stage no detailed data and information over the investigated areas are usually available moreover caflood was found to reproduce observations with fair accuracy despite the simplifying assumptions wang et al 2018 in particular the simplified representation of sewer system can be considered feasible and consistent with the usually poor availability of related data e g location and size of sewers other modelling tools share the same approach setting the infiltration rate due to the stormwater system to a reference value chosen arbitrarily cao et al 2020 or equal to the sewer network design rainfall kaspersen et al 2017 the code has been extensively validated using common benchmarks for flood propagation software packages guidolin et al 2016 although only a limited number of test cases involved purely pluvial flooding conditions 2 3 flood hazard module in case of extreme rainfall in urban contexts a cascade of adverse consequences can be identified consisting of the rainfall runoff transformation the flood and the interaction with urban sub systems such as buildings infrastructure and people in this perspective different levels of hazard can be identified stemming from different questions such as i how does the urban environment as a whole respond to extreme rainfall and ii how does a specific urban sub system respond to flooding in a climate change perspective such questions can be further attuned as i to what extent do flooding conditions change when extreme rainfall changes and ii to what extent does a service keep a certain operational level despite climate changes answering the first question requires modelling the rainfall runoff transformation process in order to understand changes e g in flooded areas flood depths and stormwater volumes this will be hereafter referred to as cumulative hazard answering the second question implies accounting for the features of the investigated sub system such as the transport network or pedestrian circulation and their interaction with flooding features this will be hereafter referred to as operational hazard although operational hazard can be regarded as a downstream effect of cumulative hazard rainfall runoff transformation models often include some urban sub systems showing a physical interaction with rainfall such as roads buildings or green areas given the complexity of modelling both processes a useful approach can consist in deriving from model simulations indicators and criteria suitable to be used as input for operational hazard estimation of the largest possible number of urban services and sub systems in the present paper cumulative and operational hazards are investigated exploiting quantities and indicators commonly adopted in the field of flood risk deployed in hazard classifications targeting one or multiple sectors as described below the simplest variables are water depth d mm and velocity v m s other variables such as flood duration will not be considered although they may have an effect on urban risks luu et al 2018 d and v are the raw output of flood modelling typically adopted to compare the outcomes of different scenarios or different modelling approaches strategies tools when the focus is on the rainfall runoff transformation indeed flood estimations focusing on flood model comparisons e g bermúdez et al 2018 on the performance of flood adaptation measures webber et al 2019a 2019b or on the impact of climate changes kaspersen et al 2017 typically compare baseline to updated scenarios by only means of water depth d or depth related variables such as flooded areas or flood volumes in such cases different arbitrary classes for d can be used according to the experienced variability interval ranging from a dry wet threshold usually set to 1 cm bermúdez et al 2018 5 cm kaspersen et al 2017 palla et al 2018 mei et al 2020 or 10 cm singh et al 2018 to a maximum value which is deeply affected by the local extreme rainfall regime and topography but mostly by the proximity to an open drainage river channel which usually causes larger flow features depth classes can be set arbitrarily by inspecting flood outcomes arrighi et al 2019 li et al 2019 he et al 2020 tanaka et al 2020 natural breaks can be used sperotto et al 2016 as well as deciles obtained inspecting the occurrence frequency of water depth within a flood map cao et al 2020 papilloud et al 2020 stretched values can also be adopted chen et al 2018 costabile et al 2020a water depth can also be used directly for hazard classification mei et al 2020 suggested six hazard classes the first in the range d 5 10 cm with incremental steps of 10 cm related to different levels of damage cao et al 2020 proposed three hazard classes starting from zero depth with incremental steps of 15 cm singh et al 2018 classified four flood severity levels as no flood 0 10 cm minor flood 10 50 cm moderate flood 50 100 cm and major flood 100 cm a similar classification is proposed by pregnolato et al 2017 but with lower thresholds 10 20 30 cm water depth d can provide focus on some operational hazards such as flood hazard for the transport services or buildings feeding threshold values for binary classifications identifying affected not affected assets for instance kramer et al 2016 suggested that roads inundated with a water depth of at least 50 cm should be closed for civil traffic for arrighi et al 2019 the threshold can be lowered to 30 cm kaspersen and halsnæs 2017 reported thresholds of 20 cm for buildings 5 cm for basements roads and railways 0 3 cm for health health issues are assumed to occur as soon as polluted storm water enters basements 20 cm for historical cultural assets incremental threshold values or hazard classes can be derived by stage damage curves such as those provided by van ootegem et al 2015 for buildings basements and related content water depth d alone or coupled with velocity related froude number fr is the main input of many investigations focused on the reduction in vehicle speed due to rainfall considered as one of the main sources of traffic disruption pregnolato et al 2017 evans et al 2020 as well as for the evaluation of flood risk for pedestrians and parked vehicles arrighi et al 2019 bocanegra et al 2018 martínez gomariz et al 2019 risk classifications can be successively derived based on the number of affected roads people or vehicles water depth d and velocity v often in terms of their combination u v d m2 s known as unit discharge feed a large number of hazard classifications targeting pedestrians russo et al 2013 and vehicles bocanegra et al 2018 a relevant example is the hazard classification proposed by the australian institute for disaster resilience aidr 2017 costabile et al 2020a identifying six hazard classes each relevant for a specific asset children elderly people vehicles buildings the total head h d v 2 2g is also adopted by kramer et al 2016 for flood hazard classification compared to a threshold of 30 cm and 60 cm for the safety of passenger cars and emergency vehicles respectively in the present paper different indicators and classifications will be adopted in order to understand the impact of climate changes at different return periods on a wide variety of outcomes targeting both cumulative and operational hazard table 1 considered interesting for the case study first a traffic oriented hazard classification will be adopted in accordance with evans et al 2020 fed by water depth d hazard model 1 second the well known u based hazard classification provided by aidr 2017 will be adopted targeting multiple assets for integrated risk assessment hazard model 2 third d will feed the threshold based classification provided by kaspersen and halsnæs 2017 again allowing for integrated risk assessment hazard model 3 however the health related threshold was removed to keep consistency with the wet dry threshold of 1 cm finally the classification based on total head h kramer et al 2016 will be considered as an alternative to the aidr classification combining depth and velocity information hazard model 4 prior to hazard evaluations two additional lumped indicators labelled runoff volume index rvi in m3 and flooded area index fai in will be analysed which aggregate information at the watershed level 3 rvi i 1 n w i d i a i 4 fai 1 s tot i 1 n w i a i where stot is the total extent of the study area n is the number of cells in the investigated area ai is the cell size di is the water depth in the cell and wi is a binary classificator assuming 0 value when di is lower than a wet dry threshold which is set to a value of 1 cm 1 otherwise in the present research both rvi and fai are only evaluated under peak conditions identified by subscript p in peak conditions each location of the case study attains its maximum water depth or velocity value experienced during the flood event which could not be concurrent in other words peak conditions do not correspond to a specific instant of the flood event but they maximize criticality for every location of the investigated area given their extremely aggregated nature those indicators are only suitable for cumulative hazard estimations and they can be used for quick preliminary understanding and comparison among different scenario outcomes peak conditions are also used for the evaluation of hazard models in table 1 with this aim the peak values of d u and h are needed the outcomes of hazard models in table 1 are represented by the area within the class awc metric expressed as a percentage of the inundable area of the case study in other words comparing the area extent where the considered indicator is within a range of predetermined values across multiple scenarios this approach has the main disadvantage of not accounting for the exact location of hazardous places in the study area however it was preferred to a cell by cell comparison due to the large number of scenarios to be simulated notice that the sum of awc across the classes of each hazard model equals faip 3 case study fuorigrotta is one of the administrative units of the city of naples located in the western part of the city fig 2 the pilot area chosen for the analysis is 2 1 km2 wide and it roughly coincides with the stormwater drainage catchment serving the neighbourhood which in turn is part of the complex and stratified combined sewer system of the city the pilot area is located along the edges of the campi flegrei volcanic system as such it can be described as a flat basin with steep edges on the north eastern side gently degrading towards the sea in south west direction fig 2 due to its peculiar topographic features the drainage efficiency of the sewer system in the area has always been limited and a large number of enhancements retrofitting and extraordinary maintenance interventions have been proposed the main concerns mostly regard the accumulation of surface runoff due to the very mild slopes in the central part of the pilot area which along with the overall poor maintenance conditions of gutters and drains makes the storm water collection difficult all the above mentioned issues have a deep influence on the rainfall runoff transformation exacerbating the flood hazard conditions of the area in turn flood risks are even more relevant considering the high exposure levels the census particles dated 2011 highlight the residential purpose of the pilot area with a population of about 40 000 and still growing and a number of highly relevant strategic assets such as the football stadium with all the satellite economic activities the railway infrastructure for public transport both local and extra urban with a large number of underground stations and the road network which is characterized by a large number of high traffic routes also in underpasses and tunnels connecting the area to the adjacent neighbourhoods and to the highway among all the above mentioned assets fig 3 the transport and road infrastructures proved to be the most vulnerable to pluvial flooding with cascading indirect damages due to service disruption caused by traffic jams potholes and railroad flooding limiting mobility both within the area and towards the city economical business centre relevant service disruptions can be observed both for small and for large return periods an example of this can be found in the very large underpass at the highway exit which is closed at every rainfall event as a precautionary measure even for small rainfall intensities with severe consequences for traffic moreover damages to underground facilities such as metro stations but also garages and basements are often experienced for those reasons this pilot area can be considered particularly interesting for pluvial flooding analysis and especially in a context of climate change in order to assess and map current and future hazard risk conditions as well as to plan adaptation strategies and measures 3 1 topographic data and land use maps different panels in fig 3 show the pilot area information that is needed for the modelling process namely i a lidar based digital terrain model http sit cittametropolitana na it lidar html providing soil elevation with a native horizontal resolution of 1 m remapped at a final resolution of 2 m considered suitable for pluvial flooding analyses wang et al 2018 and post processed to remove building footprints ii a land use classification derived from merging different land use land cover labels according to their surface drainage properties impervious areas such as roads and pedestrian areas green areas manmade pervious areas including railroads and sports facilities land use classes were assigned different roughness and infiltration rates consistently with wang et al 2018 considering for the impervious areas an infiltration rate coincident with the design extreme rainfall value for the sewer system with a return period of 2 years accounting at the same time for the sewer design return period usually 10 years and for the observed poor maintenance conditions moreover infiltration rates for green areas were differentiated according to slope referring to the fine sandy loam soil texture as suggested by kaspersen et al 2017 table 2 shows roughness and infiltration rate values for different land use classes and slopes it should be noted that the infiltration label is used consistently with software notation and related literature e g wang et al 2018 albeit it represents parametrized processes such as infiltration through green areas and sewer conveyance through drain inlets information shown in fig 3 and table 2 are used as input for the caddies caflood modelling tool coupled with extreme rainfall scenarios derived from the methodology discussed in previous section for the analyses two different return periods for the rainfall events are considered namely t 1 10 yr and t 2 200 yr consistently with the observation that urban flooding can be due to either low frequency events causing surcharge of the underground sewer systems with consequent overflowing or high frequency events caused by local unpredictable deficiencies of the drainage system palla et al 2018 urban drainage networks are usually designed for low return periods nonetheless it is quite common to understand consequences of highly extreme rainfall events in urban areas kaspersen et al 2017 martínez gomariz et al 2019 cao et al 2020 li and willems 2020 although the statistical meaning of return periods under changing climates should be carefully considered cooley 2013 3 2 rainfall data table 3 shows the members of the adopted ensemble of climate experiments exploiting six different gcm esms and eight different rcms in nineteen different combinations in case of experiments sharing same gcm esms and rcms e g members 5 and 8 in table 3 different configurations for instance in terms of parametrizations and or tuning can result in different outputs the local extreme rainfall regime for the case study under climate changes is provided by equation 2 using as observational reference the local design idf curve over the period 1971 2000 obtaining 19 idf curves expected in the future horizon 2071 2100 for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios as previously mentioned subsequent analyses focus on two relevant return periods t 1 10 yr and t 2 200 yr for a total number of 2 2 19 76 simulations under climate change plus two reference simulations under present climate conditions 4 results of the impact simulation chain 4 1 local extreme rainfall regime for the case study under climate change table 3 provides for each of the 19 climate projections the annual maximum 1 hr rainfall intensity obtained from equation 2 for the two reference return periods t 1 10 yr and t 2 200 yr and the two considered rcp scenarios the observed annual maximum 1 hr rainfall intensity provided by the design idf curve for the reference period 1971 2000 hereafter referred to as i 0 is equal to 40 4 mm h and 71 4 mm h for t 1 and t 2 respectively fig 4 shows the depth duration curves obtained by means of equation 2 for different rainfall durations as fig 4 as well as table 3 for 1 hr duration only shows variability of climate projections is a function of return period and concentration scenarios for fixed rcp scenario variability is the largest for the largest return period whereas for fixed t variability is the largest under the rcp 8 5 scenario with the effect of concentration scenario more pronounced than that of return period variability also shows an increasing dependence on rainfall duration under rcp 4 5 rainfall values appear uniformly distributed in the variability range whereas under rcp 8 5 rainfall values gather in the lower part of the range close to the reference idf curve for current climate showing a small number of significantly diverging values representing models 13 18 and 10 from the highest to the lowest rainfall depth in all cases the upper and lower bounds of the variability range correspond to models 13 and 1 respectively 1 also provides rainfall depth values lower than the observed one under rcp 4 5 for all rainfall durations 4 2 flood hazard evaluation 4 2 1 statistical features of flood related variables table 4 shows the main statistical features of the outcomes of the examined flood inundation models under peak conditions for each combination return period rcp scenario the statistical properties are referred to the complete ensemble of simulations including the baseline for each variable results are presented in terms of mean and median value standard deviation variability range skewness coefficient and variation coefficient as table 4 shows the water depth variable d exhibits a significantly skewed frequency closely followed by total head h and secondly by unit discharge u whereas flow velocity v only shows a limited although non negligible skewness coefficient consistently d and h show very small central values compared to the upper limit of the variability range and mean values roughly double than the 50th percentile mean median although to a lower extent maximum value and standard deviation uniformly increase moving from t 1 rcp 4 5 to t 2 rcp 8 5 conversely skewness shows an increasing behaviour for v but a decreasing behaviour for d and the opposite occurs for the coefficient of variation similar considerations for combined variables u and h suggest that the frequency distribution of total head is mostly affected by water depth d whereas distribution of u also accounts for the statistical features of variable v 4 2 2 cumulative hazard indicators fig 5 shows rvip and faip values for all the simulated scenarios for each return period t 1 10 years in green t 2 200 years in red rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios are identified by cross markers and triangle markers respectively however due to the distribution of simulated rainfall intensities most data points gather close to the respective baseline value represented by black markers which is also the minimum simulated rainfall value for rcp 8 5 and the second minimum value for rcp 4 5 with only a limited number of particularly high values representing climate projections 13 18 and 10 under rcp 8 5 for both metrics data points perfectly align along a regression curve with coefficient of determination r 2 98 for both indicators showing an increasing dependence of both runoff volume and flooded area on rainfall intensity faip values show that for the most critical rainfall scenario the study area is only flooded at about 40 with d 1 cm the structure of the dependence is power like in both cases with rvip and faip gradually increasing with i with a power of about 0 5 in both cases for about i 60 mm h the last part of both curves can be considered linear 4 2 3 operational hazard models fig 6 shows for each return period the amount of pilot area subject to hazard indicators d u and h classified according to the criteria identified in table 1 as a function of rainfall intensity i for each hazard model hazard classes are labelled from 1 which identifies the lowest hazard level to 3 highest hazard for the 3 class repartition criterium or 5 highest hazard for the 6 class repartition criterium where the sixth hazard class in table 1 was never attained consistently with table 3 and fig 5 moving from the lowest to the highest rainfall intensity in each panel of fig 6 corresponds to moving from rcp 4 5 to rcp 8 5 moving from left panel to right panel for each row of fig 6 corresponds to moving from t 1 to t 2 with data points gathering along the same curve partitioned in two panels to improve visual inspection for each hazard class similarly to rvip and faip in fig 5 the wide overlap between the two concentration scenarios for each of the investigated return periods makes the visual discrimination between rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 hardly possible in all the panels of fig 6 the baseline values are also shown as black markers pointing to the hazardous area values awc under present climate conditions for both return periods in all the examined scenarios the widest portion of the pilot area is subject to the lowest hazard with awc values always higher than 10 whereas the hazardous surface decreases with increasing hazard level for all the hazard models the dependence of awc on rainfall intensity is a function of the hazard class specifically all hazard classifications show a lowest class h1 corresponding to a low hazard condition where all the indicator values are lower than the minimum threshold with an almost constant awc value which is also the maximum among the classes implying that most of the pilot area with a percentage always higher than 10 is subject to the lowest hazard due to inundation despite experiencing a water depth 1 cm for increasing hazard level the hazardous area decreases on average and the dependence on rainfall increases for the highest hazard classes see for example awc 2 the amount of exposed pilot area attains very small values lower than 0 1 but the dependence on rainfall intensity is significant in the entire range of investigated rainfall scenarios the different hazard classifications show a relevant similarity especially in the estimation of the area exposed to a low hazard h1 the classifications based on water depth d hazard models 1 and 3 show a direct consistency with the statistical properties of water depth shown in table 4 so that the lower is the threshold the higher is the area characterized by a water depth lower or equal to the threshold for instance the amount of wet area exposed to d 10 cm h1 for hazard model 1 is larger than that exposed to d 5 cm h1 for hazard model 3 and the amount of wet area exposed to d 30 cm h3 for hazard model 1 is smaller than that exposed to d 20 cm h3 for hazard model 3 the classifications based on derived variables hazard models 2 and 4 show a different behaviour compared to the d based classifications especially in the estimation of higher hazard classes presumably due to the effect of the velocity parameter specifically the awc curves for h2 and h3 classes swap their position for the highest rainfall intensities under t 1 for hazard model 2 and for both return periods for hazard model 4 this happens because whereas awc values for h3 constantly increase with increasing i awc values for h2 increase at first with i and then they decrease or reach a plateau with increasing i for about i 50 mm h for t 1 and for about i 120 mm h for t 2 this behaviour should not be considered anomalous since both quantities h and u build on two variables d and v which are often opponent in each cell of the domain there usually are either high depths and low velocities or low depths and high velocities and the trend of their summation or product cannot be predicted a priori because it is very site specific for hazard model 2 in the range of t 2 the amount of pilot area exposed to h3 hazard is larger than that exposed to h2 hazard for every simulated rainfall intensity finally comparison of h1 h2 and h3 values between hazard models 2 and 4 shows that the two criteria are substantially coincident 4 3 analysis of normalized indicators as shown in the results section the raw outcomes of flood inundation modelling d v and related variables strictly depend on the rainfall intensity value used as input this is particularly evident in fig 5 for cumulative hazard metrics where the increase in rainfall intensity with respect to the baseline conditions is found to be the only predictor of the increase in peak runoff volumes and flooded areas however the present research is particularly oriented to understand if and to what extent flood hazard is affected by changes in climate conditions and this depends not only on the rainfall input but also on the hazard model adopted as shown by figs 6 and 7 for example the amount of area affected by any assigned level of flooding proves to be diversely affected by any increase in rainfall values compared to the baseline conditions in other words increases in rainfall values as those provided by climate change under the same return period provide different increase in the affected areas with this aim this section provides an analysis of normalized indicators in other words results shown in figs 5 7 are rearranged so that each metric x is represented by its normalized value x x x 0 where x 0 corresponds to baseline conditions 4 3 1 normalized cumulative hazard indicators fig 7 shows normalized peak indicators r v i p rvi p rvi p 0 and f a i p fai p fai p 0 as a function of normalized rainfall intensity i i i 0 for all the exploited scenarios which were dimensionally represented in fig 5 for fixed return periods moving from rcp 4 5 to rcp 8 5 implies increasing rainfall intensity values table 3 so that data points continuously develop along a line from the smallest to the largest abscissa however two different lines occur for the two investigated return periods due to the different reference conditions in the range of investigation the behaviour can be effectively considered linear with a coefficient of determination r 2 higher than 98 in all cases for fixed return period fig 7 shows that the transformation of rainfall into runoff can be represented by a linear relation between the considered normalized variables the equations for the regression lines shown in each panel are such that a unitary increase in rainfall does not imply a unitary change in flooding conditions in terms of either runoff volume or flooded area this confirms the recognized non linearity of the rainfall runoff transformation todini 1988 which is represented in fig 7 by means of the 1 1 line the functional form of the regression lines as well as the parameters values depend on the overall features of the case study judged relevant for the rainfall runoff transformation neglected or simplified processes such as the role of infiltration and the effect of the drainage network may alter observed linearity among the experienced return periods regression lines of t 2 data points show a lower slope implying that the more critical is the baseline scenario the lower can be the increase in criticality due to an increase in rainfall with respect to baseline this is particularly obvious for fai p since flooded area cannot overcome 100 although only two return periods are examined in the research it is expected that the slope of the regression line decreases with increasing return period the aspect and location of the regression line could be altered by modifying drainage characteristics for instance including adaptation measures in this perspective the diagram proposed in fig 8 could act as an abacus driving the selection of interventions and providing information about the feasibility and effectiveness of selected actions for example one or multiple interventions could be simulated with the desired effect of decreasing the slope of the regression line compared to the reference condition e g that referring to present climate and drainage settings so that extreme events would cause lower flood levels it is worth noting that as fig 7 shows normalized flooded area increases to a lower extent than runoff volume with increasing normalized rainfall intensity in other words when using diagrams such as the one proposed in fig 7 for viability analysis of adaptation measures the same performance in terms of slope reduction cannot be ensured for both indicators at the same time 4 3 2 normalized operational hazard model results fig 8 shows the same results shown in fig 6 but provides on the vertical axis normalized values awc namely the ratio of awc to the baseline value awc 0 whereas normalized intensity values are used for the horizontal axis for each hazard model and each hazard class two curves are provided corresponding to t 1 solid line and t 2 dashed line for each curve increasing i implies moving from rcp 4 5 to rcp 8 5 scenario in all cases for fixed i awc is always higher for the smaller return period this is expected since t 1 is characterized by smaller intensity values than t 2 corresponding to the lower branches of all curves in left panels of fig 6 where the change in awc with i is still non negligible compared to the flat curves in right panels of fig 6 for hazard models 1 and 3 for assigned normalized intensity and return period normalized awc increases with increasing hazard level in other words any increase in rainfall intensity causes an increase in the extent of exposed areas which is more significant for the highest hazard levels the behaviour is quite similar between models 1 and 3 with the evident exception of h3 class for t 1 scenarios where hazard model 1 provides a significantly larger inflation of exposed areas for instance for the t 1 scenario inflating rainfall intensity by 1 5 in other words increasing baseline intensity by 50 implies inflating areas exposed to h3 by 2 2 according to hazard model 1 by 1 7 according to hazard model 3 the classifications based on derived variables hazard models 2 and 4 roughly confirm the above mentioned results consistently with fig 6 h2 and h3 show an opposite trend in the range of t 1 intensity values with the h3 curve monotonically increasing and the h2 increasing but less than h3 and then slightly decreasing with increasing intensity which reflects in the elbow shown in fig 8 for both hazard models for hazard model 2 h4 and h5 curves in fig 8 show a very rapid increase in exposed areas with normalized intensity for instance more than triplicating with doubling rainfall intensity although with some erratic behaviours especially for the smaller i values probably due to the fact that awc 2 values for those classes are very small fig 6 and possibly affected by estimation errors and approximations 4 4 flood hazard mapping fig 9 shows the hazard maps provided by caddies caflood for the most critical rainfall scenario characterized by a return period t 2 200 years under the rcp 8 5 concentration scenario for the climate projection 13 corresponding to a rainfall intensity i 209 mm h in fig 9 only three flood hazard classifications are represented namely the classification based on unit discharge u hazard model 2 the classification based on water depth d hazard model 3 and the classification based on total head h hazard model 4 hazard model 1 can be considered redundant as already mentioned in previous sections lacking flood observations in the case study for validation purposes hazard maps in fig 9 should be only analysed in comparison among different rainfall scenarios however a fair significance of results can be assessed considering that the inundation model correctly captures critical spots such as the underpass the areas adjacent to the football stadium and the entrance of the railway station hazard model 2 particularly emphasizes critical conditions at the entrance of the underpass whereas hazard model 3 provides a non negligible high hazard level for the main railroad results of hazard model 4 can be considered similar to 2 but with the highest hazard levels condensed in a unique class the outcomes of flood hazard mapping show that for the case study the adopted criteria are poorly selective implying that most of the pilot area comes under the lowest hazard class whereas a very small portion of the domain is assigned to the highest hazard levels this is consistent with the statistical properties reported in table 4 compared to the threshold values for hazard models in table 1 with median values for all variables not far from the lowest thresholds coupled to a deeply skewed distribution 4 5 mapping the propagation of climate projections variability fig 10 shows for each return period and each concentration scenario and for each climate simulation chain the path of normalized variables representative of all the steps of the modelling chain i the climate change module it accounts for projection uncertainties e g ipcc socio economic and greenhouse gas concentration scenarios climate model assumptions parametrizations discretization as well as bias correction it is represented in fig 10 by normalized annual maximum 1 hr rainfall intensity i ii the flood inundation module it accounts for the uncertainties proper of the rainfall runoff transformation modelling assumptions parametrizations discretization along with previous variabilities among the investigated variables normalized mean µ and standard deviation σ of water depth d and flow velocity v occurring over the pilot area are considered in fig 10 iii the cumulative hazard modelling in fig 10 normalized fai p and rvi p are chosen these indicators can be considered representative of the inundation modelling as well since they only depend on water depth d iv the operational hazard modelling it accounts for the arbitrariness in the definition of threshold values for hazard classification along with previous variabilities normalized awc is chosen as representative with awc values computed for the lowest hazard class for each hazard model in table 1 shortened as h1 in fig 10 h1 class was preferred since it is the most represented hazard level for all hazard models the radar graph in fig 10 was considered the most effective tool to visually map and inspect results since it is acknowledged as particularly suitable to show multivariate data each of the normalized indicators identified in i iv is assigned an axis with a common origin at the center of the graph each line maps the main outcomes of each single flood simulation starting from rainfall intensity vertical axis i and entry point for the radar graph lines moving clockwise through raw flood features axes from µ d to σ v and cumulative hazard features axes fai p and rvi p and ending at the operational hazard features axis from h1 1 to h1 4 fig 10 shows that the spread in rainfall values used as input which is due to the use of an ensemble of climate experiments table 3 slightly reduces moving from climate change modelling to flood modelling implying a dampening effect of the flood modelling for all scenarios in other words a given increase in rainfall intensity with respect to present climate causes a lower increase in water depth features particularly in the mean values and in flow velocity features particularly in the standard deviation in turn moving towards hazard modelling causes variability to inflate with respect to flood modelling but keeping within a similar level with respect to rainfall variability among all the hazard metrics variability in rvi p proves to be the most inflated results of the four tested hazard models can be considered coincident variability in h1 along with variability in fai p attains values similar to variability in rainfall this is especially true for the rcp 4 5 scenarios which exhibit the lowest variability in rainfall increase with respect to the baseline with i always lower than 1 5 instead for the rcp 8 5 scenarios showing larger rainfall variability with maximum i almost equal to 2 and 3 for t 1 and t 2 respectively a dampening effect of the hazard modelling can be appreciated in addition to the mitigating effect of the rainfall runoff transformation the behaviour of single climate simulation chains is consistent throughout the process implying that the climate projections providing the highest increase in rainfall intensity also provide the highest increase in all the other metrics this is particularly visible for t 2 under rcp 8 5 where lines representing single climate experiments are concentric and never intersect finally as also shown in fig 7 and fig 8 for both rcp scenarios variability in normalized metrics is narrower for t 2 than for t 1 implying that alterations due to the effect of climate change are not evenly distributed for all magnitudes of rainfall events the hazard source so that more significant changes with respect to present climate should be expected for the less critical events as a final comment fig 10 shows that the total spread in all the considered normalized variables keeps within the circle corresponding to the maximum experienced i which is roughly equal to 1 3 for t 1 rcp 4 5 corresponding to an increase in rainfall intensity of 30 with respect to baseline 2 for t 1 rcp 8 5 corresponding to an increase of 100 1 3 for t 2 rcp 4 5 corresponding to an increase of 30 and 3 for t 2 rcp 8 5 corresponding to an increase of 200 the only exception being rvi p under rcp 4 5 scenarios within those circles normalized statistical properties exhibit a significantly narrower variability range for all the simulated scenarios 5 discussion 5 1 limitations of the work and future developments the choice of the flood modelling tool and related parametrizations including simplified infiltration process and sewer system conveyance may have an influence on the outcomes of the research that could constitute promising ground for further research comparing for instance the adopted flood model both to more complex tools explicitly accounting e g for the presence of a sewer system and to expeditious models usually only accounting for the elevation layout due to the lack of flood observations which is a very common situation in practical applications although usually accepted for scenario analyses as discussed in the introduction it was not possible to validate the accuracy of results for any rainfall event but it was only possible to check consistency of results basing on visual inspection of flood maps and expert judgment the observed skewness in flood depths resulting from the flood inundation model causes the extent of hazardous areas to significantly reduce with increasing hazard level resulting in very small areas exposed to the highest hazard under future as well as present climate although an asymmetric distribution skewed towards small depths should be generally expected the flat layout of the domain could deeply affect flood features because the distribution of water depths is significantly uniform with a limited number of outlying locations corresponding to specific elements of the built environment such as the underpass furthermore questions arise about the representativeness of the adopted hazard models for the pilot area most of the highly hazardous areas were expected such as the underpass however tangible experience of the site suggests that perceived hazard is higher even for rainfall events with lower frequency in addition some hazard models such as aidr 2017 fail to capture non negligible risks that are captured by others this could be explained noting that flood hazard models are often conceived for fluvial flooding with usually larger water depths and velocities and considerable damages to the exposed assets with highly critical consequences on their structural integrity e g closed streets or transport service instead purely pluvial flooding conditions may affect exposed assets especially at the operational level e g traffic jams delays and this may not be efficiently captured by those hazard models in any case propagation of variability due to the adoption of an ensemble of climate projections throughout the impact simulation chain was mapped using variables that were normalized by means of the corresponding baseline values referring to present climate this reasonably ensures that results shown in fig 10 as well as the overall methodology can be considered valuable despite the simplifications and possible inaccuracies caused by the flood inundation model governing equations numerical scheme parametrizations for simplified processes as well as by the particular choice of hazard metrics 5 2 potential impacts on the related literature despite the limitations highlighted in the previous section the main findings of this research may have several impacts on the related literature with specific reference to the estimation of climate change impacts on flooding and the use of flood modelling tool this paper proposes a multi purpose impact analysis based on cumulative and operational hazards indicators in this sense the work offers novel points of view for those lines of research involved in the development of flood indices to identify spatial patterns of flood risk within a given studied areas xu et al 2019 shadmehri toosi et al 2020 moreover some of the indicators considered here such as rvi and fai can be considered similar to other synthetic parameters analyzed in the literature see for example löschner et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 confirming their value when dealing with urban flood hazard assessment in a climate change context the outcomes of the research can be of aid to water infrastructure managers designers and policy makers when dealing with the impacts of climate change in flood prone urban areas and its relationship with the effects of increasing urbanization mahmoud and gan 2018 furthermore the impact simulation chain proposed in this paper can be further used for other purposes such as the quantification of benefits related to climate change adaption measures which have been devoted particular attention in the recent literature see for example zhou et al 2018 ghodsi et al 2020 it is also important to underline the potential impact of this research for urban flood modelers with particular reference to the application of caddies caflood model this numerical code was extensively applied for classic flood propagation situations guidolin et al 2016 and only recently it has been also used for rain on grid simulation wang et al 2018 where the rainfall input is directly considered within the hydrodynamic model it should be recalled that these simulations are very challenging from a numerical point of view cea and bladé 2015 and due to the increasing use in the literature for both basin scale i e ferraro et al 2020 and urban scale i e guo et al 2021 applications further evidence is required about the suitability of the software package for pluvial flooding costabile et al 2020b as finally concerns the climate change perspective in the field of urban flooding the paper presents a unique example of propagating the spread in rainfall coming from a large ensemble of climate projections throughout a comprehensive modelling chain from the quantification of local effects of climate change up to flood hazard evaluations the main difference with similar outcomes such as those shown by kaspersen et al 2017 lies in the decision of mapping the results of each flood simulation taking as input a specific rainfall value separately this approach stems from the assumption that each different climate projection provides an equiprobable future rainfall scenario rejecting the common idea that particularly high future extreme rainfall values are outliers and consequently less credible than the moderate ones 6 conclusions and lessons learnt a complete impact simulation chain was performed consisting of a climate change modelling module an urban flood modelling module and a flood hazard modelling module analyses were performed for two different return periods t 1 10 years and t 2 200 years for the test case of fuorigrotta city of naples italy the paper fills the current gap in the analysis of climate change impacts on urban flooding by relying on a full ensemble of climate projections reflecting the use of a large ensemble of climate experiments derived from different gcms esms coupled with different rcms under different rcp scenarios where single members were considered equiprobable in opposition to current impact literature usually targeting ensemble mean and standard deviation or relevant percentiles the main goal of the research consisted in understanding how the variability in the rainfall input propagated within the system and reflected onto the urban environment and related sub systems despite the above mentioned limitations the following conclusions can be drawn variability of climate projections is a function of return period and concentration scenarios for fixed rcp variability is the largest for the largest return period whereas for fixed t variability is the largest under rcp 8 5 with the effect of concentration scenario more pronounced than that of return period raw output variables of flood inundation model exhibit a considerably asymmetrical distribution with very large skewness coefficients for water depth closely followed by total head and unit discharge and smaller skewness values for flow velocity analysis of cumulative hazard indicators shows that runoff volumes and flooded areas increase with increasing rainfall with a power of about 0 5 this implies that with respect to current climate for a fixed increase in rainfall the increase in both flood indicators has a magnitude which decreases with increasing return period for the lower return period the increase in runoff volumes is roughly equal to the increase in rainfall whereas it is smaller for the higher return period the experienced increase in flooded areas is always smaller than the increase in rainfall probably due to the elevation features of the pilot area although this testifies the nonlinearity of the rainfall runoff transformation the relationship between rainfall increase and flood features increase was found to be linear for all return periods analysis of operational hazard indicators show that for increasing hazard level the extent of hazardous areas decreases and the dependence on rainfall becomes more marked for fixed hazard level hazardous areas are closely related to rainfall only for small intensities namely 10 yr return period under rcp 4 5 and then stabilize with respect to current climate for fixed return period the extent of hazardous areas increases more rapidly with increasing rainfall for higher than for lower hazard levels for fixed hazard inflation of hazardous areas is more evident for 10 yr than for 200 yr rainfall scenarios mapping the propagation of rainfall variability through the impact simulation chain in terms of normalized indicators shows that the spread in normalized rainfall input envelopes the variability range of all subsequent modelling steps including raw flood modelling outputs cumulative and operational hazard indicators the envelope spread is roughly equal to 1 3 for t 1 rcp 4 5 corresponding to an increase in rainfall intensity of 30 with respect to current climate 2 for t 1 rcp 8 5 increase of 100 1 3 for t 2 rcp 4 5 increase of 30 and 3 for t 2 rcp 8 5 increase of 200 on one hand this confirms that the higher the return period the lower the increase in flood indicators in comparison on the other hand this demonstrates that concentration scenarios play a predominant role in the allocation of variability in the input and as a consequence in the output with e g t 1 rcp 8 5 scenario providing a higher increase in flood criticality than t 2 rcp 4 5 in terms of input data computational effort and reliability and versatility of the outputs the adopted inundation model provides a balance between expeditious tools often relying on elevation only and comprehensive hydrodynamic models usually fed by a large amount of detailed input data this makes the impact simulation chain particularly suitable to be used for scenario analysis under climate change the research provides a methodological framework that can be tailored to meet specific requirements and needs adopting for instance different gcms rcms couplings or bias adjustment techniques different flood models or different hazard indicators as a future perspective this framework can be used to explore different uncertainty sources within the impact simulation chain as well as the feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation measures to reduce flood

4208,in cold climate the main annual recharge event is spring snowmelt projections of groundwater storage hence depend on winter hydroclimate winter recharge is a factor of rain melt and ground frost increases in winter rain and melt have already been observed however due to complex processes involved in ground frost formation and its natural patchy coverage the effect of ground frost on recharge is poorly understood the objective of the study is to improve the understanding of the connection between groundwater storage and hydroclimate in sweden and finland a region with temperate and cold climate from a seasonal frost cover perspective in the study annual frost free season and frost season temperature and precipitation trends in the climate regions are compared between one global and two regional reanalysis datasets effective precipitation and wet day frequency trends between 1980 and 2010 are compared to groundwater level trends for the same period trends are calculated using the mann kendall test and sen s slope the results show that the region is generally experiencing warming and increased precipitation these trends are strongest in the frost season further the global dataset systematically underestimates median temperatures and precipitation compared to the regional datasets effective precipitation trends are generally weak and indicate wetting in the frost season and drying in the frost free season wet day frequency trends are decreasing significantly on the regional scale in finland but with nearly no trends in sweden groundwater levels in southern finland and southeastern sweden are declining significantly while groundwater levels in southwestern sweden are significantly rising the results indicate that groundwater trends in southern finland are linked to wet day frequency and effective precipitation trends in the frost free season and that trends in the frost season have no impact on annual groundwater level trends in southern sweden groundwater level trends appear linked to annual and frost free season trends in effective precipitation though insignificantly these trends may be explained by century scale trends in precipitation drought indices identified by previous studies keywords trends climate change groundwater frost fennoscandia 1 introduction since direct and indirect impact of climate change on groundwater storage remains unclear taylor et al 2013 understanding the impact of climate requires studies correlating climatic variables to groundwater level trends holman et al 2012 however changes in groundwater storage are not linearly correlated with long term precipitation trends e g wu et al 2020 the relationship rather depends strongly on hydroclimate seasonality i e precipitation and temperature controlling effective precipitation and eventually groundwater recharge hinzman et al 2005 hamlet et al 2007 clilverd et al 2011 jasechko et al 2014 lee et al 2014 fu et al 2019 nygren et al 2020 temperature generally has a strong seasonal variability determining variability in evapotranspiration rates but also other mechanisms i e precipitation type ground frost and snowmelt and therefore affect the general soil water balance condon et al 2020 the effectiveness of rain to produce recharge is dominated by rainfall characteristics such as intensity wet spell length and frequency e g clilverd et al 2011 jasechko et al 2014 shanley et al 2016 fu et al 2019 this is because surface layers have limited infiltration capacity which is a factor of soil permeability horton 1941 therefore intense storms have a high runoff ratio and rapid recharge production is debilitated jasechko et al 2014 meixner et al 2016 on the other hand long periods of moderate rainfall allows for persistent infiltration soils become saturated and the connection between precipitation and groundwater increases han et al 2019 the latter is vulnerable to changing transpiration rates as it can reduce soil moisture hamlet et al 2007 and thus the atmosphere groundwater connection han et al 2019 evapotranspiration which varies depending on land use and land cover decreases the amount of groundwater recharge ala aho et al 2015 scheliga et al 2018 wang et al 2018 where groundwater levels are shallow or where the capillary fringe is thick groundwater and the root zone are often connected under these conditions vegetation can transpire groundwater directly condon et al 2020 martínez de la torre and miguez macho 2019 and actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration pet are similar warming including changes in the duration of the growing season as well as changing land cover characteristics wang et al 2018 therefore affects soil water availability and groundwater recharge in cold climates the growing season is largely driven by seasonality of temperature irannezhad and kløve 2015 it follows that rainfall has a higher efficiency in producing recharge in winter when transpiration rates are low jasechko et al 2014 further how seasonality in precipitation impacts groundwater storage is due to the ratio of snowmelt to rainfall input as they are found to be variably effective at producing recharge jasechko et al 2017 wu et al 2020 snow storage and ground frost play a significant role for annual groundwater recharge e g clilverd et al 2011 in these regions recharge is affected by temperature dependent processes such as snow accumulation and melt timing shanley et al 2016 hence groundwater storage typically declines in winter as precipitation accumulates at the surface and frost reduces the soil permeability bayard et al 2005 thus spring snowmelt is the main annual recharge event for aquifers in cold regions jasechko et al 2017 kløve et al 2017 in northern latitudes winter temperatures are warming most rapidly dai 2013 due to increased winter temperature variability more winter precipitation is rain and the snow water equivalent is reduced irannezhad et al 2014 however although conditions in winter are energy limited and evapotranspiration rates low or nil winter infiltration is hindered by frost lundberg et al 2016 studies predict that frost cover extent will decrease significantly within the next century enabling increased winter infiltration and recharge jyrkama and sykes 2007 okkonen and kløve 2011 however as in other subarctic regions robeson 2002 kunkel et al 2004 winter air temperatures in sweden and finland in the early 2000 s still promoted surface frost formation further in addition to air temperature ground frost formation is dependent on other factors such as conditions during the first snowfall and snow cover thickness bayard et al 2005 jungqvist et al 2014 ice influence on infiltration is also affected by the presence of gas bubbles bayard et al 2005 and frost formation or ice free zones may be patchy making the identification of areas strongly influenced by frost formed runoff complicated jones and pomeroy 2001 hence knowledge on how frost influences recharge on catchment scale and larger is often excluded in numerical studies therefore despite that much of the northern latitudes and high altitude regions are affected by snow and frost continuously and seasonally little is known on the topic lundberg et al 2016 ala aho et al 2021 the objective of this study is to assess the impact of hydroclimate on groundwater with a focus on seasonal frost cover the aim is to evaluate potential changes of hydroclimate and the impact on groundwater storage in a region dominated by cold climate sweden and finland as they relate to the frost season two hydroclimate variables that affects recharge are included in the analysis effective precipitation and wet day frequency effective precipitation is the amount of precipitation that surpasses the evapotranspiration demand in the soil and hence can be considered potential recharge wet day frequency indicates continuously wet conditions which increases soil moisture and facilitates the atmosphere groundwater connection both variables encompass a collection of parameters important for the atmosphere groundwater connection data on groundwater storage is unavailable instead groundwater level fluctuations are used as a proxy for qualitative assessment annual frost free season and frost season trends of effective precipitation wet day frequency and groundwater levels between 1980 and 2010 31 years are analysed and compared trends are calculated using the mann kendall test and sen s slope 2 study area and data 2 1 data meteorological data for finland is provided by the finnish meteorological institute and is part of the fmi climgrid at a 10 10 km daily resolution aalto et al 2016 the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute provides data for sweden the dataset is part of the e obs gridded dataset in collaboration with uerra the copernicus climate change service and the eca d project cornes et al 2018 produced with a 11v11 km daily resolution for sweden undén 2017 estimates of monthly pet average per day frost days and wet spells days are provided by the university of east anglia climatic research unit here the data version 4 04 is used the dataset is gridded on a 0 5 0 5 approximately 55 5 55 5 km monthly resolution harris et al 2020 the 4 04 version interpolates data using angular distance weighting the original data observations are temperature precipitation vapour pressure wet days and cloud cover harris et al 2020 advices caution in using the dataset to assess regional climate trends hence the dataset is compared to data and trends in the regional reanalysis datasets fmi climgrid and e obs the swedish geological survey sgu and the finnish environment agency syke provide hydrographs from groundwater level observation wells ows the time series contain a minimum of 31 years of biweekly observations with no more than 4 months missing which is imputed using the average value of the previous and following observation hydrographs known to be affected by pumping classified with poor quality by sgu or syke or with irregular time series are excluded examples of irregular time series include a sudden change in mean groundwater level or inconsistent fluctuation patterns after pre processing 256 ows out of 1500 are used due to consistency requirements in the data collection the time period is restricted to covering the period 1980 2010 the ows are at a surface elevation lower than 500 m a s l and for the ows and period used in the study the median groundwater depth is between 0 and 18 m nygren et al 2020 almost all ows are in unconsolidated quaternary sediment of glacial origin 2 2 climate context in the context of changing hydroclimate on the millennial scale studies have found that there is currently a trend towards more pluvial conditions and warmer temperatures in northern europe seftigen et al 2017 chen et al 2020 the climate has become increasingly wetter and warmer since the 1900s hartmann et al 2013 markonis et al 2018 between 1901 and 2010 the annual increase in precipitation is significant at 2 5 25 mm year decade hartmann et al 2013 in fact 1983 2012 has been the wettest period in scandinavia within the last millennium cook et al 2015 markonis et al 2018 in terms of winter hydroclimate the second half of the 1900s is even the wettest period between 1600 and 2000 ce linderholm and chen 2005 the increase is unevenly distributed between seasons winter experiencing the highest increase in wetness and temperatures bengtsson and rana 2014 chen et al 2015 ruostennoja et al 2016 caloiero et al 2018 in finland the increase in wetness is evenly distributed between both winter and summer irannezhad et al 2014 though the increase in summer precipitation is slightly counterbalanced by a prolonged growing season irannezhad and kløve 2015 however spatial differences exist in both countries finland and northern sweden experience wetting trends due to increased precipitation and weaker warming while in southeast sweden the trend is for drier climate due to a weaker precipitation increase and more intense warming dai 2013 due to the flat topography of both countries the climate is mainly affected by latitude ocean and atmospheric circulation and proximity to sea engström and uvo 2016 feiccabrino and grigg 2017 irannezhad et al 2019 as defined by the köppen geiger climate classification for the period 1980 2010 the climate is temperate in southern sweden and cold snow dominated north of 60 n in both sweden and finland fig 1 kottek et al 2006 beck et al 2018 temperate climate has monthly average temperatures exceeding 10 c in the summer and winter monthly averages between 3 c and 18 c cold climate temperatures are equal to temperate climate in summer but monthly averages are less than 3 c in winter between the temperate and cold climate zone there is an intermediate climate zone that is a subcategory of cold climate with warmer summers fig 1 important to add is that these climate zone boundaries are not stationary but stabilise on the decadal to 30 year timescales chen and chen 2013 both sweden and finland are classified as being humid meaning there is no dry season rubel et al 2017 the annual sum of precipitation for the years 1980 2010 is on average 675 mm yr 1 and 605 mm yr 1 in temperate climate south of 60 n and cold climate north of 60 n respectively fig 2 however inter annually this value may vary between 400 and 900 mm yr 1 nygren et al 2020 the corresponding annual average temperature is 8 c temperate and 2 8 c cold climate according to the ipcc emissions scenario rcp8 5 there will be an increase in average annual temperatures of 3 5 c 0 04 c yr 1 and in precipitation of 17 0 19 yr 1 between 2011 and 2099 smhi no date rusteenoja et al 2016 a continuation of warming and increased precipitation is projected for both sweden and finland within the century however with varying seasonal effects the biggest temperature increase is expected in winter the season with the biggest projected increase in precipitation followed by spring chen et al 2016 rusteenoja et al 2016 hence precipitation and temperature trends of the 20th century apply also on the 21st century results from an ensemble of climate models and emission scenarios accordingly indicate that the cold climate zone will migrate northwards with a somewhat delayed climate zone shift in sweden compared to the same latitude in finland rubel et al 2017 by the end of the current century climate change is projected to have changed most of the region to temperate humid climate rubel and kottek 2010 2 3 the frost season seasonality in recharge as a product of precipitation and evapotranspiration is commonly represented by estimating these variables through numerical models precipitation phase may be estimated using a snowmelt model and evapotranspiration rates approximated by pet calculations seasonality in recharge may be partly accounted for by using the output from calculated estimates however frost is also important for seasonality of recharge although little is known on the topic surface and ground frost formation depends on ground temperatures affected by long and short term air temperatures weather conditions before snowfall insulation of snowpack bayard et al 2005 and refreezing of snowmelt after interim warm periods in winter and early spring lundberg et al 2016 once formed frost decreases the permeability of soil reducing its infiltration capacity and transmissivity bayard et al 2005 further due to the locally heterogeneous distribution and thickness of snow the distribution of frost may also have high variation on the catchment scale jones and pomeroy 2001 the cru ts global re analysis model uses an empirical function based on minimum air temperature to produce estimates of frost this output can be used to visualise the surface extent of estimated frost distribution as a proxy for ground frost fig 3 to compare frost day duration between months day values are normalised to a fraction of the month multiplied by 30 the frost season is considered to have started when larger areas have frost for some days in a month which continues consistently in the following months it is considered to end when there is frost for fewer than 30 days i e max days after normalisation which decreases in the following month in the north of the study area the frost season starts in september in october it has spread to all of the cold climate region and ends in may furthest south the frost season starts in november and ends in april thus the two climate zones have a fairly uniform frost season extent october to may in the cold climate zone and november to april in the temperate climate zone 2 4 hydrogeological context and groundwater seasonality nordic hydrogeology in sweden and finland is characterised by the climate mainly flat or hilly bedrock and surface topography and crystalline bedrock overlain by unconsolidated glacial deposits kløve et al 2017 depth to bedrock varies between 0 to around 200 m on average 10 m kleman et al 2008 where boundary ice formations eskers other glaciofluvial deposits and fracture valleys compose the thicker soil deposits the most common sediment type is till of typically low hydraulic conductivity ojala et al 2007 further bedrock fracture porosity is highly variable knutsson 2008 but generally low deep weathering and saprolites are rare and local aquifers in sweden and finland are therefore small by international comparison and mainly of importance on the local scale richts et al 2011 fan et al 2013 for freshwater supply big cities and municipalities in sweden and finland mainly rely on surface water reservoirs smaller municipalities and private well owners in sparsely populated countryside do most groundwater extraction kløve et al 2017 extraction is highly variable and the higher quantities constrained mainly to moderately productive aquifers in eskers deltas and end moraines which are isolated from each other by clayey till or crystalline bedrock katko et al 2006 ojala et al 2007 nygren et al 2020 analysed the seasonality of groundwater levels in ows in the study area the results indicate that groundwater level seasonality in sweden and finland is linked to the köppen geiger climate zones in temperate climate groundwater levels rise mainly in winter in response to rainfall and decline in summer due to increased evapotranspiration in a northward gradient from around 57 n to around 65 n including both the temperate and the cold zones groundwater levels also rise in response to rainfall autumn and decline with increasing evapotranspiration summer in cold climates groundwater levels mainly rise in response to snowmelt in spring and decline during the frost snow season that starts sometime in autumn or early winter the seasonality in groundwater level fluctuation indicates that the recharge regime of groundwater in the study area is mainly driven by winter rain in the south and autumn rain and spring snowmelt further north 3 methods the aim of this study is to evaluate recent hydroclimate trends with a background in seasonal frost and relate them to trends in groundwater storage to include frost in the analysis annual trends are compared to trends in the frost and frost free season firstly effective precipitation and wet day frequency are estimated as they are closely linked to groundwater recharge then trends in temperature precipitation effective precipitation wet day frequency and groundwater levels are evaluated the impact on groundwater storage is assessed by comparing hydroclimate to groundwater trends 3 1 estimating effective precipitation and wet day frequency climate is a major factor in the aquifer recharge process hence climate change will impact future groundwater storage through its effect on recharge the two main components driving temporal variability in groundwater recharge are variations in precipitation and evapotranspiration this can be conceptualised by a groundwater balance equation 1 δ s p e t q where δs mm is the change in groundwater storage in the aquifer p mm is the precipitation input et mm is evapotranspiration and q mm is groundwater discharge actual evapotranspiration is not known hence potential evapotranspiration pet mm is used as a proxy pet is a product of the urc ts dataset harris et al 2020 pet data is based on the penman monteith formula applied on gridded values of mean air temperature vapour pressure cloud cover and average wind speed harris et al 2020 further since the study analyses temporal variability in diffuse recharge from precipitation and evapotranspiration and the surface groundwater connection is poor due to low hydraulic conductivity groundwater discharge q is considered constant to simplify the analysis there is no data to quantify groundwater storage at this scale however since groundwater levels reflect storage change storage may be qualitatively evaluated using groundwater levels only in cold climate regions precipitation must further be separated into rain and snowmelt wu et al 2020 since snow is accumulated at the surface only rain and snowmelt are used in the calculation focusing on effective precipitation only the simplified groundwater balance equation can hence be rewritten as 2 δ s r m p e t where r mm is rain and m mm is snowmelt rain and snowmelt are estimated on a daily basis using the finnish and swedish datasets of daily precipitation and temperature values pet as part of the urc dataset is estimated as a daily average per month thus the groundwater balance is calculated based on the daily rain and snowmelt estimates subtracted by the daily average of pet per month when conditions are water limited and pet is higher than rain and melt together the effective precipitation δs equals 0 mm snow and rain are estimated from temperature and precipitation data using daily values of precipitation and temperature daily rainfall and snowmelt magnitudes are estimated for every climate grid cell using a simple temperature index based snowmelt model rain and snowmelt bergström 1976 when the temperature is above the threshold temperature here 1 c an estimate of snowmelt production is calculated using a degree day factor here 2 74 mm c day the degree day factor is an empirical constant value which limits the amount of modelled accumulated snow that can melt per degree per day irrespective of rain or snowfall the parameter used in this study are based on results from feiccabrino and lundberg 2008 seibert 2005 and seibert and vis 2012 further information on the snowmelt model as used here can be found in nygren et al 2020 variations in precipitation may also be conceptualised by wet day frequency in addition to effective precipitation persistence in wet conditions increases the soil moisture hence facilitating the recharge process wet days per month is an output variable in the urc ts 4 04 dataset and is calculated from daily precipitation data a wet day in the urc dataset is defined as receiving 0 1 mm of precipitation 3 2 trends in effective precipitation wet day frequency and groundwater levels the two sided non parametric mann kendall test is used to calculate trends mann 1945 theil 1950 kendall 1975 and sen s slope sen 1968 are used to quantify the significance and the slope of the trend the mann kendall test is based on the assumption that the time series continuously increase or decrease a p value threshold 0 05 is used to assess whether the null hypothesis can be rejected when the p value is 0 05 the null hypothesis is rejected and there is a significant annual change if the p value is 0 05 the null hypothesis cannot be rejected and hence there is no significant trend sen s slope is a median value calculated on estimates of the slope in trends between data points the slope estimate indicates the magnitude a trend is increasing or decreasing per unit time here per year temperature and precipitation data is compared between the three climate datasets on the annual scale for the frost free season including data in months without frost and the frost season including only values in months with frost in the temperate climate zone the frost free season is between april and november and the frost season between december and march in the cold climate zone the frost free season between may and october and the frost season between november and april trends in the cru ts dataset are calculated for 60 years between 1960 and 2019 for the two regional datasets e obs and fmi climgrid trends are calculated for 31 years between 1980 and 2010 effective precipitation is calculated using the output from the groundwater balance calculation eq 2 annual frost free and frost season trends in effective precipitation mm and wet day frequency days are then calculated for the study period 1980 2010 annual differences in groundwater storage are estimated based on the median annual groundwater level m below surface sen s slope of groundwater levels m yr is dependent on environmental factors controlling the storativity meaning that a unit change in groundwater level is not comparable across sites to represent the difference between ows the trend magnitude is normalised to the change to range index cri developed by dudley and hodgkins 2013 as 3 cri s l r where s is sen s slope of the trend level time unit l time unit is the length of the record here 31 years and r level unit is the interquartile range of the data a very strong trend is given by cri values above 1 or below 1 and a strong trend by the cri values between 0 5 and 1 or 1 and 0 5 for cri values between 0 2 and 0 2 the trend is weak the sen s slope of trends in effective precipitation and wet days and the cri for groundwater levels are presented regardless of the significance to visualise the range in results 4 results the objective is to compare and connect recent hydroclimate trends from a seasonal frost perspective to trends in groundwater levels temperature and precipitation trends from three datasets between 1960 and 2019 cru ts and 1980 and 2010 e obs and fmi climgrid this is followed by the results of the 1980 2010 trend analysis of effective precipitation and wet day frequency between 1980 and 2010 finally groundwater level trends between 1980 and 2010 are presented with a comparison to hydroclimate trends 4 1 trends in temperature and precipitation the median annual temperature from three datasets used in this study is similar with consistently rising temperature trends on the regional scale in both climate zones fig 4 however the cru ts dataset systematically underestimate median temperatures in comparison to the two regional datasets e obs fmi climgrid additionally the slope of the trends representing the change in celsius per year is slightly lower for the cru ts dataset possibly due to the difference in timescale for the trend calculation 60 vs 31 years the trends are significant for all datasets on the annual scale but only for the cru ts dataset in the frost free and frost seasons finally all datasets indicate that temperatures are rising faster in the frost season fig 4 a3 and 4 b3 compared to trends per year fig 4 a1 and 4 b1 and the frost free season fig 4 a2 and 4 b2 further temperatures are rising slightly faster in the cold fig 4 a compared to the temperate fig 4 b climate zone temperature trends in the cold climate zone also have a higher variability particularly in the frost season ranging between 0 2 c yr for cru ts and fmi climgrid to almost 1 c yr for e obs fig 4 a4 6 and 4 b4 6 the median annual sum of precipitation for the two climate zones is generally higher for the two regional datasets particularly the one for sweden e obs fig 5 a1 3 and 5 b1 3 the difference between the datasets is higher on the annual scale and for the frost free season fig 5 a1 2 and 5 b1 2 the trend slope is generally higher for the cru ts dataset fig 5 a4 6 and 5 b4 6 particularly for the cold climate zone further cru ts generally has a smaller variation in trends within the dataset compared to the other datasets annual trends for the regional datasets are small and insignificant in the cold climate region while cru ts indicates precipitation is significantly increasing by 0 39 mm yr between 1960 and 2019 fig 5 a4 fmi climgrid has a slightly stronger declining trend in the frost free season and a slightly rising trend in the frost season e obs has a very weak trend in the frost free season but for the frost season the trend is stronger and declining cru ts trends are increasing for both the frost free and frost season which is significant at 0 46 mm yr for the frost season fig 5 a6 in the temperate climate zone trends in both cru ts and e obs are rising annually and in the frost free season in the frost season the e obs dataset has a declining trend fig 5 b however only cru ts has significant trends annually and in the frost free season of 0 70 mm yr and 0 96 mm yr respectively fig 5 b4 5 4 2 trends in effective precipitation and wet day frequency median trends in effective precipitation and wet day frequency are similar with similar variations fig 6 the trends are decreasing in the cold climate zone fig 6 a though effective precipitation is increasing in the frost season fig 6 a3 and 6 a6 only wet day frequency trends are significant decreasing annually and in the frost free season by 0 26 days yr and 0 37 days yr respectively fig 6 a4 and 6 a5 in the temperate climate zone trends are insignificant fig 6 b trends in wet day frequency are weak in general trends in effective precipitation are weak on the annual scale in the frost free season effective precipitation trends are stronger and increasing with weaker decreasing trends in the frost season there are varying spatial patterns of hydroclimate trends fig 7 a in the north the effective precipitation is increasing in a south westward direction trends change to indicate decreasing effective precipitation to around 60 n where the climate zone changes from cold to temperate in the temperate climate zone effective precipitation is increasing the trends are insignificant on the regional scale trends in annual wet day frequency are similar fig 7d though weaker in southern sweden however most of finland and northern sweden have decreasing wet day trends this trend is significant around 63 65 n in sweden and in eastern finland east of 25 e in the frost free season the increase in effective precipitation around 57 58 n and 11 15 e is stronger fig 7b the decrease in effective precipitation in southern finland is also stronger with some grid cells with significant trends wet day frequency trends are generally weaker with fewer significant trends in sweden fig 7e in finland trends of decreased wet day frequency have shifted from eastern to southern finland trends in the frost season are in contrast to the frost free season effective precipitation trends indicate increasing wetness over nearly the entire study area except for southern sweden where there is no trend the wetting trends are significant in middle finland and in the north wet day frequency trends indicate general drying although there are no trends in most of sweden except for significant weak drying trends around 64 n fig 7c in finland frost season wet day frequency trends fig 7f are similar to the annual trends with significant drying in the east 4 3 trends in groundwater levels groundwater level trends have some spatial coherency though there is large local variability fig 8 almost all regions have ows with significant trends the strongest trends are in finland where most ows have significantly declining groundwater level trends particularly south of 65 n except for some ows with rising levels in the southeast and far north many ows in sweden do not have a trend in groundwater levels particularly north of 63 n most trends are weak 0 5 cri 0 5 and insignificant trends are stronger further south south of 62 n and west of 15 e there are some ows with significantly rising levels in the southeast around 59 62 n and 15 17 e south around 58 n 14 e and southernmost parts of sweden the significant trend is for declining groundwater levels 4 4 connecting trends in hydroclimate to groundwater in southern finland ows have trends of significantly declining groundwater levels on the regional scale which are weak and insignificant in northern finland fig 8 these groundwater trends correspond very well to hydroclimate trends in the frost free season that is significantly declining wet day frequency trends fig 7e and enhanced trends in decreasing effective precipitation fig 7b in southern finland further the absence of significant groundwater trends in northern finland correspond to insignificant and weak hydroclimate trends in the same area in contrast there is a general increase in effective precipitation in the frost season fig 7c which is counterintuitive to observed ow trends significant frost season trends in wet day frequency are distributed in eastern finland fig 7f which does not correspond to the pattern of negative groundwater trends that are distributed in the south the visual connection between ow and annual hydroclimate trends is vague and in between frost free and frost season trends the connection between hydroclimate and groundwater trends in sweden is more difficult to interpret particularly since the hydroclimate trends are mostly insignificant and weak further there is a boundary 63 n between southern sweden with significant groundwater trends and the north with weak or no groundwater trends 0 5 cri 0 5 fig 8 to summarise the results in sweden some key observations are defined as follows 1 ows in southwestern sweden have significant rising trends they may be a product of statistically insignificant wetting in both effective precipitation and wet day frequency over the same area fig 7a b and d a trend that is stronger for effective precipitation in frost free months other trends indicate wetting though weaker 2 ows inland 58 n 14 e in the south and southeast around 59 62 n and 15 17 e have declining groundwater trends these trends may be connected to the gradient from weak wetting trends in the southwest to weak drying trends in the southeast specifically annual trends in effective precipitation indicate strong though insignificant drying in the area fig 7a 3 north of 63 n in sweden until 65 n hydroclimate trends indicate drying only significant on the annual scale for wet day frequency fig 7d though most ows have no trends north of 65 n there are likewise no hydroclimate trends however these connections are not as sound as the link between trends in finland mainly because the hydroclimate trends analysed are weak in sweden 5 discussion 5 1 recent trends in temperature and precipitation all three datasets have increasing temperature trends on all three scales and in both climate zones 0 01 0 05 c yr the global dataset generally underestimate annual median temperatures compared to the two regional datasets particularly in the temperate climate region further the global dataset has a lower trend slope which may be because the global dataset covers a longer period the regional datasets indicate that temperatures are rising faster in cold climate in the frost season the annual trends have a lower variation in trend slope within the two climate regions and are significant for all three datasets while the seasonal temperature trends are significant only for the global dataset the regional datasets nearly always have a higher median annual sum of precipitation particularly e obs rra covering sweden in the cold climate region however the global dataset has a higher trend slope which is significant on the annual scale for both climate zones 0 38 mm yr in cold climate and 0 7 mm yr in temperate climate the frost season in cold climate 0 46 mm yr and the frost free season in temperate climate 0 96 mm yr 5 2 recent trends in effective precipitation wet day frequency and groundwater levels and their connection groundwater trends are declining significantly in southern finland below 65 n these groundwater trends correspond well to significant decreasing trends in wet day frequency and decreasing trends in effective precipitation in the frost free season groundwater level trends in northern sweden are weak and insignificant similarly to annual trends in effective precipitation further north of 65 n in southern sweden groundwater trends are significant mainly below 62 n where they are somewhat similar to insignificant annual and frost free season trends in effective precipitation however significantly declining groundwater trends in the south and southeast have no clear corresponding hydroclimate trend chen et al 2020 analysed hydroclimate change for the last century and classified sweden into three regions based on trends in different drought indices between 1902 and 2018 the north with significant wetting the southeast with significant drying and the southwest with insignificant wetting the difference in wetting and drying trends with a background of general wetting and warming is explained by varying energy vs water limiting conditions e g wu et al 2020 that is where warming is more intense than increased precipitation the effect is a drier climate and where increased precipitation trends are stronger than warming trends the effect is a wetter climate chen et al 2020 this classification better corresponds to groundwater trends in southern sweden compared to hydroclimate trends presented in this study the difference in significance and slope of trends between this and other studies may well be explained with the different temporal scales for the trend analysis chen et al 2020 in northern sweden and northern finland the hydroclimate trends between 1980 and 2010 are generally weak significant trends in precipitation fig 5 and fig 7 and effective precipitation fig 7 are constrained to the frost season similarly to other studies that have shown that winter receives the highest increase in wetness and warming bengtsson and rana 2014 chen et al 2015 ruostennoja et al 2016 caloiero et al 2018 in contrast southern finland has significantly declining groundwater levels whilst there is no trend in northern finland or in northern sweden groundwater trends are most similar to significant trends in the frost free season in wet day frequency in the south and somewhat to the lack of significant trends in effective precipitation in the north this suggest that declining groundwater levels in southern finland are affected by reduced wet day frequency which is closely related to soil moisture and groundwater recharge han et al 2019 furthermore it implies that the increase in frost season rain and melt have little impact on annual groundwater recharge except the reduction in spring melt reduced soil transmissivity caused by frost may impede winter groundwater recharge in cold climates lundberg et al 2016 the reduction in spring snowmelt caused by increased winter snowmelt and decreased winter snow storage reduces spring recharge rates this effect has already been observed in the study area kløve et al 2017 nygren et al 2020 and in other cold climate regions jasechko et al 2017 ford et al 2020 therefore hydroclimate trends in periods affected by frost may have little to no effect on groundwater storage instead there may be a disproportionate impact on groundwater storage from hydroclimate trends in frost free months 5 3 results in a broader context in snow dominated catchments the infiltration of winter rain is amongst the most important factors for the impact of climate on storage e g jyrkama and sykes 2007 and okkonen and kløve 2011 under consistently warmer conditions increased winter infiltration in cold climate regions relies on increased winter snowmelt and rainfall and on the decrease in soil frost clilverd et al 2011 jyrkama and sykes 2007 okkonen and kløve 2011 winter precipitation is increasing in the cold climate region in the study area and is predicted to continue in the future chen et al 2016 rusteenoja et al 2016 some studies have concluded that due to warming frost will disappear and thus not impact future infiltration clilverd et al 2011 jyrkama and sykes 2007 okkonen and kløve 2011 that is the climate will shift from cold to temperate where winter frost does not impede infiltration ford et al 2020 however due to the uncertain effect of frost on recharge it needs to be included in analyses of climate change impact on groundwater recharge bayard et al 2005 jyrkama and sykes 2007 okkonen and kløve 2011 indeed in this study frost season trends in hydroclimate had little or no similarity to groundwater trends instead excluding the frost season from the trend calculation annual vs frost free season trends improved the spatial similarity between hydroclimate and groundwater trends in the cold climate region this suggests that within the study period precipitation trends within the frost season have little impact on groundwater storage and that that frost cover impedes recharge on a regional scale in cold climate regions and within timeframes shorter than a century the impact of frost hence need to be considered in the estimation of groundwater recharge 5 4 approach limitations the analysis is affected by several limitations listed below 1 the approach of the groundwater balance equation introduces some error due to an over simplification of the driving variables rain melt and evapotranspiration see point 2 5 further the assumption is that hydroclimate trends are driving change in groundwater levels but this cannot be verified without data on groundwater discharge 2 the temperature index based model used to estimate rain and snowmelt will be faulty at temperatures near 0 c as precipitation phase will be affected by other factors such as humidity and vapour pressure feiccabrino 2016 3 the penman monteith equation does not include information on land cover or land use that in addition to spatial variability may change over time ala aho et al 2015 sultana and coulibaly 2011 scheliga et al 2018 wang et al 2018 pet is also estimated on a monthly scale though it varies daily this could introduce further error additionally pet is a product of the cru ts dataset which systematically underestimate median temperatures compared to the two regional datasets particularly in temperate climate since the approach relies on temperature data this implies pet is underestimated 4 woodland constitute more than 50 of land cover in sweden and finland and crops agriculture about a third of the southern end skåne and blekinge eurostat lundberg et al 2016 the difference in apparent impact of insignificant hydroclimate trends between southern sweden and the rest of sweden could thus be related to differences in large scale land management practices 5 ows used in this study are considered to be only affected by natural processes yet there is no data on groundwater extraction see section 2 4 hydrogeological context and groundwater seasonality therefore despite care being taken during the data selection process to avoid pumped aquifers some ows in the study may be affected by pumping 6 additionally relatively stationary parameters such as hydrogeologic characteristics are also important particularly on the local scale as they cause strong spatial variability in trends e g dudley and hodgkins 2013 for example topography strongly influences hydrologic fluxes due to a variety of processes and mechanisms such as differential hillslope infiltration allen et al 2014 bayard et al 2005 and snow and ice formation lundberg et al 2016 further depth to groundwater is an example of a parameter correlated to the propagation of the precipitation signal giese et al 2020 6 conclusion the objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of hydroclimate on groundwater from a seasonal frost cover perspective in a region going from temperate climate in the south to cold climate in the north sweden and finland to reach the objective annual frost free season and frost season temperature and precipitation trends are compared between two regional and one global reanalysis datasets for 1960 2019 the global dataset cru ts and 1980 2010 the regional datasets e obs rra and fmi climgrid annual frost free and frost season trends between 1980 and 2010 in effective precipitation calculated from e obs rra fmi climgrid cru ts and wet day frequency provided by cru ts are compared to groundwater trends for the same period the results indicate that 1 the region is warming significantly at a range from 0 01 to 0 05 c yr a trend which is strongest in the frost season particularly in the cold climate zone 2 the region experiences increasing precipitation which is significant for the cru ts dataset on the annual scale in both climate zones 0 39 mm yr in cold and 0 7 mm yr in temperate climate in the frost season in cold climate 0 46 mm yr and in the frost free season in temperate climate 0 96 mm yr 3 the global cru ts dataset systematically underestimates median temperatures and the median annual sum of precipitation compared to the two regional datasets this implies that pet product of the cru dataset used in the estimation of effective precipitation is underestimated 4 effective precipitation is increasing in southwestern sweden in the frost free season and in finland in the frost season in the frost free season effective precipitation is decreasing in southern finland 5 there is no change in wet day frequency in sweden within the study period in finland there is a regional decrease in wet days in the frost season and on the annual scale the trend is significant in eastern finland and in the frost free season the trend is significant in southern finland 6 groundwater trends are significant in southern finland and southern sweden with declining trends in finland and southeastern sweden and rising trends in southwestern sweden 7 groundwater trends in finland are primarily driven by decreasing wet day frequency and effective precipitation in the frost free season in southwestern sweden they are driven by increasing effective precipitation while trends in southeastern sweden could be affected by drying on the century scale dai 2013 chen et al 2020 which is outside the scope of this study 8 none of the groundwater trends corresponds well to frost season trends this implies that trends within the frost season have little impact on groundwater trends overall and that frost cover may be debilitating winter groundwater recharge in the study area these results have some uncertainty regarding the connection to significant groundwater trends in southern sweden and the lack of significant groundwater trends in northern sweden and finland hence to make reliable projections of groundwater storage there need to be more site specific evaluations of statistical relationships between groundwater recharge

4208,in cold climate the main annual recharge event is spring snowmelt projections of groundwater storage hence depend on winter hydroclimate winter recharge is a factor of rain melt and ground frost increases in winter rain and melt have already been observed however due to complex processes involved in ground frost formation and its natural patchy coverage the effect of ground frost on recharge is poorly understood the objective of the study is to improve the understanding of the connection between groundwater storage and hydroclimate in sweden and finland a region with temperate and cold climate from a seasonal frost cover perspective in the study annual frost free season and frost season temperature and precipitation trends in the climate regions are compared between one global and two regional reanalysis datasets effective precipitation and wet day frequency trends between 1980 and 2010 are compared to groundwater level trends for the same period trends are calculated using the mann kendall test and sen s slope the results show that the region is generally experiencing warming and increased precipitation these trends are strongest in the frost season further the global dataset systematically underestimates median temperatures and precipitation compared to the regional datasets effective precipitation trends are generally weak and indicate wetting in the frost season and drying in the frost free season wet day frequency trends are decreasing significantly on the regional scale in finland but with nearly no trends in sweden groundwater levels in southern finland and southeastern sweden are declining significantly while groundwater levels in southwestern sweden are significantly rising the results indicate that groundwater trends in southern finland are linked to wet day frequency and effective precipitation trends in the frost free season and that trends in the frost season have no impact on annual groundwater level trends in southern sweden groundwater level trends appear linked to annual and frost free season trends in effective precipitation though insignificantly these trends may be explained by century scale trends in precipitation drought indices identified by previous studies keywords trends climate change groundwater frost fennoscandia 1 introduction since direct and indirect impact of climate change on groundwater storage remains unclear taylor et al 2013 understanding the impact of climate requires studies correlating climatic variables to groundwater level trends holman et al 2012 however changes in groundwater storage are not linearly correlated with long term precipitation trends e g wu et al 2020 the relationship rather depends strongly on hydroclimate seasonality i e precipitation and temperature controlling effective precipitation and eventually groundwater recharge hinzman et al 2005 hamlet et al 2007 clilverd et al 2011 jasechko et al 2014 lee et al 2014 fu et al 2019 nygren et al 2020 temperature generally has a strong seasonal variability determining variability in evapotranspiration rates but also other mechanisms i e precipitation type ground frost and snowmelt and therefore affect the general soil water balance condon et al 2020 the effectiveness of rain to produce recharge is dominated by rainfall characteristics such as intensity wet spell length and frequency e g clilverd et al 2011 jasechko et al 2014 shanley et al 2016 fu et al 2019 this is because surface layers have limited infiltration capacity which is a factor of soil permeability horton 1941 therefore intense storms have a high runoff ratio and rapid recharge production is debilitated jasechko et al 2014 meixner et al 2016 on the other hand long periods of moderate rainfall allows for persistent infiltration soils become saturated and the connection between precipitation and groundwater increases han et al 2019 the latter is vulnerable to changing transpiration rates as it can reduce soil moisture hamlet et al 2007 and thus the atmosphere groundwater connection han et al 2019 evapotranspiration which varies depending on land use and land cover decreases the amount of groundwater recharge ala aho et al 2015 scheliga et al 2018 wang et al 2018 where groundwater levels are shallow or where the capillary fringe is thick groundwater and the root zone are often connected under these conditions vegetation can transpire groundwater directly condon et al 2020 martínez de la torre and miguez macho 2019 and actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration pet are similar warming including changes in the duration of the growing season as well as changing land cover characteristics wang et al 2018 therefore affects soil water availability and groundwater recharge in cold climates the growing season is largely driven by seasonality of temperature irannezhad and kløve 2015 it follows that rainfall has a higher efficiency in producing recharge in winter when transpiration rates are low jasechko et al 2014 further how seasonality in precipitation impacts groundwater storage is due to the ratio of snowmelt to rainfall input as they are found to be variably effective at producing recharge jasechko et al 2017 wu et al 2020 snow storage and ground frost play a significant role for annual groundwater recharge e g clilverd et al 2011 in these regions recharge is affected by temperature dependent processes such as snow accumulation and melt timing shanley et al 2016 hence groundwater storage typically declines in winter as precipitation accumulates at the surface and frost reduces the soil permeability bayard et al 2005 thus spring snowmelt is the main annual recharge event for aquifers in cold regions jasechko et al 2017 kløve et al 2017 in northern latitudes winter temperatures are warming most rapidly dai 2013 due to increased winter temperature variability more winter precipitation is rain and the snow water equivalent is reduced irannezhad et al 2014 however although conditions in winter are energy limited and evapotranspiration rates low or nil winter infiltration is hindered by frost lundberg et al 2016 studies predict that frost cover extent will decrease significantly within the next century enabling increased winter infiltration and recharge jyrkama and sykes 2007 okkonen and kløve 2011 however as in other subarctic regions robeson 2002 kunkel et al 2004 winter air temperatures in sweden and finland in the early 2000 s still promoted surface frost formation further in addition to air temperature ground frost formation is dependent on other factors such as conditions during the first snowfall and snow cover thickness bayard et al 2005 jungqvist et al 2014 ice influence on infiltration is also affected by the presence of gas bubbles bayard et al 2005 and frost formation or ice free zones may be patchy making the identification of areas strongly influenced by frost formed runoff complicated jones and pomeroy 2001 hence knowledge on how frost influences recharge on catchment scale and larger is often excluded in numerical studies therefore despite that much of the northern latitudes and high altitude regions are affected by snow and frost continuously and seasonally little is known on the topic lundberg et al 2016 ala aho et al 2021 the objective of this study is to assess the impact of hydroclimate on groundwater with a focus on seasonal frost cover the aim is to evaluate potential changes of hydroclimate and the impact on groundwater storage in a region dominated by cold climate sweden and finland as they relate to the frost season two hydroclimate variables that affects recharge are included in the analysis effective precipitation and wet day frequency effective precipitation is the amount of precipitation that surpasses the evapotranspiration demand in the soil and hence can be considered potential recharge wet day frequency indicates continuously wet conditions which increases soil moisture and facilitates the atmosphere groundwater connection both variables encompass a collection of parameters important for the atmosphere groundwater connection data on groundwater storage is unavailable instead groundwater level fluctuations are used as a proxy for qualitative assessment annual frost free season and frost season trends of effective precipitation wet day frequency and groundwater levels between 1980 and 2010 31 years are analysed and compared trends are calculated using the mann kendall test and sen s slope 2 study area and data 2 1 data meteorological data for finland is provided by the finnish meteorological institute and is part of the fmi climgrid at a 10 10 km daily resolution aalto et al 2016 the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute provides data for sweden the dataset is part of the e obs gridded dataset in collaboration with uerra the copernicus climate change service and the eca d project cornes et al 2018 produced with a 11v11 km daily resolution for sweden undén 2017 estimates of monthly pet average per day frost days and wet spells days are provided by the university of east anglia climatic research unit here the data version 4 04 is used the dataset is gridded on a 0 5 0 5 approximately 55 5 55 5 km monthly resolution harris et al 2020 the 4 04 version interpolates data using angular distance weighting the original data observations are temperature precipitation vapour pressure wet days and cloud cover harris et al 2020 advices caution in using the dataset to assess regional climate trends hence the dataset is compared to data and trends in the regional reanalysis datasets fmi climgrid and e obs the swedish geological survey sgu and the finnish environment agency syke provide hydrographs from groundwater level observation wells ows the time series contain a minimum of 31 years of biweekly observations with no more than 4 months missing which is imputed using the average value of the previous and following observation hydrographs known to be affected by pumping classified with poor quality by sgu or syke or with irregular time series are excluded examples of irregular time series include a sudden change in mean groundwater level or inconsistent fluctuation patterns after pre processing 256 ows out of 1500 are used due to consistency requirements in the data collection the time period is restricted to covering the period 1980 2010 the ows are at a surface elevation lower than 500 m a s l and for the ows and period used in the study the median groundwater depth is between 0 and 18 m nygren et al 2020 almost all ows are in unconsolidated quaternary sediment of glacial origin 2 2 climate context in the context of changing hydroclimate on the millennial scale studies have found that there is currently a trend towards more pluvial conditions and warmer temperatures in northern europe seftigen et al 2017 chen et al 2020 the climate has become increasingly wetter and warmer since the 1900s hartmann et al 2013 markonis et al 2018 between 1901 and 2010 the annual increase in precipitation is significant at 2 5 25 mm year decade hartmann et al 2013 in fact 1983 2012 has been the wettest period in scandinavia within the last millennium cook et al 2015 markonis et al 2018 in terms of winter hydroclimate the second half of the 1900s is even the wettest period between 1600 and 2000 ce linderholm and chen 2005 the increase is unevenly distributed between seasons winter experiencing the highest increase in wetness and temperatures bengtsson and rana 2014 chen et al 2015 ruostennoja et al 2016 caloiero et al 2018 in finland the increase in wetness is evenly distributed between both winter and summer irannezhad et al 2014 though the increase in summer precipitation is slightly counterbalanced by a prolonged growing season irannezhad and kløve 2015 however spatial differences exist in both countries finland and northern sweden experience wetting trends due to increased precipitation and weaker warming while in southeast sweden the trend is for drier climate due to a weaker precipitation increase and more intense warming dai 2013 due to the flat topography of both countries the climate is mainly affected by latitude ocean and atmospheric circulation and proximity to sea engström and uvo 2016 feiccabrino and grigg 2017 irannezhad et al 2019 as defined by the köppen geiger climate classification for the period 1980 2010 the climate is temperate in southern sweden and cold snow dominated north of 60 n in both sweden and finland fig 1 kottek et al 2006 beck et al 2018 temperate climate has monthly average temperatures exceeding 10 c in the summer and winter monthly averages between 3 c and 18 c cold climate temperatures are equal to temperate climate in summer but monthly averages are less than 3 c in winter between the temperate and cold climate zone there is an intermediate climate zone that is a subcategory of cold climate with warmer summers fig 1 important to add is that these climate zone boundaries are not stationary but stabilise on the decadal to 30 year timescales chen and chen 2013 both sweden and finland are classified as being humid meaning there is no dry season rubel et al 2017 the annual sum of precipitation for the years 1980 2010 is on average 675 mm yr 1 and 605 mm yr 1 in temperate climate south of 60 n and cold climate north of 60 n respectively fig 2 however inter annually this value may vary between 400 and 900 mm yr 1 nygren et al 2020 the corresponding annual average temperature is 8 c temperate and 2 8 c cold climate according to the ipcc emissions scenario rcp8 5 there will be an increase in average annual temperatures of 3 5 c 0 04 c yr 1 and in precipitation of 17 0 19 yr 1 between 2011 and 2099 smhi no date rusteenoja et al 2016 a continuation of warming and increased precipitation is projected for both sweden and finland within the century however with varying seasonal effects the biggest temperature increase is expected in winter the season with the biggest projected increase in precipitation followed by spring chen et al 2016 rusteenoja et al 2016 hence precipitation and temperature trends of the 20th century apply also on the 21st century results from an ensemble of climate models and emission scenarios accordingly indicate that the cold climate zone will migrate northwards with a somewhat delayed climate zone shift in sweden compared to the same latitude in finland rubel et al 2017 by the end of the current century climate change is projected to have changed most of the region to temperate humid climate rubel and kottek 2010 2 3 the frost season seasonality in recharge as a product of precipitation and evapotranspiration is commonly represented by estimating these variables through numerical models precipitation phase may be estimated using a snowmelt model and evapotranspiration rates approximated by pet calculations seasonality in recharge may be partly accounted for by using the output from calculated estimates however frost is also important for seasonality of recharge although little is known on the topic surface and ground frost formation depends on ground temperatures affected by long and short term air temperatures weather conditions before snowfall insulation of snowpack bayard et al 2005 and refreezing of snowmelt after interim warm periods in winter and early spring lundberg et al 2016 once formed frost decreases the permeability of soil reducing its infiltration capacity and transmissivity bayard et al 2005 further due to the locally heterogeneous distribution and thickness of snow the distribution of frost may also have high variation on the catchment scale jones and pomeroy 2001 the cru ts global re analysis model uses an empirical function based on minimum air temperature to produce estimates of frost this output can be used to visualise the surface extent of estimated frost distribution as a proxy for ground frost fig 3 to compare frost day duration between months day values are normalised to a fraction of the month multiplied by 30 the frost season is considered to have started when larger areas have frost for some days in a month which continues consistently in the following months it is considered to end when there is frost for fewer than 30 days i e max days after normalisation which decreases in the following month in the north of the study area the frost season starts in september in october it has spread to all of the cold climate region and ends in may furthest south the frost season starts in november and ends in april thus the two climate zones have a fairly uniform frost season extent october to may in the cold climate zone and november to april in the temperate climate zone 2 4 hydrogeological context and groundwater seasonality nordic hydrogeology in sweden and finland is characterised by the climate mainly flat or hilly bedrock and surface topography and crystalline bedrock overlain by unconsolidated glacial deposits kløve et al 2017 depth to bedrock varies between 0 to around 200 m on average 10 m kleman et al 2008 where boundary ice formations eskers other glaciofluvial deposits and fracture valleys compose the thicker soil deposits the most common sediment type is till of typically low hydraulic conductivity ojala et al 2007 further bedrock fracture porosity is highly variable knutsson 2008 but generally low deep weathering and saprolites are rare and local aquifers in sweden and finland are therefore small by international comparison and mainly of importance on the local scale richts et al 2011 fan et al 2013 for freshwater supply big cities and municipalities in sweden and finland mainly rely on surface water reservoirs smaller municipalities and private well owners in sparsely populated countryside do most groundwater extraction kløve et al 2017 extraction is highly variable and the higher quantities constrained mainly to moderately productive aquifers in eskers deltas and end moraines which are isolated from each other by clayey till or crystalline bedrock katko et al 2006 ojala et al 2007 nygren et al 2020 analysed the seasonality of groundwater levels in ows in the study area the results indicate that groundwater level seasonality in sweden and finland is linked to the köppen geiger climate zones in temperate climate groundwater levels rise mainly in winter in response to rainfall and decline in summer due to increased evapotranspiration in a northward gradient from around 57 n to around 65 n including both the temperate and the cold zones groundwater levels also rise in response to rainfall autumn and decline with increasing evapotranspiration summer in cold climates groundwater levels mainly rise in response to snowmelt in spring and decline during the frost snow season that starts sometime in autumn or early winter the seasonality in groundwater level fluctuation indicates that the recharge regime of groundwater in the study area is mainly driven by winter rain in the south and autumn rain and spring snowmelt further north 3 methods the aim of this study is to evaluate recent hydroclimate trends with a background in seasonal frost and relate them to trends in groundwater storage to include frost in the analysis annual trends are compared to trends in the frost and frost free season firstly effective precipitation and wet day frequency are estimated as they are closely linked to groundwater recharge then trends in temperature precipitation effective precipitation wet day frequency and groundwater levels are evaluated the impact on groundwater storage is assessed by comparing hydroclimate to groundwater trends 3 1 estimating effective precipitation and wet day frequency climate is a major factor in the aquifer recharge process hence climate change will impact future groundwater storage through its effect on recharge the two main components driving temporal variability in groundwater recharge are variations in precipitation and evapotranspiration this can be conceptualised by a groundwater balance equation 1 δ s p e t q where δs mm is the change in groundwater storage in the aquifer p mm is the precipitation input et mm is evapotranspiration and q mm is groundwater discharge actual evapotranspiration is not known hence potential evapotranspiration pet mm is used as a proxy pet is a product of the urc ts dataset harris et al 2020 pet data is based on the penman monteith formula applied on gridded values of mean air temperature vapour pressure cloud cover and average wind speed harris et al 2020 further since the study analyses temporal variability in diffuse recharge from precipitation and evapotranspiration and the surface groundwater connection is poor due to low hydraulic conductivity groundwater discharge q is considered constant to simplify the analysis there is no data to quantify groundwater storage at this scale however since groundwater levels reflect storage change storage may be qualitatively evaluated using groundwater levels only in cold climate regions precipitation must further be separated into rain and snowmelt wu et al 2020 since snow is accumulated at the surface only rain and snowmelt are used in the calculation focusing on effective precipitation only the simplified groundwater balance equation can hence be rewritten as 2 δ s r m p e t where r mm is rain and m mm is snowmelt rain and snowmelt are estimated on a daily basis using the finnish and swedish datasets of daily precipitation and temperature values pet as part of the urc dataset is estimated as a daily average per month thus the groundwater balance is calculated based on the daily rain and snowmelt estimates subtracted by the daily average of pet per month when conditions are water limited and pet is higher than rain and melt together the effective precipitation δs equals 0 mm snow and rain are estimated from temperature and precipitation data using daily values of precipitation and temperature daily rainfall and snowmelt magnitudes are estimated for every climate grid cell using a simple temperature index based snowmelt model rain and snowmelt bergström 1976 when the temperature is above the threshold temperature here 1 c an estimate of snowmelt production is calculated using a degree day factor here 2 74 mm c day the degree day factor is an empirical constant value which limits the amount of modelled accumulated snow that can melt per degree per day irrespective of rain or snowfall the parameter used in this study are based on results from feiccabrino and lundberg 2008 seibert 2005 and seibert and vis 2012 further information on the snowmelt model as used here can be found in nygren et al 2020 variations in precipitation may also be conceptualised by wet day frequency in addition to effective precipitation persistence in wet conditions increases the soil moisture hence facilitating the recharge process wet days per month is an output variable in the urc ts 4 04 dataset and is calculated from daily precipitation data a wet day in the urc dataset is defined as receiving 0 1 mm of precipitation 3 2 trends in effective precipitation wet day frequency and groundwater levels the two sided non parametric mann kendall test is used to calculate trends mann 1945 theil 1950 kendall 1975 and sen s slope sen 1968 are used to quantify the significance and the slope of the trend the mann kendall test is based on the assumption that the time series continuously increase or decrease a p value threshold 0 05 is used to assess whether the null hypothesis can be rejected when the p value is 0 05 the null hypothesis is rejected and there is a significant annual change if the p value is 0 05 the null hypothesis cannot be rejected and hence there is no significant trend sen s slope is a median value calculated on estimates of the slope in trends between data points the slope estimate indicates the magnitude a trend is increasing or decreasing per unit time here per year temperature and precipitation data is compared between the three climate datasets on the annual scale for the frost free season including data in months without frost and the frost season including only values in months with frost in the temperate climate zone the frost free season is between april and november and the frost season between december and march in the cold climate zone the frost free season between may and october and the frost season between november and april trends in the cru ts dataset are calculated for 60 years between 1960 and 2019 for the two regional datasets e obs and fmi climgrid trends are calculated for 31 years between 1980 and 2010 effective precipitation is calculated using the output from the groundwater balance calculation eq 2 annual frost free and frost season trends in effective precipitation mm and wet day frequency days are then calculated for the study period 1980 2010 annual differences in groundwater storage are estimated based on the median annual groundwater level m below surface sen s slope of groundwater levels m yr is dependent on environmental factors controlling the storativity meaning that a unit change in groundwater level is not comparable across sites to represent the difference between ows the trend magnitude is normalised to the change to range index cri developed by dudley and hodgkins 2013 as 3 cri s l r where s is sen s slope of the trend level time unit l time unit is the length of the record here 31 years and r level unit is the interquartile range of the data a very strong trend is given by cri values above 1 or below 1 and a strong trend by the cri values between 0 5 and 1 or 1 and 0 5 for cri values between 0 2 and 0 2 the trend is weak the sen s slope of trends in effective precipitation and wet days and the cri for groundwater levels are presented regardless of the significance to visualise the range in results 4 results the objective is to compare and connect recent hydroclimate trends from a seasonal frost perspective to trends in groundwater levels temperature and precipitation trends from three datasets between 1960 and 2019 cru ts and 1980 and 2010 e obs and fmi climgrid this is followed by the results of the 1980 2010 trend analysis of effective precipitation and wet day frequency between 1980 and 2010 finally groundwater level trends between 1980 and 2010 are presented with a comparison to hydroclimate trends 4 1 trends in temperature and precipitation the median annual temperature from three datasets used in this study is similar with consistently rising temperature trends on the regional scale in both climate zones fig 4 however the cru ts dataset systematically underestimate median temperatures in comparison to the two regional datasets e obs fmi climgrid additionally the slope of the trends representing the change in celsius per year is slightly lower for the cru ts dataset possibly due to the difference in timescale for the trend calculation 60 vs 31 years the trends are significant for all datasets on the annual scale but only for the cru ts dataset in the frost free and frost seasons finally all datasets indicate that temperatures are rising faster in the frost season fig 4 a3 and 4 b3 compared to trends per year fig 4 a1 and 4 b1 and the frost free season fig 4 a2 and 4 b2 further temperatures are rising slightly faster in the cold fig 4 a compared to the temperate fig 4 b climate zone temperature trends in the cold climate zone also have a higher variability particularly in the frost season ranging between 0 2 c yr for cru ts and fmi climgrid to almost 1 c yr for e obs fig 4 a4 6 and 4 b4 6 the median annual sum of precipitation for the two climate zones is generally higher for the two regional datasets particularly the one for sweden e obs fig 5 a1 3 and 5 b1 3 the difference between the datasets is higher on the annual scale and for the frost free season fig 5 a1 2 and 5 b1 2 the trend slope is generally higher for the cru ts dataset fig 5 a4 6 and 5 b4 6 particularly for the cold climate zone further cru ts generally has a smaller variation in trends within the dataset compared to the other datasets annual trends for the regional datasets are small and insignificant in the cold climate region while cru ts indicates precipitation is significantly increasing by 0 39 mm yr between 1960 and 2019 fig 5 a4 fmi climgrid has a slightly stronger declining trend in the frost free season and a slightly rising trend in the frost season e obs has a very weak trend in the frost free season but for the frost season the trend is stronger and declining cru ts trends are increasing for both the frost free and frost season which is significant at 0 46 mm yr for the frost season fig 5 a6 in the temperate climate zone trends in both cru ts and e obs are rising annually and in the frost free season in the frost season the e obs dataset has a declining trend fig 5 b however only cru ts has significant trends annually and in the frost free season of 0 70 mm yr and 0 96 mm yr respectively fig 5 b4 5 4 2 trends in effective precipitation and wet day frequency median trends in effective precipitation and wet day frequency are similar with similar variations fig 6 the trends are decreasing in the cold climate zone fig 6 a though effective precipitation is increasing in the frost season fig 6 a3 and 6 a6 only wet day frequency trends are significant decreasing annually and in the frost free season by 0 26 days yr and 0 37 days yr respectively fig 6 a4 and 6 a5 in the temperate climate zone trends are insignificant fig 6 b trends in wet day frequency are weak in general trends in effective precipitation are weak on the annual scale in the frost free season effective precipitation trends are stronger and increasing with weaker decreasing trends in the frost season there are varying spatial patterns of hydroclimate trends fig 7 a in the north the effective precipitation is increasing in a south westward direction trends change to indicate decreasing effective precipitation to around 60 n where the climate zone changes from cold to temperate in the temperate climate zone effective precipitation is increasing the trends are insignificant on the regional scale trends in annual wet day frequency are similar fig 7d though weaker in southern sweden however most of finland and northern sweden have decreasing wet day trends this trend is significant around 63 65 n in sweden and in eastern finland east of 25 e in the frost free season the increase in effective precipitation around 57 58 n and 11 15 e is stronger fig 7b the decrease in effective precipitation in southern finland is also stronger with some grid cells with significant trends wet day frequency trends are generally weaker with fewer significant trends in sweden fig 7e in finland trends of decreased wet day frequency have shifted from eastern to southern finland trends in the frost season are in contrast to the frost free season effective precipitation trends indicate increasing wetness over nearly the entire study area except for southern sweden where there is no trend the wetting trends are significant in middle finland and in the north wet day frequency trends indicate general drying although there are no trends in most of sweden except for significant weak drying trends around 64 n fig 7c in finland frost season wet day frequency trends fig 7f are similar to the annual trends with significant drying in the east 4 3 trends in groundwater levels groundwater level trends have some spatial coherency though there is large local variability fig 8 almost all regions have ows with significant trends the strongest trends are in finland where most ows have significantly declining groundwater level trends particularly south of 65 n except for some ows with rising levels in the southeast and far north many ows in sweden do not have a trend in groundwater levels particularly north of 63 n most trends are weak 0 5 cri 0 5 and insignificant trends are stronger further south south of 62 n and west of 15 e there are some ows with significantly rising levels in the southeast around 59 62 n and 15 17 e south around 58 n 14 e and southernmost parts of sweden the significant trend is for declining groundwater levels 4 4 connecting trends in hydroclimate to groundwater in southern finland ows have trends of significantly declining groundwater levels on the regional scale which are weak and insignificant in northern finland fig 8 these groundwater trends correspond very well to hydroclimate trends in the frost free season that is significantly declining wet day frequency trends fig 7e and enhanced trends in decreasing effective precipitation fig 7b in southern finland further the absence of significant groundwater trends in northern finland correspond to insignificant and weak hydroclimate trends in the same area in contrast there is a general increase in effective precipitation in the frost season fig 7c which is counterintuitive to observed ow trends significant frost season trends in wet day frequency are distributed in eastern finland fig 7f which does not correspond to the pattern of negative groundwater trends that are distributed in the south the visual connection between ow and annual hydroclimate trends is vague and in between frost free and frost season trends the connection between hydroclimate and groundwater trends in sweden is more difficult to interpret particularly since the hydroclimate trends are mostly insignificant and weak further there is a boundary 63 n between southern sweden with significant groundwater trends and the north with weak or no groundwater trends 0 5 cri 0 5 fig 8 to summarise the results in sweden some key observations are defined as follows 1 ows in southwestern sweden have significant rising trends they may be a product of statistically insignificant wetting in both effective precipitation and wet day frequency over the same area fig 7a b and d a trend that is stronger for effective precipitation in frost free months other trends indicate wetting though weaker 2 ows inland 58 n 14 e in the south and southeast around 59 62 n and 15 17 e have declining groundwater trends these trends may be connected to the gradient from weak wetting trends in the southwest to weak drying trends in the southeast specifically annual trends in effective precipitation indicate strong though insignificant drying in the area fig 7a 3 north of 63 n in sweden until 65 n hydroclimate trends indicate drying only significant on the annual scale for wet day frequency fig 7d though most ows have no trends north of 65 n there are likewise no hydroclimate trends however these connections are not as sound as the link between trends in finland mainly because the hydroclimate trends analysed are weak in sweden 5 discussion 5 1 recent trends in temperature and precipitation all three datasets have increasing temperature trends on all three scales and in both climate zones 0 01 0 05 c yr the global dataset generally underestimate annual median temperatures compared to the two regional datasets particularly in the temperate climate region further the global dataset has a lower trend slope which may be because the global dataset covers a longer period the regional datasets indicate that temperatures are rising faster in cold climate in the frost season the annual trends have a lower variation in trend slope within the two climate regions and are significant for all three datasets while the seasonal temperature trends are significant only for the global dataset the regional datasets nearly always have a higher median annual sum of precipitation particularly e obs rra covering sweden in the cold climate region however the global dataset has a higher trend slope which is significant on the annual scale for both climate zones 0 38 mm yr in cold climate and 0 7 mm yr in temperate climate the frost season in cold climate 0 46 mm yr and the frost free season in temperate climate 0 96 mm yr 5 2 recent trends in effective precipitation wet day frequency and groundwater levels and their connection groundwater trends are declining significantly in southern finland below 65 n these groundwater trends correspond well to significant decreasing trends in wet day frequency and decreasing trends in effective precipitation in the frost free season groundwater level trends in northern sweden are weak and insignificant similarly to annual trends in effective precipitation further north of 65 n in southern sweden groundwater trends are significant mainly below 62 n where they are somewhat similar to insignificant annual and frost free season trends in effective precipitation however significantly declining groundwater trends in the south and southeast have no clear corresponding hydroclimate trend chen et al 2020 analysed hydroclimate change for the last century and classified sweden into three regions based on trends in different drought indices between 1902 and 2018 the north with significant wetting the southeast with significant drying and the southwest with insignificant wetting the difference in wetting and drying trends with a background of general wetting and warming is explained by varying energy vs water limiting conditions e g wu et al 2020 that is where warming is more intense than increased precipitation the effect is a drier climate and where increased precipitation trends are stronger than warming trends the effect is a wetter climate chen et al 2020 this classification better corresponds to groundwater trends in southern sweden compared to hydroclimate trends presented in this study the difference in significance and slope of trends between this and other studies may well be explained with the different temporal scales for the trend analysis chen et al 2020 in northern sweden and northern finland the hydroclimate trends between 1980 and 2010 are generally weak significant trends in precipitation fig 5 and fig 7 and effective precipitation fig 7 are constrained to the frost season similarly to other studies that have shown that winter receives the highest increase in wetness and warming bengtsson and rana 2014 chen et al 2015 ruostennoja et al 2016 caloiero et al 2018 in contrast southern finland has significantly declining groundwater levels whilst there is no trend in northern finland or in northern sweden groundwater trends are most similar to significant trends in the frost free season in wet day frequency in the south and somewhat to the lack of significant trends in effective precipitation in the north this suggest that declining groundwater levels in southern finland are affected by reduced wet day frequency which is closely related to soil moisture and groundwater recharge han et al 2019 furthermore it implies that the increase in frost season rain and melt have little impact on annual groundwater recharge except the reduction in spring melt reduced soil transmissivity caused by frost may impede winter groundwater recharge in cold climates lundberg et al 2016 the reduction in spring snowmelt caused by increased winter snowmelt and decreased winter snow storage reduces spring recharge rates this effect has already been observed in the study area kløve et al 2017 nygren et al 2020 and in other cold climate regions jasechko et al 2017 ford et al 2020 therefore hydroclimate trends in periods affected by frost may have little to no effect on groundwater storage instead there may be a disproportionate impact on groundwater storage from hydroclimate trends in frost free months 5 3 results in a broader context in snow dominated catchments the infiltration of winter rain is amongst the most important factors for the impact of climate on storage e g jyrkama and sykes 2007 and okkonen and kløve 2011 under consistently warmer conditions increased winter infiltration in cold climate regions relies on increased winter snowmelt and rainfall and on the decrease in soil frost clilverd et al 2011 jyrkama and sykes 2007 okkonen and kløve 2011 winter precipitation is increasing in the cold climate region in the study area and is predicted to continue in the future chen et al 2016 rusteenoja et al 2016 some studies have concluded that due to warming frost will disappear and thus not impact future infiltration clilverd et al 2011 jyrkama and sykes 2007 okkonen and kløve 2011 that is the climate will shift from cold to temperate where winter frost does not impede infiltration ford et al 2020 however due to the uncertain effect of frost on recharge it needs to be included in analyses of climate change impact on groundwater recharge bayard et al 2005 jyrkama and sykes 2007 okkonen and kløve 2011 indeed in this study frost season trends in hydroclimate had little or no similarity to groundwater trends instead excluding the frost season from the trend calculation annual vs frost free season trends improved the spatial similarity between hydroclimate and groundwater trends in the cold climate region this suggests that within the study period precipitation trends within the frost season have little impact on groundwater storage and that that frost cover impedes recharge on a regional scale in cold climate regions and within timeframes shorter than a century the impact of frost hence need to be considered in the estimation of groundwater recharge 5 4 approach limitations the analysis is affected by several limitations listed below 1 the approach of the groundwater balance equation introduces some error due to an over simplification of the driving variables rain melt and evapotranspiration see point 2 5 further the assumption is that hydroclimate trends are driving change in groundwater levels but this cannot be verified without data on groundwater discharge 2 the temperature index based model used to estimate rain and snowmelt will be faulty at temperatures near 0 c as precipitation phase will be affected by other factors such as humidity and vapour pressure feiccabrino 2016 3 the penman monteith equation does not include information on land cover or land use that in addition to spatial variability may change over time ala aho et al 2015 sultana and coulibaly 2011 scheliga et al 2018 wang et al 2018 pet is also estimated on a monthly scale though it varies daily this could introduce further error additionally pet is a product of the cru ts dataset which systematically underestimate median temperatures compared to the two regional datasets particularly in temperate climate since the approach relies on temperature data this implies pet is underestimated 4 woodland constitute more than 50 of land cover in sweden and finland and crops agriculture about a third of the southern end skåne and blekinge eurostat lundberg et al 2016 the difference in apparent impact of insignificant hydroclimate trends between southern sweden and the rest of sweden could thus be related to differences in large scale land management practices 5 ows used in this study are considered to be only affected by natural processes yet there is no data on groundwater extraction see section 2 4 hydrogeological context and groundwater seasonality therefore despite care being taken during the data selection process to avoid pumped aquifers some ows in the study may be affected by pumping 6 additionally relatively stationary parameters such as hydrogeologic characteristics are also important particularly on the local scale as they cause strong spatial variability in trends e g dudley and hodgkins 2013 for example topography strongly influences hydrologic fluxes due to a variety of processes and mechanisms such as differential hillslope infiltration allen et al 2014 bayard et al 2005 and snow and ice formation lundberg et al 2016 further depth to groundwater is an example of a parameter correlated to the propagation of the precipitation signal giese et al 2020 6 conclusion the objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of hydroclimate on groundwater from a seasonal frost cover perspective in a region going from temperate climate in the south to cold climate in the north sweden and finland to reach the objective annual frost free season and frost season temperature and precipitation trends are compared between two regional and one global reanalysis datasets for 1960 2019 the global dataset cru ts and 1980 2010 the regional datasets e obs rra and fmi climgrid annual frost free and frost season trends between 1980 and 2010 in effective precipitation calculated from e obs rra fmi climgrid cru ts and wet day frequency provided by cru ts are compared to groundwater trends for the same period the results indicate that 1 the region is warming significantly at a range from 0 01 to 0 05 c yr a trend which is strongest in the frost season particularly in the cold climate zone 2 the region experiences increasing precipitation which is significant for the cru ts dataset on the annual scale in both climate zones 0 39 mm yr in cold and 0 7 mm yr in temperate climate in the frost season in cold climate 0 46 mm yr and in the frost free season in temperate climate 0 96 mm yr 3 the global cru ts dataset systematically underestimates median temperatures and the median annual sum of precipitation compared to the two regional datasets this implies that pet product of the cru dataset used in the estimation of effective precipitation is underestimated 4 effective precipitation is increasing in southwestern sweden in the frost free season and in finland in the frost season in the frost free season effective precipitation is decreasing in southern finland 5 there is no change in wet day frequency in sweden within the study period in finland there is a regional decrease in wet days in the frost season and on the annual scale the trend is significant in eastern finland and in the frost free season the trend is significant in southern finland 6 groundwater trends are significant in southern finland and southern sweden with declining trends in finland and southeastern sweden and rising trends in southwestern sweden 7 groundwater trends in finland are primarily driven by decreasing wet day frequency and effective precipitation in the frost free season in southwestern sweden they are driven by increasing effective precipitation while trends in southeastern sweden could be affected by drying on the century scale dai 2013 chen et al 2020 which is outside the scope of this study 8 none of the groundwater trends corresponds well to frost season trends this implies that trends within the frost season have little impact on groundwater trends overall and that frost cover may be debilitating winter groundwater recharge in the study area these results have some uncertainty regarding the connection to significant groundwater trends in southern sweden and the lack of significant groundwater trends in northern sweden and finland hence to make reliable projections of groundwater storage there need to be more site specific evaluations of statistical relationships between groundwater recharge

4209,due to the poor understanding of fractured aquifer systems the choice of the best locations for the installation of productive wells in these aquifers is a challenge for hydrogeology the present work aims to propose and apply a method to evaluate the water productivity of the serra geral aquifer system sgas in northern paraná environmental factors that influence the aquifer productivity were defined and weights were assigned ranging from 1 to 5 as well as ranges and classes that varied from 1 to 10 using data from wells and structural lineaments identified in the area maps of estimates were prepared using the ordinary kriging method the maps were then multiplied by the previously assigned weights and classes generating the water productivity map fapi multiple linear regression mlr was applied to validate the assigned weights and obtain the sgas water productivity equation the fapi map indicates that the majority of the study area 58 has low water productivity followed by medium productivity 27 7 the other classes represented low percentages in the area the mlr demonstrated that the weights assigned were mostly correct with the exception of the weight of the specific capacity factor which could be lower despite this the model generated was considered representative p 0 05 r2 0 85 it was also possible to suggest areas more favorable to the location of tubular wells in the study area finally the proposed method and the fapi map are considered innovative and important tools for urban and environmental planning aiming at better management of water resources keywords aquifer productivity methodological proposal hydrogeological modelling groundwater 1 introduction intensification in the use of water resources mainly surfaces caused by population and economic growth generates impacts not only on the quantity of water used but also on its quality leading to so called relative scarcity in addition as an alternative to the increase in demand for water consumption the use of groundwater has also been growing borges et al 2017 khosravi et al 2018 due to this fact concern regarding understanding the functioning of the different aquifer systems and their preservation has led to several studies mainly with regard to the aspects of water quality and vulnerability to contamination aiding in the development of methods that identify the weaknesses of aquifers the drastic method developed by aller et al 1987 is one of the most commonly used methods to evaluate aquifer vulnerability to contamination khosravi et al 2018 drastic is an index that evaluates the vulnerability to contamination in any hydrogeological scenario using the intrinsic physical characteristics of an area the advantage of using intrinsic vulnerability indices refers to the mapping of this information in a spatial domain lisboa et al 2016 the method is composed of a numerical ranking system using the factors water depth d recharge r aquifer a soil s topography t impact on the vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c assigning weights ranges and classes to each environmental factor to determine their relative importance to aquifer vulnerability aller et al 1987 in view of several current studies carried out using the drastic method and its adaptations as in the work of al adamat et al 2003 santos et al 2006 melo júnior 2008 kazakis and voudouris 2015 lisboa et al 2016 borges et al 2017 mfonka et al 2018 pacheco et al 2018 asfaw and mengistu 2020 and considering the efficiency of this method in the assessment of aquifer vulnerability the possibility of developing methods based on drastic is questioned to assess no longer the vulnerability but rather the aquifer productivity mainly in more complex hydrogeological environments such as fractured aquifers in these aquifers the primary porosity and permeability of the rock are extremely low causing water to be stored and circulated only between the fractures and structures present in the rocky basement rebouças 1978 athayde 2012 roques et al 2016 this characteristic of fractured aquifers makes the exploration of this type of system one of the greatest challenges of hydrogeology since the hydraulic properties are very variable resulting in extremely heterogeneous anisotropic and discontinuous aquifers which can cause difficulties losses and frustrations in drilling unproductive or even dry wells and lead to less efficient water resource management freitas 2000 douagui et al 2019 it is necessary therefore to map with better precision the areas with the greatest potential for the occurrence of groundwater integrating several environmental factors as well as the drastic method freitas 2000 it is possible to highlight some studies that assess water productivity using one or more environmental factors in fractured aquifers lattman and parizek 1964 evaluated the influence of the distance between wells and structural lineaments in an aquifer of carbonate rocks anaba onana et al 2017 in addition to studying the lineaments also evaluated the depth of the well and weathering type of rock and topography in a crystalline rock aquifer lee et al 2012 andualem and demeke 2019 and nigussie et al 2019 used these factors and the vegetation density of the drainage network and or soil of an area to map the water productivity of a fractured aquifer with a predominance of basalts assigning weights to the factors as a methodological proposal based on the drastic method the fractured aquifer productivity index fapi developed and presented in the current work consists of a model that aims to evaluate not the vulnerability but the water productivity in fractured aquifers in the fapi method the determining environmental factors were modified to identify which most contributed to the greater production of water in this type of hydrogeological environment in this sense the current study aims to create and apply the fapi method to evaluate the water productivity of a fractured aquifer system in a set of predominantly urban watersheds in londrina cambé and ibiporã pr to serve as an urban and environmental planning tool for the region assisting in the future location of wells and providing subsidies for the use and occupation of urban land 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of the study area the study area of the current work comprises the watersheds partly or wholly inserted in the urban perimeters of the municipalities of cambé londrina and ibiporã located between the coordinates 23 11 07 and 23 26 58 south latitude and 51 25 47 and 50 58 10 west longitude as seen in fig 1 the area was chosen because it contains a large number of deep tubular wells which are drilled mainly in more urbanized areas where the largest population and a high number of industries are concentrated the study area is located in the mesozoic compartment of the paraná sedimentary basin and its rocks belong to the são bento group represented by the serra geral formation composed of igneous rocks originating from a series of extensive jurassic cretaceous basalt flows these are basic effusive tholeitic rocks with massive vesicular aphanitic and gray to black basalts rebouças and fraga 1988 mineropar 2003 there is also the presence of sedimentary material such as siltstones and sandstones interspersed with successive lava flows celligoi 1993 mineropar 2001 the lava flows have lateral extension and vertical continuity that overlap with each lava flow having thicknesses ranging from 5 to 25 m fernandes et al 2010 when studying outcrops of the serra geral formation in the state of são paulo brazil verified a lateral extension of the layers of at least 30 km however the authors point out that due to the thickness observed in the area and the mechanisms of lava placement it is expected that the lateral extensions are very large 600 km or more as occurs in the basalts of the columbia river basalt group and other basaltic provinces there is also the presence of faults and or fractures called structural lineaments with predominantly ne sw and nw se directions in addition to the existence of an important group of lineaments with e w orientation zalán et al 1987 mineropar 2001 londrina 2010 these failures and fractures generated by tectonism as well as fractures caused by cooling of the magma allow the storage and circulation of groundwater in the rocks of this region constituting an important hydrogeological unit of the fractured type the sasg which due to rocky discontinuities presents strong heterogeneity and anisotropy rebouças and fraga 1988 subdivide the sasg into two units the upper one being the product of the weathering of the basalts limited by a surface of physical discontinuity which is characterized as a zone of relatively higher permeability the structure of the lava flows located below this discontinuity lower unit as the movement cooling and content of the lava gases occurred originated layers characterized by a vesicular or amygdaloidal top zone with the presence of horizontal diaclases which represents the preferred zone for circulation of water an intermediate zone which has vertical diaclases with vertical water circulation and a basal zone which presents microvesicles and glassy material rebouças and fraga 1988 rosa filho et al 2006 according to celligoi and brito 1999 in sasg the permeability depends on the spatial disposition of the vacuoles and presents better results when they are interconnected with fracture and fault structures which allows the water to percolate up to the diaclases of the lower portion of the lava flow which do not have very effective water circulation in this sense the serra geral formation due to its lithologic characteristics does not give to sasg an important primary porosity and permeabitily which may not allow significant storage of water volumes the complexity of lithologic and structural features through which water is circulated makes hydraulic conductivity very variable and even difficult to assess rosa filho et al 2006 athayde et al 2012 explained that due to the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the sasg cases were observed in which two tubular wells separated by a distance of 10 m presented different specific capacities according to data from the instituto das águas do paraná approximately 230 tubular wells exploit the sasg in the study area fig 2 in the areas of flat or smooth undulating relief red oxisols have developed which can be eutrophic or dystrophic these soils are clayey homogeneous deep porous or very porous ibge 2007 embrapa 2008 the regions of smooth wavy to wavy relief on the other hand contain eutropheric red nitosols which are strongly developed have a clayey homogeneous texture and little color difference between the horizons ibge 2007 iac 2012 in the most rugged relief areas are the regolitic eutrophic neosols which have a clayey texture are shallow and stony embrapa 2008 and close to the channel of the tibagi river lower areas and alluvial plains developed haplic gleysols which in general are formed by recent sediments have gray to black colors in the superficial horizon are shallow and have medium to high levels of organic carbon santos and zaroni 2019 2 2 fractured aquifer productivity index by reviewing the existing literature and evaluating geological and pedological factors that influence water productivity in the sgas carried out previously by the authors the factors that most contribute to water productivity in fractured aquifers formed by basaltic rocks were defined 2 2 1 flow structures f the aquifers that have the basalts as basement rock are formed by different lava flows consecutively occurred and that have a geostructure characterized by a degassing zone top of the layer where the gases present in the lava are trapped below already the consolidated plates forming vacuoles vesicles a horizontal disjunction zone upper portion of the lava layer formed by magmatic contraction or laminar lava flows generating horizontal diaclases a vertical disjunction zone central portion of the lava flow that has predominantly vertical diaclases resulting from the slow cooling of the lava and a vitreous zone the lower portion of the lava flow in which there is amorphous material which has horizontal diaclases as a consequence of rapid cooling when in contact with the basement freeze and cherry 1979 rebouças and fraga 1988 celligoi 1993 miller 1999 bertrand et al 2010 gastmans et al 2016 miller 1999 points out that the upper and lower portions of basaltic effusions generally present greater permeability due to the presence of horizontal vesicles and diaclases the center of the flow forms a dense zone of low permeability between these two more permeable zones greater water storage and flow in these aquifers occurs when these structures are interconnected vesicles horizontal and vertical fractures adyalkar and mani 1974 also state that the presence size and quantity of vesicles tend to increase porosity and aquifer permeability controlling their productivity fraser et al 2018 highlight that the vesicular cavities provide the flow path for the water together with the joints and flaws of the basalts previous studies carried out by peterlini et al 2020 in the same study area have shown that tubular wells that present in their geological profiles only vesicles or only fractures have a lower flow rate than wells that have both structures in addition the observed correlation between the presence of both structures and the flow presented an r 0 51 considered as a moderate correlation based on these studies that prove the moderate influence that horizontal and vertical fracture structures caused by tectonism pressure relief and lava cooling as well as vesicles exert on aquifer productivity this group of structures was defined as one of the factors to compose the method proposed in the present work thus to determine the number of structures in the study area the information on the geological profiles of each well provided by the instituto das águas do paraná which indicate the drilling intervals and local geological characteristics such as the presence of vesicles and basalt fractures were observed fig 3 shows an example of the geological profile of a tubular well in this sense for the study of the structures the sum of the thicknesses of the rock with vesicles and fractures was calculated di where i 1 2 n and subsequently considering the total depth of the well dt the percentage of structures present in the profile was calculated f using equation 1 1 f d i 100 dt in addition to the structures located inside the basalt flows according to fraga 1986 and fernandes et al 2010 the contact zones between flows also called agglomeratic breccias or intertrapean sandstones can form between two lava flows deposited at different times these zones are generally filled with sedimentary material sand silty clayey that was included in the lava from the overflow agglomeratic breccias occur when lava flows cover considerable sediment thickness in the intertrapean sandstones on the other hand the thickness of sediments may be smaller from a few centimeters to 20 m in addition to being very silicified which if chaotically mixed with the overlapping lava flow give rise to basaltic breccias srivastava et al 2016 who studied sediments between lava flows in the basaltic province of deccan india claimed that these sediments are also common in other volcanic provinces such as columbia river basalt usa karoo flood basalt south africa and north atlantic igneous province hartmann et al 2012 and reis et al 2014 in studies carried out in the serra geral formation brazil highlight that the intertrapean sandstones and volcanic breccias found in the regions between two basaltic lava flows because they are intensely silicified and have high clay content have very low porosity which does not make reservoirs very effective porosity in the case of breccias can be secondary and localized 2 2 2 lineament distance d there are several works that provide evidence on the influence that the distance from fractures caused by tectonism called structural lineaments has on the water productivity of wells that exploit fractured aquifer systems lattman and parizek 1964 celligoi and duarte 1997 braathen and gabrielsen 1998 mabee 1999 madrucci et al 2003 holland and witthüser 2011 peterlini 2017 according to these works the wells closest to structural lineaments can present greater productivity since the greater the proximity of the fractures the greater the fracture of the rocks and thus they become more favorable to the infiltration circulation and storage of groundwater to consider the influence that the structural lineaments have on the productivity of the wells the structural lineaments existing in the study area were identified through the observation of rectilinear features of the relief utilizing the shaded relief technique in srtm images used by peterlini 2017 statistical studies carried out by the author on the sgas in the region of londrina found that the structural lineaments have a greater influence on the productivity of wells especially at distances up to 400 m peterlini 2017 2 2 3 discharge q according to cprm 1998 the discharge q is a measure of the volume of water that leaves the well in a given period and its unit is presented in cubic meters per hour m3 h the discharge of a tubular well is determined by means of pumping tests that is water is pumped while the evolution of the lowering water in the well is recorded cprm 1998 feitosa and manoel filho 2000 the discharge of the wells was determined as an important factor for the evaluation of the water productivity of the aquifer as this constitutes an indicator of the amount of water that can and is already being extracted at that point according to studies developed by celligoi and duarte 1997 viana and celligoi 2002 and peterlini 2017 it was observed that the majority of the wells located in the region of londrina have discharges less than 10 m3 h while exceptional discharges 50 m3 h were observed in a low number of wells 2 2 4 specific capacity c the specific capacity of a well can be defined as the ratio between the discharge that is pumped and the drawdown caused in the water level given in m3 h m neves et al 2004 according to neves 2005 and celligoi 1993 specific capacity can be considered the parameter that best represents the productivity of tubular wells in this sense all the specific capacity values for the wells present in the study area were calculated research developed by celligoi 1993 and peterlini 2017 demonstrates that the specific capacity of wells located in londrina presents an exponential distribution of values which means that a greater number of wells have a lower specific capacity value generally 1 m3 h m and a low number of wells have specific capacities 10 m3 h m 2 2 5 well depth w the well depth is an important factor to assist in the study of water productivity as it may be correlated to well discharge studies carried out by freitas et al 2001 neves 2005 abreu et al 2016 peterlini 2017 and douagui et al 2019 demonstrate the existence of a correlation between these hydrodynamic parameters as the authors observed a reduction in discharge with the increase in the depth of the well the authors concluded that this can be explained by the lithostatic pressure that overlying rocks exert causing a reduction in the number of fractures at greater depth as well as reducing the opening of existing fractures which causes a decrease in the permeability of the rocks 2 2 6 lineament direction l the direction of rock fractures lineaments is characterized as a relevant factor in the evaluation of aquifer productivity since according to neves et al 2002 many works have been developed that aim to link the production of wells with their position in relation to the structural lineaments the author highlights some studies in addition to her own that correlate not only the distance of the lineament versus water productivity but also the direction of these lineaments providing evidence of their influence assatse et al 2015 also observed a correlation between the direction of the lineaments and the high productivity of the wells in the yaoundé region cameroon corgne et al 2010 note that certain specific orientations that result from geological deformation are highly correlated with groundwater productivity ranganai and ebinger 2008 observed that the directions of the lineaments present in a fractured aquifer in south central zimbabwe are related to the water productivity of wells due to these structures being generated mainly by tectonic efforts such as compression and shear stress tectonism can generate greater openness in fractures and greater fracture in rocks conditioning greater storage and water flow in these places in addition celligoi and duarte 1997 in their research developed in wells that exploit the sgas in the region of londrina describe the presence of 4 families of predominant seams in the area n s n45 w n50 e and n83 e the latter considered as having an ew direction among these directions by means of production data on the wells discharge and specific capacity the author shows that the wells located close to the structural lineaments with an ew direction present higher discharges and specific capacities followed by the ne and nw directions respectively this is because according to freeze and cherry 1979 the direction of highest permeability in volcanic rocks aquifers is generally parallel to the lava flows 2 2 7 soil thickness s depending on the climate and weathering to be formed the soil is a relevant factor for water productivity in humid climates where chemical weathering predominates soils are generally deeper than those formed in dry climate regions where physical weathering is more active ranganai and ebinger 2008 state that thicker regoliths generally occur over areas of intense rock fracturing costa and silva 2000 ranganai and ebinger 2008 point out that a greater thickness of soil allows greater capture of precipitated water less losses by runoff and water evaporation anaba onana 2017 highlight a range of soil thickness from 5 to 35 m in which wells that exploit fractured aquifers have higher water productivity in cameroon however studies carried out by peterlini et al 2020 for the same area studied here indicate that a smaller soil thickness is related to a greater flow from wells in the region this fact can occur because in soils that present a great thickness the time in which the water takes to percolate and reach the fractures of the rocks is also greater making the aquifer recharge to happen more slowly in addition the precipitated water may be retained in the most superficial layers of the soil making it difficult to recharge the fractures deyassa et al 2014 when studying a fractured aquifer of crystalline rock in ethiopia observed that the wells located in the northern region of the studied area which had less soil thickness than the southern and western regions had higher yields the authors also point out that low flow values were observed in the western region which had the highest soil thickness of all the studied regions despite the fact that it presents a greater amount of rainfall and that this is due to the high storage capacity of the thick regolith cover on the rock in order to obtain soil thickness data the geological profiles of the wells provided by the instituto das águas do paraná were analyzed 2 2 8 calculation of fapi based on the knowledge presented above weights were assigned to environmental factors highlighted in table 1 the weights range from 1 to 5 where the greater the influence and importance of the factor the greater its weight after identifying the factors and assigning the weights the ranges of values for each factor and the ratings were defined ranging from 1 to 10 also according to their importance for the flow structures factor f it was considered that the greater the number of structures the greater the water productivity therefore the ranges and ratings shown in table 2 were established considering the greatest influence of distance of the structural lineaments on the wells presented in item 3 2 and knowing that the shorter the well versus lineament distance the greater the water productivity the ranges and ratings for factor d are presented in table 3 regarding the discharge factor q as this is a direct indicator of water production for determining the ranges and ratings it was considered that the higher the discharge the greater the aquifer productivity in the location the ranges of values and ratings were defined as shown in table 4 regarding the specific capacity factor c discharge can be considered a direct indicator of productivity taking this fact into account it was considered that the greater the specific capacity the greater the productivity the established range and rating values are shown in table 5 for the well depth factor w the ranges and ratings of values table 6 were established considering that the greater the depth of the well the lower its water productivity the results of water productivity versus the direction of the structural lineaments found by celligoi 1993 were used to determine the ranges and ratings for the lineament direction factor d in the model in this sense the azimuths of the lineaments were extracted to determine the angular range for each observed direction these values are shown in table 7 finally to determine the ranges and ratings of the soil thickness factor presented in table 8 it was considered that the lesser the thickness the greater its contribution to aquifer productivity from the values of weights ranges and ratings presented the fapi was calculated using equation 3 considering different combinations of values the productivity index can vary from 45 to 190 from the calculated fapi value water productivity can be divided according to table 9 for the classification of the productivity map fapi fw fr dw dr qw qr cw cr ww wr lw lr sw sr 3 where fapi fractured

many wells as possible each factor had a different number of wells since in many cases the same wells that had discharge data might not have data on structures soil thickness or another factor as the data values of the wells are points it was necessary to use a geostatistical method to estimate the values of the factors presented for the study area using the ordinary kriging method unidirectional semivariograms with 90 tolerance were modeled for factors i q c w l and s for the generation of grids through the grids contour maps were generated and the estimated values were then separated according to the intervals of the previously established ranges for the generation of the factor d map structural lineaments were identified and the buffer tool was applied to establish distance ranges in a gis environment vectorization was performed for later generation of raster products from then on a reclassification was carried out assigning the values of the ratings to the bands ir dr qr cr wr lr sr finally using the raster calculator the sum of the class maps was multiplied by the respective weights iw dw qw cw ww lw sw applying equation 3 the fapi map for the region under study was generated from this and the steps of the fapi map generation process are shown in the flowchart of fig 4 2 4 validation of the water productivity model the generation of a water productivity map for the sgas in the municipalities of londrina cambé and ibiporã is a model that indicates the areas that could present greater groundwater production and which consequently are more favorable to the location of tubular wells in the studied area as with any model that seeks to explain an environmental phenomenon it is necessary to carry out a validation step in this sense for the validation of the generated model multiple linear regression mlr analysis was applied to verify that the weights attributed to the factors are correct as well as to obtain the mathematical equation that represents the water productivity of the sgas in the area like the simple linear regression slr the mlr seeks to express the existing relationships between known magnitudes and magnitudes to be determined through mathematical equations this equation is obtained by adjusting a curve to the observed data from which the relationship between different variables can be graphically or analytically represented piana et al 2009 hair et al 2009 however in the slr the existing relationship is obtained by analyzing only two variables one dependent and the other independent while the mlr is more complete as it involves the study of the correlation of more than one independent variable for the prediction of the dependent variable hair et al 2009 in this sense the model generated by the mlr is represented by equation 4 y β0 β1 x1 β2 x2 βp xp e 4 in which y corresponds to the predicted value of the dependent variable βi i 0 1 2 p are the regression coefficients to be estimated xi i 0 1 2 p are the values of the independent variables and e is a random error component since these errors must be independent and follow a normal distribution with zero mean and unknown variance as the data in the present study came from two different sources wells and structural lineaments and considering that the number of samples was different for each factor 222 wells were selected to be used in the validation process using maps to estimate the factors generated by the kriging and fapi map information on i d q c w l s independent variables and water productivity dependent variable were collected for each well and subsequently the mlr was performed 3 results and discussion 3 1 zoning of water productivity after generating the maps for estimating and reclassifying the ranges according to the ratings equation 3 presented above was applied assigning the weights to the factors the result was the generation of a map that indicates the areas of greatest water productivity for the study area as shown in fig 5 as seen in the map the fapi values for the study area did not vary from 45 to 190 but from 53 to 168 the very low productivity zones represent approximately 8 1 of the estimated area while the low productivity zones were observed in the majority of the area representing approximately 58 medium productivity was observed as the second largest class corresponding to 27 7 of the area and finally high and very high productivity zones were equivalent to 5 9 and 0 3 respectively it is possible to observe that the fapi map presents several rectilinear zones that have medium to very high productivity these zones became more evident due to the presence of structural lineaments and the weight attributed to factor d making these zones the areas of greatest productivity observed on the map in addition it is important to highlight that although small the zones classified as very productive were observed close to the lineaments in the ew direction making these areas the most favorable to the location of deep tubular wells which corroborates the results obtained by celligoi 1993 who also point out that the areas close to the lineaments in this direction combined with regular adjacent vegetation are the most appropriate for the location and obtention of more productive wells the zones of medium water productivity present greater spreading which start from the surroundings of one lineament to another indicating that the greater the density and proximity between lineaments of an area the greater the coverage of the zone of medium productivity favoring the drilling of wells with higher discharges and specific capacities in these locations in this sense the largest areas of medium productivity are located in the n nw and se of the area the zones of very low productivity can be observed more in the central region of the area by analyzing the contour maps for each factor it can be seen that this region has in most of the factors used the worst factors for aquifer favorability leading to the result obtained on the fapi map on the other hand there is a great density of wells drilled in this area mainly because it is located in the central region of the city of londrina where many residential condominiums are located whose source of water is the sgas this fact coupled with the possibility of new drilling in this area could contribute to a reduction in the water level of the aquifer further aggravating the low productivity scenario in the central region with the possibility of influencing the discharge of water into the drainage network 3 2 multiple linear regression to verify that the weights attributed to the environmental factors are correct and to validate the water productivity model mlr was applied to the data the results of the analysis of variance anova are presented in table 10 the total variability present in the anova can be divided into two parts one part due to the regression and the other due to the random variation measured through the residuals if there is regression it is expected that the majority of the variability portion pertains to the regression and less is due to the residuals this can be seen through the value of sq which demonstrates that the portion belonging to the regression 98 387 28 is greater than the portion of the residual 17 345 57 showing that there is regression and that the environmental factors chosen may have some relationship with water productivity which enables prediction through the value of the f test of global significance p 1 58 10 84 it can be seen that at least one variable present in the model is related to water productivity since the p 0 05 value indicates that there is statistical significance table 11 presents the results of significance for each environmental factor in the model to verify which are related to water productivity in addition to presenting the β coefficients enabling evaluation of whether the assigned weights are correct as seen from the p values all environmental factors presented statistical significance as the values were much lower than 0 05 indicating that there is a relationship between each factor used and water productivity in this sense replacing the values of the coefficients and the factors in equation 4 the mathematical equation that can estimate the water productivity wp of the sgas in a given location in the studied area is presented by equation 5 wp 3 97 2 09i 4 29d 3 31q 4 33c 0 72 w 2 44l 1 12s 5 when comparing the present equation with equation 3 used to calculate the fapi great similarity can be observed in the values of the weights with the values of the coefficients however the values of standardized coefficients indicate that factor c could have been given less weight than factors l and q as the latter have greater influence on water productivity than c despite this fact the multiple correlation values r 0 92 r2 0 85 and adjusted r2 0 85 returned by the mlr indicate that the model explains 85 of the variability in the dependent variable using the environmental factors i d q c w l and s which means that the model is representative of the phenomenon of water productivity however there may be other environmental factors that influence the productivity of the sgas and that could be included in the model for example the slope of the land and the density of structural lineaments to improve the estimates 4 conclusions due to the exploratory difficulty of fractured aquifers such as the sgas the objective of the present work was to propose a method to assess aquifer productivity in this type of hydrogeological environment seeking to identify and map through a set of environmental factors the zones that may present more productive wells in this sense the environmental factors used the methodology employed to map these factors for most of the study area and the weights attributed to each of them were satisfactory since the fapi map is coherent enabling visualization of the areas of greatest aquifer productivity in addition through the mlr analysis it was possible to observe the hierarchical importance by weight of each factor used in the calculation of water productivity it was possible to conclude that the hierarchy of factors which before applying the analysis was w s f q l c d present the following order of importance w s f c q l d this indicates that the weight attributed to factor c could have been lower than the weights attributed to factors l and q since the latter presented a standardized β coefficient greater than the former indicating that specific capacity has less influence than expected on productivity despite this the fapi model and map can be considered representative as they explain 85 of the water productivity variability for the study area not existing previously the proposed methodology to evaluate water productivity and the fapi map can be considered innovative and important tools for urban and environmental planning as they can be used by water resource management bodies to make decisions about the best locations for drilling wells for public supply as well as which they can be used in urban zoning with the objective of assisting in the decision making for the creation of new districts mainly industrial or even in the definition of urban expansion zones in the study area in addition the method can be adapted to other regions that contain fractured aquifer hydrogeology as long as the researcher or manager responsible has knowledge of the influence of the direction of the lineaments in the area to be studied which can vary according to local geology credit authorship contribution statement giselly peterlini conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft

4209,due to the poor understanding of fractured aquifer systems the choice of the best locations for the installation of productive wells in these aquifers is a challenge for hydrogeology the present work aims to propose and apply a method to evaluate the water productivity of the serra geral aquifer system sgas in northern paraná environmental factors that influence the aquifer productivity were defined and weights were assigned ranging from 1 to 5 as well as ranges and classes that varied from 1 to 10 using data from wells and structural lineaments identified in the area maps of estimates were prepared using the ordinary kriging method the maps were then multiplied by the previously assigned weights and classes generating the water productivity map fapi multiple linear regression mlr was applied to validate the assigned weights and obtain the sgas water productivity equation the fapi map indicates that the majority of the study area 58 has low water productivity followed by medium productivity 27 7 the other classes represented low percentages in the area the mlr demonstrated that the weights assigned were mostly correct with the exception of the weight of the specific capacity factor which could be lower despite this the model generated was considered representative p 0 05 r2 0 85 it was also possible to suggest areas more favorable to the location of tubular wells in the study area finally the proposed method and the fapi map are considered innovative and important tools for urban and environmental planning aiming at better management of water resources keywords aquifer productivity methodological proposal hydrogeological modelling groundwater 1 introduction intensification in the use of water resources mainly surfaces caused by population and economic growth generates impacts not only on the quantity of water used but also on its quality leading to so called relative scarcity in addition as an alternative to the increase in demand for water consumption the use of groundwater has also been growing borges et al 2017 khosravi et al 2018 due to this fact concern regarding understanding the functioning of the different aquifer systems and their preservation has led to several studies mainly with regard to the aspects of water quality and vulnerability to contamination aiding in the development of methods that identify the weaknesses of aquifers the drastic method developed by aller et al 1987 is one of the most commonly used methods to evaluate aquifer vulnerability to contamination khosravi et al 2018 drastic is an index that evaluates the vulnerability to contamination in any hydrogeological scenario using the intrinsic physical characteristics of an area the advantage of using intrinsic vulnerability indices refers to the mapping of this information in a spatial domain lisboa et al 2016 the method is composed of a numerical ranking system using the factors water depth d recharge r aquifer a soil s topography t impact on the vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c assigning weights ranges and classes to each environmental factor to determine their relative importance to aquifer vulnerability aller et al 1987 in view of several current studies carried out using the drastic method and its adaptations as in the work of al adamat et al 2003 santos et al 2006 melo júnior 2008 kazakis and voudouris 2015 lisboa et al 2016 borges et al 2017 mfonka et al 2018 pacheco et al 2018 asfaw and mengistu 2020 and considering the efficiency of this method in the assessment of aquifer vulnerability the possibility of developing methods based on drastic is questioned to assess no longer the vulnerability but rather the aquifer productivity mainly in more complex hydrogeological environments such as fractured aquifers in these aquifers the primary porosity and permeability of the rock are extremely low causing water to be stored and circulated only between the fractures and structures present in the rocky basement rebouças 1978 athayde 2012 roques et al 2016 this characteristic of fractured aquifers makes the exploration of this type of system one of the greatest challenges of hydrogeology since the hydraulic properties are very variable resulting in extremely heterogeneous anisotropic and discontinuous aquifers which can cause difficulties losses and frustrations in drilling unproductive or even dry wells and lead to less efficient water resource management freitas 2000 douagui et al 2019 it is necessary therefore to map with better precision the areas with the greatest potential for the occurrence of groundwater integrating several environmental factors as well as the drastic method freitas 2000 it is possible to highlight some studies that assess water productivity using one or more environmental factors in fractured aquifers lattman and parizek 1964 evaluated the influence of the distance between wells and structural lineaments in an aquifer of carbonate rocks anaba onana et al 2017 in addition to studying the lineaments also evaluated the depth of the well and weathering type of rock and topography in a crystalline rock aquifer lee et al 2012 andualem and demeke 2019 and nigussie et al 2019 used these factors and the vegetation density of the drainage network and or soil of an area to map the water productivity of a fractured aquifer with a predominance of basalts assigning weights to the factors as a methodological proposal based on the drastic method the fractured aquifer productivity index fapi developed and presented in the current work consists of a model that aims to evaluate not the vulnerability but the water productivity in fractured aquifers in the fapi method the determining environmental factors were modified to identify which most contributed to the greater production of water in this type of hydrogeological environment in this sense the current study aims to create and apply the fapi method to evaluate the water productivity of a fractured aquifer system in a set of predominantly urban watersheds in londrina cambé and ibiporã pr to serve as an urban and environmental planning tool for the region assisting in the future location of wells and providing subsidies for the use and occupation of urban land 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of the study area the study area of the current work comprises the watersheds partly or wholly inserted in the urban perimeters of the municipalities of cambé londrina and ibiporã located between the coordinates 23 11 07 and 23 26 58 south latitude and 51 25 47 and 50 58 10 west longitude as seen in fig 1 the area was chosen because it contains a large number of deep tubular wells which are drilled mainly in more urbanized areas where the largest population and a high number of industries are concentrated the study area is located in the mesozoic compartment of the paraná sedimentary basin and its rocks belong to the são bento group represented by the serra geral formation composed of igneous rocks originating from a series of extensive jurassic cretaceous basalt flows these are basic effusive tholeitic rocks with massive vesicular aphanitic and gray to black basalts rebouças and fraga 1988 mineropar 2003 there is also the presence of sedimentary material such as siltstones and sandstones interspersed with successive lava flows celligoi 1993 mineropar 2001 the lava flows have lateral extension and vertical continuity that overlap with each lava flow having thicknesses ranging from 5 to 25 m fernandes et al 2010 when studying outcrops of the serra geral formation in the state of são paulo brazil verified a lateral extension of the layers of at least 30 km however the authors point out that due to the thickness observed in the area and the mechanisms of lava placement it is expected that the lateral extensions are very large 600 km or more as occurs in the basalts of the columbia river basalt group and other basaltic provinces there is also the presence of faults and or fractures called structural lineaments with predominantly ne sw and nw se directions in addition to the existence of an important group of lineaments with e w orientation zalán et al 1987 mineropar 2001 londrina 2010 these failures and fractures generated by tectonism as well as fractures caused by cooling of the magma allow the storage and circulation of groundwater in the rocks of this region constituting an important hydrogeological unit of the fractured type the sasg which due to rocky discontinuities presents strong heterogeneity and anisotropy rebouças and fraga 1988 subdivide the sasg into two units the upper one being the product of the weathering of the basalts limited by a surface of physical discontinuity which is characterized as a zone of relatively higher permeability the structure of the lava flows located below this discontinuity lower unit as the movement cooling and content of the lava gases occurred originated layers characterized by a vesicular or amygdaloidal top zone with the presence of horizontal diaclases which represents the preferred zone for circulation of water an intermediate zone which has vertical diaclases with vertical water circulation and a basal zone which presents microvesicles and glassy material rebouças and fraga 1988 rosa filho et al 2006 according to celligoi and brito 1999 in sasg the permeability depends on the spatial disposition of the vacuoles and presents better results when they are interconnected with fracture and fault structures which allows the water to percolate up to the diaclases of the lower portion of the lava flow which do not have very effective water circulation in this sense the serra geral formation due to its lithologic characteristics does not give to sasg an important primary porosity and permeabitily which may not allow significant storage of water volumes the complexity of lithologic and structural features through which water is circulated makes hydraulic conductivity very variable and even difficult to assess rosa filho et al 2006 athayde et al 2012 explained that due to the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the sasg cases were observed in which two tubular wells separated by a distance of 10 m presented different specific capacities according to data from the instituto das águas do paraná approximately 230 tubular wells exploit the sasg in the study area fig 2 in the areas of flat or smooth undulating relief red oxisols have developed which can be eutrophic or dystrophic these soils are clayey homogeneous deep porous or very porous ibge 2007 embrapa 2008 the regions of smooth wavy to wavy relief on the other hand contain eutropheric red nitosols which are strongly developed have a clayey homogeneous texture and little color difference between the horizons ibge 2007 iac 2012 in the most rugged relief areas are the regolitic eutrophic neosols which have a clayey texture are shallow and stony embrapa 2008 and close to the channel of the tibagi river lower areas and alluvial plains developed haplic gleysols which in general are formed by recent sediments have gray to black colors in the superficial horizon are shallow and have medium to high levels of organic carbon santos and zaroni 2019 2 2 fractured aquifer productivity index by reviewing the existing literature and evaluating geological and pedological factors that influence water productivity in the sgas carried out previously by the authors the factors that most contribute to water productivity in fractured aquifers formed by basaltic rocks were defined 2 2 1 flow structures f the aquifers that have the basalts as basement rock are formed by different lava flows consecutively occurred and that have a geostructure characterized by a degassing zone top of the layer where the gases present in the lava are trapped below already the consolidated plates forming vacuoles vesicles a horizontal disjunction zone upper portion of the lava layer formed by magmatic contraction or laminar lava flows generating horizontal diaclases a vertical disjunction zone central portion of the lava flow that has predominantly vertical diaclases resulting from the slow cooling of the lava and a vitreous zone the lower portion of the lava flow in which there is amorphous material which has horizontal diaclases as a consequence of rapid cooling when in contact with the basement freeze and cherry 1979 rebouças and fraga 1988 celligoi 1993 miller 1999 bertrand et al 2010 gastmans et al 2016 miller 1999 points out that the upper and lower portions of basaltic effusions generally present greater permeability due to the presence of horizontal vesicles and diaclases the center of the flow forms a dense zone of low permeability between these two more permeable zones greater water storage and flow in these aquifers occurs when these structures are interconnected vesicles horizontal and vertical fractures adyalkar and mani 1974 also state that the presence size and quantity of vesicles tend to increase porosity and aquifer permeability controlling their productivity fraser et al 2018 highlight that the vesicular cavities provide the flow path for the water together with the joints and flaws of the basalts previous studies carried out by peterlini et al 2020 in the same study area have shown that tubular wells that present in their geological profiles only vesicles or only fractures have a lower flow rate than wells that have both structures in addition the observed correlation between the presence of both structures and the flow presented an r 0 51 considered as a moderate correlation based on these studies that prove the moderate influence that horizontal and vertical fracture structures caused by tectonism pressure relief and lava cooling as well as vesicles exert on aquifer productivity this group of structures was defined as one of the factors to compose the method proposed in the present work thus to determine the number of structures in the study area the information on the geological profiles of each well provided by the instituto das águas do paraná which indicate the drilling intervals and local geological characteristics such as the presence of vesicles and basalt fractures were observed fig 3 shows an example of the geological profile of a tubular well in this sense for the study of the structures the sum of the thicknesses of the rock with vesicles and fractures was calculated di where i 1 2 n and subsequently considering the total depth of the well dt the percentage of structures present in the profile was calculated f using equation 1 1 f d i 100 dt in addition to the structures located inside the basalt flows according to fraga 1986 and fernandes et al 2010 the contact zones between flows also called agglomeratic breccias or intertrapean sandstones can form between two lava flows deposited at different times these zones are generally filled with sedimentary material sand silty clayey that was included in the lava from the overflow agglomeratic breccias occur when lava flows cover considerable sediment thickness in the intertrapean sandstones on the other hand the thickness of sediments may be smaller from a few centimeters to 20 m in addition to being very silicified which if chaotically mixed with the overlapping lava flow give rise to basaltic breccias srivastava et al 2016 who studied sediments between lava flows in the basaltic province of deccan india claimed that these sediments are also common in other volcanic provinces such as columbia river basalt usa karoo flood basalt south africa and north atlantic igneous province hartmann et al 2012 and reis et al 2014 in studies carried out in the serra geral formation brazil highlight that the intertrapean sandstones and volcanic breccias found in the regions between two basaltic lava flows because they are intensely silicified and have high clay content have very low porosity which does not make reservoirs very effective porosity in the case of breccias can be secondary and localized 2 2 2 lineament distance d there are several works that provide evidence on the influence that the distance from fractures caused by tectonism called structural lineaments has on the water productivity of wells that exploit fractured aquifer systems lattman and parizek 1964 celligoi and duarte 1997 braathen and gabrielsen 1998 mabee 1999 madrucci et al 2003 holland and witthüser 2011 peterlini 2017 according to these works the wells closest to structural lineaments can present greater productivity since the greater the proximity of the fractures the greater the fracture of the rocks and thus they become more favorable to the infiltration circulation and storage of groundwater to consider the influence that the structural lineaments have on the productivity of the wells the structural lineaments existing in the study area were identified through the observation of rectilinear features of the relief utilizing the shaded relief technique in srtm images used by peterlini 2017 statistical studies carried out by the author on the sgas in the region of londrina found that the structural lineaments have a greater influence on the productivity of wells especially at distances up to 400 m peterlini 2017 2 2 3 discharge q according to cprm 1998 the discharge q is a measure of the volume of water that leaves the well in a given period and its unit is presented in cubic meters per hour m3 h the discharge of a tubular well is determined by means of pumping tests that is water is pumped while the evolution of the lowering water in the well is recorded cprm 1998 feitosa and manoel filho 2000 the discharge of the wells was determined as an important factor for the evaluation of the water productivity of the aquifer as this constitutes an indicator of the amount of water that can and is already being extracted at that point according to studies developed by celligoi and duarte 1997 viana and celligoi 2002 and peterlini 2017 it was observed that the majority of the wells located in the region of londrina have discharges less than 10 m3 h while exceptional discharges 50 m3 h were observed in a low number of wells 2 2 4 specific capacity c the specific capacity of a well can be defined as the ratio between the discharge that is pumped and the drawdown caused in the water level given in m3 h m neves et al 2004 according to neves 2005 and celligoi 1993 specific capacity can be considered the parameter that best represents the productivity of tubular wells in this sense all the specific capacity values for the wells present in the study area were calculated research developed by celligoi 1993 and peterlini 2017 demonstrates that the specific capacity of wells located in londrina presents an exponential distribution of values which means that a greater number of wells have a lower specific capacity value generally 1 m3 h m and a low number of wells have specific capacities 10 m3 h m 2 2 5 well depth w the well depth is an important factor to assist in the study of water productivity as it may be correlated to well discharge studies carried out by freitas et al 2001 neves 2005 abreu et al 2016 peterlini 2017 and douagui et al 2019 demonstrate the existence of a correlation between these hydrodynamic parameters as the authors observed a reduction in discharge with the increase in the depth of the well the authors concluded that this can be explained by the lithostatic pressure that overlying rocks exert causing a reduction in the number of fractures at greater depth as well as reducing the opening of existing fractures which causes a decrease in the permeability of the rocks 2 2 6 lineament direction l the direction of rock fractures lineaments is characterized as a relevant factor in the evaluation of aquifer productivity since according to neves et al 2002 many works have been developed that aim to link the production of wells with their position in relation to the structural lineaments the author highlights some studies in addition to her own that correlate not only the distance of the lineament versus water productivity but also the direction of these lineaments providing evidence of their influence assatse et al 2015 also observed a correlation between the direction of the lineaments and the high productivity of the wells in the yaoundé region cameroon corgne et al 2010 note that certain specific orientations that result from geological deformation are highly correlated with groundwater productivity ranganai and ebinger 2008 observed that the directions of the lineaments present in a fractured aquifer in south central zimbabwe are related to the water productivity of wells due to these structures being generated mainly by tectonic efforts such as compression and shear stress tectonism can generate greater openness in fractures and greater fracture in rocks conditioning greater storage and water flow in these places in addition celligoi and duarte 1997 in their research developed in wells that exploit the sgas in the region of londrina describe the presence of 4 families of predominant seams in the area n s n45 w n50 e and n83 e the latter considered as having an ew direction among these directions by means of production data on the wells discharge and specific capacity the author shows that the wells located close to the structural lineaments with an ew direction present higher discharges and specific capacities followed by the ne and nw directions respectively this is because according to freeze and cherry 1979 the direction of highest permeability in volcanic rocks aquifers is generally parallel to the lava flows 2 2 7 soil thickness s depending on the climate and weathering to be formed the soil is a relevant factor for water productivity in humid climates where chemical weathering predominates soils are generally deeper than those formed in dry climate regions where physical weathering is more active ranganai and ebinger 2008 state that thicker regoliths generally occur over areas of intense rock fracturing costa and silva 2000 ranganai and ebinger 2008 point out that a greater thickness of soil allows greater capture of precipitated water less losses by runoff and water evaporation anaba onana 2017 highlight a range of soil thickness from 5 to 35 m in which wells that exploit fractured aquifers have higher water productivity in cameroon however studies carried out by peterlini et al 2020 for the same area studied here indicate that a smaller soil thickness is related to a greater flow from wells in the region this fact can occur because in soils that present a great thickness the time in which the water takes to percolate and reach the fractures of the rocks is also greater making the aquifer recharge to happen more slowly in addition the precipitated water may be retained in the most superficial layers of the soil making it difficult to recharge the fractures deyassa et al 2014 when studying a fractured aquifer of crystalline rock in ethiopia observed that the wells located in the northern region of the studied area which had less soil thickness than the southern and western regions had higher yields the authors also point out that low flow values were observed in the western region which had the highest soil thickness of all the studied regions despite the fact that it presents a greater amount of rainfall and that this is due to the high storage capacity of the thick regolith cover on the rock in order to obtain soil thickness data the geological profiles of the wells provided by the instituto das águas do paraná were analyzed 2 2 8 calculation of fapi based on the knowledge presented above weights were assigned to environmental factors highlighted in table 1 the weights range from 1 to 5 where the greater the influence and importance of the factor the greater its weight after identifying the factors and assigning the weights the ranges of values for each factor and the ratings were defined ranging from 1 to 10 also according to their importance for the flow structures factor f it was considered that the greater the number of structures the greater the water productivity therefore the ranges and ratings shown in table 2 were established considering the greatest influence of distance of the structural lineaments on the wells presented in item 3 2 and knowing that the shorter the well versus lineament distance the greater the water productivity the ranges and ratings for factor d are presented in table 3 regarding the discharge factor q as this is a direct indicator of water production for determining the ranges and ratings it was considered that the higher the discharge the greater the aquifer productivity in the location the ranges of values and ratings were defined as shown in table 4 regarding the specific capacity factor c discharge can be considered a direct indicator of productivity taking this fact into account it was considered that the greater the specific capacity the greater the productivity the established range and rating values are shown in table 5 for the well depth factor w the ranges and ratings of values table 6 were established considering that the greater the depth of the well the lower its water productivity the results of water productivity versus the direction of the structural lineaments found by celligoi 1993 were used to determine the ranges and ratings for the lineament direction factor d in the model in this sense the azimuths of the lineaments were extracted to determine the angular range for each observed direction these values are shown in table 7 finally to determine the ranges and ratings of the soil thickness factor presented in table 8 it was considered that the lesser the thickness the greater its contribution to aquifer productivity from the values of weights ranges and ratings presented the fapi was calculated using equation 3 considering different combinations of values the productivity index can vary from 45 to 190 from the calculated fapi value water productivity can be divided according to table 9 for the classification of the productivity map fapi fw fr dw dr qw qr cw cr ww wr lw lr sw sr 3 where fapi fractured

many wells as possible each factor had a different number of wells since in many cases the same wells that had discharge data might not have data on structures soil thickness or another factor as the data values of the wells are points it was necessary to use a geostatistical method to estimate the values of the factors presented for the study area using the ordinary kriging method unidirectional semivariograms with 90 tolerance were modeled for factors i q c w l and s for the generation of grids through the grids contour maps were generated and the estimated values were then separated according to the intervals of the previously established ranges for the generation of the factor d map structural lineaments were identified and the buffer tool was applied to establish distance ranges in a gis environment vectorization was performed for later generation of raster products from then on a reclassification was carried out assigning the values of the ratings to the bands ir dr qr cr wr lr sr finally using the raster calculator the sum of the class maps was multiplied by the respective weights iw dw qw cw ww lw sw applying equation 3 the fapi map for the region under study was generated from this and the steps of the fapi map generation process are shown in the flowchart of fig 4 2 4 validation of the water productivity model the generation of a water productivity map for the sgas in the municipalities of londrina cambé and ibiporã is a model that indicates the areas that could present greater groundwater production and which consequently are more favorable to the location of tubular wells in the studied area as with any model that seeks to explain an environmental phenomenon it is necessary to carry out a validation step in this sense for the validation of the generated model multiple linear regression mlr analysis was applied to verify that the weights attributed to the factors are correct as well as to obtain the mathematical equation that represents the water productivity of the sgas in the area like the simple linear regression slr the mlr seeks to express the existing relationships between known magnitudes and magnitudes to be determined through mathematical equations this equation is obtained by adjusting a curve to the observed data from which the relationship between different variables can be graphically or analytically represented piana et al 2009 hair et al 2009 however in the slr the existing relationship is obtained by analyzing only two variables one dependent and the other independent while the mlr is more complete as it involves the study of the correlation of more than one independent variable for the prediction of the dependent variable hair et al 2009 in this sense the model generated by the mlr is represented by equation 4 y β0 β1 x1 β2 x2 βp xp e 4 in which y corresponds to the predicted value of the dependent variable βi i 0 1 2 p are the regression coefficients to be estimated xi i 0 1 2 p are the values of the independent variables and e is a random error component since these errors must be independent and follow a normal distribution with zero mean and unknown variance as the data in the present study came from two different sources wells and structural lineaments and considering that the number of samples was different for each factor 222 wells were selected to be used in the validation process using maps to estimate the factors generated by the kriging and fapi map information on i d q c w l s independent variables and water productivity dependent variable were collected for each well and subsequently the mlr was performed 3 results and discussion 3 1 zoning of water productivity after generating the maps for estimating and reclassifying the ranges according to the ratings equation 3 presented above was applied assigning the weights to the factors the result was the generation of a map that indicates the areas of greatest water productivity for the study area as shown in fig 5 as seen in the map the fapi values for the study area did not vary from 45 to 190 but from 53 to 168 the very low productivity zones represent approximately 8 1 of the estimated area while the low productivity zones were observed in the majority of the area representing approximately 58 medium productivity was observed as the second largest class corresponding to 27 7 of the area and finally high and very high productivity zones were equivalent to 5 9 and 0 3 respectively it is possible to observe that the fapi map presents several rectilinear zones that have medium to very high productivity these zones became more evident due to the presence of structural lineaments and the weight attributed to factor d making these zones the areas of greatest productivity observed on the map in addition it is important to highlight that although small the zones classified as very productive were observed close to the lineaments in the ew direction making these areas the most favorable to the location of deep tubular wells which corroborates the results obtained by celligoi 1993 who also point out that the areas close to the lineaments in this direction combined with regular adjacent vegetation are the most appropriate for the location and obtention of more productive wells the zones of medium water productivity present greater spreading which start from the surroundings of one lineament to another indicating that the greater the density and proximity between lineaments of an area the greater the coverage of the zone of medium productivity favoring the drilling of wells with higher discharges and specific capacities in these locations in this sense the largest areas of medium productivity are located in the n nw and se of the area the zones of very low productivity can be observed more in the central region of the area by analyzing the contour maps for each factor it can be seen that this region has in most of the factors used the worst factors for aquifer favorability leading to the result obtained on the fapi map on the other hand there is a great density of wells drilled in this area mainly because it is located in the central region of the city of londrina where many residential condominiums are located whose source of water is the sgas this fact coupled with the possibility of new drilling in this area could contribute to a reduction in the water level of the aquifer further aggravating the low productivity scenario in the central region with the possibility of influencing the discharge of water into the drainage network 3 2 multiple linear regression to verify that the weights attributed to the environmental factors are correct and to validate the water productivity model mlr was applied to the data the results of the analysis of variance anova are presented in table 10 the total variability present in the anova can be divided into two parts one part due to the regression and the other due to the random variation measured through the residuals if there is regression it is expected that the majority of the variability portion pertains to the regression and less is due to the residuals this can be seen through the value of sq which demonstrates that the portion belonging to the regression 98 387 28 is greater than the portion of the residual 17 345 57 showing that there is regression and that the environmental factors chosen may have some relationship with water productivity which enables prediction through the value of the f test of global significance p 1 58 10 84 it can be seen that at least one variable present in the model is related to water productivity since the p 0 05 value indicates that there is statistical significance table 11 presents the results of significance for each environmental factor in the model to verify which are related to water productivity in addition to presenting the β coefficients enabling evaluation of whether the assigned weights are correct as seen from the p values all environmental factors presented statistical significance as the values were much lower than 0 05 indicating that there is a relationship between each factor used and water productivity in this sense replacing the values of the coefficients and the factors in equation 4 the mathematical equation that can estimate the water productivity wp of the sgas in a given location in the studied area is presented by equation 5 wp 3 97 2 09i 4 29d 3 31q 4 33c 0 72 w 2 44l 1 12s 5 when comparing the present equation with equation 3 used to calculate the fapi great similarity can be observed in the values of the weights with the values of the coefficients however the values of standardized coefficients indicate that factor c could have been given less weight than factors l and q as the latter have greater influence on water productivity than c despite this fact the multiple correlation values r 0 92 r2 0 85 and adjusted r2 0 85 returned by the mlr indicate that the model explains 85 of the variability in the dependent variable using the environmental factors i d q c w l and s which means that the model is representative of the phenomenon of water productivity however there may be other environmental factors that influence the productivity of the sgas and that could be included in the model for example the slope of the land and the density of structural lineaments to improve the estimates 4 conclusions due to the exploratory difficulty of fractured aquifers such as the sgas the objective of the present work was to propose a method to assess aquifer productivity in this type of hydrogeological environment seeking to identify and map through a set of environmental factors the zones that may present more productive wells in this sense the environmental factors used the methodology employed to map these factors for most of the study area and the weights attributed to each of them were satisfactory since the fapi map is coherent enabling visualization of the areas of greatest aquifer productivity in addition through the mlr analysis it was possible to observe the hierarchical importance by weight of each factor used in the calculation of water productivity it was possible to conclude that the hierarchy of factors which before applying the analysis was w s f q l c d present the following order of importance w s f c q l d this indicates that the weight attributed to factor c could have been lower than the weights attributed to factors l and q since the latter presented a standardized β coefficient greater than the former indicating that specific capacity has less influence than expected on productivity despite this the fapi model and map can be considered representative as they explain 85 of the water productivity variability for the study area not existing previously the proposed methodology to evaluate water productivity and the fapi map can be considered innovative and important tools for urban and environmental planning as they can be used by water resource management bodies to make decisions about the best locations for drilling wells for public supply as well as which they can be used in urban zoning with the objective of assisting in the decision making for the creation of new districts mainly industrial or even in the definition of urban expansion zones in the study area in addition the method can be adapted to other regions that contain fractured aquifer hydrogeology as long as the researcher or manager responsible has knowledge of the influence of the direction of the lineaments in the area to be studied which can vary according to local geology credit authorship contribution statement giselly peterlini conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft
