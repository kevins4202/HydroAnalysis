4675,this study presents a new concept that integrates the index overlay method and a physical based numerical model for predicting groundwater sustainability under various climate conditions and anthropogenic activities the index overlay drastic method was modified with an analytical hierarchy process theory and employed to create groundwater vulnerability maps for the pingtung plain groundwater basin in southern taiwan the physical based modflow model was used for predicting the dynamics of a basin scale groundwater system solutions and calibrated hydrogeological parameters in the modflow model provide feedback to the factors in the modified drastic method which enables predicting groundwater vulnerability in this study different climate conditions were considered in the numerical model to obtain the changes in depth of water and net recharge for predicting future groundwater vulnerability and for evaluating the current state of the sustainability indicators results show that the depth of water and net recharge obtained from the groundwater model improve the accuracy of the groundwater vulnerability prediction the variations of future climate conditions have less influence on the variations of groundwater vulnerability because of the dense river network that controls the shallow groundwater levels in the pingtung plain groundwater basin therefore the influence of climate conditions on the risk of groundwater contamination is also relatively low based on the analysis of the sustainability indicators we found that the groundwater resource system in the pingtung plain groundwater basin is in a critical condition of high vulnerability keywords index overlay method drastic numerical model modflow groundwater vulnerability groundwater sustainability 1 introduction groundwater gw is a vital supplement for domestic use and essential for agriculture industry and related ecosystems in semi arid regions where surface water is scarce aller et al 1987 however population growth agricultural activities urbanization and climate change are threatening the groundwater quantity and quality in many groundwater basins rahman 2008 the effective management and development of policies are of great importance for ensuring the sustainable use of groundwater over the past few decades the integration of various tools or methods has been proposed to protect and manage groundwater deterioration and degradation chang et al 2017 jang et al 2016 lin et al 2017 whereby providing scientifically plausible instruction for policymakers and governors groundwater vulnerability gv is an effective technique for practical groundwater pollution prevention and remediation tasks jang et al 2017 existing methods for assessing groundwater vulnerability can be classified into three categories nobre et al 2007 1 index and overlay methods 2 process based methods and 3 statistical methods one of the popular index overlay methods for quantifying groundwater vulnerability is the drastic method which was initially developed by the us epa for ease of use minimal data requirements and a clear interpretation of gv aller et al 1987 furthermore associated with gis tools the drastic model can be applied for large scale regions with low application costs however it has some limitations because the ratings and weights assigned in the model depend on the site specific conditions and judgment of experts busico et al 2020 also in recent years many studies have modified the drastic method by adding parameters or ignoring the existing parameters according to site specific settings huan et al 2012 kazakis and voudouris 2015 sadat noori and ebrahimi 2016 sener et al 2009 the conventional drastic model could be calibrated and verified by using the analytic hierarchy process ahp geo statistics artificial neural networks ann or artificial intelligence ai to optimize the weights and to fit the observations baghapour et al 2016 dixon 2005 goudarzi et al 2017 saida et al 2017 previous studies proved that the drastic model coupled with ahp could produce high accuracy and reliable gv maps which can be validated by field measurements of pollutants neshat et al 2014 sener and davraz 2012 thirumalaivasan et al 2003 in addition land use is also one of the critical components for improving the reliability of gv because of its influence directly on gv the integration of land use factors and the conventional drastic model was proposed by many researchers to predict the impacts of human activities on groundwater quality e g huang et al 2009 li and merchant 2013 lima et al 2011 previous studies have conducted investigations of the gv approach which focused on the prediction of gv under the impact of climate change climate change can potentially affect the variation of gv which is heavily dependent on factors such as depth to water dtw net recharge or land use conditions therefore focusing on gv that may be affected by both climate and land use changes is an excellent approach because it provides governments with valuable information on groundwater resources management several studies have quantified gv under different scenarios of climate and land use for example huang et al 2009 predicted future gv under a combination of climate change scenarios and urbanization they concluded that the whole hunan province faces a high risk of groundwater pollution in the future li and merchant 2013 determined how and where changes in depth to water net recharge and land use caused by different scenarios of climate change affected gv the results showed that the north and northwest regions of eastern north dakota would continuously have high gv under different scenarios of climate conditions nevertheless it can be seen that in these studies groundwater recharge and dtw were estimated based on the empirical equations or hydrological methods without considering the geological or hydrogeological condition and other parameters as well as lack of calibration and validation physical based numerical models play an essential role in the planning and management of gw resources and in forecasting the effects of management measures the models have been used as assessment tools for evaluating recharge discharge and aquifer storage processes and as prediction tools for forecasting future conditions or impacts of human activities zhou 2009 with the rapid improvement of computing power and the widespread use of geographic information system gis significant progress has been made in the use of 3d groundwater flow models such as modflow modflow is a us geological survey modular finite difference flow model with a flexible modular structure complete coverage of hydrogeological processes and is available in the public domain although applications of the groundwater flow model modflow for various purposes have been conducted in many studies e g singh 2013 mahmoudpour et al 2016 mi et al 2016 huang and chiu 2018 lin et al 2017 li et al 2016 su et al 2020 investigations on the combination of a physical based model and an index overlay method to quantify the variation of groundwater vulnerability have not yet been reported physically meaningful parameters such as the water pumped from the aquifers or the precipitation influenced by climate change may interact with other parameters in the drastic method users adjust the drastic settings and weightings to reflect changes in hydrogeological conditions however the characteristics of the drastic parameters cannot solely rely on changing the weightings without considering the physical mechanisms a potential solution to such a situation is to use a physical based model to quantify changes in hydrogeological conditions based on the fixed parameters and weightings the variation of vulnerability in the drastic method can then be obtained by applying the variations of parameters obtained from a physical model moreover gv is one of the key components to evaluate the degree of gw sustainability which supports the policymakers in establishing comprehensive protection and quality conservation policies for highly vulnerable areas gv informs the public about the potential of gw contamination and the necessary solutions for management and protection the gv indicator is a practical economic and social tool for protecting the gw system through land use planning vrba and lipponen 2007 in addition to reach the goal of sustainable and reasonable gw utilization and management it is necessary to develop the policies and to implement effective groundwater management options in practice that need managerially important information on the quality and quantity of groundwater systems the relevant information can be quantified through the indicators which act as an essential assessment tool for policymakers planners and the public vrba and lipponen 2007 the sustainability indicators sis of gw management provide information about the current status and trends in groundwater systems they also help analyze the impacts of anthropogenic activities and the extent of natural processes on the groundwater system and promote the awareness of the public in the utilization and management of gw sustainably vrba and lipponen 2007 however they also have drawbacks because of their dependency on social economic development geographical conditions and hydrogeological structures russo et al 2014 due to distinct study areas the characteristics of an aquifer system will vary dramatically which means that the fundamental analysis of each aquifer system is unique juwana et al 2012 vrba and lipponen 2007 developed a meaningful set of 10 indicators from more than one hundred conceptual water related indices as guiding principles these indicators have been employed to assess groundwater sustainability in several countries at the national level hirata et al 2007 lavapuro et al 2008 perez et al 2015 none of them considered a physical based numerical model as a tool for providing information on aquifer characteristics to calculate the sustainability indicators water balance the dynamics of groundwater levels or estimation of net recharge would be extracted from the calibrated gw flow model to support the assessment of gw sustainability this paper is a first attempt to integrate a physical based groundwater flow model and proposed sustainability indicators for delineating a complete representation of groundwater system sustainability in this study we propose a concept of integrated procedures that is capable of quantifying groundwater vulnerability changes to site specific problems under changing climate conditions while evaluating the sustainability of groundwater resources in the pingtung plain groundwater basin in southern taiwan generally the modflow model was used for simulating the physical responses of the groundwater system the aquifer parameters calibrated in the numerical model provide feedback for the key parameters such as the depth of water net recharge and hydraulic conductivity used in the drastic method the drastic method incorporated with land use and ahp theory was then employed to quantify the groundwater vulnerability which was validated by the field data from nitrate measurements this integration of the modflow and drastic system acts as an assessment process to calculate the vulnerability changes induced by climate conditions different scenarios of climate conditions are applied to the numerical model to obtain changes in water level and net recharge in the aquifer systems additionally the sustainability of groundwater resources in the study area has been evaluated based on the water budget from the modflow model and the results of gv in the current year of 2017 the results of this study are expected to provide useful information about the status of the groundwater resources system that supports policymakers in planning and adopting strategies of sustainable groundwater management 2 materials and methods 2 1 the conceptual framework the objective of this study is to propose a new concept that integrates a physical based numerical model with an index overlay method and sustainability indicators to quantify changes in groundwater vulnerability affected by climate conditions as well as to assess the gw resource sustainability to integrate the index overly method with the physical based model the parameters in the index overlay method interact with the parameters and or site specific conditions in the calibrated physical based model the validated gw vulnerability acts as an indicator of gw resource sustainability in combination with the selected sustainability indicators that are calculated based on the numerical gw flow model in this study the aquifer system located in the pingtung plain was used to illustrate the proposed concept as shown in fig 1 the selected index overlay method is the modified ahp drastic method and the widely used modflow model was employed as the physical based numerical flow model the sis were proposed by vrba and lipponen 2007 for illustration purposes the methods and models used for the proposed concept are not limited to those shown in this study it is assumed that field data and observations are available for a selected groundwater basin the procedures for evaluating the variations of vulnerability and gw resource sustainability are based on the following two main procedures and the associated steps see also fig 1 1 quantifying the variation of gw vulnerability 1 conduct an initial modflow simulation including calibration and verification of parameters for the selected groundwater basin usually the hydraulic head generated by the model solutions and the aquifer properties for the first layer unconfined aquifer are the critical parameters for the modified ahp drastic method 2 calculate relevant drastic parameters based on the head solution and the associated hydrogeological conditions obtained from the calibrated modflow model the depth of groundwater in drastic can be obtained by calculating the differences between groundwater levels and ground surface elevations on a cell by cell basis the cell by cell net recharge rates and hydraulic conductivity are the same as those in the calibrated modflow model for the aquifer media soil media the impact of the vadose zone and land use the drastic method uses depth averaged values so the aquifer properties derived from the model need to be averaged cell by cell along the vertical direction in this step we have integrated the physical based modflow with the drastic method 3 for different scenarios of climate conditions for precipitation rerun the modflow model based on the stress changes net recharge involved in these scenarios then re calculate the drastic parameters according to the new results from modflow one can obtain the groundwater vulnerability corresponding to the stress changes the effect of stress changes on groundwater vulnerability is quantified through detailed spatial distribution 2 assessing the gw sustainability 1 calculate sis based on the gw vulnerability obtained from step 1 for the year 2017 the other selected sis can be calculated from the components of the flow budget such as inflow outflow net recharge seepage and gw extraction from the calibrated modflow model for the current year s simulation here we have assessed gw sustainability by the combination of the numerical model index overlay method and sis 2 accordingly the information or predictions of the critical factors that affect gw sustainability will be taken into consideration such as social economic development policy and governance gw management and utilization environmental conservation etc these factors influence or interact directly with the variation of the gw vulnerability as well as with the flow system at this stage the physical based gw flow model should be conceptualized and re stimulated based on the updated information i e gv will be quantified again based on the new calibrated model these results from the gw vulnerability and numerical model respond to gw sustainability the process repeats when the components in this framework change 2 2 study area the pingtung groundwater basin is located in southern taiwan which is one of nine groundwater sub regions in taiwan from north to south see fig 2 three river catchments extend across the plain the kaoping tungkang and linpien catchments this elongated plain covers an area of 1210 km2 22 km wide in the east west direction and 55 km in the north south direction the topography of the pingtung plain ranges from 10 m above sea level in coastal areas to 110 m above sea level in the central mountain range according to the central weather bureau the long term average precipitation in the area ranges from 1928 to 3827 mm with an average of 2470 mm the rainfall season occurs from may to september and the dry season occurs from october to april the ratio of rain in the dry seasons and the wet season is 1 9 hsu et al 2007 the unconsolidated sediments underlying the plain are of late quaternary age which comprises the principal aquifer in the plain ting et al 1998 investigation of subsurface hydrogeology to a depth of approximately 250 m covers eight overlapping sequences including four marine sequences and four non marine sequences in the distal fan cgs 2002 the sequence of the aquifer system illustrated in fig 3 is referred to as aquifer 1 f1 aquitard 1 t1 aquifer 2 f2 aquitard 2 t2 aquifer 3 1 f3 1 aquitard 3 t3 and aquifer 3 2 f3 2 in the vertical direction huang and chiu 2018 in general the groundwater system in the plain is driven mainly from direct precipitation and partly from local influence as inferred from the river seepage ting et al 1998 the permeability of the soil dominates the recharge pattern hsieh et al 2010 the proximal fan which is composed primarily of gravel and sand in the eastern sector of the study area has high infiltration and percolation of rainfall and river flow ting et al 1998 this leads to a higher groundwater head than the left side of the plain that comprises mainly fine sediments and clay hsieh et al 2010 also groundwater resources in the pingtung plain are controlled by the distribution of precipitation hsu et al 2007 rainfall infiltrates directly to underlying aquifers through the valleys in the northern and eastern parts and foothills in the western part of the plain additionally the dense river network of the pingtung plain is one of the main factors controlling the groundwater recharge river seepage is a significant source of replenishment for groundwater resources the pingtung plain is the primary region for agricultural development in taiwan surface water provides only 20 of total water demand and consequently the plain relies heavily on groundwater the groundwater is used to supply agriculture aquaculture industry and domestic uses hsu et al 2007 groundwater demand for farmland fishponds and households is approximately 60 and 54 respectively over the last few decades taiwan dgbsas 2005 taiwan wra 2012 which causes land subsidence and seawater intrusion in the study area ting et al 1998 although the government has monitored and regulated the gw exploitation the total amount of pumping is still unknown therefore the sustainable utilization of surface and groundwater resources has become an essential mission to agricultural water use over the past decade in addition agricultural activities in the pingtung plain can lead to the deterioration of the gw quality by using chemicals and fertilizers such as nitrate for improving the crops recently gw nitrate contamination has been a major concern of sustainable gw management in taiwan agriculture engineering research center 2009 also nitrate is one of the effective indicators to reflect the gw quality ouedraogo et al 2016 elevated nitrate concentration can threaten human health and the environment based on long term gw quality monitoring the gv map has been validated by nitrate concentration data published by agriculture engineering research center 2009 2 3 groundwater flow model the modflow model is a modular three dimensional finite difference numerical flow model developed by the us geological survey usgs to solve the three dimensional partial differential equation for groundwater flow through a porous medium mcdonald and harbaugh 1984 implementation details from modflow are provided by harbaugh et al 2000 and mcdonald and harbaugh 1984 in this study the gw flow model was simulated using modflow 2000 under the groundwater modeling system gms user interface model calibration which is used to estimate model parameters based on steady state and transient groundwater conditions is undertaken using the parameter estimation package pest doherty 2010 pest is an automatic parameter estimation and optimization package and is one of the most popular systems offering model independent optimization routines doherty and johnston 2003 it adopts a gradient search algorithm gauss marquardt levenberg method for instance to minimize an objective function based on the sum of squared weighted residuals i e the discrepancy between the computed head and observed head it also determines the optimal parameter vector b that minimizes a single weighted least squares objective function ф of the form 1 φ i 1 m ω i h i h i b 2 j 1 n ω j k j k j b 2 where b is a vector containing the values of the parameters to be estimated m is the number of observations n is the number of prior information values h i is the ith observed head h i b is the ith simulated head corresponding to the ith observation k j is the jth prior estimate k j b is the jth simulated head ω i is the weight for the observation i ω j is the weight for prior estimate j the performance of model calibration is evaluated by using the root mean square error rmse hill and tiedeman 2007 2 r m s e 1 n w s p t 1 s p i 1 n w h i t s i m h i t o b s 2 0 5 where nw presents the number of wells sp denotes the simulated period hsim and hobs are the computed and observed hydraulic heads respectively t is the time of the model simulation 2 4 modified ahp drastic model the conventional drastic model which was developed by aller et al 1987 assesses the relative potential for groundwater contamination the model uses seven parameters based on the hydrogeologic characteristics to evaluate gv namely depth of water d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography t the impact of the vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c the ratings and weights of the drastic parameters are classified into the ranges or zones on a scale of 1 to 10 and 1 to 5 respectively which represents the contribution of each parameter to aquifer vulnerability an additional land use factor is integrated to be a modified drastic for improving the quality of groundwater vulnerability mapping which has been conducted in many previous studies panagopoulos et al 2006 sadat noori and ebrahimi 2016 secunda et al 1998 the vulnerability index vi can be expressed as follows 3 dvi d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w l r l w where d r a s t i c represent the seven parameters and l denotes land use factor r is the rating and w is the weight assigned to each parameter analytical hierarchy process theory was also employed in the modified ahp drastic approach to adjust the weights and ratings ahp theory is a multi criteria evaluation method developed by saaty 1980 that creates a series of multiple pair wise comparisons based on a fundamental scale of nine levels a comparison is performed using a scale of 1 to 9 from less importance to extremely high influence to quantify the rating and weighting of each criterion also the experience and knowledge of experts were taken into consideration to quantify the effect of the parameters on the decision making process dweiri and oqla 2006 ho 2008 there are four different steps to implement the ahp calculations first a comparison matrix is conducted using the eigenvector and eigenvalue the next step involves the calculation of the consistency index and consistency ratio cr the cr analysis determines if the judgments were consistent relative to large samples of purely random assessments if the cr is over 0 1 the judgment made while creating a pair wise comparison matrix has a serious inconsistency and needs to be modified so as to remove the inconsistency according to vu et al 2019 the results of gv mapping from the modified ahp drastic model showed more reliability than the conventional drastic and modified drastic approaches for the study area that was validated by field measurements of nitrate concentration therefore this model is selected to incorporate the physical based numerical model also the definition of gw vulnerability and gw contamination risk has been discussed in detail by vu et al 2019 gw contamination risk is defined as the combination of gw vulnerability probability of contaminant occurrence and the amount of gw contamination in this study we only focus on the prediction of gv variation under the change of climate conditions the approach of the vulnerability mapping and validation in the study follows the concept implemented in the investigation of assaf and saadeh 2009 and stigter et al 2006 2 5 the sustainability indicators according to gordon 2011 the definition of gw sustainability is the conservation and protection of gw resources to maintain a natural balance for social economic ecosystems future environment and human demand meanwhile gw sustainability indicators sis are the measurable parameters that describe relevant information on the status and trends of gw systems in a readily understandable way gordon 2011 steinman 2007 unesco has taken up the development of groundwater indicators under the sixth phase of the international hydrological programme ihp the indicators proposed in this report were used to assess the status and the trends in gw characteristics the influence of the exploitation and the sustainability of groundwater systems and to provide guidelines for resource management in addition hosseini et al 2019 suggested that the quantitative indicators can be applicable 1 to analyze the spatial temporal impacts of human activities on the gw system 2 to improve gw management capability of the policymakers and planners 3 compare the local management strategies for gw resources in different regions aquifers and 4 to create an awareness of public participation in gw resources planning and strategy based on indicator characteristics and data availability six indicators are used to evaluate gw sustainability in the pingtung plain a renewable gw resources per capita gwi1 m3 cap it expresses the total annual amount of renewable gw resources m3 per year per capita at the national or regional level the objective of this indicator is to estimate how much gw is theoretically available for each inhabitant per year and is defined as 4 gw i 1 r s b f i f o f a r p where r is net recharge generated from precipitation m3 s is the amount of gw seepage from the infiltration of surface water m3 bf is the base flow or gw discharge to rivers m3 if is gw inflow volume that enters an aquifer system naturally m3 of is gw outflow volume that leaves an aquifer system m3 ar is an artificial recharge supplied by using water wells spreading on the surface or by changing natural conditions to increase infiltration m3 and p is the population living in the study area all information on these components required to calculate the indicator gwi1 is collected from the calibrated gw flow model of the study area the population size of each aquifer is also obtained from the department of household registration website b ratio of total gw abstraction to recharge gwi2 this indicator shows the availability of water resources ground and surface water with regard to the current gw abstraction the indicator shows whether gw is used in a sustainable way or if there is any indication of over exploitation when the abstraction is less than recharge the use of gw can be considered viable the ratio is defined as 5 g w i 2 t o t a l g w a b s t r a c t i o n g w r e c h a r g e 100 where the primary gw recharge comprises precipitation infiltration from surface water bodies irrigation losses and seepage from urban water supply distribution and wastewater collection systems total gw abstraction denotes a total amount of water extracted from a given aquifer by means of wells boreholes springs and other ways for public water supply vrba and lipponen 2007 in this study the gw recharge is calculated based on the water balance equations bisson and lehr 2004 and calibrated in the gw flow model data on gw abstraction is generally unknown but information on gw rights representing the legal gw withdrawal is employed to estimate the regional utilization of gw resources it is adjusted during the process of gw flow calibration c the ratio of total gw abstraction to exploitable gw resources gwi3 it shows how much water has been extracted for the renewable gw resources and demonstrates the availability in the currently practiced abstractions 6 g w i 3 t o t a l g w a b s t r a c t i o n e x p l o i t a b l e g w r e s o u r c e s 100 where the total gw abstraction is calculated as described above the exploitable groundwater resources refer to the withdrawal of water from a given aquifer annually under the constraint of social economic technological factors and environmental conditions vrba and lipponen 2007 it should be the same amount of renewable gw resources sophocleous 2000 d gw vulnerability gwi4 this indicator specifies how much the physical environment protects the gw basin or the gw containing formation from pollution also it plays a role in increasing the awareness of public participation in gw protection as well as supporting the gw protection policy defined as 7 g w i 4 t o t a l a r e a o f h i g h v u l n e r a b i l i t y t o c o n t a m i n a n t t o t a l s t u d i e d a r e a 100 in this study the modified ahp drastic approach developed by sener et al 2009 was employed to evaluate the intrinsic gv data preparation and processing of gw vulnerability in the pingtung plain were implemented in previous works of vu et al 2019 e percentage of total gw withdraw for drinking water gwi5 this indicator essentially represents the ratio of groundwater dependence for public supply to surface water the sources of total gw withdrawal are surface water artificial recharge and gw abstraction but only for community water supplies the data collected from the taiwan water resources agency wra 2012 were used to compute this indicator f density of gw monitoring wells gwi5 wells km2 it provides the early warning of sustainable use of gw resources cameron and white 2004 defined as 8 g w i 6 n u m b e r o f g w m o n i t o r i n g w e l l s t o t a l a q u i f e r a r e a in this study the data of the gw monitoring network are collected from the taiwan water resources agency wra 2012 g impact of land use gwi6 gwi7 it assesses the effects of land use or land cover on the quantity and quality of gw resources systems according to steinman 2007 this impact stems from natural land cover or land use and impervious surfaces these indices are given by 9 g w i 7 a r e a s o f n a t u r a l l a n d c o v e r o r l a n d u s e t o t a l a q u i f e r a r e a 100 10 g w i 8 a r e a s o f i m p e r v i o u s s u r f a c e t o t a l a q u i f e r a r e a 100 the larger the area of land use or land cover naturally the less the anthropogenic impact on gw resources and the higher the potential for gw replenishment a significant increase in the impervious surface may affect the gw replenishment rate and permeability water quality deterioration land subsidence and aquifer depletion sharp 2010 3 data preparation and processing of gv mapping data preparation and processing of the modified ahp drastic approach is described in detail by vu et al 2019 in this study we only briefly present the critical information of gv mapping parameter maps for gv mapping were created by different types of data using the arcgis environment the study area was discretized using a grid of 1000x1000m which has a projection of twd 1997 tm taiwan the ordinary kriging interpolation method was used to present the spatial distribution of all drastic parameters the various data sources are presented in table 1 the map of depth to water d was created by the computed hydraulic head from the calibrated gw flow model in 2017 the rating was classified into 7 classes fig 6 recharge estimation followed the concept of bisson and lehr 2004 that considers the components of precipitation evapotranspiration and surface runoff afterward net recharge was adjusted during the calibration process of the physical model the rating of net recharge r has 3 classes presented in fig 6 for aquifer media a the geological map and 47 borehole profiles were employed to identify the material characteristics of the aquifer there are four ratings fine to medium sand medium to coarse sand fine to medium gravel and medium to coarse gravel fig 6 the rating of soil media s was classified into sandy loam loam and clay loam as shown in fig 6 a 20 m resolution of a digital elevation model was employed to calculate the topographic slope t with five categories of topography rating the information of vadose zone i which has 5 classes of rating was extracted from 47 borehole logs pumping test data from 47 monitoring wells were used to calculate hydraulic conductivity giving a range of 0 1 507 m day 1 the land use map in 2017 has 6 categories with the highest rating for the agricultural regions as presented in fig 6 groundwater sampling was carried out in the pingtung plain to evaluate the gw quality and to correlate with the gv map the gw sampling period varies from 1 to 4 times per month based on the data published by taiwan wra gw samples were taken after purging bottles containing the sample were cleaned by deionized water three times and soaked in the diluted hcl solution within 24 h afterward gw samples were sent to the laboratory to analyze the quality on the same day ultra pure hydrochloric acid was employed to acidify the samples for cation analysis ion chromatography dx 500 was used for analyzing n o 3 the analytical precision is less than 2 for each analysis it is assumed there is no uncertainty related to the measurement 4 development of groundwater model and the simulation scenarios 4 1 conceptual model the steady state gw flow model of the pingtung plain was developed using modflow 2000 as presented briefly in table 2 the model has a domain area of 1355 km2 which is oriented north south and discretized into 90 rows and 40 columns with a uniform grid size of 1000 1000 m the aquifer system can be schematically subdivided into three hydrogeological layers that correspond to the well field inventory by the defined depths of 10 30 m 30 60 m and below 60 m ting 1992 the topmost layer is assumed to be an unconfined aquifer the geological formation for the middle layer has a very low transmissivity ting et al 1998 the middle layer is assumed to be semi pervious the bottom layer is assumed to be a confined aquifer layer the sources of natural aquifer replenishment are rainfall rivers and subsurface inflow from the northern upstream part of the fluvial fan the recharge rate was calculated based on the water balance equation bisson and h lehr 2004 using the long term average precipitation for 2010 2017 which was adjusted during the calibration process the hydraulic conductivity values were estimated based on pumping tests cgs 2002 there are 47 tests in aquifer layer 1 45 tests in aquifer layer 2 and 20 tests in aquifer layer 3 the hydraulic conductivity estimated from wells ranges from 0 155 to 507 m day 1 in the first layer 0 005 120 m day 1 in the second layer and 0 06 153 m day 1 in the bottom layer the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivities was interpolated using the kriging method and treated as the initial input parameters for model calibration the highest uncertainty in the model might be the unknown gw extraction for various uses groundwater extraction was modeled based on the gw rights of each county issued by taiwan s wra in 2013 the calibration process will further modify the amount of water withdrawal in the simulation area fig 4 shows the boundary conditions in the study area for simulating the gw flow system the northern eastern and western parts of the study area were assigned as no flow boundaries based on the drilling logs obtained from taiwan cgs the lower boundary of the basin has not yet been reached by drilling ting et al 1998 because we are interested in the interactions in the shallow groundwater system the bottom of the aquifer layer was assumed to be a no flow boundary specified head boundaries were assumed at upstream river valleys and along the coastal line the river package was employed to simulate the interaction of the kaoping tungkang and linpien rivers and the gw system 4 2 model calibration the parameter estimation pest code is an inverse model to calibrate parameter values aiming to minimize an objective function based on the sum of squares of the residuals between observed and computed results the pest model enables many parameters to be calibrated such as recharge evaporation hydraulic conductivity pumping rate river conductance and so forth in this study three settings of recharge hydraulic conductivity and pumping rate were parameterized which means identifying which parts of the model input the inverse model will optimize pilot points are a set of scatter points that are used to assign the value of hydraulic conductivity or recharge throughout the entire simulation model the values of the parameters from the pilot points are interpolated to the grid cells based on the geostatistic structure of the observations the inverse model then estimates the value of the pilot points which are adjusted and re interpolated to the grid cells until the discrepancies between measurements and simulated results fall within the predefined criteria in this study there are 82 81 and 48 points of hydraulic conductivity for aquifer 1 aquifer 2 and aquifer 3 respectively and 81 points for recharge the numbers and locations of the pilot points were chosen according to the proposed approach of doherty 2005 the initial parameter values were defined by altering the values at the pilot points the lower and upper bounds for parameter adjustments were assigned based on the obtained min and max measurements from the study area in this study kriging interpolation is selected to re interpolate to the model domain the model calibration process was implemented iteratively by the pest model firstly the parameter of recharge was initially calibrated then the calibrated recharge was imported to the model secondly the hydraulic conductivity of each aquifer was adjusted and the modified hydraulic conductivity was assigned again to the model finally the pumping rate has been optimized the process needs to be run several times to obtain the best parameter values that minimize the residuals between observed and simulated results calibrating the steady state gw flow model employed the annual average observation data of monitoring wells in 2017 4 3 climate scenarios a climate scenario can be employed to represent future climate conditions which evaluates the potential effects of human activities ipcc climate change 2001 according to climate change in taiwan scientific report council 2011 taiwan climate change projection and information platform project tccip analyzed the results from the ipcc ar4 and applied statistical downscaling to 24 global climate models gcms also gcm simulations were used to project the long term climate change due to possible human effects on future climate in this report there are four representative concentration pathways rcps rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 rc8 5 that are fundamentals of long term and near term modeling experiments for the climate simulation community the four rcps together span the range of the year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature i e from 2 6 to 8 5 w m2 results of the rcps provide the full dataset with high resolution for the period extending to 2100 council 2011 in the current study the trend of percent increase and decrease of precipitation in the report was used to predict the changes of groundwater head in the future as shown in table 3 in the current study various scenarios of varied precipitation were selected see table 3 we assumed that the climate conditions influence the gw system mainly through the amount of annual recharge produced by the rainfall the recharge rate was adjusted using the pest model for the calibration the estimated recharge rate through calibration was employed to project the percent change of predicted rainfall in different emission scenarios into the future positive values indicated an increase in precipitation and negative values indicated a decrease 5 results and discussion 5 1 physical based gw model in this study the gw flow system in the pingtung plain was modeled under steady state conditions the output of the gw flow model constitutes the gw balance the physical response of the gw system under different constraints and the interactions of gw and surface water as well as flow patterns the model must first be calibrated to estimate model parameters and conditions that are best matched between measured and simulated heads the model calibration attempts to simulate the gw flow conditions for 2017 assuming that the gw system was at or near quasi steady state conditions in the year 2017 the static water level observations of 41 wells in layer 1 29 wells in layer 2 and 14 wells in layer 3 were used to calibrate the model fig 5 shows the relation between the observed and computed hydraulic head at selected calibration wells residuals for the hydraulic head are distributed relatively evenly in the 1 1 line which indicates that the calibrated model shows no apparent bias the calibration results showed that the mean error me is 0 03 m the mean absolute error mae is 0 48 m and the root mean square error rmse is 0 61 m the coefficient of determination r2 between measured and computed gw heads was 0 99 the purpose of model verification is to demonstrate the best match of the field measurements based on the calibrated model anderson et al 2015 in this study observation data from 2015 and 2016 were employed to verify the calibrated model the results of the model verification are presented in table 4 the statistics of me mae and rmse indicated that the calibrated model could reproduce the gw levels in 2015 and 2016 within an acceptable margin of errors overall it can be seen that the calibrated model can simulate the water levels and gw balance in the study area in the steady state model simulations the flow into and out of the aquifer should be determined inflow originates from the infiltration of precipitation the seepage of rivers and gw interaction through all boundaries meanwhile gw flows out the study area including as base flow pumping extraction and discharge through the boundaries table 5 summarizes the water budget of the steady state gw flow simulation for the entire model domain 5 2 iterative drastic model fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the rating map of different parameters used in the modified ahp drastic note that the rating map of depth to water net recharge and hydraulic conductivity have been calculated based on the output of the calibrated gw model the rest of the parameter maps were created by a different type of data set based on the previous work of vu et al 2019 the modified ahp drastic vulnerability map was created by overlaying the weights and ratings from eight maps of drastic parameters in arcview gis see fig 7 the gv indices were divided into three intervals low moderate and high based on natural breaks jenks the drastic indices for the study area show low vulnerable zones i e the index 0 129 0 272 moderately vulnerable zones i e the index 0 272 0 333 and highly vulnerable zones i e the index 0 334 0 414 respectively it can be seen that the low gv risk accounts for 24 4 of the study area while moderate and high gv risk in the pingtung plain is 40 1 and 35 6 respectively fig 7 shows that the townships such as gaoshu yanpu meinong changzhi have a very high risk of gw contamination and a high gv is also seen in parts of the rest of the municipalities the accuracy of gv mapping should be validated by field measurements of common groundwater pollutants in this study the nitrate concentration is one of the non point source contaminants that have been employed to quantify the gv and contamination risk based on the 71 monitoring wells vu et al 2019 suggested that the short term average no3 n concentration is more reliable than long term data for validation of gv this study used nitrate data from 2016 to 2017 to validate the gv mapping with a minimum maximum and average values of 0 01 16 10 and 4 14 mg l respectively fig 8 shows the comparison between nitrate concentrations and normalized gv values at the sampling wells the pearson correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination are 0 85 and 0 717 respectively the correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination of the gv map obtained from the previous work of vu et al 2019 are 0 84 and 0 705 which are slightly smaller than those in this study note that the results in the study require the gv parameters modified by the physical based modflow model the results show that parameters modified by the gw model can improve the accuracy of the gv for site specific problems with the available physical based model predictions of the gv method become feasible because the physical based model enables the quantification of natural conditions and anthropogenic activities 5 3 the variation of gv induced by climate conditions in this study we have focused on the climate conditions to present the proposed concept for predicting the variations of the gv distributions other natural conditions or anthropogenic activities can follow the same concept when a physical based model is available to represent the behavior of aquifer responses the variation of climate conditions affects the frequency and timing of rainfall which alters the gw recharge regimes thereby influencing gw availability and the variations of the gv fig 9 shows the variation of the groundwater vulnerability value gvv under different scenarios of climate conditions in the pingtung plain groundwater basin the distributions of the gvv in 2025 and 2017 show a similar pattern and intensity under the rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 climate scenarios the scenarios lead to slight changes in precipitation which varies from 1 19 to 1 44 for rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 as compared to the baseline case in 2017 with the increase of precipitation up to 3 6 in the rcp8 5 the variations of gvv show relatively significant changes in both the pattern and intensity however the rise of gv intensity for rcp8 5 remains in the same defined vulnerable intervals the highest vulnerable area increases by 2 4 as compared to the map based on the data in 2017 see table 6 similarly the prediction of gv variation in 2050 shows that the change of gvv is not significant the results show a slightly different intensity and the increase of the highly vulnerable area is 3 1 for rcp2 6 as compared to the conditions in 2017 additionally the low and moderate regions increase by 0 1 the change in precipitation in rcp6 0 falls to 0 85 and leads to a decrease of gvv in both the distribution and intensity in 2100 there is a similar trend of gvv variations for rcp 2 6 and rcp6 0 and the highly vulnerable areas increase to 3 0 and 3 1 see table 6 the corresponding percentage increases in the precipitation are 4 11 and 4 16 the gvv with rcp8 5 conditions varies slightly in both distribution and intensity as compared to the conditions in 2017 however the pattern is similar to the gvv with rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 conditions in 2025 comparing the variation of gvv under different times in a specific scenario rcp shows that the gvv in 2025 for rcp2 6 changes slightly with respect to its distribution and intensity as compared with the gvv in 2017 however the precipitation increases from 4 11 to 4 67 both the distribution and intensity of gvv vary considerably and show increases of 3 0 and 3 1 in the highly vulnerable areas the scenario of rcp6 0 demonstrates that there is no typical trend of precipitation but the gvv changes significantly over time see table 6 which decrease in 2050 then increases in 2100 with respect to the first 2025 similar behavior was obtained for scenario rcp8 5 the gvv increases significantly in 2025 decreases in 2050 and increases again in 2100 based on the modeling conditions applied to the modflow model we had fixed the river stages for different climate conditions the dense river network in the pingtung plain might control the variations of groundwater levels also the boundary conditions control the behavior near the boundaries of the basin in this study the high variations of gv zones are generally located away from the basin boundaries the influence of the boundaries might be small as compared to the local stress applied to the gw flow model therefore the variations of climate conditions do not significantly influence the gv in the pingtung plain groundwater basin however when the changes in climate conditions induce higher precipitation by up to 3 6 to 4 or more there are slight increases in highly vulnerable areas these areas are relatively sensitive to climate variations and are generally located away from the rivers see fig 9 in fig 9 the gv base case is calculated based on the data in 2017 the results in fig 9 are further divided into two groups including the cells that have no change of gvvs marked with no change and the cells that are influenced by the climate conditions marked with the specific gv classes defined for 2017 data the values associated with different gv classes in fig 9 summarize the overall variation of the gvvs in the study area note that we have converted the changed value of gv to a percentage change in gv for better presentation the variations of gv changes are relative to the gv obtained in 2017 the results in fig 9 indicate that the greater the recharge of the aquifer system the greater the groundwater vulnerability table 6 summarizes the vulnerable areas for various rcps in 2017 and in 2025 2050 and 2100 comparing the gv changes induced by the climate conditions and the land use changes proposed by vu et al 2019 it is evident that the climate conditions have less influence on the gv the land use changes have a strong relationship and directly influence the potential of gw contamination previous research has concluded that the impact of land use land cover lulc on the hydrologic system may surpass that of recent or anticipated climate change at least over decadal time scales vörösmarty et al 2004 the results also agree with the conclusion of li and merchant 2013 that dtw and net recharge contribute less significance compared to land use factors in predicting future gv the changes in climate conditions lead to changes in recharge and depth of water which are generally inconsistent with anthropogenic activities however the accumulated effects of the natural conditions and human activities on the gv can be significant for most practical problems 5 4 the sustainability assessment of gw resources the value of gwi1 expresses the total available amount of renewable gw resources for social economic development the higher the value of gwi1 the better is the possibility of using renewable gw resources for development purposes there are no specific criteria for the value of this indicator however considering this indicator at the regional or national level one can obtain an overview of the gw availability therefore it can be viewed as an indicator of pressure to reflect the water consumption per capita under the current conditions and to suggest trends in water consumption related to social development and future economic growth table 7 lists the gw system in 11 counties that are over exploited with respect to their renewable capacity the gwi1 in this study varies from 196 9 to 8758 2 m3 cap average 1614 2 m3 cap for the pingtung plain groundwater basin this value is higher than the reported value of south africa 261 0 m3 cap finland 126 2 m3 cap and iran on average 1101 3 m3 cap and less than that of sao paulo brazil 3120 0 m3 cap the gwi2 value considers total annual abstraction and total recharge in this study the gw abstraction recharge and river leakage in 2017 are calculated from the calibrated gw flow model the ratio of total gw abstraction to recharge gwi2 is between 0 0 and 841 2 see table 7 according to gw rights the counties of linbian dongkang and linyuan have reported no gw extraction which results in a sustainable gw system if the value of gwi2 is over 100 which means that the current state of gw extraction should be carefully managed and regulated because the potential for gw replenishment is not enough to control the water balance in the local system vrba and lipponen 2007 proposed that the abstraction amount should be less than the recharge amount gwi2 90 on this basis ten counties show sustainable gw resources including xinpi yanpu meinong kanding likang and pingtung table 7 the remaining counties have a very high ratio of total gw abstraction to recharge from 114 to 841 2 compared to results from finland south africa and iran which have pumping values of only 10 17 1 and 17 52 at the national scale respectively as with the previous indicator the availability of gw abstraction data is essentially the same the amount of gw abstraction has been taken into consideration to avoid adversely affecting the utilization and development of long term gw resources the values of gwi3 of xinpi yanpu meinong kanding likang pingtung fangliao wanluan kaoshu and neipu range from 25 6 to 85 7 especially linbian dongkang and linyuan with zero percent that reflects sustainable gw utilization and management according to the classification of this indicator vrba and lipponen 2007 the defined indicator value of remaining counties covered by the third scenario shows that these counties have over exploited gw resources the resulting stress should be considered when managing water resources see table 7 this indicator is also much higher than in other countries such as finland 12 iran 0 03 21 9 and brazil 0 52 gwi4 expresses the creation of public awareness about gw protection and the formulation of stress reduction measures of sustainable gw management the indicator for gv in the study area is in the range of 0 0 to 83 6 based on the modified ahp drastic model the gwi4 indicator points out that the most vulnerable areas are the counties of yanpu meinong changzhi and gaoshu see table 7 therefore these areas need more investigations of existing contamination in detail and careful evaluations that should be carried out in these regions when implementing gw management plans in the future according to the taiwan water resources agency taiwan wra 2012 tap water from the water treatment plants was distributed to approximately 45 8 of inhabitants of the pingtung plain thus 54 2 of the population extracted a massive volume of gw for drinking and household purposes therefore the values of gwi5 are equal to 54 2 which indicates that the public supply depends significantly on the gw resources this indicator is much lower than sao paulo state in brazil 62 3 finland 61 iran 79 1 and santa fe province in argentina 97 5 there are 143 observation wells taiwan wra 2012 within an area of 1210 km2 in the pingtung plain groundwater basin the indicator of gwi6 expresses the capacity of the gw monitoring network in observing the dynamics of gw levels under different stresses the density of the gw monitoring network in the pingtung plain is 0 12 well per km2 which is relatively small as compared with those of other countries more observation wells might be required to measure the detailed dynamics of gw levels and fluctuations for example the coverage of observation wells in iran ranges from 0 02 to 0 32 well km2 hosseini et al 2019 some countries have a relatively high density of gw monitoring wells such as finland with 2 well km2 and the netherlands with over 93 well km2 jousma and roelofsen 2004 koreimann et al 1996 the percentage of natural land use impact gwi7 in the pingtung plain ranges from 55 1 to 94 7 with an average value of 80 9 see table 7 which reflects a high potential for water to replenish the aquifer however a significant proportion of natural land is used for agriculture purposes in the study area and the larger the agricultural areas the higher potential for groundwater contamination in the study area the gwi8 value is between 5 3 linbian county and 44 9 pingtung city with an average value of 19 1 which implies a risk of gw shortages and environmental deterioration in summary the analysis of the sustainability indicators in the pingtung plain indicates that the gw system is less sustainable and faces the risk of contamination dependence on gw resources in the study area explains the significant decline of gw levels that has led to land subsidence and seawater intrusion over the past five decades ting et al 1998 however the gw system in the counties of libian dongkang and linyuan is still safe the groundwater system in these areas requires suitable management strategies for the long term sustainable use of groundwater resources 6 conclusions this study has presented a new concept that integrates the modflow model and the drastic method for predicting gv and groundwater sustainability in the pingtung plain groundwater basin the assessments focus on various climate conditions that are simulated by the modflow model the predictions of future gv and groundwater sustainability then rely on the results obtained from the calibrated gw flow model the calibrated depth of water net recharge and hydraulic conductivity generated from the gw flow model in combination with land use factors and ahp theory slightly improved the accuracy and reliability of the gv assessment the pearson correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination between the gv map and the nitrate measurements were 0 85 and 0 717 respectively results of the predicted gv maps for different rcp scenarios show that the climate conditions have relatively less influence on the gv estimations additionally climate conditions do not significantly affect the risk of gw contamination we found that the relatively dense river network in the pingtung plain might control the regional groundwater flow pattern through the fixed river stages applied to the model the areas away from the rivers show relatively higher sensitivity to the changes in climate conditions the integration of the gv maps and the gw flow model is crucial to calculate the sustainability indicators for an aquifer system the primary function of gw resource sustainability indicators is to describe the state and trends of the gw system the sustainability indicators play an important role in planning regional development and water resource strategies the results of the analyses show that the gw resource system in the pingtung plain groundwater basin is in a critical condition in many counties in the pingtung plain area the gw system is not sustainable and faces the risk of contamination more measurements and better management strategies should be proposed immediately to protect and recover the gw system the proposed approach is the first to consider the integration of a numerical model and an index overlay method for predicting future groundwater vulnerability and groundwater resource sustainability the concept can be implemented with different physical models and different index overlay methods in the future the approach could include other types of information including social economic development water policy environmental conservation and others many of which can be directly quantified by using a physical model also for the cases of the relevant gv zones near the boundaries that are affected by boundary conditions more detailed observations are needed to validate the boundary conditions for the flow model furthermore hydrochemistry data should be considered to correlate with the gv map which relates to the anthropogenic activities the integration of the physical model and the gv map will reflect the dynamics of the regional groundwater variations and target contamination thus predicting the impact of regional development on groundwater vulnerability and sustainability for an aquifer system will be more accurate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

4675,this study presents a new concept that integrates the index overlay method and a physical based numerical model for predicting groundwater sustainability under various climate conditions and anthropogenic activities the index overlay drastic method was modified with an analytical hierarchy process theory and employed to create groundwater vulnerability maps for the pingtung plain groundwater basin in southern taiwan the physical based modflow model was used for predicting the dynamics of a basin scale groundwater system solutions and calibrated hydrogeological parameters in the modflow model provide feedback to the factors in the modified drastic method which enables predicting groundwater vulnerability in this study different climate conditions were considered in the numerical model to obtain the changes in depth of water and net recharge for predicting future groundwater vulnerability and for evaluating the current state of the sustainability indicators results show that the depth of water and net recharge obtained from the groundwater model improve the accuracy of the groundwater vulnerability prediction the variations of future climate conditions have less influence on the variations of groundwater vulnerability because of the dense river network that controls the shallow groundwater levels in the pingtung plain groundwater basin therefore the influence of climate conditions on the risk of groundwater contamination is also relatively low based on the analysis of the sustainability indicators we found that the groundwater resource system in the pingtung plain groundwater basin is in a critical condition of high vulnerability keywords index overlay method drastic numerical model modflow groundwater vulnerability groundwater sustainability 1 introduction groundwater gw is a vital supplement for domestic use and essential for agriculture industry and related ecosystems in semi arid regions where surface water is scarce aller et al 1987 however population growth agricultural activities urbanization and climate change are threatening the groundwater quantity and quality in many groundwater basins rahman 2008 the effective management and development of policies are of great importance for ensuring the sustainable use of groundwater over the past few decades the integration of various tools or methods has been proposed to protect and manage groundwater deterioration and degradation chang et al 2017 jang et al 2016 lin et al 2017 whereby providing scientifically plausible instruction for policymakers and governors groundwater vulnerability gv is an effective technique for practical groundwater pollution prevention and remediation tasks jang et al 2017 existing methods for assessing groundwater vulnerability can be classified into three categories nobre et al 2007 1 index and overlay methods 2 process based methods and 3 statistical methods one of the popular index overlay methods for quantifying groundwater vulnerability is the drastic method which was initially developed by the us epa for ease of use minimal data requirements and a clear interpretation of gv aller et al 1987 furthermore associated with gis tools the drastic model can be applied for large scale regions with low application costs however it has some limitations because the ratings and weights assigned in the model depend on the site specific conditions and judgment of experts busico et al 2020 also in recent years many studies have modified the drastic method by adding parameters or ignoring the existing parameters according to site specific settings huan et al 2012 kazakis and voudouris 2015 sadat noori and ebrahimi 2016 sener et al 2009 the conventional drastic model could be calibrated and verified by using the analytic hierarchy process ahp geo statistics artificial neural networks ann or artificial intelligence ai to optimize the weights and to fit the observations baghapour et al 2016 dixon 2005 goudarzi et al 2017 saida et al 2017 previous studies proved that the drastic model coupled with ahp could produce high accuracy and reliable gv maps which can be validated by field measurements of pollutants neshat et al 2014 sener and davraz 2012 thirumalaivasan et al 2003 in addition land use is also one of the critical components for improving the reliability of gv because of its influence directly on gv the integration of land use factors and the conventional drastic model was proposed by many researchers to predict the impacts of human activities on groundwater quality e g huang et al 2009 li and merchant 2013 lima et al 2011 previous studies have conducted investigations of the gv approach which focused on the prediction of gv under the impact of climate change climate change can potentially affect the variation of gv which is heavily dependent on factors such as depth to water dtw net recharge or land use conditions therefore focusing on gv that may be affected by both climate and land use changes is an excellent approach because it provides governments with valuable information on groundwater resources management several studies have quantified gv under different scenarios of climate and land use for example huang et al 2009 predicted future gv under a combination of climate change scenarios and urbanization they concluded that the whole hunan province faces a high risk of groundwater pollution in the future li and merchant 2013 determined how and where changes in depth to water net recharge and land use caused by different scenarios of climate change affected gv the results showed that the north and northwest regions of eastern north dakota would continuously have high gv under different scenarios of climate conditions nevertheless it can be seen that in these studies groundwater recharge and dtw were estimated based on the empirical equations or hydrological methods without considering the geological or hydrogeological condition and other parameters as well as lack of calibration and validation physical based numerical models play an essential role in the planning and management of gw resources and in forecasting the effects of management measures the models have been used as assessment tools for evaluating recharge discharge and aquifer storage processes and as prediction tools for forecasting future conditions or impacts of human activities zhou 2009 with the rapid improvement of computing power and the widespread use of geographic information system gis significant progress has been made in the use of 3d groundwater flow models such as modflow modflow is a us geological survey modular finite difference flow model with a flexible modular structure complete coverage of hydrogeological processes and is available in the public domain although applications of the groundwater flow model modflow for various purposes have been conducted in many studies e g singh 2013 mahmoudpour et al 2016 mi et al 2016 huang and chiu 2018 lin et al 2017 li et al 2016 su et al 2020 investigations on the combination of a physical based model and an index overlay method to quantify the variation of groundwater vulnerability have not yet been reported physically meaningful parameters such as the water pumped from the aquifers or the precipitation influenced by climate change may interact with other parameters in the drastic method users adjust the drastic settings and weightings to reflect changes in hydrogeological conditions however the characteristics of the drastic parameters cannot solely rely on changing the weightings without considering the physical mechanisms a potential solution to such a situation is to use a physical based model to quantify changes in hydrogeological conditions based on the fixed parameters and weightings the variation of vulnerability in the drastic method can then be obtained by applying the variations of parameters obtained from a physical model moreover gv is one of the key components to evaluate the degree of gw sustainability which supports the policymakers in establishing comprehensive protection and quality conservation policies for highly vulnerable areas gv informs the public about the potential of gw contamination and the necessary solutions for management and protection the gv indicator is a practical economic and social tool for protecting the gw system through land use planning vrba and lipponen 2007 in addition to reach the goal of sustainable and reasonable gw utilization and management it is necessary to develop the policies and to implement effective groundwater management options in practice that need managerially important information on the quality and quantity of groundwater systems the relevant information can be quantified through the indicators which act as an essential assessment tool for policymakers planners and the public vrba and lipponen 2007 the sustainability indicators sis of gw management provide information about the current status and trends in groundwater systems they also help analyze the impacts of anthropogenic activities and the extent of natural processes on the groundwater system and promote the awareness of the public in the utilization and management of gw sustainably vrba and lipponen 2007 however they also have drawbacks because of their dependency on social economic development geographical conditions and hydrogeological structures russo et al 2014 due to distinct study areas the characteristics of an aquifer system will vary dramatically which means that the fundamental analysis of each aquifer system is unique juwana et al 2012 vrba and lipponen 2007 developed a meaningful set of 10 indicators from more than one hundred conceptual water related indices as guiding principles these indicators have been employed to assess groundwater sustainability in several countries at the national level hirata et al 2007 lavapuro et al 2008 perez et al 2015 none of them considered a physical based numerical model as a tool for providing information on aquifer characteristics to calculate the sustainability indicators water balance the dynamics of groundwater levels or estimation of net recharge would be extracted from the calibrated gw flow model to support the assessment of gw sustainability this paper is a first attempt to integrate a physical based groundwater flow model and proposed sustainability indicators for delineating a complete representation of groundwater system sustainability in this study we propose a concept of integrated procedures that is capable of quantifying groundwater vulnerability changes to site specific problems under changing climate conditions while evaluating the sustainability of groundwater resources in the pingtung plain groundwater basin in southern taiwan generally the modflow model was used for simulating the physical responses of the groundwater system the aquifer parameters calibrated in the numerical model provide feedback for the key parameters such as the depth of water net recharge and hydraulic conductivity used in the drastic method the drastic method incorporated with land use and ahp theory was then employed to quantify the groundwater vulnerability which was validated by the field data from nitrate measurements this integration of the modflow and drastic system acts as an assessment process to calculate the vulnerability changes induced by climate conditions different scenarios of climate conditions are applied to the numerical model to obtain changes in water level and net recharge in the aquifer systems additionally the sustainability of groundwater resources in the study area has been evaluated based on the water budget from the modflow model and the results of gv in the current year of 2017 the results of this study are expected to provide useful information about the status of the groundwater resources system that supports policymakers in planning and adopting strategies of sustainable groundwater management 2 materials and methods 2 1 the conceptual framework the objective of this study is to propose a new concept that integrates a physical based numerical model with an index overlay method and sustainability indicators to quantify changes in groundwater vulnerability affected by climate conditions as well as to assess the gw resource sustainability to integrate the index overly method with the physical based model the parameters in the index overlay method interact with the parameters and or site specific conditions in the calibrated physical based model the validated gw vulnerability acts as an indicator of gw resource sustainability in combination with the selected sustainability indicators that are calculated based on the numerical gw flow model in this study the aquifer system located in the pingtung plain was used to illustrate the proposed concept as shown in fig 1 the selected index overlay method is the modified ahp drastic method and the widely used modflow model was employed as the physical based numerical flow model the sis were proposed by vrba and lipponen 2007 for illustration purposes the methods and models used for the proposed concept are not limited to those shown in this study it is assumed that field data and observations are available for a selected groundwater basin the procedures for evaluating the variations of vulnerability and gw resource sustainability are based on the following two main procedures and the associated steps see also fig 1 1 quantifying the variation of gw vulnerability 1 conduct an initial modflow simulation including calibration and verification of parameters for the selected groundwater basin usually the hydraulic head generated by the model solutions and the aquifer properties for the first layer unconfined aquifer are the critical parameters for the modified ahp drastic method 2 calculate relevant drastic parameters based on the head solution and the associated hydrogeological conditions obtained from the calibrated modflow model the depth of groundwater in drastic can be obtained by calculating the differences between groundwater levels and ground surface elevations on a cell by cell basis the cell by cell net recharge rates and hydraulic conductivity are the same as those in the calibrated modflow model for the aquifer media soil media the impact of the vadose zone and land use the drastic method uses depth averaged values so the aquifer properties derived from the model need to be averaged cell by cell along the vertical direction in this step we have integrated the physical based modflow with the drastic method 3 for different scenarios of climate conditions for precipitation rerun the modflow model based on the stress changes net recharge involved in these scenarios then re calculate the drastic parameters according to the new results from modflow one can obtain the groundwater vulnerability corresponding to the stress changes the effect of stress changes on groundwater vulnerability is quantified through detailed spatial distribution 2 assessing the gw sustainability 1 calculate sis based on the gw vulnerability obtained from step 1 for the year 2017 the other selected sis can be calculated from the components of the flow budget such as inflow outflow net recharge seepage and gw extraction from the calibrated modflow model for the current year s simulation here we have assessed gw sustainability by the combination of the numerical model index overlay method and sis 2 accordingly the information or predictions of the critical factors that affect gw sustainability will be taken into consideration such as social economic development policy and governance gw management and utilization environmental conservation etc these factors influence or interact directly with the variation of the gw vulnerability as well as with the flow system at this stage the physical based gw flow model should be conceptualized and re stimulated based on the updated information i e gv will be quantified again based on the new calibrated model these results from the gw vulnerability and numerical model respond to gw sustainability the process repeats when the components in this framework change 2 2 study area the pingtung groundwater basin is located in southern taiwan which is one of nine groundwater sub regions in taiwan from north to south see fig 2 three river catchments extend across the plain the kaoping tungkang and linpien catchments this elongated plain covers an area of 1210 km2 22 km wide in the east west direction and 55 km in the north south direction the topography of the pingtung plain ranges from 10 m above sea level in coastal areas to 110 m above sea level in the central mountain range according to the central weather bureau the long term average precipitation in the area ranges from 1928 to 3827 mm with an average of 2470 mm the rainfall season occurs from may to september and the dry season occurs from october to april the ratio of rain in the dry seasons and the wet season is 1 9 hsu et al 2007 the unconsolidated sediments underlying the plain are of late quaternary age which comprises the principal aquifer in the plain ting et al 1998 investigation of subsurface hydrogeology to a depth of approximately 250 m covers eight overlapping sequences including four marine sequences and four non marine sequences in the distal fan cgs 2002 the sequence of the aquifer system illustrated in fig 3 is referred to as aquifer 1 f1 aquitard 1 t1 aquifer 2 f2 aquitard 2 t2 aquifer 3 1 f3 1 aquitard 3 t3 and aquifer 3 2 f3 2 in the vertical direction huang and chiu 2018 in general the groundwater system in the plain is driven mainly from direct precipitation and partly from local influence as inferred from the river seepage ting et al 1998 the permeability of the soil dominates the recharge pattern hsieh et al 2010 the proximal fan which is composed primarily of gravel and sand in the eastern sector of the study area has high infiltration and percolation of rainfall and river flow ting et al 1998 this leads to a higher groundwater head than the left side of the plain that comprises mainly fine sediments and clay hsieh et al 2010 also groundwater resources in the pingtung plain are controlled by the distribution of precipitation hsu et al 2007 rainfall infiltrates directly to underlying aquifers through the valleys in the northern and eastern parts and foothills in the western part of the plain additionally the dense river network of the pingtung plain is one of the main factors controlling the groundwater recharge river seepage is a significant source of replenishment for groundwater resources the pingtung plain is the primary region for agricultural development in taiwan surface water provides only 20 of total water demand and consequently the plain relies heavily on groundwater the groundwater is used to supply agriculture aquaculture industry and domestic uses hsu et al 2007 groundwater demand for farmland fishponds and households is approximately 60 and 54 respectively over the last few decades taiwan dgbsas 2005 taiwan wra 2012 which causes land subsidence and seawater intrusion in the study area ting et al 1998 although the government has monitored and regulated the gw exploitation the total amount of pumping is still unknown therefore the sustainable utilization of surface and groundwater resources has become an essential mission to agricultural water use over the past decade in addition agricultural activities in the pingtung plain can lead to the deterioration of the gw quality by using chemicals and fertilizers such as nitrate for improving the crops recently gw nitrate contamination has been a major concern of sustainable gw management in taiwan agriculture engineering research center 2009 also nitrate is one of the effective indicators to reflect the gw quality ouedraogo et al 2016 elevated nitrate concentration can threaten human health and the environment based on long term gw quality monitoring the gv map has been validated by nitrate concentration data published by agriculture engineering research center 2009 2 3 groundwater flow model the modflow model is a modular three dimensional finite difference numerical flow model developed by the us geological survey usgs to solve the three dimensional partial differential equation for groundwater flow through a porous medium mcdonald and harbaugh 1984 implementation details from modflow are provided by harbaugh et al 2000 and mcdonald and harbaugh 1984 in this study the gw flow model was simulated using modflow 2000 under the groundwater modeling system gms user interface model calibration which is used to estimate model parameters based on steady state and transient groundwater conditions is undertaken using the parameter estimation package pest doherty 2010 pest is an automatic parameter estimation and optimization package and is one of the most popular systems offering model independent optimization routines doherty and johnston 2003 it adopts a gradient search algorithm gauss marquardt levenberg method for instance to minimize an objective function based on the sum of squared weighted residuals i e the discrepancy between the computed head and observed head it also determines the optimal parameter vector b that minimizes a single weighted least squares objective function ф of the form 1 φ i 1 m ω i h i h i b 2 j 1 n ω j k j k j b 2 where b is a vector containing the values of the parameters to be estimated m is the number of observations n is the number of prior information values h i is the ith observed head h i b is the ith simulated head corresponding to the ith observation k j is the jth prior estimate k j b is the jth simulated head ω i is the weight for the observation i ω j is the weight for prior estimate j the performance of model calibration is evaluated by using the root mean square error rmse hill and tiedeman 2007 2 r m s e 1 n w s p t 1 s p i 1 n w h i t s i m h i t o b s 2 0 5 where nw presents the number of wells sp denotes the simulated period hsim and hobs are the computed and observed hydraulic heads respectively t is the time of the model simulation 2 4 modified ahp drastic model the conventional drastic model which was developed by aller et al 1987 assesses the relative potential for groundwater contamination the model uses seven parameters based on the hydrogeologic characteristics to evaluate gv namely depth of water d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography t the impact of the vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c the ratings and weights of the drastic parameters are classified into the ranges or zones on a scale of 1 to 10 and 1 to 5 respectively which represents the contribution of each parameter to aquifer vulnerability an additional land use factor is integrated to be a modified drastic for improving the quality of groundwater vulnerability mapping which has been conducted in many previous studies panagopoulos et al 2006 sadat noori and ebrahimi 2016 secunda et al 1998 the vulnerability index vi can be expressed as follows 3 dvi d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w l r l w where d r a s t i c represent the seven parameters and l denotes land use factor r is the rating and w is the weight assigned to each parameter analytical hierarchy process theory was also employed in the modified ahp drastic approach to adjust the weights and ratings ahp theory is a multi criteria evaluation method developed by saaty 1980 that creates a series of multiple pair wise comparisons based on a fundamental scale of nine levels a comparison is performed using a scale of 1 to 9 from less importance to extremely high influence to quantify the rating and weighting of each criterion also the experience and knowledge of experts were taken into consideration to quantify the effect of the parameters on the decision making process dweiri and oqla 2006 ho 2008 there are four different steps to implement the ahp calculations first a comparison matrix is conducted using the eigenvector and eigenvalue the next step involves the calculation of the consistency index and consistency ratio cr the cr analysis determines if the judgments were consistent relative to large samples of purely random assessments if the cr is over 0 1 the judgment made while creating a pair wise comparison matrix has a serious inconsistency and needs to be modified so as to remove the inconsistency according to vu et al 2019 the results of gv mapping from the modified ahp drastic model showed more reliability than the conventional drastic and modified drastic approaches for the study area that was validated by field measurements of nitrate concentration therefore this model is selected to incorporate the physical based numerical model also the definition of gw vulnerability and gw contamination risk has been discussed in detail by vu et al 2019 gw contamination risk is defined as the combination of gw vulnerability probability of contaminant occurrence and the amount of gw contamination in this study we only focus on the prediction of gv variation under the change of climate conditions the approach of the vulnerability mapping and validation in the study follows the concept implemented in the investigation of assaf and saadeh 2009 and stigter et al 2006 2 5 the sustainability indicators according to gordon 2011 the definition of gw sustainability is the conservation and protection of gw resources to maintain a natural balance for social economic ecosystems future environment and human demand meanwhile gw sustainability indicators sis are the measurable parameters that describe relevant information on the status and trends of gw systems in a readily understandable way gordon 2011 steinman 2007 unesco has taken up the development of groundwater indicators under the sixth phase of the international hydrological programme ihp the indicators proposed in this report were used to assess the status and the trends in gw characteristics the influence of the exploitation and the sustainability of groundwater systems and to provide guidelines for resource management in addition hosseini et al 2019 suggested that the quantitative indicators can be applicable 1 to analyze the spatial temporal impacts of human activities on the gw system 2 to improve gw management capability of the policymakers and planners 3 compare the local management strategies for gw resources in different regions aquifers and 4 to create an awareness of public participation in gw resources planning and strategy based on indicator characteristics and data availability six indicators are used to evaluate gw sustainability in the pingtung plain a renewable gw resources per capita gwi1 m3 cap it expresses the total annual amount of renewable gw resources m3 per year per capita at the national or regional level the objective of this indicator is to estimate how much gw is theoretically available for each inhabitant per year and is defined as 4 gw i 1 r s b f i f o f a r p where r is net recharge generated from precipitation m3 s is the amount of gw seepage from the infiltration of surface water m3 bf is the base flow or gw discharge to rivers m3 if is gw inflow volume that enters an aquifer system naturally m3 of is gw outflow volume that leaves an aquifer system m3 ar is an artificial recharge supplied by using water wells spreading on the surface or by changing natural conditions to increase infiltration m3 and p is the population living in the study area all information on these components required to calculate the indicator gwi1 is collected from the calibrated gw flow model of the study area the population size of each aquifer is also obtained from the department of household registration website b ratio of total gw abstraction to recharge gwi2 this indicator shows the availability of water resources ground and surface water with regard to the current gw abstraction the indicator shows whether gw is used in a sustainable way or if there is any indication of over exploitation when the abstraction is less than recharge the use of gw can be considered viable the ratio is defined as 5 g w i 2 t o t a l g w a b s t r a c t i o n g w r e c h a r g e 100 where the primary gw recharge comprises precipitation infiltration from surface water bodies irrigation losses and seepage from urban water supply distribution and wastewater collection systems total gw abstraction denotes a total amount of water extracted from a given aquifer by means of wells boreholes springs and other ways for public water supply vrba and lipponen 2007 in this study the gw recharge is calculated based on the water balance equations bisson and lehr 2004 and calibrated in the gw flow model data on gw abstraction is generally unknown but information on gw rights representing the legal gw withdrawal is employed to estimate the regional utilization of gw resources it is adjusted during the process of gw flow calibration c the ratio of total gw abstraction to exploitable gw resources gwi3 it shows how much water has been extracted for the renewable gw resources and demonstrates the availability in the currently practiced abstractions 6 g w i 3 t o t a l g w a b s t r a c t i o n e x p l o i t a b l e g w r e s o u r c e s 100 where the total gw abstraction is calculated as described above the exploitable groundwater resources refer to the withdrawal of water from a given aquifer annually under the constraint of social economic technological factors and environmental conditions vrba and lipponen 2007 it should be the same amount of renewable gw resources sophocleous 2000 d gw vulnerability gwi4 this indicator specifies how much the physical environment protects the gw basin or the gw containing formation from pollution also it plays a role in increasing the awareness of public participation in gw protection as well as supporting the gw protection policy defined as 7 g w i 4 t o t a l a r e a o f h i g h v u l n e r a b i l i t y t o c o n t a m i n a n t t o t a l s t u d i e d a r e a 100 in this study the modified ahp drastic approach developed by sener et al 2009 was employed to evaluate the intrinsic gv data preparation and processing of gw vulnerability in the pingtung plain were implemented in previous works of vu et al 2019 e percentage of total gw withdraw for drinking water gwi5 this indicator essentially represents the ratio of groundwater dependence for public supply to surface water the sources of total gw withdrawal are surface water artificial recharge and gw abstraction but only for community water supplies the data collected from the taiwan water resources agency wra 2012 were used to compute this indicator f density of gw monitoring wells gwi5 wells km2 it provides the early warning of sustainable use of gw resources cameron and white 2004 defined as 8 g w i 6 n u m b e r o f g w m o n i t o r i n g w e l l s t o t a l a q u i f e r a r e a in this study the data of the gw monitoring network are collected from the taiwan water resources agency wra 2012 g impact of land use gwi6 gwi7 it assesses the effects of land use or land cover on the quantity and quality of gw resources systems according to steinman 2007 this impact stems from natural land cover or land use and impervious surfaces these indices are given by 9 g w i 7 a r e a s o f n a t u r a l l a n d c o v e r o r l a n d u s e t o t a l a q u i f e r a r e a 100 10 g w i 8 a r e a s o f i m p e r v i o u s s u r f a c e t o t a l a q u i f e r a r e a 100 the larger the area of land use or land cover naturally the less the anthropogenic impact on gw resources and the higher the potential for gw replenishment a significant increase in the impervious surface may affect the gw replenishment rate and permeability water quality deterioration land subsidence and aquifer depletion sharp 2010 3 data preparation and processing of gv mapping data preparation and processing of the modified ahp drastic approach is described in detail by vu et al 2019 in this study we only briefly present the critical information of gv mapping parameter maps for gv mapping were created by different types of data using the arcgis environment the study area was discretized using a grid of 1000x1000m which has a projection of twd 1997 tm taiwan the ordinary kriging interpolation method was used to present the spatial distribution of all drastic parameters the various data sources are presented in table 1 the map of depth to water d was created by the computed hydraulic head from the calibrated gw flow model in 2017 the rating was classified into 7 classes fig 6 recharge estimation followed the concept of bisson and lehr 2004 that considers the components of precipitation evapotranspiration and surface runoff afterward net recharge was adjusted during the calibration process of the physical model the rating of net recharge r has 3 classes presented in fig 6 for aquifer media a the geological map and 47 borehole profiles were employed to identify the material characteristics of the aquifer there are four ratings fine to medium sand medium to coarse sand fine to medium gravel and medium to coarse gravel fig 6 the rating of soil media s was classified into sandy loam loam and clay loam as shown in fig 6 a 20 m resolution of a digital elevation model was employed to calculate the topographic slope t with five categories of topography rating the information of vadose zone i which has 5 classes of rating was extracted from 47 borehole logs pumping test data from 47 monitoring wells were used to calculate hydraulic conductivity giving a range of 0 1 507 m day 1 the land use map in 2017 has 6 categories with the highest rating for the agricultural regions as presented in fig 6 groundwater sampling was carried out in the pingtung plain to evaluate the gw quality and to correlate with the gv map the gw sampling period varies from 1 to 4 times per month based on the data published by taiwan wra gw samples were taken after purging bottles containing the sample were cleaned by deionized water three times and soaked in the diluted hcl solution within 24 h afterward gw samples were sent to the laboratory to analyze the quality on the same day ultra pure hydrochloric acid was employed to acidify the samples for cation analysis ion chromatography dx 500 was used for analyzing n o 3 the analytical precision is less than 2 for each analysis it is assumed there is no uncertainty related to the measurement 4 development of groundwater model and the simulation scenarios 4 1 conceptual model the steady state gw flow model of the pingtung plain was developed using modflow 2000 as presented briefly in table 2 the model has a domain area of 1355 km2 which is oriented north south and discretized into 90 rows and 40 columns with a uniform grid size of 1000 1000 m the aquifer system can be schematically subdivided into three hydrogeological layers that correspond to the well field inventory by the defined depths of 10 30 m 30 60 m and below 60 m ting 1992 the topmost layer is assumed to be an unconfined aquifer the geological formation for the middle layer has a very low transmissivity ting et al 1998 the middle layer is assumed to be semi pervious the bottom layer is assumed to be a confined aquifer layer the sources of natural aquifer replenishment are rainfall rivers and subsurface inflow from the northern upstream part of the fluvial fan the recharge rate was calculated based on the water balance equation bisson and h lehr 2004 using the long term average precipitation for 2010 2017 which was adjusted during the calibration process the hydraulic conductivity values were estimated based on pumping tests cgs 2002 there are 47 tests in aquifer layer 1 45 tests in aquifer layer 2 and 20 tests in aquifer layer 3 the hydraulic conductivity estimated from wells ranges from 0 155 to 507 m day 1 in the first layer 0 005 120 m day 1 in the second layer and 0 06 153 m day 1 in the bottom layer the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivities was interpolated using the kriging method and treated as the initial input parameters for model calibration the highest uncertainty in the model might be the unknown gw extraction for various uses groundwater extraction was modeled based on the gw rights of each county issued by taiwan s wra in 2013 the calibration process will further modify the amount of water withdrawal in the simulation area fig 4 shows the boundary conditions in the study area for simulating the gw flow system the northern eastern and western parts of the study area were assigned as no flow boundaries based on the drilling logs obtained from taiwan cgs the lower boundary of the basin has not yet been reached by drilling ting et al 1998 because we are interested in the interactions in the shallow groundwater system the bottom of the aquifer layer was assumed to be a no flow boundary specified head boundaries were assumed at upstream river valleys and along the coastal line the river package was employed to simulate the interaction of the kaoping tungkang and linpien rivers and the gw system 4 2 model calibration the parameter estimation pest code is an inverse model to calibrate parameter values aiming to minimize an objective function based on the sum of squares of the residuals between observed and computed results the pest model enables many parameters to be calibrated such as recharge evaporation hydraulic conductivity pumping rate river conductance and so forth in this study three settings of recharge hydraulic conductivity and pumping rate were parameterized which means identifying which parts of the model input the inverse model will optimize pilot points are a set of scatter points that are used to assign the value of hydraulic conductivity or recharge throughout the entire simulation model the values of the parameters from the pilot points are interpolated to the grid cells based on the geostatistic structure of the observations the inverse model then estimates the value of the pilot points which are adjusted and re interpolated to the grid cells until the discrepancies between measurements and simulated results fall within the predefined criteria in this study there are 82 81 and 48 points of hydraulic conductivity for aquifer 1 aquifer 2 and aquifer 3 respectively and 81 points for recharge the numbers and locations of the pilot points were chosen according to the proposed approach of doherty 2005 the initial parameter values were defined by altering the values at the pilot points the lower and upper bounds for parameter adjustments were assigned based on the obtained min and max measurements from the study area in this study kriging interpolation is selected to re interpolate to the model domain the model calibration process was implemented iteratively by the pest model firstly the parameter of recharge was initially calibrated then the calibrated recharge was imported to the model secondly the hydraulic conductivity of each aquifer was adjusted and the modified hydraulic conductivity was assigned again to the model finally the pumping rate has been optimized the process needs to be run several times to obtain the best parameter values that minimize the residuals between observed and simulated results calibrating the steady state gw flow model employed the annual average observation data of monitoring wells in 2017 4 3 climate scenarios a climate scenario can be employed to represent future climate conditions which evaluates the potential effects of human activities ipcc climate change 2001 according to climate change in taiwan scientific report council 2011 taiwan climate change projection and information platform project tccip analyzed the results from the ipcc ar4 and applied statistical downscaling to 24 global climate models gcms also gcm simulations were used to project the long term climate change due to possible human effects on future climate in this report there are four representative concentration pathways rcps rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 rc8 5 that are fundamentals of long term and near term modeling experiments for the climate simulation community the four rcps together span the range of the year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature i e from 2 6 to 8 5 w m2 results of the rcps provide the full dataset with high resolution for the period extending to 2100 council 2011 in the current study the trend of percent increase and decrease of precipitation in the report was used to predict the changes of groundwater head in the future as shown in table 3 in the current study various scenarios of varied precipitation were selected see table 3 we assumed that the climate conditions influence the gw system mainly through the amount of annual recharge produced by the rainfall the recharge rate was adjusted using the pest model for the calibration the estimated recharge rate through calibration was employed to project the percent change of predicted rainfall in different emission scenarios into the future positive values indicated an increase in precipitation and negative values indicated a decrease 5 results and discussion 5 1 physical based gw model in this study the gw flow system in the pingtung plain was modeled under steady state conditions the output of the gw flow model constitutes the gw balance the physical response of the gw system under different constraints and the interactions of gw and surface water as well as flow patterns the model must first be calibrated to estimate model parameters and conditions that are best matched between measured and simulated heads the model calibration attempts to simulate the gw flow conditions for 2017 assuming that the gw system was at or near quasi steady state conditions in the year 2017 the static water level observations of 41 wells in layer 1 29 wells in layer 2 and 14 wells in layer 3 were used to calibrate the model fig 5 shows the relation between the observed and computed hydraulic head at selected calibration wells residuals for the hydraulic head are distributed relatively evenly in the 1 1 line which indicates that the calibrated model shows no apparent bias the calibration results showed that the mean error me is 0 03 m the mean absolute error mae is 0 48 m and the root mean square error rmse is 0 61 m the coefficient of determination r2 between measured and computed gw heads was 0 99 the purpose of model verification is to demonstrate the best match of the field measurements based on the calibrated model anderson et al 2015 in this study observation data from 2015 and 2016 were employed to verify the calibrated model the results of the model verification are presented in table 4 the statistics of me mae and rmse indicated that the calibrated model could reproduce the gw levels in 2015 and 2016 within an acceptable margin of errors overall it can be seen that the calibrated model can simulate the water levels and gw balance in the study area in the steady state model simulations the flow into and out of the aquifer should be determined inflow originates from the infiltration of precipitation the seepage of rivers and gw interaction through all boundaries meanwhile gw flows out the study area including as base flow pumping extraction and discharge through the boundaries table 5 summarizes the water budget of the steady state gw flow simulation for the entire model domain 5 2 iterative drastic model fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the rating map of different parameters used in the modified ahp drastic note that the rating map of depth to water net recharge and hydraulic conductivity have been calculated based on the output of the calibrated gw model the rest of the parameter maps were created by a different type of data set based on the previous work of vu et al 2019 the modified ahp drastic vulnerability map was created by overlaying the weights and ratings from eight maps of drastic parameters in arcview gis see fig 7 the gv indices were divided into three intervals low moderate and high based on natural breaks jenks the drastic indices for the study area show low vulnerable zones i e the index 0 129 0 272 moderately vulnerable zones i e the index 0 272 0 333 and highly vulnerable zones i e the index 0 334 0 414 respectively it can be seen that the low gv risk accounts for 24 4 of the study area while moderate and high gv risk in the pingtung plain is 40 1 and 35 6 respectively fig 7 shows that the townships such as gaoshu yanpu meinong changzhi have a very high risk of gw contamination and a high gv is also seen in parts of the rest of the municipalities the accuracy of gv mapping should be validated by field measurements of common groundwater pollutants in this study the nitrate concentration is one of the non point source contaminants that have been employed to quantify the gv and contamination risk based on the 71 monitoring wells vu et al 2019 suggested that the short term average no3 n concentration is more reliable than long term data for validation of gv this study used nitrate data from 2016 to 2017 to validate the gv mapping with a minimum maximum and average values of 0 01 16 10 and 4 14 mg l respectively fig 8 shows the comparison between nitrate concentrations and normalized gv values at the sampling wells the pearson correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination are 0 85 and 0 717 respectively the correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination of the gv map obtained from the previous work of vu et al 2019 are 0 84 and 0 705 which are slightly smaller than those in this study note that the results in the study require the gv parameters modified by the physical based modflow model the results show that parameters modified by the gw model can improve the accuracy of the gv for site specific problems with the available physical based model predictions of the gv method become feasible because the physical based model enables the quantification of natural conditions and anthropogenic activities 5 3 the variation of gv induced by climate conditions in this study we have focused on the climate conditions to present the proposed concept for predicting the variations of the gv distributions other natural conditions or anthropogenic activities can follow the same concept when a physical based model is available to represent the behavior of aquifer responses the variation of climate conditions affects the frequency and timing of rainfall which alters the gw recharge regimes thereby influencing gw availability and the variations of the gv fig 9 shows the variation of the groundwater vulnerability value gvv under different scenarios of climate conditions in the pingtung plain groundwater basin the distributions of the gvv in 2025 and 2017 show a similar pattern and intensity under the rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 climate scenarios the scenarios lead to slight changes in precipitation which varies from 1 19 to 1 44 for rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 as compared to the baseline case in 2017 with the increase of precipitation up to 3 6 in the rcp8 5 the variations of gvv show relatively significant changes in both the pattern and intensity however the rise of gv intensity for rcp8 5 remains in the same defined vulnerable intervals the highest vulnerable area increases by 2 4 as compared to the map based on the data in 2017 see table 6 similarly the prediction of gv variation in 2050 shows that the change of gvv is not significant the results show a slightly different intensity and the increase of the highly vulnerable area is 3 1 for rcp2 6 as compared to the conditions in 2017 additionally the low and moderate regions increase by 0 1 the change in precipitation in rcp6 0 falls to 0 85 and leads to a decrease of gvv in both the distribution and intensity in 2100 there is a similar trend of gvv variations for rcp 2 6 and rcp6 0 and the highly vulnerable areas increase to 3 0 and 3 1 see table 6 the corresponding percentage increases in the precipitation are 4 11 and 4 16 the gvv with rcp8 5 conditions varies slightly in both distribution and intensity as compared to the conditions in 2017 however the pattern is similar to the gvv with rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 conditions in 2025 comparing the variation of gvv under different times in a specific scenario rcp shows that the gvv in 2025 for rcp2 6 changes slightly with respect to its distribution and intensity as compared with the gvv in 2017 however the precipitation increases from 4 11 to 4 67 both the distribution and intensity of gvv vary considerably and show increases of 3 0 and 3 1 in the highly vulnerable areas the scenario of rcp6 0 demonstrates that there is no typical trend of precipitation but the gvv changes significantly over time see table 6 which decrease in 2050 then increases in 2100 with respect to the first 2025 similar behavior was obtained for scenario rcp8 5 the gvv increases significantly in 2025 decreases in 2050 and increases again in 2100 based on the modeling conditions applied to the modflow model we had fixed the river stages for different climate conditions the dense river network in the pingtung plain might control the variations of groundwater levels also the boundary conditions control the behavior near the boundaries of the basin in this study the high variations of gv zones are generally located away from the basin boundaries the influence of the boundaries might be small as compared to the local stress applied to the gw flow model therefore the variations of climate conditions do not significantly influence the gv in the pingtung plain groundwater basin however when the changes in climate conditions induce higher precipitation by up to 3 6 to 4 or more there are slight increases in highly vulnerable areas these areas are relatively sensitive to climate variations and are generally located away from the rivers see fig 9 in fig 9 the gv base case is calculated based on the data in 2017 the results in fig 9 are further divided into two groups including the cells that have no change of gvvs marked with no change and the cells that are influenced by the climate conditions marked with the specific gv classes defined for 2017 data the values associated with different gv classes in fig 9 summarize the overall variation of the gvvs in the study area note that we have converted the changed value of gv to a percentage change in gv for better presentation the variations of gv changes are relative to the gv obtained in 2017 the results in fig 9 indicate that the greater the recharge of the aquifer system the greater the groundwater vulnerability table 6 summarizes the vulnerable areas for various rcps in 2017 and in 2025 2050 and 2100 comparing the gv changes induced by the climate conditions and the land use changes proposed by vu et al 2019 it is evident that the climate conditions have less influence on the gv the land use changes have a strong relationship and directly influence the potential of gw contamination previous research has concluded that the impact of land use land cover lulc on the hydrologic system may surpass that of recent or anticipated climate change at least over decadal time scales vörösmarty et al 2004 the results also agree with the conclusion of li and merchant 2013 that dtw and net recharge contribute less significance compared to land use factors in predicting future gv the changes in climate conditions lead to changes in recharge and depth of water which are generally inconsistent with anthropogenic activities however the accumulated effects of the natural conditions and human activities on the gv can be significant for most practical problems 5 4 the sustainability assessment of gw resources the value of gwi1 expresses the total available amount of renewable gw resources for social economic development the higher the value of gwi1 the better is the possibility of using renewable gw resources for development purposes there are no specific criteria for the value of this indicator however considering this indicator at the regional or national level one can obtain an overview of the gw availability therefore it can be viewed as an indicator of pressure to reflect the water consumption per capita under the current conditions and to suggest trends in water consumption related to social development and future economic growth table 7 lists the gw system in 11 counties that are over exploited with respect to their renewable capacity the gwi1 in this study varies from 196 9 to 8758 2 m3 cap average 1614 2 m3 cap for the pingtung plain groundwater basin this value is higher than the reported value of south africa 261 0 m3 cap finland 126 2 m3 cap and iran on average 1101 3 m3 cap and less than that of sao paulo brazil 3120 0 m3 cap the gwi2 value considers total annual abstraction and total recharge in this study the gw abstraction recharge and river leakage in 2017 are calculated from the calibrated gw flow model the ratio of total gw abstraction to recharge gwi2 is between 0 0 and 841 2 see table 7 according to gw rights the counties of linbian dongkang and linyuan have reported no gw extraction which results in a sustainable gw system if the value of gwi2 is over 100 which means that the current state of gw extraction should be carefully managed and regulated because the potential for gw replenishment is not enough to control the water balance in the local system vrba and lipponen 2007 proposed that the abstraction amount should be less than the recharge amount gwi2 90 on this basis ten counties show sustainable gw resources including xinpi yanpu meinong kanding likang and pingtung table 7 the remaining counties have a very high ratio of total gw abstraction to recharge from 114 to 841 2 compared to results from finland south africa and iran which have pumping values of only 10 17 1 and 17 52 at the national scale respectively as with the previous indicator the availability of gw abstraction data is essentially the same the amount of gw abstraction has been taken into consideration to avoid adversely affecting the utilization and development of long term gw resources the values of gwi3 of xinpi yanpu meinong kanding likang pingtung fangliao wanluan kaoshu and neipu range from 25 6 to 85 7 especially linbian dongkang and linyuan with zero percent that reflects sustainable gw utilization and management according to the classification of this indicator vrba and lipponen 2007 the defined indicator value of remaining counties covered by the third scenario shows that these counties have over exploited gw resources the resulting stress should be considered when managing water resources see table 7 this indicator is also much higher than in other countries such as finland 12 iran 0 03 21 9 and brazil 0 52 gwi4 expresses the creation of public awareness about gw protection and the formulation of stress reduction measures of sustainable gw management the indicator for gv in the study area is in the range of 0 0 to 83 6 based on the modified ahp drastic model the gwi4 indicator points out that the most vulnerable areas are the counties of yanpu meinong changzhi and gaoshu see table 7 therefore these areas need more investigations of existing contamination in detail and careful evaluations that should be carried out in these regions when implementing gw management plans in the future according to the taiwan water resources agency taiwan wra 2012 tap water from the water treatment plants was distributed to approximately 45 8 of inhabitants of the pingtung plain thus 54 2 of the population extracted a massive volume of gw for drinking and household purposes therefore the values of gwi5 are equal to 54 2 which indicates that the public supply depends significantly on the gw resources this indicator is much lower than sao paulo state in brazil 62 3 finland 61 iran 79 1 and santa fe province in argentina 97 5 there are 143 observation wells taiwan wra 2012 within an area of 1210 km2 in the pingtung plain groundwater basin the indicator of gwi6 expresses the capacity of the gw monitoring network in observing the dynamics of gw levels under different stresses the density of the gw monitoring network in the pingtung plain is 0 12 well per km2 which is relatively small as compared with those of other countries more observation wells might be required to measure the detailed dynamics of gw levels and fluctuations for example the coverage of observation wells in iran ranges from 0 02 to 0 32 well km2 hosseini et al 2019 some countries have a relatively high density of gw monitoring wells such as finland with 2 well km2 and the netherlands with over 93 well km2 jousma and roelofsen 2004 koreimann et al 1996 the percentage of natural land use impact gwi7 in the pingtung plain ranges from 55 1 to 94 7 with an average value of 80 9 see table 7 which reflects a high potential for water to replenish the aquifer however a significant proportion of natural land is used for agriculture purposes in the study area and the larger the agricultural areas the higher potential for groundwater contamination in the study area the gwi8 value is between 5 3 linbian county and 44 9 pingtung city with an average value of 19 1 which implies a risk of gw shortages and environmental deterioration in summary the analysis of the sustainability indicators in the pingtung plain indicates that the gw system is less sustainable and faces the risk of contamination dependence on gw resources in the study area explains the significant decline of gw levels that has led to land subsidence and seawater intrusion over the past five decades ting et al 1998 however the gw system in the counties of libian dongkang and linyuan is still safe the groundwater system in these areas requires suitable management strategies for the long term sustainable use of groundwater resources 6 conclusions this study has presented a new concept that integrates the modflow model and the drastic method for predicting gv and groundwater sustainability in the pingtung plain groundwater basin the assessments focus on various climate conditions that are simulated by the modflow model the predictions of future gv and groundwater sustainability then rely on the results obtained from the calibrated gw flow model the calibrated depth of water net recharge and hydraulic conductivity generated from the gw flow model in combination with land use factors and ahp theory slightly improved the accuracy and reliability of the gv assessment the pearson correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination between the gv map and the nitrate measurements were 0 85 and 0 717 respectively results of the predicted gv maps for different rcp scenarios show that the climate conditions have relatively less influence on the gv estimations additionally climate conditions do not significantly affect the risk of gw contamination we found that the relatively dense river network in the pingtung plain might control the regional groundwater flow pattern through the fixed river stages applied to the model the areas away from the rivers show relatively higher sensitivity to the changes in climate conditions the integration of the gv maps and the gw flow model is crucial to calculate the sustainability indicators for an aquifer system the primary function of gw resource sustainability indicators is to describe the state and trends of the gw system the sustainability indicators play an important role in planning regional development and water resource strategies the results of the analyses show that the gw resource system in the pingtung plain groundwater basin is in a critical condition in many counties in the pingtung plain area the gw system is not sustainable and faces the risk of contamination more measurements and better management strategies should be proposed immediately to protect and recover the gw system the proposed approach is the first to consider the integration of a numerical model and an index overlay method for predicting future groundwater vulnerability and groundwater resource sustainability the concept can be implemented with different physical models and different index overlay methods in the future the approach could include other types of information including social economic development water policy environmental conservation and others many of which can be directly quantified by using a physical model also for the cases of the relevant gv zones near the boundaries that are affected by boundary conditions more detailed observations are needed to validate the boundary conditions for the flow model furthermore hydrochemistry data should be considered to correlate with the gv map which relates to the anthropogenic activities the integration of the physical model and the gv map will reflect the dynamics of the regional groundwater variations and target contamination thus predicting the impact of regional development on groundwater vulnerability and sustainability for an aquifer system will be more accurate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

4676,forest harvest climate change and their interaction can alter catchment peak discharges which have ramifications for channel geomorphology and water quality catchments in the boreal temperate transition zone may be especially vulnerable to these factors we developed a new approach to peak flow analysis using two long term paired catchment experiments in that landscape at the marcell experimental forest mef in north central minnesota we investigated how forest cover change affects the magnitude occurrence probability event decoupling and seasonal decoupling of annual maximum peak flows event decoupling is when the annual maximum flows on control and treatment catchments occur in response to different events within a given year seasonal decoupling is when the annual maximum flows on control and treatment catchments occur in different seasons within a given year commonly used statistical methods e g ancova support inferences only for effects on peak flow magnitude disregarding effects on event occurrence probability statistical stationarity i e time invariant parameters is generally assumed within the ancova analysis despite temporal changes in climatic and land cover controls further use of these methods requires event coupling which is not always valid for annual maximum flows in catchments with mixed precipitation regimes to address these limitations we developed new nonstationary flood frequency analysis methods with bayesian parameter estimation to analyze two harvesting experiments including conversion from deciduous to coniferous species we compared results from these models to traditional least squares based methods e g ancova we assessed event and seasonal decoupling using logistic regression with bayesian parameter estimation there was no effect of harvesting on the annual maximum flow according to ancova and generalized least squares models but these methods were not reliable due to the presence of outliers and both event and seasonal decoupling flood frequency results from one clearcutting experiment showed increases in the annual maximum flow across nearly all return intervals with 80 85 confidence for peak discharges between the 10 and 50 year peak flow the 50 year return interval peak increased from an expected 17 cfs to 34 cfs after harvest harvesting induced substantial event decoupling in the catchment pairs and seasonal decoupling in one catchment pair as forest cover regenerated decoupling probability decreased our coupling analysis results indicated that control and treatment catchments generated and processed flood peaks differently after harvest and explained the poor fit of the linear models for which we assumed event coupling our study calls into question several key assumptions of traditional linear models in the analysis of paired catchments given certain conditions for example where forest harvesting can affect the season of annual maximum peaks and thus the phase of the generating precipitation event snowmelt versus rainfall it changes the relationship between the catchment pair in a way not accounted for in traditional linear models we advocate the use of probabilistic methods that can incorporate nonstationarity and are robust to different mechanisms of catchment hydrologic change in response to forest harvest keywords paired catchments bayesian parameter estimation flood frequency flooding nonstationary forest harvesting 1 introduction forest cover change and forest harvesting effects on catchment processes especially on the high streamflow regime have been an area of research for decades andréassian 2004 yu and alila 2019 zon 1927 alterations in peak flows can have serious ramifications for channel geomorphology stream ecology as well as water quality and sediment dynamics auerswald and geist 2018 poff et al 2006 furthermore floods can be devastating for local communities bradshaw et al 2007 forests are generally thought to offer some level of flood protection which can be influenced by disturbance such as forest harvesting alila and green 2014 andréassian 2004 birkinshaw 2014 green and alila 2012 moving forward changing climate and a growing demand for wood products may increase forest disturbance underlying the ecological and societal importance of understanding the relationship between forests and peak stream flows angel et al 2018 buongiorno et al 2012 buras and menzel 2018 in north america forest harvesting and forest cover change effects on peak streamflows are predominantly examined in high relief regions with bedrock close to the soil surface alila et al 2009 jones and grant 1996 kuraś et al 2012 thomas and megahan 1998 small 10 km2 paired catchment studies have provided the foundation for much of the current knowledge in forest hydrology including peak flows and flooding andréassian 2004 widespread disagreement remains and often stems from interpretation of the statistical method used to analyze paired catchment data buttle 2011 historical methods that have addressed the relationship between forest cover change and peak discharges in paired catchment experiments have typically relied on linear statistical models e g anova ancova hewlett 1982 jones and grant 1996 thomas and megahan 1998 that utilize traditional frequentist approaches they are designed to test for differences in mean values and rely on chronological pairing such that differences between catchments are compared for the same precipitation event alila et al 2009 such methods have given rise to the general paradigm that the effect of forest harvesting on peak flows exhibits a decreasing effect size with increasing peak flow and thus a greater proportional impact associated with frequent low discharge peak flows andréassian 2004 bathurst et al 2011 thomas and megahan 1998 the historic chronologically paired approach does not account for both event magnitude and frequency e g as reviewed by alilia et al 2009 analyses accounting for frequency of peak flows mostly conducted in mountainous snowmelt dominated catchments have found sizable effects for large peak flows and even an increasing effect size with increasing return interval alila et al 2009 green and alila 2012 kuraś et al 2012 yu and alila 2019 it is unclear how findings in these landscapes apply to those found in low relief glaciated regions such as those found in central north america russia and scandinavia further catchments at these northern latitudes are expected to be especially sensitive to climate change due to their highly climate dependent and seasonal hydrologic cycle tetzlaff et al 2015 2013 when examining peak flows changes between control and treatment catchments may manifest in several ways such as changes in flood magnitude probability of occurrence or a change in the type of precipitation event associated with the largest flow events e g rainfall vs snowmelt a shift in the seasonality and phase of the driving precipitation event has important ramifications for understanding flood generation and catchment processes producing high flows as these may be different for snowmelt versus rainfall events for example post harvest changes in hydrology in snowmelt dominated and snowmelt influenced catchments have the potential to increase peak flows even for large infrequent events due to catchment hydrologic processes e g increased catchment saturation alterations in soil thermodynamics freezing and infiltration at the time of snowmelt increased snowpack snow water equivalent etc murray and buttle 2003 pomeroy et al 1994 possible shifts in catchment processes in response to harvest highlight the need for statistical methods that offer flexibility to evaluate the temporal structure of the statistical model of peak discharges the integration of nonstationary representation of flood generation and flood frequency analysis methods offers a more detailed framework compared to previously used methods allowing inference about how peak flow magnitudes and frequencies change in response to forest cover and climatic changes through time at the small catchment scale yu and alila 2019 further use of bayesian methods to frame peak flow analysis in a probabilistic framework allows for uncertainty to be easily calculated in context of the models fitted to observations and our background or prior knowledge about the system we quantified the effect of forest cover change on flood and peak flows in two sets of paired catchments at the marcell experimental forest mef in north central minnesota usa in order to test the hypotheses that clearcutting will increase annual peak flows across all return intervals compared to pre harvest mature forest conditions and that annual peak flows will decrease with time since harvest as the forest regrows additionally we examined consistency of results and implications for the effects of harvesting on floods by comparing our nonstationary flood frequency analysis with traditional paired catchment ancova methods 2 methods 2 1 study sites the mef catchment studies were initiated by the u s forest service in 1961 to investigate the hydrologic and ecological role of peatlands in the boreal temperate transition zone fig 1 a each of six small 100 ha upland peatland experimental catchments named s1 s6 consists of an upland forest surrounding a central peatland from which drains a first order stream fig 1b aspen populus spp and northern hardwoods dominate the uplands while black spruce picea mariana and tamarack larix laricina dominate the central peatlands the mef is located on a moraine where multiple ice sub lobes terminated over the course of the last glaciation 26 12 ka bp verry and janssens 2011 upland soils are alfisols or entisols and generally have a clay loam texture with histosols in the peatlands nyberg 1987 the climate is continental with moist warm summers and dry cold winters sebestyen et al 2011a the mean annual precipitation from 1961 to 2009 was 78 cm 11 cm standard deviation and the annual mean temperature was 3 4 c 13 c sebestyen et al 2011a about one third of annual precipitation falls as snow between november and march no significant change was found in annual precipitation or maximum annual snow water equivalent swe under black spruce canopy and in treeless open areas from 1961 to 2009 sebestyen et al 2011a annual maximum swe did decrease under aspen during this same time period sebestyen et al 2011a previous work has quantified some effects of clearcutting and forest regrowth on peak discharges at the mef from two long term paired catchment experiments however the full distribution of annual maximum discharge in response to forest harvesting and recovery has not been analyzed previous studies largely summarized by sebestyen et al 2011b and verry et al 1983 included 1 ancova analyses to separately analyze rainfall and snowmelt derived peaks sebesteyen et al 2011b verry et al 1983 2 a frequency comparison up to the 10 year return interval discharge for rainfall generated peaks only verry et al 1983 and 3 physically based modeling of catchment response to harvest using the peatland hydrologic impact model phim see guertin et al 1987 lu 1994 the phim modeling study used flood frequency analysis of simulated values of separated snowmelt and rainfall peaks for the s4 s5 mef clearcutting experiment s4 s5 experiment detailed in section 2 1 2 lu 1994 with results supporting the paradigm of decreasing effect size with increasing return interval in contrast verry et al 1983 found the 10 year recurrence interval of summer rainfall generated peak discharge after clearcutting increased more than the 2 year summer rainfall generated peak discharge the response across the entire range of recurrence intervals was not included in this study we examined nonstationary probability distributions of annual peak streamflow for rainfall and snowmelt generated annual peaks and compared the results to traditional ancova methods using long term data from two paired catchment experiments at the mef 2 1 1 s4 s5 experiment the s4 s5 experiment began with catchment instrumentation in 1962 the control catchment s5 is 52 6 ha in size and includes uplands and five small satellite wetlands draining into the 6 1 ha central peatland the treatment catchment s4 is 34 0 ha in size with an 8 1 ha central peatland clearcut harvest of merchantable timber in the s4 uplands took place over two sequential fall winter seasons 1970 71 1971 72 with final removal of non merchantable timber in summer 1972 aspen regenerated on the upland harvest areas and received fertilizer application according to an intentional study design in 1978 sebestyen et al 2011a the regenerated aspen forest was considered mature 40 years after harvesting based on commercial rotations in the great lakes region bradford and kastendick 2010 the s4 watershed straddles the laurentian divide approximately 70 of its annual water yield drains north to the hudson bay outlet s4n and 30 drains south to the mississippi outlet s4s sebestyen et al 2011b streamflow was measured using several gaging structures since 1962 including flumes and weirs all stage data were recorded on stripcharts which were then digitized and converted to streamflow using stage discharge relationships sebestyen et al 2020b supplemental information section 1 previous analyses of peak flows from the s4 catchment have only included the s4n outlet for this analysis we used the combined discharge values s4s s4n to identify the total annual maximum peak flow from the s4 catchment sebestyen et al 2020b annual maximum flow series were derived by taking the highest discharge value within each water year which was defined as march 1 february 28 29 2 1 2 s2 s6 experiment the pretreatment period in the s2 s6 experiment began in 1976 with a four year calibration period between catchments the control catchment s2 is 9 7 ha in size which includes a 3 2 ha central peatland the treatment catchment s6 is 8 9 ha in size with a 2 0 ha central peatland in march june of 1980 the aspen uplands in the treatment catchment were clearcut harvested with 77 of the catchment area harvested during the summers from june of 1980 to 1982 aspen regeneration was suppressed with grazing in may of 1983 red pine pinus resinosa and white spruce picea glauca were planted in the clearcut area with 70 of the upland area in red pine and 30 in white spruce annual maximum flow series were derived by taking the highest discharge value within each water year which was defined as march 1 february 28 29 2 2 general approach three statistical methods were used to detect differences in annual maximum flows due to forest harvesting and regrowth in each of the paired catchment experiments the first method traditional linear regression extended previous approaches at the mef to examine differences in annual maximum flow magnitude e g sebestyen et al 2011b the second method which we termed a coupling analysis utilized logistic regression analyses with parameters estimated using a bayesian method the coupling analysis was designed to determine the probability that the annual maximum flow in any given year was generated 1 by the same precipitation event on the control and treatment catchments and 2 within the same season on the control and treatment catchments finally we utilized nonstationary flood frequency models of the annual maximum streamflow series fit to observed data using a bayesian technique to explore differences in the entire probability distribution of annual maximum peak flow magnitudes across return intervals the final analysis supported inferences about how flood magnitude and probability of occurrence change due to forest harvesting and regrowth these three statistical approaches combine to offer complementary insights into the effects of forest cover change on the peak discharge magnitude occurrence probability and generating event seasonality 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1 linear regression the effects of different catchment treatments were assessed using least squares ancova regression analysis in which treatment and control catchment annual maximum discharge series were assumed to be related through a linear relationship slope and intercept effects were determined for pre and post treatment time periods table 1 following sebestyen et al 2011b models included a normally distributed error term with a constant residual variance per standard ancova methods we detected outliers in both s4 s5 and s2 s6 experiment data through standardized residual and residual versus leverage plots and used a generalized least squares approach gls to prevent the disproportionate influence of those outliers the gls approach is identical to least squares ancova except it introduces a residual variance that linearly increases with the observed control catchment annual maximum flow gls allows for a looser relationship between the control and treatment catchments during higher flow events and thus reduces the influence of high flow outliers ancova analyses were conducted using r version 3 6 2 r core team 2019 using the base ordinary least squares regression function lm and the generalized least squares regression function gls found in the nlme package pinheiro et al 2019 2 3 2 coupling analysis control and treatment catchment annual maximum discharges may be generated due to different events and or in different seasons and thus become decoupled in any given year decoupling takes two forms event decoupling and seasonal decoupling event decoupling occurs in a given year when the control and treatment catchments have their annual maximum flows due to different events in that year i e different rainfall events different snowmelt events or one snowmelt and one rainfall in any given year the annual maximum flows were event decoupled if the date of annual maximum flow on the treatment and control catchments were greater than seven days apart based on an inspection of annual maximum flow hydrographs and mef precipitation data supplemental information section 2 the seven day threshold was chosen from a visual inspection of discharge records which showed discharge generally decayed to approximately pre event levels between sequential peaks greater than seven days apart see supplemental information section 2 further the daily precipitation record at the mef indicates the median number of consecutive days with measureable precipitation was 2 1 4 days standard deviation sebestyen et al 2020c these considerations indicate that most precipitation events at the mef are relatively short such that stormflow peaks occurring greater than 7 days apart on control and treatment catchments were likely triggered by different events rather than differences in runoff from the same precipitation event a binary event decoupling series was created by denoting event decoupled years with 1 and coupled years with 0 we define seasonal decoupling as the condition when annual maximum flows on the control and treatment catchments occurred in different seasons within a given water year mef field collected snowpack data support the importance of seasonal snowpack melt in the months of march and april for streamflow sebestyen et al 2020a snowpack depth and water equivalent are measured at snowcourses starting in february and continuing every two weeks until the course is free of snow sebestyen et al 2020a based on previous work and mef precipitation data we defined a spring peak in march or april versus a summer peak between june and november the month of may was considered a transitional month because the dominant precipitation phase is rain however catchments tend to be high in saturation from snowmelt a year was considered seasonally decoupled if one catchment had a march april spring peak and the other catchment had a june to november summer peak the binary seasonal decoupling series was created by denoting seasonally decoupled years with 1 and coupled years with 0 to determine the probability of event and seasonal decoupling we analyzed the observed binary decoupling series within pretreatment and multiple post treatment time periods table 1 for both catchment experiments using logistic regression with parameters estimated through a bayesian technique shown in equation 1 1 decouple d i b e r n o u l l i p g l o g i t p g b g the probability of decoupling in year i in the time series block g for each block g in table 1 is pg which corresponds to a log odds or logit log pg 1 pg of bg we use bayesian based markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling gelman and rubin 1992 to generate a full probabilistic estimate for bg conditioned on the observed binary series we implemented the jags just another gibbs sampler algorithm plummer 2003 with the r2jags package su and yajima 2015 in r for mcmc sampling to test whether the decoupling probability pg increases due to treatment we determined the proportion of mcmc samples that predict the decoupling probability for each post treatment time period pg to be less than in the pretreatment period ppretreatment this proportion then corresponds to a type s error probability or the probability of erroneously concluding that ppretreatment pg where g pretreatment gelman et al 2012 gelman and tuerlinckx 2000 we can claim with 1 pvalue 100 confidence that the probability of control and treatment annual maximum flows occurring due to independent precipitation events or within different seasons in any given year increases due to treatment 2 3 3 flood frequency analysis 2 3 3 1 choice of distribution we used a bayesian approach to fit observed annual maximum flow to the generalized extreme value gev distribution which has the following cumulative distribution function for the annual maximum discharge q 2 f q μ σ ξ e x p 1 ξ q μ σ 1 ξ ξ 0 e x p e x p q μ σ ξ 0 after estimating parameters for equation 2 using mcmc we sampled across different probabilities of occurrence to estimate annual maximum flow magnitudes at given return intervals as in flood frequency analysis gumbel 1941 to capture nonstationarities we developed time evolving estimates of the location parameter μ possible range of to and scale parameter σ possible range of 0 to the shape parameter ξ possible range of to however the mean of the gev for ξ 1 was held stationary due to the narrow range of ξ for which the gev has a finite thus physically plausible mean our narrow range of ξ is consistent with other nonstationary flood frequency analyses of paired catchment data yu and alila 2019 the resulting nonstationary gev models applied to treatment and control catchments were then compared to detect treatment effects more details on the selection and fit of gev models are provided in the supplemental information fig s1 including comparison results in table s1 2 3 3 2 nonstationary parameter evolution nonstationary models require a defined form for parameter trends through time koutsoyiannis 2011 to capture the alterations in upland forest cover in each of the two catchment experiments we developed the temporal trend structures shown in fig 2 for the location and scale parameters μ and σ of the gev distribution eq 2 the shape parameter ξ for the gev distribution was held constant in time bayesian based mcmc sampling with the jags algorithm plummer 2003 in the r2jags package su and yajima 2015 was implemented to estimate the needed hyper parameters associated with μ and σ and stationary ξ models for the treatment and control watersheds using annual maximum flow observations fig 2 the advantage of the bayesian based mcmc approach is that it provides full posterior distribution estimates of the hyper parameters which incorporate in a statistically consistent way both constraints from the maximum flow observations as well as prior information represented by prior probability distributions about the hyper parameters based on previous knowledge of the site and or physical limitations smith and roberts 1993 for s4 s5 the general structure of the nonstationary model for the gev location and scale parameters μ and σ is assumed to follow a piecewise linear trend with time t water year during its regrowth period based on

were found 16 years after harvest sebestyen et al 2011b verry 2004 1986 verry et al 1983 the 16 year recovery was based on considerations of aspen growth rate and crown formation perala and verry 2011 and previous discharge regression analyses at mef showing that snowmelt associated peaks remained above pre harvest conditions for 15 years after harvest verry 2004 thus our mcmc calculations included a moderately informative prior distribution for the tr consisting of a discrete approximation of a normal distribution centered on the 16th year after harvesting 1988 in s4 with a standard deviation of two years a discrete approximation of the normal distribution was used to represent the recovery year to an integer year post harvest because the time step of the input data was one year the shape parameter was constrained between 0 and 1 and all other prior distributions were set as noninformative for more information on choice of prior distributions see the supplemental information section 3 for the s2 s6 experiment we modeled the location and scale parameters μ and σ of the gev distribution with a piecewise linear model with time t calendar year that includes stationary values in the pretreatment time period 1976 1979 different stationary values during upland grazing 1981 1983 decreasing values through time after conifer planting 1984 until the recovery year tr and a third set of

al 2011b and a two year standard deviation for information on the noninformative prior distributions used for all other hyperparameters see the supplemental information section 3 2 3 3 3 treatment effects a linear regression equation was fit to pre treatment observations for each catchment pair in order to parameterize the relationship between annual maximum series in the treatment and control catchments while isolating the non climatic biophysical differences between them similar to alila et al 2009 this regression was the same ancova form explained in section 2 3 1 fit only in the pretreatment time period we then applied the regression equation to the post treatment time cpostt control catchment annual maximum flow to predict the expected annual maximum flow series in the treatment catchment had the treatment not occurred t postt 5 t postt i b 0 b 1 c postt i where i is the time index during the post treatment period and b0 and b1 are coefficients estimated using pre treatment observations the full time series of annual maximum flow in the treatment catchment had the treatment not occurred from the pre treatment time through the post treatment time period is then represented by the concatenation of the pre treatment observations and t p o s t t i the concatenated time series is represented as t i parameters b0 and b1 in equation 5 were determined using bayesian based mcmc sampling with the jags package in r to acknowledge uncertainty in the coefficient estimates and retain consistency with the parameter probabilistic treatment seventy mcmc samples of b0 and b1 representing 70 possible parameter sets given the observed maximum flows were used to generate 70 possible series of t i as an uncertainty range of the expected annual maximum flow on the treatment catchment had treatment not occurred each of the 70 expected annual maximum flow series was then used as data to fit nonstationary gev distributions used for treatment catchments equations 3 and 4 expected results for the no treatment cases were compared to the observed with treatment case in order to draw inferences about harvest and regrowth effects hence utilizing the catchment pairing to control for climate covariates we note that the number of series examined was limited to 70 due to the computational burden of fitting each nonstationary gev model to the data using mcmc when equation 5 predicted negative annual maximum discharges for s6 0 was used as the predicted annual maximum discharge this circumstance happened on average 2 3 years within the 40 year long expected annual maximum flow series for s6 random samples from the posterior densities for location μ scale σ and shape ξ parameters in the time periods of interest were taken to construct 100 000 cumulative distribution functions for the expected and observed gev model fits eqns 3 and 4 in order to evaluate differences in annual maximum flow across return intervals effects of harvest were inferred for each treatment pair through comparison of the distribution functions during specific time intervals observed with treatment and expected no treatment models eqn 3 were compared across s4 s5 for the year 1972 when the treatment effect of harvesting was largest for the s2 s6 experiment a similar comparison was constructed for the time interval after clearcutting and during grazing 1981 1983 further conifer conversion effect was inferred through observed and expected model comparison between 2000 and 2016 after conifer canopy closure on the treatment catchment expected control and observed treatment cumulative distribution functions for return intervals n 1 5 to 50 years were compared through finding the proportion of the treatment cumulative distribution functions that are greater or less than the expected cumulative distribution functions as a type s error probability for each return interval gelman and tuerlinckx 2000 which represents the chance of incorrectly concluding that the n year peak flow has increased or decreased when they have in fact decreased increased or stayed the same 3 results 3 1 ancova gls ancova results for the s4 s5 experiment did not show any post treatment slopes or intercepts different than the pretreatment time period all p 0 10 including in the decade immediately following upland harvesting p 0 47 for intercept p 0 26 for

addition to the ordinary least squares ols regression due to detected outliers in the ols gls results concurred with ols indicating no statistical differences of slopes or intercepts in the post treatment time periods compared to pretreatment all p 0 25 ancova results for the s2 s6 experiment showed a significant decrease in regression slopes for the growing forest and closed canopy conifer conditions compared to the pretreatment time period p 0 001 and 0 004 respectively but no significant difference between the open young forest and pretreatment time periods fig 3b our ancova results on s2 s6 concur with previous work that found decreases in peak flows after conversion to conifer species sebestyen et al 2011b however residuals versus leverage plots revealed outliers and regression slopes corresponding to the growing forest and closed canopy time periods were no longer significantly different from pretreatment p 0 15 and p 0 46 respectively when using gls the gls regression was a better fit according to diagnostic plots such as residuals versus fitted and residuals versus leverage plots 3 2 coupling analysis harvest induced a greater probability of the annual maximum flow being due to different independent events 7 days apart on control and treatment catchments event decoupling is captured in the logistic regression results for s4 s5 and s2 s6 table 2 fig 4 a and 4c the same general trend is seen in both experiments but we are only 90 confident for the s4 s5 experiment furthermore harvest induced a greater probability of seasonal decoupling in the s4 s5 experiment fig 4b table 2 seasonal decoupling occurred in twelve years of the fifty four year s4 s5 record with 11 of those years occurring after harvest in ten of these post harvest seasonal decoupling years s4 had a summer peak and s5 had a spring peak seasonal decoupling was rarely observed for the s2 s6 experiment only two times in the 41 year record so seasonal decoupling analysis was not implemented for the s2 s6 experiment 3 3 flood frequency analysis 3 3 1 s4 s5 experiment flood frequency analysis in the pretreatment calibration regression equation 5 expected annual maximum discharge on s4 given the annual maximum flow on s5 had an intercept estimate of 0 695 95 credible interval 0 108 to 1 475 and a slope estimate of 1 288 95 credible interval 0 311 to 1 752 overall r2 0 32 expected values and their credible intervals and the raw treatment annual maximum series are shown in fig 5 a the n year discharge increased in the first year after cutting compared to the expected discharge if the harvest had not occurred fig 6 we have between 80 and 85 confidence in discharge increases for return intervals 10 years type s p 0 20 whereas we have only 30 confidence for an increase in the 1 5 year discharge fig 6b our results indicate a greater treatment effect for larger discharges averaged across all return intervals we have 80 confidence that annual maximum flows increased with increasing confidence for increases at larger return intervals p 0 16 for the 50 year annual maximum flow further the increases in annual maximum flows for each return interval stem largely from an increase in the scale σ p 0 27 and shape ξ p 0 19 parameters due to harvesting table 3 the shape parameter controls the heavy tailedness of the distribution of annual maximum flows for the entire s4 treatment record the shape parameter equaled 0 40 versus 0 20 on the entire record of the expected conditions had harvest not occurred indicating that treatment induced greater probability of very high annual maximum flows even after recovery of the location and scale parameters to pretreatment values on the treatment catchment the larger shape parameter for the treatment catchment causes larger annual maximum flows than what was expected in the absence of treatment with 88 confidence from the 10 to the 50 year return interval annual maximum flow our results indicate that post harvest changes in annual maximum flows may be driven largely by changes to the variability of annual maximum flows as the location parameter related to mean flow potentially even decreased p 0 33 we are more confident in increases to the scale parameter related to variance p 0 26 and the shape parameter related to the probability and variance of large annual maximum flows p 0 19 for expected and observed posterior densities for location scale and shape see fig s2 the recovery year for location and scale parameters is relatively unchanged from our moderately informative prior distribution based on model results we are 90 confident that recovery of the location and scale parameters to pretreatment conditions occurs between 12 and 18 years after harvest the shape parameter was held stationary within each model fit eqn 3 however we obtained different shape values when gev models were fit for expected versus observed time series p 0 19 eqn 3 the difference in shape parameter indicates that the shape parameter may have increased with forest harvesting and was therefore in truth nonstationary thus we do not know when overall recovery happened because we only assumed location and scale were nonstationary within each individual model and we have no means of testing when the shape parameter returned to what we would expect in the absence of treatment our results indicate high confidence 88 89 that annual maximum peak flows were higher on the treatment catchment than what would be expected in the absence of treatment even after recovery of the location and scale parameters there is no way to investigate when recovery of the shape parameter occurred if at all within our modeling framework 3 3 2 s2 s6 flood frequency analysis post treatment annual maximum discharges on the control catchment were adjusted according to the calibration regression fig 5b which had an intercept of 0 120 95 credible interval 0 649 to 0 409 and a slope of 1 324 95 credible interval 1 106 to 1 550 for reference overall r2 0 99 we did not find an increase in the annual maximum flow immediately following clearcut when the treatment effect should be highest based on equation 4 fig 7 a 7b across the cumulative distribution function all p values were between 0 35 and 0 45 up to the 50 year return interval fig 7b location scale and shape parameters stayed the same table 3 fig s3 there was also no effect of conifer conversion on the annual maximum flow for the s6 catchment fig 7c 7d here testing for a hypothesized decrease in annual maximum flows we are not confident in any of the modeled decreases in the annual maximum flow across return intervals up to the 50 year event with p being about 0 35 under the 10 year return interval discharge event but going up to 0 5 for larger discharge events indicating that we have no more confidence that flows decreased than we do that flows increased due to conifer conversion fig 7d location scale and shape parameters stayed the same unlike for s4 s5 we do not have evidence that the shape parameter was nonstationary table 3 the recovery of the location and scale parameters to a new stationary state after conifer planting was heavily influenced by our semi informative prior which centered recovery around canopy closure 17 years after conifer planting however because no effects of upland clearcutting or canopy conversion were found recovery year has little meaning 4 discussion 4 1 ancova gls based on the ancova and gls regression analyses no significant increases were found for annual maximum flows in the time periods directly after upland clearcut harvest when the uplands were in open young forest conditions compared to the pretreatment time period fig 3 this finding contrasts with previous ancova results that have found significant effects of harvesting on snowmelt and rainfall caused peaks for the s4 experiment verry et al 1983 several factors may explain this discrepancy between past studies and our results including 1 the longer time period of record in our analysis 2 our use of both s4n and s4s gauges to compute total annual maximum discharge on s4 and 3 our examination of the annual maximum discharge including both rainfall and snowmelt events further gls was not previously utilized 4 2 coupling analysis we observed significant event and seasonal decoupling on the s4 s5 pair in a given year seasonal decoupling was generally associated with streamflow generating processes that differed for control and treatment catchments summer annual maximum flows result directly from rainfall events in past mef research march and april high flows were generally associated with snowmelt sebestyen et al 2011b verry et al 1983 with the two week resolution of snowpack data however it remains unclear if individual march april peaks are due to snowmelt rain on snow or rain on a snowmelt saturated catchment two week data on snow depth and snow water equivalent do however support our assertions that every year does include measureable snowpack and snowpack melt largely occurs in march and april hence we can generalize that any annual maximum peak occurring in march or april is influenced by snowmelt but possibly triggered by rain on snow or also influenced somehow by rain whereas any annual maximum flow occurring after may 30 is due to summer rainfall thus the seasonal decoupling observed in s4 s5 likely reflects a regime shift in the annual peak streamflow generating process after harvesting for s4 with peaks for s4 shifting from a snowmelt influenced to a rainfall dominated process decoupling likely accounts for differences between our results and those of previous studies annual maximum discharge from the catchments is not the same as individual examinations of spring and summer peaks that have been analyzed previously verry et al 1983 sebestyen et al 2011b in our analysis peak discharge on control and treatment watersheds was decoupled at times hence not chronologically paired previous ancova analysis of paired catchment data at the mef and elsewhere relied on chronological pairing of events such that peaks generated during the same event were compared on control and treatment catchments the significant event and seasonal decoupling in the s4 s5 pair calls into question the appropriateness of chronological pairing of annual maximum flows as early as the pre treatment period catchment pairs had a non zero probability of event decoupling table 2 event decoupling was linked to open vs forest condition with a post harvest increase in both the s4 s5 and s6 s2 pairs followed by a decrease towards preharvest levels as forest cover recovered fig 4a 4c table 2 event decoupling was not related to the cover type of the regrowing forest the incidence of event decoupling for s6 with closed canopy conifer uplands compared to deciduous cover on s2 during the same time period is no greater than in the pretreatment time period when both s2 and s6 had deciduous cover p 0 563 thus canopy conversion from deciduous to coniferous does not cause event decoupling the s4 s5 experiment showed evidence of seasonal decoupling where s4 was more likely to have a summer annual maximum flow while s5 was more likely to be a spring annual maximum flow fig s4 in the first decade following harvest seven of ten of the s4 annual maximum flows occurred in the summer while only three of ten occurred in the summer on s5 seasonal decoupling was not observed significantly on s2 s6 only two of the forty years of record had seasonal decoupling which was too few instances upon which to fit a logistic regression the seasonal decoupling of s4 s5 is possibly due to internal subtle differences between the treatment s4 and control s5 catchments that were exacerbated by harvest for example s5 has 5 small satellite wetlands within the upland rim that act as distributed catchment storage in addition to the central peatland s4 does not have these upland wetlands this difference may cause s4 to be more responsive to summer rainfall events than s5 harvest may have exacerbated these preexisting differences in catchment processing of flood peaks 4 3 flood frequency analysis the nonstationary flood frequency analysis based on the immediate post harvest year indicated increases in annual maximum flows up to the 50 year return interval within the s4 catchment in the first year after harvest fig 6 the effect size of the harvest increased with increasing peak flow return interval fig 6 broadly the increases in annual maximum flows are consistent with previous results that showed increases in snowmelt caused peak discharges for 15 years and rainfall caused peak discharges for 7 years after harvesting for the s4 experiment verry 2004 sebesteyen et al 2011b further when verry et al 1983 compared stationary flood frequency distributions for pre versus post treatment rainfall peaks for s4 versus s5 they found the 10 year rainfall caused annual maximum discharge increased more than the 2 year discharge in the decade after harvesting the seasonal decoupling between s4 and s5 discussed in section 4 3 further elucidates the findings of verry et al 1983 when only rainfall peaks were compared the annual maximum from s5 which tended to be in the spring and associated with snowmelt was not included we found an increasing effect size of forest harvesting for events at increasing event return intervals which is similar to previous mef work verry et al 1983 our results indicate that in the first year after harvest the 2 year discharge was effectively the same on the harvested s4 catchment versus expected conditions 2 98 cfs versus 3 08 cfs while the 50 year discharge approximately doubles from 16 5 cfs to 32 5 cfs despite increasing uncertainty at larger return intervals our confidence in the presence of an effect on peak flows remains relatively constant from the 10 year to the 50 year discharge at about 80 85 fig 6b thus our results do not match the paradigm of decreasing effect size with increasing return interval that has been largely derived from paired catchment studies in western north american catchments with very different landscapes and ecosystems e g thomas megahan 1998 buttle 2011 one meta analysis of paired catchments using both ancova based and flood frequency based methods supported a generally decreasing effect size of harvest with increasing discharge return interval but one catchment pair in the analysis showed increasing effect size with increasing return interval bathurst et al 2020 this finding may have been due to road construction in this catchment pair bathurst et al 2020 although s4 does have proportionally more forest roads than s5 forest roads and major skid trails occupied less than 2 of the catchment area after harvesting likely not explaining the peak flow increases verry et al 1983 for the first year after harvest fig 6 we have between 80 and 86 confidence in the flow increases due to forest harvesting however our confidence in flow increases is 88 for large discharge events after recovery of the location and scale parameters due to an increased shape parameter further our results of increasing effect size with increasing return interval is consistent with recent flood frequency analyses of paired catchment data in western north america alila et al 2009 green alila 2012 yu alila 2019 and is consistent with the flood frequency analysis of rainfall peaks at the mef done by verry et al 1983 the effect of harvest on large return interval events was heavily influenced by the difference in the gev model shape parameter on the treatment watershed this shape parameter was held constant within each gev model of annual maximum flow however when fit to the annual maximum flow series on treated s4 it was larger than when fit to the 70 series of expected conditions had treatment not occurred the difference in shape parameter value for expected versus observed treatment models caused the increases in annual maximum peak flows to be present in the first year after harvesting further increases in the annual maximum flow after the recovery of location and scale parameters on s4 are evident with high confidence 88 it should be noted that three of the four largest discharge events on s4 1999 2002 and 2011 occurred after the hypothesized 16 year recovery estimate for location and scale parameters and were all in response to rainfall in june or july of these three peaks that occurred greater than 16 years after harvest two were above the 90 credible interval for the expected value based on the pretreatment calibration 1999 and 2011 fig 5 shape parameters related to the tail of the annual maximum flow distribution may thus be nonstationary and sensitive to forest harvesting contrary to our initial assumption and that of others e g yu and alila 2019 however fitting a nonstationary structure to all three parameters on 54 years of data would rapidly increase the ratio of parameters per data point decreasing the usefulness of such models it is noteworthy that the flood frequency analysis indicated high confidence for the effect of harvest for the s4 s5 experiment but not for the s2 s6 experiment where our confidence in annual maximum flow changes largely ranged between 55 and 65 however the investigation of the s2 s6 experiment is hindered by a short preharvest time period 4 years which may have been inadequate for detecting a difference due to harvesting and conversion loftis et al 2001 sebestyen et al 2011b the annual maximum flow record for s2 s6 is shorter than for s4 s5 and more parameters were necessary to model s2 s6 compared to s4 s5 due to the grazing treatment on s6 prior to forest regrowth and conversion to a different upland species fig 2 this increased model complexity resulted in greater uncertainty for parameter estimates we also consider the possibility that there truly was no effect of harvesting or conversion unlike for s4 we did not have strong evidence of seasonal decoupling for the s2 s6 experiment which may indicate that s4 passed some hydrologic threshold due to disturbance while s6 did not nonlinear and threshold processes have been observed in northern headwater catchments in which there are disproportional runoff responses to forcing inputs ali et al 2015 thresholds have been invoked for explaining increases in large peak flows and a sensitive upper tail for extreme value distributions alila et al 2009 in one threshold based investigation of a forest regenerating after disturbance the threshold in the rainfall stormflow relationship associated with rapid stormflow response did not change with forest regrowth but the magnitude of stormflow response to precipitation decreased as the forest regrew wei et al 2020 watershed shape could also play a role in the divergent results between catchment pairs s6 has an elongated shape in contrast to s4 which is more circular and has two outlets fig 1 more elongated watersheds tend to have relatively lower peak flows black 1972 the peatland is also more centrally located within the catchment in s6 than s4 fig 1 which could contribute to its ability to dampen peak flows out of the catchment finally catchment differences within individual pairs may have contributed to the different flood frequency findings in each experiment as harvesting was found to exacerbate preexisting differences in these catchments via seasonal decoupling for example the control catchment s5 includes 5 small satellite wetlands within the uplands in addition to its central peatland the preexisting differences in s4 s5 that may have contributed to our findings were not present with the s2 s6 pair no effect of canopy conversion from deciduous to coniferous upland species on the annual maximum flow was found in the flood frequency analysis of the s2 s6 experiment uncertainty with low pretreatment sample size and number of parameters versus number of datapoints apply similarly to these results given this uncertainty we note that the observed cumulative distribution function tended to decrease across all return intervals which is the hypothesized direction of effect i e conifer cover decreases flood peaks fig 7c 7d the ancova analysis supported significant decreases in peak flows while the conifer forest grew and after canopy closure but once the effects of high flow outliers were dampened using gls regression the significance of these decreases disappeared the annual maximum flow on both s2 and s6 was relatively low for the last decade of record 2006 2016 reflecting a prolonged period of relatively low flow fig 5 this period of low flow coinciding roughly with conifer canopy closure did not offer much data on how larger or medium sized peak flows respond to canopy conversion for a bulk of the closed canopy conifer conditions in our analysis this caused larger flows that did occur in the closed canopy period to exert stronger influence on the regression as outliers it is important to consider the limitations inherent in any investigation of flooding effects of land use limitations in our study include inherent factors in the paired catchment design e g past harvest treatment pairings etc because of increasing complexity and different flood generation mechanisms at larger scales it is unclear how these results apply for catchments at larger spatial scales blöschl 2006 rogger et al 2017 both experiments were partial clearcuts 75 of catchment area on only the upland portion of the catchments the unharvested forested wetlands occupy significant catchment area and tend to attenuate flooding effects detenbeck et al 2005 significant portions of the harvests were also in the winter on frozen soils to reduce soil impacts and erosion furthermore catchments were rapidly revegetated leaving few years of open conditions on the uplands from which to derive inferences about the effects of open canopy conditions on peak flows for example the s4 clearcut was staggered between 1970 and 1972 and before the upland clearcut on s4 was complete in 1972 the upland portion previously cut had measureable regeneration with 41 000 stems ha that were 2 m tall verry et al 1983 it may take several years for altered hydrology to equilibrate to a new stationary state after conversion to open conditions brown et al 2005 thus there are potentially only several years of a transient state in between mature forest and recovery conditions for investigating these effects the transient state of the effect of forest cover change is reflected in the large uncertainty bounds in nonstationary models use of a calibration period provided another source of uncertainty because of the relatively short calibration periods in the paired catchment design 10 years we assumed that the relationship between the control and treatment catchments would have been stationary if the treatment had not occurred additionally some expected values were extrapolated from the pretreatment calibration regression despite uncertainty about how the calibration regressions may apply to these larger extrapolated discharges changes in peak flow from the calibration period expected conditions are attributed solely to treatment i e climate and biophysical differences between control and treatment catchments are encapsulated in a simple calibration equation thus we attributed changes in flood frequency to changes in forest cover as opposed to any other factor such as rainfall frequency or changes in the control catchment as the forest aged however if the climate regime and or weather patterns shift the pretreatment calibration might not hold the selection and appropriateness of a pretreatment calibration regression controlling for the biophysical differences in control and treatment catchments across the range of observed climatic conditions remains a large tenant in the paired catchment study design that has been debated for years both criticized renne 1967 zégre et al 2010 and defended hewlett et al 1969 neary 2016 to incorporate our uncertainty about the calibration regressions we sampled across 70 different slopes and intercepts fit with the calibration regressions this incorporation of uncertainty in the calibration period is a considerable improvement to remedy issues of calibration uncertainty however some uncertainty about the calibration and its application for high flow regimes remains by virtue of the paired catchment study design 5 implications for analysis of paired catchment studies several important ramifications for paired catchment studies of the forest peak flow relationship were revealed by this study ongoing disagreements about the effects of forest cover on flooding often stem from the statistical lens used to look at the question we find it critical to articulate the benefits and limitations of various methods clearly define the inference space for which the methods are valid and relate statistical inference space to a physical inference space first methods that incorporate the probabilistic nature of peak flows are critical for finding differences due to landscape change such as the nonstationary flood frequency framework in our study increased use of probabilistic flood frequency methods allows researchers to explicitly make inferences about effects of forest harvesting across multiple return intervals which is not possible for traditional anova ancova analyses next ancova is highly sensitive to high flow outliers which may not be adequately remedied through relaxing the constant residual variance assumption in the gls analysis because our flood frequency model of s4 s5 indicated that flow increases after forest harvesting can manifest as a change in occurrence probability for large flows i e increase in shape parameter it is critical to use a method that is robust to high flow outliers and associated uncertainties such as a probabilistic framework our results underscore the importance of seasonal and event coupling in the assessment of forest harvest effects on peak flow peak coupling also called chronological pairing is assumed in ancova but not in flood frequency analysis the event and seasonal decoupling we found in the s4 s5 analysis highlights this important consideration in paired catchment data analysis the lack of chronological pairing for annual maximum flows likely explains the poor relationships between these discharges on control and treatment catchments in our ancova gls analyses the assumption of event coupling does not hold simply because the catchments are similar in size and physically adjacent methods robust to potential changes in pairing relationships should be further developed and utilized when analyzing paired catchment data our coupling analysis illustrates the importance of analyzing the probabilistic distribution of peak flows as well as subtle changes in seasonality that can manifest as large changes at the tails of extreme value distributions seasonal decoupling particularly in catchments that receive both snow and rain could further indicate differences in runoff generation and internal catchment processes between the paired catchments in some catchments for example mountain catchments that reliably have snowmelt derived peaks every year alila et al 2009 chronological pairing of annual maximum peaks may be possible however we found that harvesting may induce or enhance an alteration in the individual event and in some cases the event seasonality and therefore flow generating process that produces the annual maximum flow we hypothesize the mef is more likely than several western north american catchment pairs to experience seasonal decoupling due to its physiography and climate and that other boreal temperate transition catchments may be more sensitive to this decoupling response to harvest as the climate warms 6 conclusion no significant effect of forest harvesting on annual maximum flows was found using ancova gls or a nonstationary flood frequency model of s2 s6 for which there were only 4 years of pretreatment data however increases in annual maximum flows across all return intervals were supported confidence 80 85 for the s4 clearcut and aspen regeneration experiment according to nonstationary flood frequency analysis ancova based methods were not adequate to fully investigate the effect of forest harvesting because annual maximum flows decoupled after harvest and tended to occur in different seasons likely due to different streamflow generating processes snowmelt associated versus rainfall thus even if flood magnitude and frequency may or may not be changed by harvesting the precipitation event associated with the annual maximum flow may change our study demonstrates the value of using a probabilistic framework to investigate changes in peak flows this method can support inferences about harvesting effects for specific return intervals instead of being limited to differences in means i e linear models increases in annual maximum flows after forest harvesting got larger with increasing return interval for the s4 s5 experiment which indicates that if this effect truly occurred it was not limited to small discharge events as is the typical paradigm more investigation is needed particularly pairing computational physically based models with bayesian parameter estimation methods to minimize uncertainty about the form of nonstationarity introduced by harvesting and to gain more physically based insight into this effect credit authorship contribution statement zachary p mceachran conceptualization methodology software validation

4676,forest harvest climate change and their interaction can alter catchment peak discharges which have ramifications for channel geomorphology and water quality catchments in the boreal temperate transition zone may be especially vulnerable to these factors we developed a new approach to peak flow analysis using two long term paired catchment experiments in that landscape at the marcell experimental forest mef in north central minnesota we investigated how forest cover change affects the magnitude occurrence probability event decoupling and seasonal decoupling of annual maximum peak flows event decoupling is when the annual maximum flows on control and treatment catchments occur in response to different events within a given year seasonal decoupling is when the annual maximum flows on control and treatment catchments occur in different seasons within a given year commonly used statistical methods e g ancova support inferences only for effects on peak flow magnitude disregarding effects on event occurrence probability statistical stationarity i e time invariant parameters is generally assumed within the ancova analysis despite temporal changes in climatic and land cover controls further use of these methods requires event coupling which is not always valid for annual maximum flows in catchments with mixed precipitation regimes to address these limitations we developed new nonstationary flood frequency analysis methods with bayesian parameter estimation to analyze two harvesting experiments including conversion from deciduous to coniferous species we compared results from these models to traditional least squares based methods e g ancova we assessed event and seasonal decoupling using logistic regression with bayesian parameter estimation there was no effect of harvesting on the annual maximum flow according to ancova and generalized least squares models but these methods were not reliable due to the presence of outliers and both event and seasonal decoupling flood frequency results from one clearcutting experiment showed increases in the annual maximum flow across nearly all return intervals with 80 85 confidence for peak discharges between the 10 and 50 year peak flow the 50 year return interval peak increased from an expected 17 cfs to 34 cfs after harvest harvesting induced substantial event decoupling in the catchment pairs and seasonal decoupling in one catchment pair as forest cover regenerated decoupling probability decreased our coupling analysis results indicated that control and treatment catchments generated and processed flood peaks differently after harvest and explained the poor fit of the linear models for which we assumed event coupling our study calls into question several key assumptions of traditional linear models in the analysis of paired catchments given certain conditions for example where forest harvesting can affect the season of annual maximum peaks and thus the phase of the generating precipitation event snowmelt versus rainfall it changes the relationship between the catchment pair in a way not accounted for in traditional linear models we advocate the use of probabilistic methods that can incorporate nonstationarity and are robust to different mechanisms of catchment hydrologic change in response to forest harvest keywords paired catchments bayesian parameter estimation flood frequency flooding nonstationary forest harvesting 1 introduction forest cover change and forest harvesting effects on catchment processes especially on the high streamflow regime have been an area of research for decades andréassian 2004 yu and alila 2019 zon 1927 alterations in peak flows can have serious ramifications for channel geomorphology stream ecology as well as water quality and sediment dynamics auerswald and geist 2018 poff et al 2006 furthermore floods can be devastating for local communities bradshaw et al 2007 forests are generally thought to offer some level of flood protection which can be influenced by disturbance such as forest harvesting alila and green 2014 andréassian 2004 birkinshaw 2014 green and alila 2012 moving forward changing climate and a growing demand for wood products may increase forest disturbance underlying the ecological and societal importance of understanding the relationship between forests and peak stream flows angel et al 2018 buongiorno et al 2012 buras and menzel 2018 in north america forest harvesting and forest cover change effects on peak streamflows are predominantly examined in high relief regions with bedrock close to the soil surface alila et al 2009 jones and grant 1996 kuraś et al 2012 thomas and megahan 1998 small 10 km2 paired catchment studies have provided the foundation for much of the current knowledge in forest hydrology including peak flows and flooding andréassian 2004 widespread disagreement remains and often stems from interpretation of the statistical method used to analyze paired catchment data buttle 2011 historical methods that have addressed the relationship between forest cover change and peak discharges in paired catchment experiments have typically relied on linear statistical models e g anova ancova hewlett 1982 jones and grant 1996 thomas and megahan 1998 that utilize traditional frequentist approaches they are designed to test for differences in mean values and rely on chronological pairing such that differences between catchments are compared for the same precipitation event alila et al 2009 such methods have given rise to the general paradigm that the effect of forest harvesting on peak flows exhibits a decreasing effect size with increasing peak flow and thus a greater proportional impact associated with frequent low discharge peak flows andréassian 2004 bathurst et al 2011 thomas and megahan 1998 the historic chronologically paired approach does not account for both event magnitude and frequency e g as reviewed by alilia et al 2009 analyses accounting for frequency of peak flows mostly conducted in mountainous snowmelt dominated catchments have found sizable effects for large peak flows and even an increasing effect size with increasing return interval alila et al 2009 green and alila 2012 kuraś et al 2012 yu and alila 2019 it is unclear how findings in these landscapes apply to those found in low relief glaciated regions such as those found in central north america russia and scandinavia further catchments at these northern latitudes are expected to be especially sensitive to climate change due to their highly climate dependent and seasonal hydrologic cycle tetzlaff et al 2015 2013 when examining peak flows changes between control and treatment catchments may manifest in several ways such as changes in flood magnitude probability of occurrence or a change in the type of precipitation event associated with the largest flow events e g rainfall vs snowmelt a shift in the seasonality and phase of the driving precipitation event has important ramifications for understanding flood generation and catchment processes producing high flows as these may be different for snowmelt versus rainfall events for example post harvest changes in hydrology in snowmelt dominated and snowmelt influenced catchments have the potential to increase peak flows even for large infrequent events due to catchment hydrologic processes e g increased catchment saturation alterations in soil thermodynamics freezing and infiltration at the time of snowmelt increased snowpack snow water equivalent etc murray and buttle 2003 pomeroy et al 1994 possible shifts in catchment processes in response to harvest highlight the need for statistical methods that offer flexibility to evaluate the temporal structure of the statistical model of peak discharges the integration of nonstationary representation of flood generation and flood frequency analysis methods offers a more detailed framework compared to previously used methods allowing inference about how peak flow magnitudes and frequencies change in response to forest cover and climatic changes through time at the small catchment scale yu and alila 2019 further use of bayesian methods to frame peak flow analysis in a probabilistic framework allows for uncertainty to be easily calculated in context of the models fitted to observations and our background or prior knowledge about the system we quantified the effect of forest cover change on flood and peak flows in two sets of paired catchments at the marcell experimental forest mef in north central minnesota usa in order to test the hypotheses that clearcutting will increase annual peak flows across all return intervals compared to pre harvest mature forest conditions and that annual peak flows will decrease with time since harvest as the forest regrows additionally we examined consistency of results and implications for the effects of harvesting on floods by comparing our nonstationary flood frequency analysis with traditional paired catchment ancova methods 2 methods 2 1 study sites the mef catchment studies were initiated by the u s forest service in 1961 to

upland forest surrounding a central peatland from which drains a first order stream fig 1b aspen populus spp and northern hardwoods dominate the uplands while black spruce picea mariana and tamarack

harvest using the peatland hydrologic impact model phim see guertin et al 1987 lu 1994 the phim modeling study used flood frequency analysis of simulated values of separated snowmelt and rainfall peaks for the s4 s5 mef clearcutting experiment s4 s5 experiment detailed in section 2 1 2 lu 1994 with results supporting the paradigm of decreasing effect size with increasing return interval in contrast verry et al 1983 found the 10 year recurrence interval of summer rainfall generated peak discharge after clearcutting increased more than the 2 year summer rainfall generated peak discharge the response across the entire range of recurrence intervals was not included in this study we examined nonstationary probability distributions of annual peak streamflow for rainfall and snowmelt generated annual peaks and compared the results to traditional ancova methods using long term data from two paired catchment experiments at the mef 2 1 1 s4 s5 experiment the s4 s5 experiment began with catchment instrumentation in 1962 the control catchment s5 is 52 6 ha in size and includes uplands and five small satellite wetlands draining into the 6 1 ha central peatland the treatment catchment s4 is 34 0 ha in size with an 8 1 ha central peatland clearcut harvest of merchantable timber in the s4 uplands took place over two sequential fall winter seasons 1970 71 1971 72 with final removal of non merchantable timber in summer 1972 aspen regenerated on the upland harvest areas and received fertilizer application according to an intentional study design in 1978 sebestyen et al 2011a the regenerated aspen forest was considered mature 40 years after harvesting based on commercial rotations in the great lakes region bradford and kastendick 2010 the s4 watershed straddles the laurentian divide approximately 70 of its annual water yield drains north to the hudson bay outlet s4n and 30 drains south to the mississippi outlet s4s sebestyen et al 2011b streamflow was measured using several gaging structures since 1962 including flumes and weirs all stage data were recorded on stripcharts which were then digitized and converted to streamflow using stage discharge relationships sebestyen et al 2020b supplemental information section 1 previous analyses of peak flows from the s4 catchment have only included the s4n outlet for this analysis we used the combined discharge values s4s s4n to identify the total annual maximum peak flow from the s4 catchment sebestyen et al 2020b annual maximum flow series were derived by taking the highest discharge value within each water year which was defined as march 1 february 28 29 2 1 2 s2 s6 experiment the pretreatment period in the s2 s6 experiment began in 1976 with a four year calibration period between catchments the control catchment s2 is 9 7 ha in size which includes a 3 2 ha central peatland the treatment catchment s6 is 8 9 ha in size with a 2 0 ha central peatland in march june of 1980 the aspen uplands in the treatment catchment were clearcut harvested with 77 of the catchment area harvested during the summers from june of 1980 to 1982 aspen regeneration was suppressed with grazing in may of 1983 red pine pinus resinosa and white spruce picea glauca were planted in the clearcut area with 70 of the upland area in red pine and 30 in white spruce annual maximum flow series were derived by taking the highest discharge value within each water year which was defined as march 1 february 28 29 2 2 general approach three statistical methods were used to detect differences in annual maximum flows due to forest harvesting and regrowth in each of the paired catchment experiments the first method traditional linear regression extended previous approaches at the mef to examine differences in annual maximum flow magnitude e g sebestyen et al 2011b the second method which we termed a coupling analysis utilized logistic regression analyses with parameters estimated using a bayesian method the coupling analysis was designed to determine the probability that the annual maximum flow in any given year was generated 1 by the same precipitation event on the control and treatment catchments and 2 within the same season on the control and treatment catchments finally we utilized nonstationary flood frequency models of the annual maximum streamflow series fit to observed data using a bayesian technique to explore differences in the entire probability distribution of annual maximum peak flow magnitudes across return intervals the final analysis supported inferences about how flood magnitude and probability of occurrence change due to forest harvesting and regrowth these three statistical approaches combine to offer complementary insights into the effects of forest cover change on the peak discharge magnitude occurrence probability and generating event seasonality 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1 linear regression the effects of different catchment treatments were assessed using least squares ancova regression analysis in which treatment and control catchment annual maximum discharge series were assumed to be related through a linear relationship slope and intercept effects were determined for pre and post treatment time periods table 1 following sebestyen et al 2011b models included a normally distributed error term with a constant residual variance per standard ancova methods we detected outliers in both s4 s5 and s2 s6 experiment data through standardized residual and residual versus leverage plots and used a generalized least squares approach gls to prevent the disproportionate influence of those outliers the gls approach is identical to least squares ancova except it introduces a residual variance that linearly increases with the observed control catchment annual maximum flow gls allows for a looser relationship between the control and treatment catchments during higher flow events and thus reduces the influence of high flow outliers ancova analyses were conducted using r version 3 6 2 r core team 2019 using the base ordinary least squares regression function lm and the generalized least squares regression function gls found in the nlme package pinheiro et al 2019 2 3 2 coupling analysis control and treatment catchment annual maximum discharges may be generated due to different events and or in different seasons and thus become decoupled in any given year decoupling takes two forms event decoupling and seasonal decoupling event decoupling occurs in a given year when the control and treatment catchments have their annual maximum flows due to different events in that year i e different rainfall events different snowmelt events or one snowmelt and one rainfall in any given year the annual maximum flows were event decoupled if the date of annual maximum flow on the treatment and control catchments were greater than seven days apart based on an inspection of annual maximum flow hydrographs and mef precipitation data supplemental information section 2 the seven day threshold was chosen from a visual inspection of discharge records which showed discharge generally decayed to approximately pre event levels between sequential peaks greater than seven days apart see supplemental information section 2 further the daily precipitation record at the mef indicates the median number of consecutive days with measureable precipitation was 2 1 4 days standard deviation sebestyen et al 2020c these considerations indicate that most precipitation events at the mef are relatively short such that stormflow peaks occurring greater than 7 days apart on control and treatment catchments were likely triggered by different events rather than differences in runoff from the same precipitation event a binary event decoupling series was created by denoting event decoupled years with 1 and coupled years with 0 we define seasonal decoupling as the condition when annual maximum flows on the control and treatment catchments occurred in different seasons within a given water year mef field collected snowpack data support the importance of seasonal snowpack melt in the months of march and april for streamflow sebestyen et al 2020a snowpack depth and water equivalent are measured at snowcourses starting in february and continuing every two weeks until the course is free of snow sebestyen et al 2020a based on previous work and mef precipitation data we defined a spring peak in march or april versus a summer peak between june and november the month of may was considered a transitional month because the dominant precipitation phase is rain however catchments tend to be high in saturation from snowmelt a year was considered seasonally decoupled if one catchment had a march april spring peak and the other catchment had a june to november summer peak the binary seasonal decoupling series was created by denoting seasonally decoupled years with 1 and coupled years with 0 to determine the probability of event and seasonal decoupling we analyzed the observed binary decoupling series within pretreatment and multiple post treatment time periods table 1 for both catchment experiments using logistic regression with parameters estimated through a bayesian technique shown in equation 1 1 decouple d i b e r n o u l l i p g l o g i t p g b g the probability of decoupling in year i in the time series block g for each block g in table 1 is pg which corresponds to a log odds or logit log pg 1 pg of bg we use bayesian based markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling gelman and rubin 1992 to generate a full probabilistic estimate for bg conditioned on the observed binary series we implemented the jags just another gibbs sampler algorithm plummer 2003 with the r2jags package su and yajima 2015 in r for mcmc sampling to test whether the decoupling probability pg increases due to treatment we determined the proportion of mcmc samples that predict the decoupling probability for each post treatment time period pg to be less than in the pretreatment period ppretreatment this proportion then corresponds to a type s error probability or the probability of erroneously concluding that ppretreatment pg where g pretreatment gelman et al 2012 gelman and tuerlinckx 2000 we can claim with 1 pvalue 100 confidence that the probability of control and treatment annual maximum flows occurring due to independent precipitation events or within different seasons in any given year increases due to treatment 2 3 3 flood frequency analysis 2 3 3 1 choice of distribution we used a bayesian approach to fit observed annual maximum flow to the generalized extreme value gev distribution which has the following cumulative distribution function for the annual maximum discharge q 2 f q μ σ ξ e x p 1 ξ q μ σ 1 ξ ξ 0 e x p e x p q μ σ ξ 0 after estimating parameters for equation 2 using mcmc we sampled across different probabilities of occurrence to estimate annual maximum flow magnitudes at given return intervals as in flood frequency analysis gumbel 1941 to capture nonstationarities we developed time evolving estimates of the location parameter μ possible range of to and scale parameter σ possible range of 0 to the shape parameter ξ possible range of to however the mean of the gev for ξ 1 was held stationary due to the narrow range of ξ for which the gev has a finite thus physically plausible mean our narrow range of ξ is consistent with other nonstationary flood frequency analyses of paired catchment data yu and alila 2019 the resulting nonstationary gev models applied to treatment and control catchments were then compared to detect treatment effects more details on the selection and fit of gev models are provided in the supplemental information fig s1 including comparison results in table s1 2 3 3 2 nonstationary parameter evolution nonstationary models require a defined form for parameter trends through time koutsoyiannis 2011 to capture the alterations in upland forest cover in each of the two catchment experiments we developed the temporal trend structures shown in fig 2 for the location and scale parameters μ and σ of the gev distribution eq 2 the shape parameter ξ for the gev distribution was held constant in time bayesian based mcmc sampling with the jags algorithm plummer 2003 in the r2jags package su and yajima 2015 was implemented to estimate the needed hyper parameters associated with μ and σ and stationary ξ models for the treatment and control watersheds using annual maximum flow observations fig 2 the advantage of the bayesian based mcmc approach is that it provides full posterior distribution estimates of the hyper parameters which incorporate in a statistically consistent way both constraints from the maximum flow observations as well as prior information represented by prior probability distributions about the hyper parameters based on previous knowledge of the site and or physical limitations smith and roberts 1993 for s4 s5 the general structure of the nonstationary model for the gev location and scale parameters μ and σ is assumed to follow a piecewise linear trend with time t water year during its regrowth period based on breakpoints at the year of complete upland clearcut t 1972 71 of watershed area harvested and the recovery year tr equation 3 fig 2a 3 μ t σ t ξ μ mature a s p e n slope μ t t r α t σ mature a s p e n

mcmc sampling was used to estimate ξ tr μ matureaspen slope μ σ matureaspen and slope σ equation 3 in previous assessments recovery of peak flow characteristics for post harvest aspen regeneration were found 16 years after harvest sebestyen et al 2011b verry 2004 1986 verry et al 1983 the 16 year recovery was based on considerations of aspen growth rate and crown formation perala and verry 2011 and previous discharge regression analyses at mef showing that snowmelt associated peaks remained above pre harvest conditions for 15 years after harvest verry 2004 thus our mcmc calculations included a moderately informative prior distribution for the tr consisting of a discrete approximation of a normal distribution centered on the 16th year after harvesting 1988 in s4 with a standard deviation of two years a discrete approximation of the normal distribution was used to represent the recovery year to an integer year post harvest because the time step of the input data was one year the shape parameter was constrained between 0 and 1 and all other prior distributions were set as noninformative for more information on choice of prior distributions see the supplemental information section 3 for the s2 s6 experiment we modeled the location and scale parameters μ and σ of the gev distribution with a piecewise linear model with time t calendar year that includes stationary values in the pretreatment time period 1976 1979 different stationary values during upland grazing 1981 1983 decreasing values through time after conifer planting 1984 until the recovery year tr and a third set of

al 2011b and a two year standard deviation for information on the noninformative prior distributions used for all other hyperparameters see the supplemental information section 3 2 3 3 3 treatment effects a linear regression equation was fit to pre treatment observations for each catchment pair in order to parameterize the relationship between annual maximum series in the treatment and control catchments while isolating the non climatic biophysical differences between them similar to alila et al 2009 this regression was the same ancova form explained in section 2 3 1 fit only in the pretreatment time period we then applied the regression equation to the post treatment time cpostt control catchment annual maximum flow to predict the expected annual maximum flow series in the treatment catchment had the treatment not occurred t postt 5 t postt i b 0 b 1 c postt i where i is the time index during the post treatment period and b0 and b1 are coefficients estimated using pre treatment observations the full time series of annual maximum flow in the treatment catchment had the treatment not occurred from the pre treatment time through the post treatment time period is then represented by the concatenation of the pre treatment observations and t p o s t t i the concatenated time series is represented as t i parameters b0 and b1 in equation 5 were determined using bayesian based mcmc sampling with the jags package in r to acknowledge uncertainty in the coefficient estimates and retain consistency with the parameter probabilistic treatment seventy mcmc samples of b0 and b1 representing 70 possible parameter sets given the observed maximum flows were used to generate 70 possible series of t i as an uncertainty range of the expected annual maximum flow on the treatment catchment had treatment not occurred each of the 70 expected annual maximum flow series was then used as data to fit nonstationary gev distributions used for treatment catchments equations 3 and 4 expected results for the no treatment cases were compared to the observed with treatment case in order to draw inferences about harvest and regrowth effects hence utilizing the catchment pairing to control for climate covariates we note that the number of series examined was limited to 70 due to the computational burden of fitting each nonstationary gev model to the data using mcmc when equation 5 predicted negative annual maximum discharges for s6 0 was used as the predicted annual maximum discharge this circumstance happened on average 2 3 years within the 40 year long expected annual maximum flow series for s6 random samples from the posterior densities for location μ scale σ and shape ξ parameters in the time periods of interest were taken to construct 100 000 cumulative distribution functions for the expected and observed gev model fits eqns 3 and 4 in order to evaluate differences in annual maximum flow across return intervals effects of harvest were inferred for each treatment pair through comparison of the distribution functions during specific time intervals observed with treatment and expected no treatment models eqn 3 were compared across s4 s5 for the year 1972 when the treatment effect of harvesting was largest for the s2 s6 experiment a similar comparison was constructed for the time interval after clearcutting and during grazing 1981 1983 further conifer conversion effect was inferred through observed and expected model comparison between 2000 and 2016 after conifer canopy closure on the treatment catchment expected control and observed treatment cumulative distribution functions for return intervals n 1 5 to 50 years were compared through finding the proportion of the treatment cumulative distribution functions that are greater or less than the expected cumulative distribution functions as a type s error probability for each return interval gelman and tuerlinckx 2000 which represents the chance of incorrectly concluding that the n year peak flow has increased or decreased when they have in fact decreased increased or stayed the same 3 results 3 1 ancova gls ancova results for the s4 s5 experiment did not show any post treatment slopes or intercepts different than the pretreatment time period all p 0 10 including in the decade immediately following upland harvesting p 0 47 for intercept p 0 26 for slope fig 3 a in general no slopes or intercepts were different from each other according to a type ii anova langsrud 2003 with slopes p 0 36 and intercepts p 0 38 fig 3a a gls regression was used in addition to the ordinary least squares ols regression due to detected outliers in the ols gls results concurred with ols indicating no statistical differences of slopes or intercepts in the post treatment time periods compared to pretreatment all p 0 25 ancova results for the s2 s6 experiment showed a significant decrease in regression slopes for the growing forest and closed canopy conifer conditions compared to the pretreatment time period p 0 001 and 0 004 respectively but no significant difference between the open young forest and pretreatment time periods fig 3b our ancova results on s2 s6 concur with previous work that found decreases in peak flows after conversion to conifer species sebestyen et al 2011b however residuals versus leverage plots revealed outliers and regression slopes corresponding to the growing forest and closed canopy time periods were no longer significantly different from pretreatment p 0 15 and p 0 46 respectively when using gls the gls regression was a better fit according to diagnostic plots such as residuals versus fitted and residuals versus leverage plots 3 2 coupling analysis harvest induced a greater probability of the annual maximum flow being due to different independent events 7 days apart on control and treatment catchments event decoupling is captured in the logistic regression results for s4 s5 and s2 s6 table 2 fig 4 a and 4c the same general trend is seen in both experiments but we are only 90 confident for the s4 s5 experiment furthermore harvest induced a greater probability of seasonal decoupling in the s4 s5 experiment fig 4b table 2 seasonal decoupling occurred in twelve years of the fifty four year s4 s5 record with 11 of those years occurring after harvest in ten of these post harvest seasonal decoupling years s4 had a summer peak and s5 had a spring peak seasonal decoupling was rarely observed for the s2 s6 experiment only two times in the 41 year record so seasonal decoupling analysis was not implemented for the s2 s6 experiment 3 3 flood frequency analysis 3 3 1 s4 s5 experiment flood frequency analysis in the pretreatment calibration regression equation 5 expected annual maximum discharge on s4 given the annual maximum flow on s5 had an intercept estimate of 0 695 95 credible interval 0 108 to 1 475 and a slope estimate of 1 288 95 credible interval 0 311 to 1 752 overall r2 0 32 expected values and their credible intervals and the raw treatment annual maximum series are shown in fig 5 a the n year discharge increased in the first year after cutting compared to the expected discharge if the harvest had not occurred fig 6 we have between 80 and 85 confidence in discharge increases for return intervals 10 years type s p 0 20 whereas we have only 30 confidence for an increase in the 1 5 year discharge fig 6b our results indicate a greater treatment effect for larger discharges averaged across all return intervals we have 80 confidence that annual maximum flows increased with increasing confidence for increases at larger return intervals p 0 16 for the 50 year annual maximum flow further the increases in annual maximum flows for each return interval stem largely from an increase in the scale σ p 0 27 and shape ξ p 0 19 parameters due to harvesting table 3 the shape parameter controls the heavy tailedness of the distribution of annual maximum flows for the entire s4 treatment record the shape parameter equaled 0 40 versus 0 20 on the entire record of the expected conditions had harvest not occurred indicating that treatment induced greater probability of very high annual maximum flows even after recovery of the location and scale parameters to pretreatment values on the treatment catchment the larger shape parameter for the treatment catchment causes larger annual maximum flows than what was expected in the absence of treatment with 88 confidence from the 10 to the 50 year return interval annual maximum flow our results indicate that post harvest changes in annual maximum flows may be driven largely by changes to the variability of annual maximum flows as the location parameter related to mean flow potentially even decreased p 0 33 we are more confident in increases to the scale parameter related to variance p 0 26 and the shape parameter related to the probability and variance of large annual maximum flows p 0 19 for expected and observed posterior densities for location scale and shape see fig s2 the recovery year for location and scale parameters is relatively unchanged from our moderately informative prior distribution based on model results we are 90 confident that recovery of the location and scale parameters to pretreatment conditions occurs between 12 and 18 years after harvest the shape parameter was held stationary within each model fit eqn 3 however we obtained different shape values when gev models were fit for expected versus observed time series p 0 19 eqn 3 the difference in shape parameter indicates that the shape parameter may have increased with forest harvesting and was therefore in truth nonstationary thus we do not know when overall recovery happened because we only assumed location and scale were nonstationary within each individual model and we have no means of testing when the shape parameter returned to what we would expect in the absence of treatment our results indicate high confidence 88 89 that annual maximum peak flows were higher on the treatment catchment than what would be expected in the absence of treatment even after recovery of the location and scale parameters there is no way to investigate when recovery of the shape parameter occurred if at all within our modeling framework 3 3 2 s2 s6 flood frequency analysis post treatment annual maximum discharges on the control catchment were adjusted according to the calibration regression fig 5b which had an intercept of 0 120 95 credible interval 0 649 to 0 409 and a slope of 1 324 95 credible interval 1 106 to 1 550 for reference overall r2 0 99 we did not find an increase in the annual maximum flow immediately following clearcut when the treatment effect should be highest based on equation 4 fig 7 a 7b across the cumulative distribution function all p values were between 0 35 and 0 45 up to the 50 year return interval fig 7b location scale and shape parameters stayed the same table 3 fig s3 there was also no effect of conifer conversion on the annual maximum flow for the s6 catchment fig 7c 7d here testing for a hypothesized decrease in annual maximum flows we are not confident in any of the modeled decreases in the annual maximum flow across return intervals up to the 50 year event with p being about 0 35 under the 10 year return interval discharge event but going up to 0 5 for larger discharge events indicating that we have no more confidence that flows decreased than we do that flows increased due to conifer conversion fig 7d location scale and shape parameters stayed the same unlike for s4 s5 we do not have evidence that the shape parameter was nonstationary table 3 the recovery of the location and scale parameters to a new stationary state after conifer planting was heavily influenced by our semi informative prior which centered recovery around canopy closure 17 years after conifer planting however because no effects of upland clearcutting or canopy conversion were found recovery year has little meaning 4 discussion 4 1 ancova gls based on the ancova and gls regression analyses no significant increases were found for annual maximum flows in the time periods directly after upland clearcut harvest when the uplands were in open young forest conditions compared to the pretreatment time period fig 3 this finding contrasts with previous ancova results that have found significant effects of harvesting on snowmelt and rainfall caused peaks for the s4 experiment verry et al 1983 several factors may explain this discrepancy between past studies and our results including 1 the longer time period of record in our analysis 2 our use of both s4n and s4s gauges to compute total annual maximum discharge on s4 and 3 our examination of the annual maximum discharge including both rainfall and snowmelt events further gls was not previously utilized 4 2 coupling analysis we observed significant event and seasonal decoupling on the s4 s5 pair in a given year seasonal decoupling was generally associated with streamflow generating processes that differed for control and treatment catchments summer annual maximum flows result directly from rainfall events in past mef research march and april high flows were generally associated with snowmelt sebestyen et al 2011b verry et al 1983 with the two week resolution of snowpack data however it remains unclear if individual march april peaks are due to snowmelt rain on snow or rain on a snowmelt saturated catchment two week data on snow depth and snow water equivalent do however support our assertions that every year does include measureable snowpack and snowpack melt largely occurs in march and april hence we can generalize that any annual maximum peak occurring in march or april is influenced by snowmelt but possibly triggered by rain on snow or also influenced somehow by rain whereas any annual maximum flow occurring after may 30 is due to summer rainfall thus the seasonal decoupling observed in s4 s5 likely reflects a regime shift in the annual peak streamflow generating process after harvesting for s4 with peaks for s4 shifting from a snowmelt influenced to a rainfall dominated process decoupling likely accounts for differences between our results and those of previous studies annual maximum discharge from the catchments is not the same as individual examinations of spring and summer peaks that have been analyzed previously verry et al 1983 sebestyen et al 2011b in our analysis peak discharge on control and treatment watersheds was decoupled at times hence not chronologically paired previous ancova analysis of paired catchment data at the mef and elsewhere relied on chronological pairing of events such that peaks generated during the same event were compared on control and treatment catchments the significant event and seasonal decoupling in the s4 s5 pair calls into question the appropriateness of chronological pairing of annual maximum flows as early as the pre treatment period catchment pairs had a non zero probability of event decoupling table 2 event decoupling was linked to open vs forest condition with a post harvest increase in both the s4 s5 and s6 s2 pairs followed by a decrease towards preharvest levels as forest cover recovered fig 4a 4c table 2 event decoupling was not related to the cover type of the regrowing forest the incidence of event decoupling for s6 with closed canopy conifer uplands compared to deciduous cover on s2 during the same time period is no greater than in the pretreatment time period when both s2 and s6 had deciduous cover p 0 563 thus canopy conversion from deciduous to coniferous does not cause event decoupling the s4 s5 experiment showed evidence of seasonal decoupling where s4 was more likely to have a summer annual maximum flow while s5 was more likely to be a spring annual maximum flow fig s4 in the first decade following harvest seven of ten of the s4 annual maximum flows occurred in the summer while only three of ten occurred in the summer on s5 seasonal decoupling was not observed significantly on s2 s6 only two of the forty years of record had seasonal decoupling which was too few instances upon which to fit a logistic regression the seasonal decoupling of s4 s5 is possibly due to internal subtle differences between the treatment s4 and control s5 catchments that were exacerbated by harvest for example s5 has 5 small satellite wetlands within the upland rim that act as distributed catchment storage in addition to the central peatland s4 does not have these upland wetlands this difference may cause s4 to be more responsive to summer rainfall events than s5 harvest may have exacerbated these preexisting differences in catchment processing of flood peaks 4 3 flood frequency analysis the nonstationary flood frequency analysis based on the immediate post harvest year indicated increases in annual maximum flows up to the 50 year return interval within the s4 catchment in the first year after harvest fig 6 the effect size of the harvest increased with increasing peak flow return interval fig 6 broadly the increases in annual maximum flows are consistent with previous results that showed increases in snowmelt caused peak discharges for 15 years and rainfall caused peak discharges for 7 years after harvesting for the s4 experiment verry 2004 sebesteyen et al 2011b further when verry et al 1983 compared stationary flood frequency distributions for pre versus post treatment rainfall peaks for s4 versus s5 they found the 10 year rainfall caused annual maximum discharge increased more than the 2 year discharge in the decade after harvesting the seasonal decoupling between s4 and s5 discussed in section 4 3 further elucidates the findings of verry et al 1983 when only rainfall peaks were compared the annual maximum from s5 which tended to be in the spring and associated with snowmelt was not included we found an increasing effect size of forest harvesting for events at increasing event return intervals which is similar to previous mef work verry et al 1983 our results indicate that in the first year after harvest the 2 year discharge was effectively the same on the harvested s4 catchment versus expected conditions 2 98 cfs versus 3 08 cfs while the 50 year discharge approximately doubles from 16 5 cfs to 32 5 cfs despite increasing uncertainty at larger return intervals our confidence in the presence of an effect on peak flows remains relatively constant from the 10 year to the 50 year discharge at about 80 85 fig 6b thus our results do not match the paradigm of decreasing effect size with increasing return interval that has been largely derived from paired catchment studies in western north american catchments with very different landscapes and ecosystems e g thomas megahan 1998 buttle 2011 one meta analysis of paired catchments using both ancova based and flood frequency based methods supported a generally decreasing effect size of harvest with increasing discharge return interval but one catchment pair in the analysis showed increasing effect size with increasing return interval bathurst et al 2020 this finding may have been due to road construction in this catchment pair bathurst et al 2020 although s4 does have proportionally more forest roads than s5 forest roads and major skid trails occupied less than 2 of the catchment area after harvesting likely not explaining the peak flow increases verry et al 1983 for the first year after harvest fig 6 we have between 80 and 86 confidence in the flow increases due to forest harvesting however our confidence in flow increases is 88 for large discharge events after recovery of the location and scale parameters due to an increased shape parameter further our results of increasing effect size with increasing return interval is consistent with recent flood frequency analyses of paired catchment data in western north america alila et al 2009 green alila 2012 yu alila 2019 and is consistent with the flood frequency analysis of rainfall peaks at the mef done by verry et al 1983 the effect of harvest on large return interval events was heavily influenced by the difference in the gev model shape parameter on the treatment watershed this shape parameter was held constant within each gev model of annual maximum flow however when fit to the annual maximum flow series on treated s4 it was larger than when fit to the 70 series of expected conditions had treatment not occurred the difference in shape parameter value for expected versus observed treatment models caused the increases in annual maximum peak flows to be present in the first year after harvesting further increases in the annual maximum flow after the recovery of location and scale parameters on s4 are evident with high confidence 88 it should be noted that three of the four largest discharge events on s4 1999 2002 and 2011 occurred after the hypothesized 16 year recovery estimate for location and scale parameters and were all in response to rainfall in june or july of these three peaks that occurred greater than 16 years after harvest two were above the 90 credible interval for the expected value based on the pretreatment calibration 1999 and 2011 fig 5 shape parameters related to the tail of the annual maximum flow distribution may thus be nonstationary and sensitive to forest harvesting contrary to our initial assumption and that of others e g yu and alila 2019 however fitting a nonstationary structure to all three parameters on 54 years of data would rapidly increase the ratio of parameters per data point decreasing the usefulness of such models it is noteworthy that the flood frequency analysis indicated high confidence for the effect of harvest for the s4 s5 experiment but not for the s2 s6 experiment where our confidence in annual maximum flow changes largely ranged between 55 and 65 however the investigation of the s2 s6 experiment is hindered by a short preharvest time period 4 years which may have been inadequate for detecting a difference due to harvesting and conversion loftis et al 2001 sebestyen et al 2011b the annual maximum flow record for s2 s6 is shorter than for s4 s5 and more parameters were necessary to model s2 s6 compared to s4 s5 due to the grazing treatment on s6 prior to forest regrowth and conversion to a different upland species fig 2 this increased model complexity resulted in greater uncertainty for parameter estimates we also consider the possibility that there truly was no effect of harvesting or conversion unlike for s4 we did not have strong evidence of seasonal decoupling for the s2 s6 experiment which may indicate that s4 passed some hydrologic threshold due to disturbance while s6 did not nonlinear and threshold processes have been observed in northern headwater catchments in which there are disproportional runoff responses to forcing inputs ali et al 2015 thresholds have been invoked for explaining increases in large peak flows and a sensitive upper tail for extreme value distributions alila et al 2009 in one threshold based investigation of a forest regenerating after disturbance the threshold in the rainfall stormflow relationship associated with rapid stormflow response did not change with forest regrowth but the magnitude of stormflow response to precipitation decreased as the forest regrew wei et al 2020 watershed shape could also play a role in the divergent results between catchment pairs s6 has an elongated shape in contrast to s4 which is more circular and has two outlets fig 1 more elongated watersheds tend to have relatively lower peak flows black 1972 the peatland is also more centrally located within the catchment in s6 than s4 fig 1 which could contribute to its ability to dampen peak flows out of the catchment finally catchment differences within individual pairs may have contributed to the different flood frequency findings in each experiment as harvesting was found to exacerbate preexisting differences in these catchments via seasonal decoupling for example the control catchment s5 includes 5 small satellite wetlands within the uplands in addition to its central peatland the preexisting differences in s4 s5 that may have contributed to our findings were not present with the s2 s6 pair no effect of canopy conversion from deciduous to coniferous upland species on the annual maximum flow was found in the flood frequency analysis of the s2 s6 experiment uncertainty with low pretreatment sample size and number of parameters versus number of datapoints apply similarly to these results given this uncertainty we note that the observed cumulative distribution function tended to decrease across all return intervals which is the hypothesized direction of effect i e conifer cover decreases flood peaks fig 7c 7d the ancova analysis supported significant decreases in peak flows while the conifer forest grew and after canopy closure but once the effects of high flow outliers were dampened using gls regression the significance of these decreases disappeared the annual maximum flow on both s2 and s6 was relatively low for the last decade of record 2006 2016 reflecting a prolonged period of relatively low flow fig 5 this period of low flow coinciding roughly with conifer canopy closure did not offer much data on how larger or medium sized peak flows respond to canopy conversion for a bulk of the closed canopy conifer conditions in our analysis this caused larger flows that did occur in the closed canopy period to exert stronger influence on the regression as outliers it is important to consider the limitations inherent in any investigation of flooding effects of land use limitations in our study include inherent factors in the paired catchment design e g past harvest treatment pairings etc because of increasing complexity and different flood generation mechanisms at larger scales it is unclear how these results apply for catchments at larger spatial scales blöschl 2006 rogger et al 2017 both experiments were partial clearcuts 75 of catchment area on only the upland portion of the catchments the unharvested forested wetlands occupy significant catchment area and tend to attenuate flooding effects detenbeck et al 2005 significant portions of the harvests were also in the winter on frozen soils to reduce soil impacts and erosion furthermore catchments were rapidly revegetated leaving few years of open conditions on the uplands from which to derive inferences about the effects of open canopy conditions on peak flows for example the s4 clearcut was staggered between 1970 and 1972 and before the upland clearcut on s4 was complete in 1972 the upland portion previously cut had measureable regeneration with 41 000 stems ha that were 2 m tall verry et al 1983 it may take several years for altered hydrology to equilibrate to a new stationary state after conversion to open conditions brown et al 2005 thus there are potentially only several years of a transient state in between mature forest and recovery conditions for investigating these effects the transient state of the effect of forest cover change is reflected in the large uncertainty bounds in nonstationary models use of a calibration period provided another source of uncertainty because of the relatively short calibration periods in the paired catchment design 10 years we assumed that the relationship between the control and treatment catchments would have been stationary if the treatment had not occurred additionally some expected values were extrapolated from the pretreatment calibration regression despite uncertainty about how the calibration regressions may apply to these larger extrapolated discharges changes in peak flow from the calibration period expected conditions are attributed solely to treatment i e climate and biophysical differences between control and treatment catchments are encapsulated in a simple calibration equation thus we attributed changes in flood frequency to changes in forest cover as opposed to any other factor such as rainfall frequency or changes in the control catchment as the forest aged however if the climate regime and or weather patterns shift the pretreatment calibration might not hold the selection and appropriateness of a pretreatment calibration regression controlling for the biophysical differences in control and treatment catchments across the range of observed climatic conditions remains a large tenant in the paired catchment study design that has been debated for years both criticized renne 1967 zégre et al 2010 and defended hewlett et al 1969 neary 2016 to incorporate our uncertainty about the calibration regressions we sampled across 70 different slopes and intercepts fit with the calibration regressions this incorporation of uncertainty in the calibration period is a considerable improvement to remedy issues of calibration uncertainty however some uncertainty about the calibration and its application for high flow regimes remains by virtue of the paired catchment study design 5 implications for analysis of paired catchment studies several important ramifications for paired catchment studies of the forest peak flow relationship were revealed by this study ongoing disagreements about the effects of forest cover on flooding often stem from the statistical lens used to look at the question we find it critical to articulate the benefits and limitations of various methods clearly define the inference space for which the methods are valid and relate statistical inference space to a physical inference space first methods that incorporate the probabilistic nature of peak flows are critical for finding differences due to landscape change such as the nonstationary flood frequency framework in our study increased use of probabilistic flood frequency methods allows researchers to explicitly make inferences about effects of forest harvesting across multiple return intervals which is not possible for traditional anova ancova analyses next ancova is highly sensitive to high flow outliers which may not be adequately remedied through relaxing the constant residual variance assumption in the gls analysis because our flood frequency model of s4 s5 indicated that flow increases after forest harvesting can manifest as a change in occurrence probability for large flows i e increase in shape parameter it is critical to use a method that is robust to high flow outliers and associated uncertainties such as a probabilistic framework our results underscore the importance of seasonal and event coupling in the assessment of forest harvest effects on peak flow peak coupling also called chronological pairing is assumed in ancova but not in flood frequency analysis the event and seasonal decoupling we found in the s4 s5 analysis highlights this important consideration in paired catchment data analysis the lack of chronological pairing for annual maximum flows likely explains the poor relationships between these discharges on control and treatment catchments in our ancova gls analyses the assumption of event coupling does not hold simply because the catchments are similar in size and physically adjacent methods robust to potential changes in pairing relationships should be further developed and utilized when analyzing paired catchment data our coupling analysis illustrates the importance of analyzing the probabilistic distribution of peak flows as well as subtle changes in seasonality that can manifest as large changes at the tails of extreme value distributions seasonal decoupling particularly in catchments that receive both snow and rain could further indicate differences in runoff generation and internal catchment processes between the paired catchments in some catchments for example mountain catchments that reliably have snowmelt derived peaks every year alila et al 2009 chronological pairing of annual maximum peaks may be possible however we found that harvesting may induce or enhance an alteration in the individual event and in some cases the event seasonality and therefore flow generating process that produces the annual maximum flow we hypothesize the mef is more likely than several western north american catchment pairs to experience seasonal decoupling due to its physiography and climate and that other boreal temperate transition catchments may be more sensitive to this decoupling response to harvest as the climate warms 6 conclusion no significant effect of forest harvesting on annual maximum flows was found using ancova gls or a nonstationary flood frequency model of s2 s6 for which there were only 4 years of pretreatment data however increases in annual maximum flows across all return intervals were supported confidence 80 85 for the s4 clearcut and aspen regeneration experiment according to nonstationary flood frequency analysis ancova based methods were not adequate to fully investigate the effect of forest harvesting because annual maximum flows decoupled after harvest and tended to occur in different seasons likely due to different streamflow generating processes snowmelt associated versus rainfall thus even if flood magnitude and frequency may or may not be changed by harvesting the precipitation event associated with the annual maximum flow may change our study demonstrates the value of using a probabilistic framework to investigate changes in peak flows this method can support inferences about harvesting effects for specific return intervals instead of being limited to differences in means i e linear models increases in annual maximum flows after forest harvesting got larger with increasing return interval for the s4 s5 experiment which indicates that if this effect truly occurred it was not limited to small discharge events as is the typical paradigm more investigation is needed particularly pairing computational physically based models with bayesian parameter estimation methods to minimize uncertainty about the form of nonstationarity introduced by harvesting and to gain more physically based insight into this effect credit authorship contribution statement zachary p mceachran conceptualization methodology software validation

4677,arid regions of central asia have sensitive ecosystems that rely heavily on terrestrial water storage which is composed of surface water storage soil moisture storage and groundwater storage therefore we employed three gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite datasets and five global hydrological models ghms to explore the terrestrial water storage tws changes over arid regions of central asia from 2003 to 2014 we observed significantly decreasing water storage trends in the grace data which were underestimated by the ghms after averaging the three grace satellite datasets we found that the water storage was decreasing at a rate of 4 74 mm year contrary to the prevailing declining water storage trends northeastern kazakhstan kaz and southern xinjiang increased their water storage over the same period the grace data showed that turkmenistan tkm uzbekistan uzb and kaz experienced the most severe water depletions while tajikistan tjk and northwest china nw experienced the least significant depletions with respect to the major river and lake basins the aral sea basin exhibited the most serious water loss 0 60 mm month to 0 38 mm month the water storage positively correlates with the precipitation and negatively correlates with a three month lag with temperature and potential evapotranspiration pet partial least square regression plsr had the high capability in simulating and predicting the tws these results provide scientific evidence and guidance for local policy makers working toward sustainable water resource management and the resolution of international water resource disputes among central asian countries keywords terrestrial water storage global hydrological model grace satellite dataset partial least square regression central asia 1 introduction due to global warming rapid population growth and unsustainable water withdrawal practices regional and global water scarcity is becoming increasingly severe this scarcity negatively impacts food security human health environmental sustainability and economic development oki and kanae 2006 unsurprisingly sustainable water management is a fundamental aspect of the sustainable development goals sdgs of the united nations development programme undp wood and declerck 2015 in the global water cycle water precipitates from the atmosphere travels on the surface and through groundwater to the oceans and evaporates or transpires back to the atmosphere from land or evaporates from the oceans with respect to the overall water storage oceans have the largest water volume followed by glaciers snow and groundwater oki and kanae 2006 as a critical state variable in the water cycle and as a major renewable freshwater resource terrestrial water storage encompasses surface water storage lakes rivers and reservoirs canopy interception snow water equivalent soil moisture storage and groundwater storage rodell et al 2018 water resources have been profoundly influenced by climate change and extensive anthropogenic activity the resulting changes in the hydrological cycle pose a threat to sustainable water use and agricultural production due to the cost of installing and maintaining instrument networks data gaps and the lack of digitization and sharing of existing data it is difficult to assess the changes in the global tws using in situ measurements alone long et al 2014 rodell et al 2018 global hydrological models ghms which model the regional and global water fluxes and storage usually include global land surface models lsms and global hydrological and water resource models ghwrms both of which could provide insight into the global tws scanlon et al 2018 large uncertainties exist in their outputs however mostly because of the limited in situ observations for model inputs and the model structural errors satellite remote sensing products are an efficient way to monitor the water storage and water fluxes in an ever changing world launched in 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites have been likened to giant weighing scales in the sky that monitor monthly changes in mass as water storage increases or decreases relative to climate variability and human activity compared to ghms grace satellites provide more direct estimates of changes in terrestrial water storage that are derived from the time variable gravity field which is considered the big picture in terms of the global water storage recent studies of grace satellite datasets have focused on the following questions 1 identifying the terrestrial water storage variations over regional and global scales long et al 2017 2 analyzing changes in the tws contribution from groundwater evapotranspiration floods droughts and glaciers mass balance long et al 2014 long et al 2020 and 3 discussing the effects of climate change and human activity on terrestrial water storage variations rodell et al 2018 furthermore grace satellite datasets have been used in many studies to validate ghm outputs döll et al 2014a 2014b however because grace satellite datasets have limitations within the time period i e only from 2002 to present that cannot reflect the long term terrestrial water storage variations machine learning is an efficient approach to simulating predicting and expandingthe grace satellite time series for the purposes of conducting long term analyses of the terrestrial water storage sun 2013 mukherjee and ramachandran 2018 recent works have demonstrated that machine learning can accurately simulate hydrological changes and variations using the certain climate and hydrological variables such as precipitation temperature evaporation and soil moisture long et al 2017 hu et al 2019a globally arid regions host more than 38 of the total global population these regions are more sensitive and thus vulnerable to the effects of climate change and human activity than areas that are wet and subhumid in these arid areas tws variations have a more immediate impact on humanity and on the environmental ecosystem therefore a comprehensive and detailed investigation of terrestrial water storage changes and variations in these arid regions may provide a more thorough understanding of how climate change and anthropogenic activity affect the water storage and other related hydrological processes central asia is the largest arid area region in the eurasian continent and represents a key area of the silk road the ecological system as well as human society in central asia are vulnerable and sensitive to variations in water availability chen 2012 the spatial distribution of water storage is largely dictated by the complex topography of this region unsurprisingly conflicts arise when different countries attempt to manage transboundary water resources moreover the aral sea crisis was a global ecological disaster that was caused in large part by unsustainable water resource management deng et al 2010a 2010b in our study of the water storage in central asia we hope to answer the following questions 1 how does the terrestrial water storage change across central asia 2 using certain climate and hydrological variables is it possible to simulate or predict the terrestrial water storage variations with machine learning techniques 3 how does water resource management affect the terrestrial water storage variations and vice versa to address these questions we first investigated the spatial and temporal tws variations in the arid regions of central asia using the grace satellite datasets and the ghms then using certain climate and hydrological factors we employed the partial least square regression plsr approach to simulate and predict these tws variations while also exploring the impact of climate factors and human activity on the tws lastly by analysing the relationship between the twsa and water resources management techniques we propose potential sustainable water resource development strategies that may help us to achieve the sdgs outlined in the undp 2 study area datasets and methodologies 2 1 study area the arid regions of central asia casnw area of 607 08 104 km2 include northwest china nw area of 206 43 104 km2 and the five central asia states cas5 kazakhstan kaz 272 49 104 km2 uzbekistan uzb 44 74 104 km2 kyrgyzstan kgz 19 99 104 km2 tajikistan tjk 14 31 104 km2 and turkmenistan tkm 49 12 104 km2 fig 1 a chen 2012 chen and zhou 2015 this region is in the hinterland of the eurasian continent and has complex terrain and geomorphic features including the altai tianshan kunlun and qilian mountain ranges the major lakes and rivers include balkhash lake issyk kul lake the aral sea the syr darya the amu darya and the tarrim river fig 1 the major basins in this region include the balkhash lake basin balkhash issyk kul lake basin issyk kul aral sea basin aral and tarim river basin tarim as well as the ob river basin in casnw ob with areas of 42 37 104 km2 19 10 105 km2 123 31 104 km2 105 17 104 km2 and of 81 49 104 km2 respectively fig 1b this region is dominated by an arid semiarid climate that is controlled primarily by the westerly winds chen and zhou 2015 the atlantic ocean and the arctic ocean provide the most significant moisture fluxes in the regions while the tianshan mountains and the pamir mountains largely hinder moisture fluxes from the pacific ocean and the indian ocean schiemann et al 2008 chen et al 2018 during el niño some of the moisture fluxes that originate in the indian ocean are carried by the westerly winds where they contribute to the precipitation that occurs over most parts of central asia especially in the middle southern central region mariotti 2007 hu et al 2017 2018 from 1951 to 2013 the surface temperature has increased steadily across the entire area with a wetting trend emerging in nw and a drying trend emerging in cas5 hu et al 2014 2019b 2 2 datasets in this study we derived the terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa using three data sources the first source is the three release 5 rl05 of the monthly grace tellus level 3 from the centre for space research csr the geoforschungszentrum gfz and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl https grace jpl nasa gov data get data tapley et al 2004 wahr et al 2004 the second source consists of three global land data assimilation system gldas land surface models lsms including variable infiltration capacity vic and mosaic from the gldas version 1 gldas 1 and the noah from gldas version 2 1 gldaa 2 1 rodell et al 2009 the third source is two ghwrms known as pcr globwb 2 sutanudjaja et al 2018 and the watergap water global assessment and prognosis global hydrology model wghm 2 2 alcamo et al 2003 döll et al 2014a 2014b schmied et al 2014 the monthly grace satellite datasets are from april 2002 to january with a spatial resolution of 1 1 we calculate the twsa for each of the csr gfz and jpl datasets using linear interpolation and monthly mean values to fill in any data gaps in the time series recorded deriving monthly gravity field variations from grace observations requires a complex inversion of a relative range of observations between the two formation flying grace spacecraft in combination with a precise orbit determination using global positioning system gps as well as various corrections for spacecraft accelerations not related to gravity changes many parameter choices and solution strategies are possible and they have been explored by gfz csr and jpl https grace jpl nasa gov data choosing a solution csr gfz and jpl all use different strategies to compute gravity field coefficients from the raw grace observations while using similar background models for the ocean and the atmosphere chambers 2006 the differences between solutions from jpl csr and gfz can be used to infer the uncertainty in level 2 and level 3 grace fields that arises from the choice of solution strategy in addition the different inputs and processing strategies can lead to differences between the three solutions of csr gfz and jpl as seen over the poles and within river basins sakumura et al 2014 the details of the differences of the three datasets can be obtained in sakumura et al 2014 in this study the monthly twsa data is from the three centers csr grz and jpl as the previous works scanlon et al 2018 for the three gldas models vic noah and mosaic the terrestrial water storage is computed based on the soil moisture the snow water equivalent and the plant canopy surface water the twsa datasets derived from pcr globwb 2 1958 2015 and the watergap global hydrology model wghm 2 2 1958 2014 are referred to as pcr and wghm respectively both of these datasets have a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 table 1 to better understand the twsa variations we used three climate variables from the climatic research unit timeseries cru ts v4 01 and the monthly surface climate china v2 0 zhao et al 2014 temperature precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration pet table1 our detailed investigation of the relationships between the twsa and these three climate variables as well as the control factors affecting the twsa variations throughout the casnw are listed in table 1 and discussed in the supplementary text s1 these datasets with the 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution are upscaled to the 1 1 spatial resolution of the grace based twsa our study period is from 2003 to 2014 at monthly seasonal and annual timescales because the monthly anomalies in the grace satellite datasets are typically computed relative to a time mean baseline 2004 2009 that includes all of the months we computed all of the other datasets in this study as the same process at the monthly scale 2 3 methodologies we computed the twsa of the ghms using all three ghm output variables soil moisture snow depth water equivalent and plant canopy surface water dynamic variations in twsa are revealed by the spatiotemporal distribution of the linear trends computed using the linear least square method the correlation coefficient quantifies the strength of the relationship between the twsa and these three different datasets with empirical orthogonal function eof analyses we can identify the dominant spatial twsa patterns and generate the twsa index time series hu et al 2014 we use the plsr method to simulate and predict the monthly twsa variations these methodologies and techniques are described in the following sections 2 3 1 twsa calculations we obtained twsa estimates from the grace pcr and wghm datasets directly for the vic noah and mosaic datasets we calculated the terrestrial water storage by summing the soil moisture storage in all layers snow depth water equivalent storage and plant canopy surface water storage twsa can be obtained as follows 1 twsa s m s a s w e s a p c w s a where smsa is soil moisture storage anomaly swesa is snow depth water equivalent storage anomaly and pcwsa is plant canopy surface water storage anomaly we derived the seasonal and annual twsa values by averaging the monthly twsa values note that the soil moisture dataset in this study is the summation of all the soil layers in the vic noah and mosaic datasets 2 3 2 linear trends seasonal trend decomposition stl and correlation coefficients we derived the linear trend is using the linear least square method with the significance tested by student s t test at the 95 p 0 05 and the 99 p 0 01 confidence levels according to previous studies the twsa time series are highly seasonal which suggests that the de seasonal process should be applied before computing the linear trends scanlon et al 2018 shamsudduha and taylor 2020 seasonal trend decomposition based on the loess stl filtering method was utilized for the time series analysis stl decomposes the time series into three components as follows 2 s total s long t e r m s seasonal s residual where the original signal stotal is decomposed into long term seasonal and residual components via calculations outlined in previous studies cleveland et al 1990 scanlon et al 2018 shamsudduha and taylor 2020 the long term signal can further be decomposed into its linear and non linear interannual components by fitting a trend using least squares linear regression and attributing the remaining long term signal to interannual signal the residuals reflect sub seasonal signals and noise in this study we only focus on the long term twsa trends that are revealed after stl analysis on a monthly timescales the linear trends of the other hydro climatic variables e g p t and pet are directly computed from their respective time series correlation coefficients measure the strength of the linear relationships between the monthly twsa values for the eight datasets i e csr gfz jpl vic noah mosaic pcr and wghm and the three climate factors i e temperature precipitation and pet 2 3 3 plsr method plsr is a robust analytical tool because it combines two techniques principal component analysis and multiple linear regression with plsr it is possible to overcome multicollinearity even when there are too many explanatory variables wold et al 2001 hu et al 2019a due to its prominent performance in multiple variables analysis it has been widely used in phenology research in recent years hu et al 2016a 2016b the details of the plsr procedure can be obtained in the supplementary methodology text s2 in this study we simulated and predicted the monthly twsa using plsr recent studies have demonstrated that climate change has a significantly impact on both twsa as a whole and its components e g soil moisture runoff and groundwater for example higher temperatures will turn some snowfall into rainfall resulting in an earlier snowmelt season and distinct changes in the timing and volume of the spring flooding oki and kanae 2006 as one of the main water flux contributors in the overall water balance precipitation directly affects the twsa variations and volumes hu et al 2019a because pet is responsible for more than 80 of the absolute streamflow changes observed in the headwaters we also explore the relationship between the pet and the streamflow component of twsa as such we use the precipitation anomaly pa the temperature anomaly ta and peta to simulate and predict the twsa variations by simulating the twsa across casnw we can identify the major drivers of change in the twsa additionally we can use climate and hydrological variables to effectively model the twsa in regions with little to no tws data 3 results the grace datasets used to derive the twsa time series include the grace mascon solution products csr mascons csr m and jpl mascons jpl m landerer et al 2020 wiese et al 2016 and rl05 or rl06 spherical harmonics solutions shc from csr jpl and gfz it is strongly recommended that individual scaling factors sfs are applied to the csr csr sf gfz gfz sf and jpl jpl sf grace shc products due to the attenuated surface mass variations that occur at small spatial scales during the sampling and post processing of the grace observations landerer and swenson 2012 in supplementary text s3 we conclude that for the purposes of detecting the twsa variations in central asia there is functionally no difference between the grace shc data sets and the grace sf shc datasets similarly the grace mascons solution products yield results that are similar to those of the grace shc datasets therefore the results we will discuss going forward are the twsa results derived from csr gfz and jpl grace datasets with no sf applied in this section we will first discuss the dynamic variations observed in the twsa including the temporal and spatial characteristics of the twsa across the six sub regions i e kaz uzb kgz tjk tkm and nw the five river basins i e the ob balkhash issyk aral and tarrim basins and the casnw as a whole from 2003 to 2014 secondly we investigate the results of the plsr simulation and prediction of the monthly twsa variations lastly we explore the relationships between the twsa variations and the cultivated area the population the water resource variables the water usage and the water stress to address sdgs related to the water resource storage in the arid regions of central asia 3 1 temporal variations in the monthly twsa datasets eight of the monthly twsa datasets exhibited similar temporal variations with the largest positive twsa values occurring between march and may mam and the smallest negative twsa values occurring between september and november son fig 2 fig 3 similarly most of the correlation coefficients for these variables are larger than 0 75 table 2 as expected higher correlation coefficients arises between the csr gfz and jpl grace satellite twsa variations i e the smallest correlation coefficient which demonstrates the strength of the relationship between the gfz and jpl datasets is 0 93 than they do between the three grace datasets and the five ghms fig 2 table 2 among the five ghms the mosaic dataset most closely matches the monthly twsa temporal variations recorded by the grace satellite datasets with correlation coefficients of 0 91 0 86 and 0 90 between the mosaic dataset and the csr gfz and jpl datasets respectively we obtained similar correlation coefficients between the long term components of the eight monthly twsa datasets using the stl method figure s4 table s3 we also observed similar intra annual twsa variations in the eight datasets with positive twsa values occurring from february to may and negative twsa values occurring from june to november fig 3 the grace satellite datasets and the mosaic dataset had the largest positive twsa values in april and the smallest negative twsa values in october with the exception of the mosaic dataset the five ghms had the largest positive twsa values in march and the smallest negative twsa values in september using the stl method we see that the long term components of the eight monthly twsa datasets have negative trends throughout the casnw from 2003 to 2014 which indicates that the terrestrial water storage is declining in this region these negative trends are statistically significant at the 99 confidence level p 0 01 with slopes ranging from 0 44 mm month to 0 04 mm month the monthly twsa depletion rates for the vic and mosaic datasets are similar to those of the csr gfz and jpl datasets while the other ghms underestimated the grace derived depletion rates this underestimation of the grace linear twsa trends by the ghms may arise because glacier and groundwater processes are not reflected in ghms scanlon et al 2018 2019 döll et al 2014a 2014b in reality et snow melting glacier mass retreat and groundwater discharge all contributed to the available water resources in central asia chen et al 2020 deng et al 2010a 2010b deng and chen 2017 3 2 spatial distribution of the linear trends in the monthly twsa datasets the spatial distributions and the eof analyses of the mean monthly twsa are shown in figures s5 s6 s7 the monthly twsa derived from the three grace satellite datasets exhibit similar spatial patterns with declining water storage values occurring in most of the sub regions of central asia figure s5 eof 1 results represent the differences in the temporal and spatial distributions of the monthly twsa variations between the different datasets figures s6 s7 an in depth discussion of the spatial patterns of the mean monthly twsa and their corresponding eof 1 results can be found in supplementary text s4 most of the long term components of the csr 85 gfz 78 and jpl 84 monthly twsa datasets have negative trends throughout the center and western parts of cas5 and large portion of the nw fig 4 a c and table s5 significant negative trends occur in 81 71 and 80 of for the csr gfz and jpl datasets across the casnw respectively our recent work hu et al 2019a demonstrated that the groundwater in most of xinjiang is significantly depleted in addition xinjiang has also experienced rising temperatures that have resulted in considerable snow and glacier melting hu et al 2014 the snow and glacier melting and the ongoing groundwater irrigation contribute to the twsa depletion that is occurring throughout nw the grace datasets have the significant positive twsa trends in the regions between the tarim basin and the kunlun mountains in most areas of cas5 the vic noah mosaic and pcr datasets have significant negative trends where the magnitudes of the noah and mosaic datasets are similar to those of the three grace satellite datasets fig 4d 4 g in a significant proportion of nw the three gldas lsms have positive twsa trends there does not appear to be a strong pattern in the spatial distribution of the monthly twsa trends from the wghm dataset fig 4h however the gldas glms tend to underestimate the degree of twsa depletion because these datasets exclude surface water and groundwater data due to the decreased precipitation and the increased pet large parts of casnw have significant negative twsa trends figure s8 and the positive trends in northeastern kaz and the areas between the tarim basin and the kunlun mountains are the result of increased precipitation figure s8 the noah and mosaic datasets have the similar spatial features in most of cas5 as these of the three grace satellite datasets vic and pcr also have the negative linear trends of twsa over large areas of cas5 for the ambiguous twsa trends patterns in the wghm dataset we infer that large uncertainties exist in this model throughout the casnw with the largest positive twsa values occurring between mam and the smallest negative twsa values occurring between son the seasonal timescales tend to only highlight these two seasons the spatial patterns of the seasonal i e mam and son and annual twsa trends are similar to those observed in the monthly twsa as discussed in supplementary text s5 3 3 twsa variabilities over the six subregions because of significant differences in the terrain and climate we observe strong variations in the spatial distribution of the water resources in the sub regions of the casnw based on the long term average annual precipitation in the cas5 the mul tiyear average surface water storage is about 18 77 km3 which accounts for 36 9 34 0 23 5 5 1 and 0 5 of the surface water resources in kaz tjk kgz uzb and tkm respectively united nations 2004 deng et al 2010a most of the region s groundwater resources are located in kaz tjk and kgz the distribution of water resources in nw also exhibited strong spatial variations to assess these differences we analyzed the water resource variations in these six sub regions based on the monthly twsa trends in all eight datasets the eight datasets exhibited similar temporal variationsin the monthly twsa trends in kaz kgz and tjk figures s12a c and d table s6 in uzb tkm and nw however the eight monthly twsa datasets differ significantly figures s12b e and f table s6 the three grace satellite datasets had the consistent temporal variations of monthly twsa over each of the six subregions except for the monthly twsa of vic in uzb and tkm similar temporal variations of the six ghms are observed over the six sub regions overall thetemporal variations in the monthly twsa datasets explain the spatial differences observed in the different sub regions in fig 4 moreover in kaz the intra annual variations of twsa are remarkably consistent while the eight twsa datasets are distinctly different from one another in the other sub regions figure s13 nearly every dataset is characterized by statistically significant 99 confidence level negative linear trends in all of the sub regions table s6 the largest depletion rates in the csr 0 98 mm month gfz 0 76 mm month and jpl 0 99 mm month datasets occur in tkm the second largest depletion rates occur in uzb and nw has the smallest depletion rates table s6 the average grace satellite twsa depletion rates for kaz 4 92 mm a uzb 8 5 mm a kgz 3 85 mm a tjk 2 31 mm a tkm 10 99 mm a and nw 2 53 mm a correspond to water mass losses of 0 33 gt a to 13 42 gt a table s7 the ghms tend to underestimate the grace satellite depletion rates in kaz uzb and tkm and overestimate with the exception of wghm the grace satellite depletion rates in kgz tkm and nw 3 4 twsa variations in the five major river and lake basins we analyzed the water resource changes in the balkhash lake basin balkhash the issyk kul lake basin issyk kul the aral sea basin aral the tarim river basin tarim and the ob river basin in casnw ob fig 1b the temporal variations and the linear monthly twsa trends for these basins with all eight datasets are shown in figure s14 and table s6 while the temporal variations in the monthly twsa trends for all eight datasets are relatively similar in the ob ballkhash issy kul and aral basins the trends in the tarim basin change over time figure s14 per the twsa trends serious water depletion occurs in the issyk kul and aral basins in the csr 0 33 mm month and 0 58 mm month gfz 0 16 mm month and 0 38 mm month jpl 0 35 mm month and 0 60 mm month vic 0 43 mm month and 0 31 mm month noah 0 16 mm month and 0 25 mm month mosaic 0 60 mm month and 0 56 mm month and pcr 0 28 mm month and 0 27 mm month table s6 the csr jpl vic noah mosaic and wghm datasets also exhibited statistically significant at the 95 or 95 confidence level negative twsa trends in the ob and balkhash basins within the three grace satellite datasets the tarim river basin had the lowest depletion rate the lsms and the ghms exhibit moderate negative twsa trends in the tarim river basin with the largest depletion values occurring in the vic 0 97 mm month and mosaic 0 56 mm month datasets there are no consistent trends in the monthly twsa values in the wghm dataset table s6 with the exception of the dataset differences observed in the tarim river basin the largest monthly twsa intra annual variations occurred in mam and the smallest monthly twsa intra annual variations occurred in son for the ob river balkhash lake issy kul lake and aral sea basins figure s15 3 5 simulation and prediction of the monthly twsa values based on the correlation coefficients calculated between twsa and climate factors discussed in supplementary text s6 table s8 we applied three month lags to the ta and peta data in order to simulate and predict the monthly twsa values in the csr gfz and jpl datasets and applied two month lags to the pa and peta data for the other five datasets lag 0 is set between pa and all the eight datasets a three month lag indicates that the ta parameter is three months ahead of the twsa with each total monthly twsa dataset spanning twelve years we used the first ten years 2003 2012 of the monthly datasets twsa ta pa and peta in the plsr analysis to determine the parameters of this function 3 twsa a 0 a 1 t a a 2 p a a 3 p e t a where a i i 0 1 2 3 are regression coefficients once the parameters of this function were defined we used the final two years of those datasets as input variables into function 3 for the purposes of predicting the twsa variations that occurred between january of 2013 and december of 2014 we then ascertained the degree of similarity between the original observed twsa value from the eight datasets and the twsa values simulated predicted by plsr using the coefficient of determination r2 the regression coefficients in this analysis are shown in table 3 the ta and pa datasets most heavily impact the twsa variations across casnw overall the inclusion of peta mitigates the twsa values because of the collective effects of the warming temperatures and decreasing precipitation occurring throughout casnw the simulated twsa values from january of 2003 to december of 2012 for all eight datasets are in close match for the seasonal variations and long term changes in the observed monthly twsa values r2 values range from 0 62 for csr and jpl to 0 85 for pcr and wghm fig 5 among the eight datasets the pcr and wghm datasets followed by the three gldas datasets most accurately simulate the observed monthly twsa trends the accuracy of the plsr predictions actually surpasses that of the simulation with r2 values ranging from 0 74 vic to 0 95 pcr excluding the noah r2 0 94 the twsa predictions from the three grace satellite datasets are more accurate than those of the vic and mosaic datasets fig 5a 5f by contrast twsa simulations of the first ten years of data for the vic and mosaic datasets were more accurate than those of the three grace satellite datasets as we have demonstrated this plsr technique can be used to drastically improve the prediction power of a given set of data we attribute the ability of the ghms to accurately simulate and predict the monthly twsa values to strength of the relationships between the cru climate factors and their input meteorological forcing datasets which include the gpcp dataset in the three gldas lsms rodell et al 2004 the cru dataset in the pcr model sutanudjaja et al 2018 and the gpcc dataset in the wghm model the differences in the plsr results among the various ghms are caused by their twsa datasets and indirectly by their different forcing datasets and model structures in the grace datasets however the plsr model did not accurately reproduce the downward trends of twsa in order to improve the simulating accuracy in the downward trends we added two variables into the plsr model that play a vital role in twsa smsa the soil moisture storage anomaly and swesa the snow depth water equivalent storage anomaly hu et al 2019a while the addition of these variables increased the ability of the datasets to reproduce the decreasing twsa trends the tradeoff is that the accuracy of the prediction results in 2013 2014 declined due to higher variable biases fig 5 figure s16 in future work as new datasets become available we hope to create a model that accurately simulates and predicts the monthly twsa values while maintaining small biases the detailed analysis of our plsr prediction results with the addition of smsa and swesa variables can be found in supplementary text s7 to investigate the spatial differences in the dataset simulations we explored the spatial variations in the coefficient of determination r2 coefficients of temperature a 1 precipitation a 2 and pet a 3 in the csr twsa and cru climate data fig 6 the monthly twsa values were accurately simulated over most of central asia with r2 values exceeding 0 4 in 68 of our study area fig 6a some regions such as nw tkm and uzb have negative temperature coefficients which indicates the negative impacts of the temperature on the twsa values fig 6b with the exception of negative values occurring in parts of northern kaz and almost all of tkm and uzb the coefficients of precipitation a 2 are largely positive especially in nw fig 6c as shown in fig 6 d negative pet coefficients values are found throughout most of cas5 in northern kaz in the region between cas5 and china and in southern and eastern nw in addition the regression coefficients for most of casnw are significant at the 95 confidence level fig 6a most areas have negative ta 71 64 and peta 78 66 regression coefficients which indicate temperature and pet tend cause the twsa to decrease by contrast more than half of our study area 66 57 has positive pa regression coefficients fig 6b 6d in uzb tkm and the northern part of kaz the pa regression coefficients are negative fig 6c the significant twsa depletion observed in uzb and tkm fig 4 is largely caused by the decreased precipitation and the increased pet figures s8b c in addition intensified human activity e g increased water usage in these two countries also contributes to changes in the twsa variations deng et al 2010a 2010b the increased precipitation in the northern part of kaz leads to higher twsa values fig 4 it is difficult to back out the mechanisms causing the twsa variations because of the complex hydrological processes at work in casnw deng et al 2010a 2010b deng and chen 2017 therefore we will comprehensively to explore the mechanisms that drive the twsa variations across the casnw until more and more data becomes available overall our results demonstrate that the machine learning approaches such as plsr can be used to accurately simulate and predict the monthly twsa variations by including future climate factors in models governed by machine learning techniques we hope to improve our ability to predict future twsa variations throughout casnw 3 6 sdg challenges declining twsa values and increasing water demands in this section we discuss the increasing water demand and the declining tws values with respect to sdg 6 4 2 as well as the water resource management strategies in central asia as defined in sdg 6 4 2 the water stress is the amount of freshwater drawdown as a proportion of the available freshwater resources after taking into account environmental water requirements http www fao org sustainable development goals indicators we explore three different aspects of this issue in our study area in central asia as 1 decreasing twsa derived from the three grace satellite datasets 2 changes in the cultivated area and the population and 3 renewable water resource storage and water withdrawal 3 6 1 decreasing twsa values in the three grace satellite datasets based on the annual average twsa values from the three grace satellite datasets the total water storage depletion in the arid regions of central asia is 4 74 mm a which was equivalent to a water loss rate of 28 76 gt a between 2003 and 2016 table s7 for the six sub regions kaz had the largest water storage depletion with a water mass rate of 13 42 gt a i e 4 92 mm a followed by tkm 5 4 gt a and 10 99 mm a and nw 5 23 gt a and 2 53 mm a uzb 3 8 gt a and 8 5 mm a kgz 0 77 gt a and 3 85 mm a and tjk 0 33 gt a and 2 31 mm a table s7 and tkm and uzb have the most significant water height reductions an observation that is consistent with the growing water consumption in these two countries deng et al 2010a 2010b among the five river and lake basins the aral sea basin had the largest water height reduction 6 39 mm a and water loss rate 7 88 gt a table s7 while the ob river basin experienced lesser declines in the water height 1 63 mm a and the water loss rate 1 32 gt a balkhash lake basin and issyk lake basin had the twsa rates of 2 19 mm a and 3 52 mm a in water height and the corresponding water mass rate were 0 93 gt a and 9 67 gt a the water storage depletion rates of the tarim river basin are 1 07 mm a in water height and 1 13 gt a in water mass table s7 3 6 2 changes in the cultivated area and the local population cultivated area arable land and permanent crops and population variations significantly impact a region s water consumption and water withdrawal especially in more arid regions in this section the cultivated area variation and the population of the five countries i e kaz kgz tjk tkm and uzb of central asia were analyzed to illustrate the water resource change over the arid regions of central asia the cultivated area of kaz increased from 2847 104 ha in 2002 to 2953 104 ha in 2014 with at a growth rate of 8 83 104 ha a which has a 3 72 increase in uzb the cultivated area decreased from 483 104 ha in 2002 to 469 104 ha in 2007 and then increased again to 477 104 ha in 2014 the cultivated area of kgz is decreased from 141 1 104 ha in 2002 to 135 6 104 ha in 2014 in tjk the amount of cultivated area was remained relatively consistent with values of 88 1 104 ha in 2002 and 87 104 ha in 2014 in tkm the cultivated area decreased from 210 104 ha in 2002 and 2007 to 200 104 ha in 2012 and 2014 table 4 kaz has the largest cultivated area followed by uzb and tkm while the irrigated area in kaz make up a relatively small percentage of the cultivated area in this state most of the cultivated areas in the other four countries are almost entirely irrigated uzb had the largest irrigated area in 2008 430 104 ha followed by kaz 188 7 104 ha tkm 185 104 ha and tjk 71 104 ha deng et al 2010a the population of all five countries have increased to some extent from 2003 to 2017 the population of kaz is increased from 15 23 million to 18 2 million and the uzb population increased from 25 83 million to 31 91 million further details on these population changes can be found in table s10 the changes in the cultivated area specifically in the extent of the irrigated area and the increased populations in these five central asia countries lead to higher water withdrawal and water consumption values 3 6 3 renewable water resource storage and water withdrawal in this section we analyzed six variables were from the aquastat database of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations these variables include three water resource variables i e total renewable water resources gt a total renewable surface water gt a total renewable groundwater gt a two water use variables agricultural water withdrawal gt a total water withdrawal gt a and water stress in sustainable development goal sdg 6 4 2 defined as the ratio between total freshwater withdrawn by major economic sectors and total renewable freshwater resources table 4 http www fao org nr water aquastat data query index html lang en in 2002 2007 2012 and 2014 the three water resource variables remained constant in each of the five countries there were no changes in the available water resources at this time table 4 the renewable water resources among the five countries had remarkable differences from 2002 to 2014 kaz had the largest total renewable water resources 108 4 gt a total renewable surface water 100 6 gt a and total renewable groundwater 33 85 gt a table s8 moreover kaz had the total renewable water resources and total renewable surface water more than 40 gt a and the total renewable groundwater with the value of 8 8 gt a kgz and kaz experienced water shortages can actively facing the shortage of water resources due to the large percentages of the total renewable groundwater in the total renewable water resources i e 58 and 31 and tkm uzb and tjk were vulnerable and sensitivity to the total renewable groundwater with the small percentages in the total renewable water resources i e 0 405 gt a 8 8 gt a 6 gt a and 1 64 18 and 27 38 respectively these results were satisfied with the water stress values of the five countries from sdg 6 4 2 table s8 moreover comparing the water storage depletion of the annual twsa the decreased annual twsa per year accounted for 12 38 3 26 1 51 21 8 and 7 79 of the total renewable water resources for kaz kgz tjk tkm and uzb respectively at the present depletion rate from1998 to 2007 uzb and tkm had more water use in total water withdrawal i e 60 58 gt in 2001 and 56 gt in 2005 for uzb 24 91 gt in 2000 and 27 95 gt in2004 for tkm and agriculture water withdrawal i e 54 78 gt in 2001 and 50 4 gt in 2005 for uzb 24 04 gt in 2000 and 26 36 gt in 2004 for tkm than kaz kgz and tjk between 2000 and 2010 the total water withdrawals in kaz and tkm increased from 2002 19 7 gt to 2010 21 14 gt and from 2000 24 91 gt to 2004 26 36 gt respectively while the decrease in the cultivated area in the other countries resulted in decreased in agricultural it displayed that the agricultural water withdrawal in central asia accounted to almost of the total water withdrawal e g larger than 90 for kgz tjk tkm and uzb table 4 between 2002 and 2010 kaz and tkm experience serious water shortages their water stresses increased from 26 26 to 28 14 and from 145 5 to 162 8 respectively by contrast the water stress values decreased in uzb from 151 8 in 2001 to 138 8 in 2005 kgz from 57 49 in 2000 to 43 95 in 2006 and tjk from 74 35 in 2000 to 71 36 in 2006 the distressingly high water stresses in tkm and uzb are a reflection of their larger depletion water storage rates with respect to the water height table s8 and table s1 furthermore when water stresses are larger than 100 the total renewable freshwater resources cannot satisfy the soceconomic water demand which may result in the groundwater over exploration 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty analyses of the monthly twsa values from the grace lsm and ghm datasets in the grace satellite datasets uncertainties arise due to signal filtering e g some useful signals are erased when we remove the high frequency noise and the coarse spatial and temporal resolutions of the grace dataseets long et al 2014 2015a long et al 2015b 2017 the uncertainties in the ghm datasets are caused by limited input datasets and an inability to accurately model complex hydrological processes scanlon et al 2018 hu et al 2019a to evaluate the robustness of our twsa results we conduct conducted uncertainty analyses on the monthly twsa values from the three grace satellite datasetsand the vic noah mosaic pcr and wghm models based on scanlon et al 2018 to ensure that the twsa uncertainties are comparable between different datasets we calculated the standard deviations stds with respect to the linear trends in each dataset the trend uncertainties reflect discrepancies in the slopes of the twsa in the three grace satellite datasets and the five models the multi model average of the linear monthly twsa trends derived from the three grace satellite datasets has a spatial distribution that is similar to those of the three grace datasets individually with negative trends located throughout most of casnw and positive trends occurring in the kunlun mountains and in northeastern kaz fig 4a c figure s17a for the other five models the spatial distributions of the mean linear trends had the weak negative trends in most of cas5 and weak positive trends in nw figure s17b the std values for the three grace dataset trends are smaller than 0 15 mm figure s17c while the std values for the five models are larger than 0 15 in most of casnw figure s17d to better monitor the terrestrial water cycle new datas from grace fo follow on interferometry synthetic aperture radar measurements more robust ghms and in situ observation networks should be incorporated into existing datasets using techniques such as plsr it is possible to improve the coarse spatial and temporal resolution of the grace satellite datasets hu et al 2019a tapley et al 2019 4 2 why are there differences in the grace ghm and lsm twsa trends possible explanations for the twsa differences between the grace ghmand lsm datasets have been explored in previous works scanlon et al 2018 2019 śliwińska et al 2019 however due to the large uncertainties caused by the different model structures or modeling approaches input forcing datasets e g climate forcing water use and land cover and model parameters and the complexity of hydrological processes at the regional and global scales schmied et al 2014 there has not yet been a consensus as to why these differences occur using our results we will address this issue with respect to the climate factors and human activity factors that contribute to the model and dataset uncertainties 4 2 1 effects of climate factors and human activity on twsa central asia hosts a number of complex water circulation and hydrologic processes that are further complicated by climate factors human activity and an inability to monitor important hydrological parameters such as the snowmelt runoff and groundwater chen et al 2019 li et al 2019 hu et al 2019a shen et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 the recent terrestrial water storage depletion in central asia has largely been attributed toa combination of climate factors and increased human activity deng and chen 2017 chen et al 2020 as seen in the cru dataset from 1980 to 2016 both the temperature 0 36 c 10a and pet 1 77 mm a increased significantly throughout central asia figure s18a c the precipitation only exhibited a weakly positive trend figure s18b increased temperatures lead to accelerated snow melting and glacier retreat which result in terrestrial water storage depletions throughout central asia brun et al 2017 yang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 from 2006 to 2016 the glacier mass change rate in central asia was 7 gt a during 2006 2016 zemp et al 2019 and from 2003 to 2010 the glacier mass balance retreat rate in the tianshan mountains was 5 6 gt a jacob et al 2012 the total annual seasonal delayed glacier melt rates are the highest in the aral basin 7 1 gt a followed by the tarim basin 3 6 gt a the balkhash basin 1 7 gt a and the chu issyk kul basin 0 6 gt a pritchard 2019 a positive glacier mass balance in the western kunlun mountains resulted in an increased terrestrial water storage in the southern tarim river basin yao et al 2012 deng and chen 2017 this data suggests that climate affects tws indirectly through changes in the mountain glaciers and in the snow cover due to increased anthropogenic activity the extent of the irrigated areas in central asia increased by 60 from 1962 to 2002 oberhänsli et al 2007 which drastically increased the groundwater withdrawal and significantly decreased the input water flow into the aral sea shibuo et al 2006 warming temperatures and shrinking lakes results in strong negative twsa trends throughout western central asia shi et al 2014 deng and chen 2017 4 2 2 major factors of uncertainty in the grace ghm and lsm it is possible that the sources of uncertainty in the grace satellite datasets the ghm and the lsms contribute to the twsa differences observed between the eight datasets models used in this study döll et al 2014a 2014b scanlon et al 2018 2019 śliwińska et al 2019 two major sources of uncertainty in the grace satellite datasets are the signal filtering processes and the low spatial resolution while bias signal loss due to low pass filtering of the grace satellite datasets and leakage errors signal gain from the surrounding due to low pass filtering can be corrected using the additive approach with synthetic data from lsms longuevergne et al 2010 the low spatial resolution remains a large source of potential error in the water storage ideally this low spatial resolution can be resolved by statistical downscaling or dynamical downscaling approaches because the ghms used in this study pcr globwb 2 and wghm are mainly based on water balance calculations these models account for human actions such as water usage and reservoir management scanlon et al 2018 2019 discrepancies between the ghm and the grace twsa trends arise due to differences in the initial conditions input datasets e g climate forcing and land cover model structures calibration and inclusion of human involvement scanlon et al 2018 schmied et al 2014 in addition an incomplete understanding of hydrological processes at the regional and global scales creates epistemic uncertainties schmied et al 2014 in pcr globwb 2 the forcing data set is based on time series of monthly precipitation temperatures and reference evaporation from the cru ts 3 2 data set of harris et al 2014 these variables have been downscaled to daily values using era40 1958 1978 and era interim 1979 2015 and that downscaling is a source of uncertainty in the model outputs due to structural errors this model cannot incorporate glacier and ice processes the groundwater response time or the effects of wetlands sutanudjaja et al 2018 because the wghm model include the monthly total runoff time series it accounts for both natural and anthropogenic changes in hydrological features such as groundwater recharge river discharge and water storage in diverse storage locations döll et al 2003 2012 werth and güntner 2010 schmied et al 2014 however to reduce model uncertainties wghm baseflow estimates evapotranspiration estimates snowmelt estimates the water balance calculations for wetlands and lakes and for the assessments of the land use and land cover alcamo et al 2003 must be improved with a lack of high quality input data it is unrealistic to expect wghm or any other hydrological model to compute accurate runoff and discharge döll et al 2003 by neglecting river channel losses and evaporation of runoff from small ephemeral ponds most models do a poorer job of simulating trends in semiarid and arid basins than they do in humid basins in all basins where discharge is controlled by man made reservoirs it is likely that the seasonality inaccurate because the wghm does not include information related to reservoir management with overly simplistic snow modeling algorithms wghm yields poor estimates of the discharge in snow dominated basins döll et al 2003 wghm does not include changes in irrigation water use efficiency crop patterns or groundwater abstractions as a fraction of total abstractions döll et al 2014a uncertainties in the estimated groundwater depletion stem from the fact that wghm simulates groundwater dynamics using a simple water balance approach rather than by considering hydraulic head gradients döll et al 2014a therefore although the global wghm model simulates the most important storage compartments including surface water and groundwater the simulation accuracy of this conceptual model was originally low for river discharge in snow dominated and semi arid regions döll et al 2003 2014a 2014b for the gldas lsms employed in this study i e vic noah and mosaic the initial conditions input datasets e g climate forcing and land cover model structures and calibration algorithms are sources of uncertainty for the output data of these lsms while the lsms account for water storage in the canopy snow and soil moisture these one dimensional models do not simulate lateral flow gldas lsms integrate observational data into the models in order to produce global summaries of land surface states e g soil moisture storage and fluxes e g evapotranspiration runoff that self consistent balanced with respect to water and energy and spatially and temporally continuous the parameters of the lsms are described in table s2 of scanlon et al 2018 the gldas lsms generally account for sub grid variability with vegetation tiles and grid cells but do not include water bodies such as rivers reservoirs and wetlands furthermore the lsms include a detailed soil vegetation atmosphere transfer scheme for simulating vegetation but neglect the effects of irrigated crops scanlon et al 2018 2019 4 2 3 potential factors causing the twsa differences in variousdatasets the sources of uncertainty in the grace datasets the ghms and the lsms may contribute to the observed differences between these datasets in the central asia twsa trends as discussed previously these uncertainties typically arise due to neglecting important parameters or parameter simplification the inability to accurate model the complexities in certain water circulation and and hydrologic processes e g snow mass loss glacier mass loss and irrigation as well as the questionable accuracy of the regional hydro climate data e g precipitation et and pet may also play a part in creating twsa variations for the first aspect the uncertainties of twsa derived from grace are straight forward caused by the two major factors of the filtering process and the coarse spatial resolution long et al 2014 2015a long et al 2015b 2017 for ghms and lsms the initial conditions input datasets and model structure contribute to the large uncertainties of twsa surface water storage and groundwater storage are not included in the lsms which result in the underestimation of the twsa depletion derived from grace although the most important storage compartments including surface water and groundwater are simulated in ghms there are still large uncertainties caused by the limited input data at regional and global scales especially in the arid and semiarid regions döll et al 2014a 2014b scanlon et al 2018 2019 in the second aspect as a typical arid and semi arid region central asia is governed by a highly complex water circulation and hydrologic processes that are very sensitive to regional climate changes and anthropogenic activity chen 2012 hu et al 2019a additionally due to a lack of accessibility it is very difficult to obtain in situ hydrological data in central asia hu et al 2014 2016a 2016b 2018 the lack of independent accurate model constraints heavily impacts the forcing datasets that form the basis of the ghms and lsms and the data that is used to calibrate the grace ghm and lsm datasets to minimize the twsa differences in various datasets we recommend that the grace satellite datasets should incorporate higher resolution data e g grace follow on and employ more effective filtering techniques we also suggest that future ghms and lsms should find more sophisticated ways to represent complex hydrologic processes in future moreover the integration of complimentary observation data to further constrain the simulation and calibration of single storage compartments is encouraged 4 3 impacts of irrigation on the twsa depletion agriculture water withdrawal i e irrigation accounts for 90 of the total water withdrawal 91 of the agriculture water withdrawal occurs in surface waters and the residual withdrawal 9 is from groundwater sources fao water report 39 2013 from 1940 to 1999 the irrigation area and the corresponding water withdrawal in the aral sea basin dramatically increased from 52 3 k m3 and 385 104 hm2 to 108 9 km3 and 789 6 104 hm2 deng et al 2010b for a more in depth investigation into the impact of irrigation on twsa in the casnw refer to our previous study hu et al 2019a which compares the twsa values in irrigated regions and non irrigated regions figure s19a shows the irrigated regions in casnw this data was extracted from the global map of irrigation areas gmia v5 0 of the fao http www fao org nr water aquastat irrigationmap index10 stm in this analysis a grid that covered irrigated areas was defined as an irrigated grid otherwise it was a non irrigated grid based on this definition 132 irrigated grids and 537 non irrigated grids were identified figure s19b the annual twsa of the irrigated grids was compared with the averaged twsa of their surrounding non irrigated grids based on student s t test at the 95 significance level the irrigated grids without any surrounding non irrigated grids were excluded in the comparison twsa in 19 of the irrigated grids red grids in figure s19b were significantly different from their surrounding non irrigated grids based on this result we infer that agricultural irrigation exerts considerable influence over the twsa the average twsa depletion rate in the irrigated grids 4 58 mm a is slightly higher than that of the adjacent non irrigated grids 4 55 mm a which indicates that agricultural irrigation exacerbates the twsa depletion moreover the largest twsa depletion which occurs in the aral sea basin is caused by the shrinking of the aral sea micklin 1988 deng et al 2010b pekel et al 2016 however 81 of the irrigated grids with no significant difference compared with their surrounding non irrigated grids due to the limited inclusion of complex hydrological processes in the grace datasets it is difficult to accurately quantify the relationship between irrigation and twsa in central asia 4 4 possible sustainable water resource management strategies due to climate change and anthropogenic activity the available water resources in the arid regions of central asia precipitously declined between 2003 and 2014 as the population continues to grow the increased water withdrawal will continue to negatively impact the tws in the arid regions of central asia the heightened water demand and the declining tws may result in serious environmental and ecological issues such as groundwater depletion water pollution and desertification deng et al 2010a 2010b moreover the lack of available water may aggravate the water related conflicts between these five countries therefore strategies to achieve the sdgs in central asia are desperately needed the mismatch between the natural distribution of the water resources and the actual water use is one of the key drivers of water resource issues in central asia with respect to these five countries 90 of the natural water resources are located in kaz kgz and tjk but these three countries account for less than 40 of the total water use by contrast 10 of the natural water sources are located in uzb and tkm but the water usage in these two countries accounts for 65 of the total water usage in all five countries deng et al 2010a 2010b therefore developing and promoting transboundary water sharing agreements will help to balance competing water demands and defuse potential conflicts united nations strengthening cooperation for rational and efficient use of water and energy resources in central asia r new york un 2004 in central asia the agricultural water withdrawal specifically irrigation accounts for more than 60 of the total water withdrawal therefore reducing the agricultural water consumption is another possible sustainable water resource management strategy for example by using more efficient equipment or by planting crops that require less water agricultural users can reduce the overall agricultural withdrawal deng et al 2010a 2010b creating a water saving society controlling the rapidly increase population and recharging the groundwater at high flow years are other possible strategies that could be employed as sustainable water resource management techniques in the arid regions of central asia 5 conclusions in this study we analyzed the dynamical variations simulation and prediction and sustainable development in the water resources in the arid regions of central asia our sources for this study include three grace satellite datasets i e csr gfz and jpl and five ghms i e vic noah mosaic pcr and wghm that span the time period from 2003 to 2014 with three climate factors temperature precipitation and pet as the predictor variables we used plsr a machine learning approach to simulate and predict the monthly twsa we explored the state of the water resources in the arid regions of central asia by examining the relationships between the observed twsa changes and driving forces such as cultivated area population three water resource variables two water use variables and the water stress due to a lack of observational data we only compared the linear trends of twsa between the grace datasets and the ghms datasets our major findings are as follows 1 with the exception of the mosaic model most of the models underestimated the terrestrial water storage depletion values derived from the grace datasets the grace datasets and the vic mosaic and pcr models exhibited significant decreasing twsa trends at monthly seasonal and annual scales in the arid regions of central asia from the grace satellite datasets we observed negative monthly trends in northern and central xinjiang and in northern western and southern cas5 while the ghms only generate negative twsa trends the grace satellite datasets and the lsms reveal positive twsa trends in northeastern kaz and southern xinjiang 2 between 2003 and 2014 the average terrestrial water storage rate of change and the average water mass loss produced by the grace satellite datasets are 4 74 mm a and 28 76 gt a respectively in the six sub regions tkm had the highest water depletion rate with respect to the water height and kaz had the highest water depletion rate with respect to the water mass of the five river and lake basins the aral sea basin had the most serious water storage loss in terms of both water height and the water mass 3 with temperature precipitation and pet as the predictor variables we used plsr to simulate and predict the monthly twsa variations by extending the time series and increasing the spatial resolution of the grace satellite datasets the influence that precipitation exerts over the twsa variations is stronger than that of the temperature and the pet 4 action must be taken to mitigate the climate factors and the anthropogenic activity that are responsible for the water storage depletion in central asia for improved water resource management in central asia the casnw nations must cooperate with one another and develop water resource management strategies such as water saving agricultural policies and technologies more in situ measurements and future satellite remote sensing missions e g grace fo launched in 2018 that extend the long term hydrological observations will be essential for the continued assessment of the changes in terrestrial water storage and its components e g soil moisture and groundwater machine learning techniques can be used to accurately predict future twsa variations which will help researchers and decision makers to better understand the features of the terrestrial water cycle by making more accurate information about the terrestrial water storage and other key hydrological parameters available for study it is possible to achieve the sdgs by balancing the needs

4677,arid regions of central asia have sensitive ecosystems that rely heavily on terrestrial water storage which is composed of surface water storage soil moisture storage and groundwater storage therefore we employed three gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite datasets and five global hydrological models ghms to explore the terrestrial water storage tws changes over arid regions of central asia from 2003 to 2014 we observed significantly decreasing water storage trends in the grace data which were underestimated by the ghms after averaging the three grace satellite datasets we found that the water storage was decreasing at a rate of 4 74 mm year contrary to the prevailing declining water storage trends northeastern kazakhstan kaz and southern xinjiang increased their water storage over the same period the grace data showed that turkmenistan tkm uzbekistan uzb and kaz experienced the most severe water depletions while tajikistan tjk and northwest china nw experienced the least significant depletions with respect to the major river and lake basins the aral sea basin exhibited the most serious water loss 0 60 mm month to 0 38 mm month the water storage positively correlates with the precipitation and negatively correlates with a three month lag with temperature and potential evapotranspiration pet partial least square regression plsr had the high capability in simulating and predicting the tws these results provide scientific evidence and guidance for local policy makers working toward sustainable water resource management and the resolution of international water resource disputes among central asian countries keywords terrestrial water storage global hydrological model grace satellite dataset partial least square regression central asia 1 introduction due to global warming rapid population growth and unsustainable water withdrawal practices regional and global water scarcity is becoming increasingly severe this scarcity negatively impacts food security human health environmental sustainability and economic development oki and kanae 2006 unsurprisingly sustainable water management is a fundamental aspect of the sustainable development goals sdgs of the united nations development programme undp wood and declerck 2015 in the global water cycle water precipitates from the atmosphere travels on the surface and through groundwater to the oceans and evaporates or transpires back to the atmosphere from land or evaporates from the oceans with respect to the overall water storage oceans have the largest water volume followed by glaciers snow and groundwater oki and kanae 2006 as a critical state variable in the water cycle and as a major renewable freshwater resource terrestrial water storage encompasses surface water storage lakes rivers and reservoirs canopy interception snow water equivalent soil moisture storage and groundwater storage rodell et al 2018 water resources have been profoundly influenced by climate change and extensive anthropogenic activity the resulting changes in the hydrological cycle pose a threat to sustainable water use and agricultural production due to the cost of installing and maintaining instrument networks data gaps and the lack of digitization and sharing of existing data it is difficult to assess the changes in the global tws using in situ measurements alone long et al 2014 rodell et al 2018 global hydrological models ghms which model the regional and global water fluxes and storage usually include global land surface models lsms and global hydrological and water resource models ghwrms both of which could provide insight into the global tws scanlon et al 2018 large uncertainties exist in their outputs however mostly because of the limited in situ observations for model inputs and the model structural errors satellite remote sensing products are an efficient way to monitor the water storage and water fluxes in an ever changing world launched in 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites have been likened to giant weighing scales in the sky that monitor monthly changes in mass as water storage increases or decreases relative to climate variability and human activity compared to ghms grace satellites provide more direct estimates of changes in terrestrial water storage that are derived from the time variable gravity field which is considered the big picture in terms of the global water storage recent studies of grace satellite datasets have focused on the following questions 1 identifying the terrestrial water storage variations over regional and global scales long et al 2017 2 analyzing changes in the tws contribution from groundwater evapotranspiration floods droughts and glaciers mass balance long et al 2014 long et al 2020 and 3 discussing the effects of climate change and human activity on terrestrial water storage variations rodell et al 2018 furthermore grace satellite datasets have been used in many studies to validate ghm outputs döll et al 2014a 2014b however because grace satellite datasets have limitations within the time period i e only from 2002 to present that cannot reflect the long term terrestrial water storage variations machine learning is an efficient approach to simulating predicting and expandingthe grace satellite time series for the purposes of conducting long term analyses of the terrestrial water storage sun 2013 mukherjee and ramachandran 2018 recent works have demonstrated that machine learning can accurately simulate hydrological changes and variations using the certain climate and hydrological variables such as precipitation temperature evaporation and soil moisture long et al 2017 hu et al 2019a globally arid regions host more than 38 of the total global population these regions are more sensitive and thus vulnerable to the effects of climate change and human activity than areas that are wet and subhumid in these arid areas tws variations have a more immediate impact on humanity and on the environmental ecosystem therefore a comprehensive and detailed investigation of terrestrial water storage changes and variations in these arid regions may provide a more thorough understanding of how climate change and anthropogenic activity affect the water storage and other related hydrological processes central asia is the largest arid area region in the eurasian continent and represents a key area of the silk road the ecological system as well as human society in central asia are vulnerable and sensitive to variations in water availability chen 2012 the spatial distribution of water storage is largely dictated by the complex topography of this region unsurprisingly conflicts arise when different countries attempt to manage transboundary water resources moreover the aral sea crisis was a global ecological disaster that was caused in large part by unsustainable water resource management deng et al 2010a 2010b in our study of the water storage in central asia we hope to answer the following questions 1 how does the terrestrial water storage change across central asia 2 using certain climate and hydrological variables is it possible to simulate or predict the terrestrial water storage variations with machine learning techniques 3 how does water resource management affect the terrestrial water storage variations and vice versa to address these questions we first investigated the spatial and temporal tws variations in the arid regions of central asia using the grace satellite datasets and the ghms then using certain climate and hydrological factors we employed the partial least square regression plsr approach to simulate and predict these tws variations while also exploring the impact of climate factors and human activity on the tws lastly by analysing the relationship between the twsa and water resources management techniques we propose potential sustainable water resource development strategies that may help us to achieve the sdgs outlined in the undp 2 study area datasets and methodologies 2 1 study area the arid regions of central asia casnw area of 607 08 104 km2 include northwest china nw area of 206 43 104 km2 and the five central asia states cas5 kazakhstan kaz 272 49 104 km2 uzbekistan uzb 44 74 104 km2 kyrgyzstan kgz 19 99 104 km2 tajikistan tjk 14 31 104 km2 and turkmenistan tkm 49 12 104 km2 fig 1 a chen 2012 chen and zhou 2015 this region is in the hinterland of the eurasian continent and has complex terrain and geomorphic features including the altai tianshan kunlun and qilian mountain ranges the major lakes and rivers include balkhash lake issyk kul lake the aral sea the syr darya the amu darya and the tarrim river fig 1 the major basins in this region include the balkhash lake basin balkhash issyk kul lake basin issyk kul aral sea basin aral and tarim river basin tarim as well as the ob river basin in casnw ob with areas of 42 37 104 km2 19 10 105 km2 123 31 104 km2 105 17 104 km2 and of 81 49 104 km2 respectively fig 1b this region is dominated by an arid semiarid climate that is controlled primarily by the westerly winds chen and zhou 2015 the atlantic ocean and the arctic ocean provide the most significant moisture fluxes in the regions while the tianshan mountains and the pamir mountains largely hinder moisture fluxes from the pacific ocean and the indian ocean schiemann et al 2008 chen et al 2018 during el niño some of the moisture fluxes that originate in the indian ocean are carried by the westerly winds where they contribute to the precipitation that occurs over most parts of central asia especially in the middle southern central region mariotti 2007 hu et al 2017 2018 from 1951 to 2013 the surface temperature has increased steadily across the entire area with a wetting trend emerging in nw and a drying trend emerging in cas5 hu et al 2014 2019b 2 2 datasets in this study we derived the terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa using three data sources the first source is the three release 5 rl05 of the monthly grace tellus level 3 from the centre for space research csr the geoforschungszentrum gfz and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl https grace jpl nasa gov data get data tapley et al 2004 wahr et al 2004 the second source consists of three global land data assimilation system gldas land surface models lsms including variable infiltration capacity vic and mosaic from the gldas version 1 gldas 1 and the noah from gldas version 2 1 gldaa 2 1 rodell et al 2009 the third source is two ghwrms known as pcr globwb 2 sutanudjaja et al 2018 and the watergap water global assessment and prognosis global hydrology model wghm 2 2 alcamo et al 2003 döll et al 2014a 2014b schmied et al 2014 the monthly grace satellite datasets are from april 2002 to january with a spatial resolution of 1 1 we calculate the twsa for each of the csr gfz and jpl datasets using linear interpolation and monthly mean values to fill in any data gaps in the time series recorded deriving monthly gravity field variations from grace observations requires a complex inversion of a relative range of observations between the two formation flying grace spacecraft in combination with a precise orbit determination using global positioning system gps as well as various corrections for spacecraft accelerations not related to gravity changes many parameter choices and solution strategies are possible and they have been explored by gfz csr and jpl https grace jpl nasa gov data choosing a solution csr gfz and jpl all use different strategies to compute gravity field coefficients from the raw grace observations while using similar background models for the ocean and the atmosphere chambers 2006 the differences between solutions from jpl csr and gfz can be used to infer the uncertainty in level 2 and level 3 grace fields that arises from the choice of solution strategy in addition the different inputs and processing strategies can lead to differences between the three solutions of csr gfz and jpl as seen over the poles and within river basins sakumura et al 2014 the details of the differences of the three datasets can be obtained in sakumura et al 2014 in this study the monthly twsa data is from the three centers csr grz and jpl as the previous works scanlon et al 2018 for the three gldas models vic noah and mosaic the terrestrial water storage is computed based on the soil moisture the snow water equivalent and the plant canopy surface water the twsa datasets derived from pcr globwb 2 1958 2015 and the watergap global hydrology model wghm 2 2 1958 2014 are referred to as pcr and wghm respectively both of these datasets have a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 table 1 to better understand the twsa variations we used three climate variables from the climatic research unit timeseries cru ts v4 01 and the monthly surface climate china v2 0 zhao et al 2014 temperature precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration pet table1 our detailed investigation of the relationships between the twsa and these three climate variables as well as the control factors affecting the twsa variations throughout the casnw are listed in table 1 and discussed in the supplementary text s1 these datasets with the 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution are upscaled to the 1 1 spatial resolution of the grace based twsa our study period is from 2003 to 2014 at monthly seasonal and annual timescales because the monthly anomalies in the grace satellite datasets are typically computed relative to a time mean baseline 2004 2009 that includes all of the months we computed all of the other datasets in this study as the same process at the monthly scale 2 3 methodologies we computed the twsa of the ghms using all three ghm output variables soil moisture snow depth water equivalent and plant canopy surface water dynamic variations in twsa are revealed by the spatiotemporal distribution of the linear trends computed using the linear least square method the correlation coefficient quantifies the strength of the relationship between the twsa and these three different datasets with empirical orthogonal function eof analyses we can identify the dominant spatial twsa patterns and generate the twsa index time series hu et al 2014 we use the plsr method to simulate and predict the monthly twsa variations these methodologies and techniques are described in the following sections 2 3 1 twsa calculations we obtained twsa estimates from the grace pcr and wghm datasets directly for the vic noah and mosaic datasets we calculated the terrestrial water storage by summing the soil moisture storage in all layers snow depth water equivalent storage and plant canopy surface water storage twsa can be obtained as follows 1 twsa s m s a s w e s a p c w s a where smsa is soil moisture storage anomaly swesa is snow depth water equivalent storage anomaly and pcwsa is plant canopy surface water storage anomaly we derived the seasonal and annual twsa values by averaging the monthly twsa values note that the soil moisture dataset in this study is the summation of all the soil layers in the vic noah and mosaic datasets 2 3 2 linear trends seasonal trend decomposition stl and correlation coefficients we derived the linear trend is using the linear least square method with the significance tested by student s t test at the 95 p 0 05 and the 99 p 0 01 confidence levels according to previous studies the twsa time series are highly seasonal which suggests that the de seasonal process should be applied before computing the linear trends scanlon et al 2018 shamsudduha and taylor 2020 seasonal trend decomposition based on the loess stl filtering method was utilized for the time series analysis stl decomposes the time series into three components as follows 2 s total s long t e r m s seasonal s residual where the original signal stotal is decomposed into long term seasonal and residual components via calculations outlined in previous studies cleveland et al 1990 scanlon et al 2018 shamsudduha and taylor 2020 the long term signal can further be decomposed into its linear and non linear interannual components by fitting a trend using least squares linear regression and attributing the remaining long term signal to interannual signal the residuals reflect sub seasonal signals and noise in this study we only focus on the long term twsa trends that are revealed after stl analysis on a monthly timescales the linear trends of the other hydro climatic variables e g p t and pet are directly computed from their respective time series correlation coefficients measure the strength of the linear relationships between the monthly twsa values for the eight datasets i e csr gfz jpl vic noah mosaic pcr and wghm and the three climate factors i e temperature precipitation and pet 2 3 3 plsr method plsr is a robust analytical tool because it combines two techniques principal component analysis and multiple linear regression with plsr it is possible to overcome multicollinearity even when there are too many explanatory variables wold et al 2001 hu et al 2019a due to its prominent performance in multiple variables analysis it has been widely used in phenology research in recent years hu et al 2016a 2016b the details of the plsr procedure can be obtained in the supplementary methodology text s2 in this study we simulated and predicted the monthly twsa using plsr recent studies have demonstrated that climate change has a significantly impact on both twsa as a whole and its components e g soil moisture runoff and groundwater for example higher temperatures will turn some snowfall into rainfall resulting in an earlier snowmelt season and distinct changes in the timing and volume of the spring flooding oki and kanae 2006 as one of the main water flux contributors in the overall water balance precipitation directly affects the twsa variations and volumes hu et al 2019a because pet is responsible for more than 80 of the absolute streamflow changes observed in the headwaters we also explore the relationship between the pet and the streamflow component of twsa as such we use the precipitation anomaly pa the temperature anomaly ta and peta to simulate and predict the twsa variations by simulating the twsa across casnw we can identify the major drivers of change in the twsa additionally we can use climate and hydrological variables to effectively model the twsa in regions with little to no tws data 3 results the grace datasets used to derive the twsa time series include the grace mascon solution products csr mascons csr m and jpl mascons jpl m landerer et al 2020 wiese et al 2016 and rl05 or rl06 spherical harmonics solutions shc from csr jpl and gfz it is strongly recommended that individual scaling factors sfs are applied to the csr csr sf gfz gfz sf and jpl jpl sf grace shc products due to the attenuated surface mass variations that occur at small spatial scales during the sampling and post processing of the grace observations landerer and swenson 2012 in supplementary text s3 we conclude that for the purposes of detecting the twsa variations in central asia there is functionally no difference between the grace shc data sets and the grace sf shc datasets similarly the grace mascons solution products yield results that are similar to those of the grace shc datasets therefore the results we will discuss going forward are the twsa results derived from csr gfz and jpl grace datasets with no sf applied in this section we will first discuss the dynamic variations observed in the twsa including the temporal and spatial characteristics of the twsa across the six sub regions i e kaz uzb kgz tjk tkm and nw the five river basins i e the ob balkhash issyk aral and tarrim basins and the casnw as a whole from 2003 to 2014 secondly we investigate the results of the plsr simulation and prediction of the monthly twsa variations lastly we explore the relationships between the twsa variations and the cultivated area the population the water resource variables the water usage and the water stress to address sdgs related to the water resource storage in the arid regions of central asia 3 1 temporal variations in the monthly twsa datasets eight of the monthly twsa datasets exhibited similar temporal variations with the largest positive twsa values occurring between march and may mam and the smallest negative twsa values occurring between september and november son fig 2 fig 3 similarly most of the correlation coefficients for these variables are larger than 0 75 table 2 as expected higher correlation coefficients arises between the csr gfz and jpl grace satellite twsa variations i e the smallest correlation coefficient which demonstrates the strength of the relationship between the gfz and jpl datasets is 0 93 than they do between the three grace datasets and the five ghms fig 2 table 2 among the five ghms the mosaic dataset most closely matches the monthly twsa temporal variations recorded by the grace satellite datasets with correlation coefficients of 0 91 0 86 and 0 90 between the mosaic dataset and the csr gfz and jpl datasets respectively we obtained similar correlation coefficients between the long term components of the eight monthly twsa datasets using the stl method figure s4 table s3 we also observed similar intra annual twsa variations in the eight datasets with positive twsa values occurring from february to may and negative twsa values occurring from june to november fig 3 the grace satellite datasets and the mosaic dataset had the largest positive twsa values in april and the smallest negative twsa values in october with the exception of the mosaic dataset the five ghms had the largest positive twsa values in march and the smallest negative twsa values in september using the stl method we see that the long term components of the eight monthly twsa datasets have negative trends throughout the casnw from 2003 to 2014 which indicates that the terrestrial water storage is declining in this region these negative trends are statistically significant at the 99 confidence level p 0 01 with slopes ranging from 0 44 mm month to 0 04 mm month the monthly twsa depletion rates for the vic and mosaic datasets are similar to those of the csr gfz and jpl datasets while the other ghms underestimated the grace derived depletion rates this underestimation of the grace linear twsa trends by the ghms may arise because glacier and groundwater processes are not reflected in ghms scanlon et al 2018 2019 döll et al 2014a 2014b in reality et snow melting glacier mass retreat and groundwater discharge all contributed to the available water resources in central asia chen et al 2020 deng et al 2010a 2010b deng and chen 2017 3 2 spatial distribution of the linear trends in the monthly twsa datasets the spatial distributions and the eof analyses of the mean monthly twsa are shown in figures s5 s6 s7 the monthly twsa derived from the three grace satellite datasets exhibit similar spatial patterns with declining water storage values occurring in most of the sub regions of central asia figure s5 eof 1 results represent the differences in the temporal and spatial distributions of the monthly twsa variations between the different datasets figures s6 s7 an in depth discussion of the spatial patterns of the mean monthly twsa and their corresponding eof 1 results can be found in supplementary text s4 most of the long term components of the csr 85 gfz 78 and jpl 84 monthly twsa datasets have negative trends throughout the center and western parts of cas5 and large portion of the nw fig 4 a c and table s5 significant negative trends occur in 81 71 and 80 of for the csr gfz and jpl datasets across the casnw respectively our recent work hu et al 2019a demonstrated that the groundwater in most of xinjiang is significantly depleted in addition xinjiang has also experienced rising temperatures that have resulted in considerable snow and glacier melting hu et al 2014 the snow and glacier melting and the ongoing groundwater irrigation contribute to the twsa depletion that is occurring throughout nw the grace datasets have the significant positive twsa trends in the regions between the tarim basin and the kunlun mountains in most areas of cas5 the vic noah mosaic and pcr datasets have significant negative trends where the magnitudes of the noah and mosaic datasets are similar to those of the three grace satellite datasets fig 4d 4 g in a significant proportion of nw the three gldas lsms have positive twsa trends there does not appear to be a strong pattern in the spatial distribution of the monthly twsa trends from the wghm dataset fig 4h however the gldas glms tend to underestimate the degree of twsa depletion because these datasets exclude surface water and groundwater data due to the decreased precipitation and the increased pet large parts of casnw have significant negative twsa trends figure s8 and the positive trends in northeastern kaz and the areas between the tarim basin and the kunlun mountains are the result of increased precipitation figure s8 the noah and mosaic datasets have the similar spatial features in most of cas5 as these of the three grace satellite datasets vic and pcr also have the negative linear trends of twsa over large areas of cas5 for the ambiguous twsa trends patterns in the wghm dataset we infer that large uncertainties exist in this model throughout the casnw with the largest positive twsa values occurring between mam and the smallest negative twsa values occurring between son the seasonal timescales tend to only highlight these two seasons the spatial patterns of the seasonal i e mam and son and annual twsa trends are similar to those observed in the monthly twsa as discussed in supplementary text s5 3 3 twsa variabilities over the six subregions because of significant differences in the terrain and climate we observe strong variations in the spatial distribution of the water resources in the sub regions of the casnw based on the long term average annual precipitation in the cas5 the mul tiyear average surface water storage is about 18 77 km3 which accounts for 36 9 34 0 23 5 5 1 and 0 5 of the surface water resources in kaz tjk kgz uzb and tkm respectively united nations 2004 deng et al 2010a most of the region s groundwater resources are located in kaz tjk and kgz the distribution of water resources in nw also exhibited strong spatial variations to assess these differences we analyzed the water resource variations in these six sub regions based on the monthly twsa trends in all eight datasets the eight datasets exhibited similar temporal variationsin the monthly twsa trends in kaz kgz and tjk figures s12a c and d table s6 in uzb tkm and nw however the eight monthly twsa datasets differ significantly figures s12b e and f table s6 the three grace satellite datasets had the consistent temporal variations of monthly twsa over each of the six subregions except for the monthly twsa of vic in uzb and tkm similar temporal variations of the six ghms are observed over the six sub regions overall thetemporal variations in the monthly twsa datasets explain the spatial differences observed in the different sub regions in fig 4 moreover in kaz the intra annual variations of twsa are remarkably consistent while the eight twsa datasets are distinctly different from one another in the other sub regions figure s13 nearly every dataset is characterized by statistically significant 99 confidence level negative linear trends in all of the sub regions table s6 the largest depletion rates in the csr 0 98 mm month gfz 0 76 mm month and jpl 0 99 mm month datasets occur in tkm the second largest depletion rates occur in uzb and nw has the smallest depletion rates table s6 the average grace satellite twsa depletion rates for kaz 4 92 mm a uzb 8 5 mm a kgz 3 85 mm a tjk 2 31 mm a tkm 10 99 mm a and nw 2 53 mm a correspond to water mass losses of 0 33 gt a to 13 42 gt a table s7 the ghms tend to underestimate the grace satellite depletion rates in kaz uzb and tkm and overestimate with the exception of wghm the grace satellite depletion rates in kgz tkm and nw 3 4 twsa variations in the five major river and lake basins we analyzed the water resource changes in the balkhash lake basin balkhash the issyk kul lake basin issyk kul the aral sea basin aral the tarim river basin tarim and the ob river basin in casnw ob fig 1b the temporal variations and the linear monthly twsa trends for these basins with all eight datasets are shown in figure s14 and table s6 while the temporal variations in the monthly twsa trends for all eight datasets are relatively similar in the ob ballkhash issy kul and aral basins the trends in the tarim basin change over time figure s14 per the twsa trends serious water depletion occurs in the issyk kul and aral basins in the csr 0 33 mm month and 0 58 mm month gfz 0 16 mm month and 0 38 mm month jpl 0 35 mm month and 0 60 mm month vic 0 43 mm month and 0 31 mm month noah 0 16

significant at the 95 or 95 confidence level negative twsa trends in the ob and balkhash basins within the three grace satellite datasets the tarim river basin had the lowest depletion rate the lsms and the ghms exhibit moderate negative twsa trends in the tarim river basin with the largest depletion values occurring in the vic 0 97 mm month and mosaic 0 56 mm month datasets there are no consistent trends in the monthly twsa values in the wghm dataset table s6 with the exception of the dataset differences observed in the tarim river basin the largest monthly twsa intra annual variations occurred in mam and the smallest monthly twsa intra annual variations occurred in son for the ob river balkhash lake issy kul lake and aral sea basins figure s15 3 5 simulation and prediction of the monthly twsa values based on the correlation coefficients calculated between twsa and climate factors discussed in supplementary text s6 table s8 we applied three month lags to the ta and peta data in order to simulate and predict the monthly twsa values in the csr gfz and jpl datasets and applied two month lags to the pa and peta data for the other five datasets lag 0 is set between pa and all the eight datasets a three month lag indicates that the ta parameter is three months ahead of the twsa with each total monthly twsa dataset spanning twelve years we used the first ten years 2003 2012 of the monthly datasets twsa ta pa and peta in the plsr analysis to determine the parameters of this function 3 twsa a 0 a 1 t a a 2 p a a 3 p e t a where a i i 0 1 2 3 are regression coefficients once the parameters of this function were defined we used the final two years of those datasets as input variables into function 3 for the purposes of predicting the twsa variations that occurred between january of 2013 and december of 2014 we then ascertained the degree of similarity between the original observed twsa value from the eight datasets and the twsa values simulated predicted by plsr using the coefficient of determination r2 the regression coefficients in this analysis are shown in table 3 the ta and pa datasets most heavily impact the twsa variations across casnw overall the inclusion of peta mitigates the twsa values because of the collective effects of the warming temperatures and decreasing precipitation occurring throughout casnw the simulated twsa values from january of 2003 to december of 2012 for all eight datasets are in close match for the seasonal variations and long term changes in the observed monthly twsa values r2 values range from 0 62 for csr and jpl to 0 85 for pcr and wghm fig 5 among the eight datasets the pcr and wghm datasets followed by the three gldas datasets most accurately simulate the observed monthly twsa trends the accuracy of the plsr predictions actually surpasses that of the simulation with r2 values ranging from 0 74 vic to 0 95 pcr excluding the noah r2 0 94 the twsa predictions from the three grace satellite datasets are more accurate than those of the vic and mosaic datasets fig 5a 5f by contrast twsa simulations of the first ten years of data for the vic and mosaic datasets were more accurate than those of the three grace satellite datasets as we have demonstrated this plsr technique can be used to drastically improve the prediction power of a given set of data we attribute the ability of the ghms to accurately simulate and predict the monthly twsa values to strength of the relationships between the cru climate factors and their input meteorological forcing datasets which include the gpcp dataset in the three gldas lsms rodell et al 2004 the cru dataset in the pcr model sutanudjaja et al 2018 and the gpcc dataset in the wghm model the differences in the plsr results among the various ghms are caused by their twsa datasets and indirectly by their different forcing datasets and model structures in the grace datasets however the plsr model did not accurately reproduce the downward trends of twsa in order to improve the simulating accuracy in the downward trends we added two variables into the plsr model that play a vital role in twsa smsa the soil moisture storage anomaly and swesa the snow depth water equivalent storage anomaly hu et al 2019a while the addition of these variables increased the ability of the datasets to reproduce the decreasing twsa trends the tradeoff is that the accuracy of the prediction results in 2013 2014 declined due to higher variable biases fig 5 figure s16 in future work as new datasets become available we hope to create a model that accurately simulates and predicts the monthly twsa values while maintaining small biases the detailed analysis of our plsr prediction results with the addition of smsa and swesa variables can be found in supplementary text s7 to investigate the spatial differences in the dataset simulations we explored the spatial variations in the coefficient of determination r2 coefficients of temperature a 1 precipitation a 2 and pet a 3 in the csr twsa and cru climate data fig 6 the monthly twsa values were accurately simulated over most of central asia with r2 values exceeding 0 4 in 68 of our study area fig 6a some regions such as nw tkm and uzb have negative temperature coefficients which indicates the negative impacts of the temperature on the twsa values fig 6b with the exception of negative values occurring in parts of northern kaz and almost all of tkm and uzb the coefficients of precipitation a 2 are largely positive especially in nw fig 6c as shown in fig 6 d negative pet coefficients values are found throughout most of cas5 in northern kaz in the region between cas5 and china and in southern and eastern nw in addition the regression coefficients for most of casnw are significant at the 95 confidence level fig 6a most areas have negative ta 71 64 and peta 78 66 regression coefficients which indicate temperature and pet tend cause the twsa to decrease by contrast more than half of our study area 66 57 has positive pa regression coefficients fig 6b 6d in uzb tkm and the northern part of kaz the pa regression coefficients are negative fig 6c the significant twsa depletion observed in uzb and tkm fig 4 is largely caused by the decreased precipitation and the increased pet figures s8b c in addition intensified human activity e g increased water usage in these two countries also contributes to changes in the twsa variations deng et al 2010a 2010b the increased precipitation in the northern part of kaz leads to higher twsa values fig 4 it is difficult to back out the mechanisms causing the twsa variations because of the complex hydrological processes at work in casnw deng et al 2010a 2010b deng and chen 2017 therefore we will comprehensively to explore the mechanisms that drive the twsa variations across the casnw until more and more data becomes available overall our results demonstrate that the machine learning approaches such as plsr can be used to accurately simulate and predict the monthly twsa variations by including future climate factors in models governed by machine learning techniques we hope to improve our ability to predict future twsa variations throughout casnw 3 6 sdg challenges declining twsa values and increasing water demands in this section we discuss the increasing water demand and the declining tws values with respect to sdg 6 4 2 as well as the water resource management strategies in central asia as defined in sdg 6 4 2 the water stress is the amount of freshwater drawdown as a proportion of the available freshwater resources after taking into account environmental water requirements http www fao org sustainable development goals indicators we explore three different aspects of this issue in our study area in central asia as 1 decreasing twsa derived from the three grace satellite datasets 2 changes in the cultivated area and the population and 3 renewable water resource storage and water withdrawal 3 6 1 decreasing twsa values in the three grace satellite datasets based on the annual average twsa values from the three grace satellite datasets the total water storage depletion in the arid regions of central asia is 4 74 mm a which was equivalent to a water loss rate of 28 76 gt a between 2003 and 2016 table s7 for the six sub regions kaz had the largest water storage depletion with a water mass rate of 13 42 gt a i e 4 92 mm a followed by tkm 5 4 gt a and 10 99 mm a and nw 5 23 gt a and 2 53 mm a uzb 3 8 gt a and 8 5 mm a kgz 0 77 gt a and 3 85 mm a and tjk 0 33 gt a and 2 31 mm a table s7 and tkm and uzb have the most significant water height reductions an observation that is consistent with the growing water consumption in these two countries deng et al 2010a 2010b among the five river and lake basins the aral sea basin had the largest water height reduction 6 39 mm a and water loss rate 7 88 gt a table s7 while the ob river basin experienced lesser declines in the water height 1 63 mm a and the water loss rate 1 32 gt a balkhash lake basin and issyk lake basin had the twsa rates of 2 19 mm a and 3 52 mm a in water height and the corresponding water mass rate were 0 93 gt a and 9 67 gt a the water storage depletion rates of the tarim river basin are 1 07 mm a in water height and 1 13 gt a in water mass table s7 3 6 2 changes in the cultivated area and the local population cultivated area arable land and permanent crops and population variations significantly impact a region s water consumption and water withdrawal especially in more arid regions in this section the cultivated area variation and the population of the five countries i e kaz kgz tjk tkm and uzb of central asia were analyzed to illustrate the water resource change over the arid regions of central asia the cultivated area of kaz increased from 2847 104 ha in 2002 to 2953 104 ha in 2014 with at a growth rate of 8 83 104 ha a which has a 3 72 increase in uzb the cultivated area decreased from 483 104 ha in 2002 to 469 104 ha in 2007 and then increased again to 477 104 ha in 2014 the cultivated area of kgz is decreased from 141 1 104 ha in 2002 to 135 6 104 ha in 2014 in tjk the amount of cultivated area was remained relatively consistent with values of 88 1 104 ha in 2002 and 87 104 ha in 2014 in tkm the cultivated area decreased from 210 104 ha in 2002 and 2007 to 200 104 ha in 2012 and 2014 table 4 kaz has the largest cultivated area followed by uzb and tkm while the irrigated area in kaz make up a relatively small percentage of the cultivated area in this state most of the cultivated areas in the other four countries are almost entirely irrigated uzb had the largest irrigated area in 2008 430 104 ha followed by kaz 188 7 104 ha tkm 185 104 ha and tjk 71 104 ha deng et al 2010a the population of all five countries have increased to some extent from 2003 to 2017 the population of kaz is increased from 15 23 million to 18 2 million and the uzb population increased from 25 83 million to 31 91 million further details on these population changes can be found in table s10 the changes in the cultivated area specifically in the extent of the irrigated area and the increased populations in these five central asia countries lead to higher water withdrawal and water consumption values 3 6 3 renewable water resource storage and water withdrawal in this section we analyzed six variables were from the aquastat database of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations these variables include three water resource variables i e total renewable water resources gt a total renewable surface water gt a total renewable groundwater gt a two water use variables agricultural water withdrawal gt a total water withdrawal gt a and water stress in sustainable development goal sdg 6 4 2 defined as the ratio between total freshwater withdrawn by major economic sectors and total renewable freshwater resources table 4 http www fao org nr water aquastat data query index html lang en in 2002 2007 2012 and 2014 the three water resource variables remained constant in each of the five countries there were no changes in the available water resources at this time table 4 the renewable water resources among the five countries had remarkable differences from 2002 to 2014 kaz had the largest total renewable water resources 108 4 gt a total renewable surface water 100 6 gt a and total renewable groundwater 33 85 gt a table s8 moreover kaz had the total renewable water resources and total renewable surface water more than 40 gt a and the total renewable groundwater with the value of 8 8 gt a kgz and kaz experienced water shortages can actively facing the shortage of water resources due to the large percentages of the total renewable groundwater in the total renewable water resources i e 58 and 31 and tkm uzb and tjk were vulnerable and sensitivity to the total renewable groundwater with the small percentages in the total renewable water resources i e 0 405 gt a 8 8 gt a 6 gt a and 1 64 18 and 27 38 respectively these results were satisfied with the water stress values of the five countries from sdg 6 4 2 table s8 moreover comparing the water storage depletion of the annual twsa the decreased annual twsa per year accounted for 12 38 3 26 1 51 21 8 and 7 79 of the total renewable water resources for kaz kgz tjk tkm and uzb respectively at the present depletion rate from1998 to 2007 uzb and tkm had more water use in total water withdrawal i e 60 58 gt in 2001 and 56 gt in 2005 for uzb 24 91 gt in 2000 and 27 95 gt in2004 for tkm and agriculture water withdrawal i e 54 78 gt in 2001 and 50 4 gt in 2005 for uzb 24 04 gt in 2000 and 26 36 gt in 2004 for tkm than kaz kgz and tjk between 2000 and 2010 the total water withdrawals in kaz and tkm increased from 2002 19 7 gt to 2010 21 14 gt and from 2000 24 91 gt to 2004 26 36 gt respectively while the decrease in the cultivated area in the other countries resulted in decreased in agricultural it displayed that the agricultural water withdrawal in central asia accounted to almost of the total water withdrawal e g larger than 90 for kgz tjk tkm and uzb table 4 between 2002 and 2010 kaz and tkm experience serious water shortages their water stresses increased from 26 26 to 28 14 and from 145 5 to 162 8 respectively by contrast the water stress values decreased in uzb from 151 8 in 2001 to 138 8 in 2005 kgz from 57 49 in 2000 to 43 95 in 2006 and tjk from 74 35 in 2000 to 71 36 in 2006 the distressingly high water stresses in tkm and uzb are a reflection of their larger depletion water storage rates with respect to the water height table s8 and table s1 furthermore when water stresses are larger than 100 the total renewable freshwater resources cannot satisfy the soceconomic water demand which may result in the groundwater over exploration 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty analyses of the monthly twsa values from the grace lsm and ghm datasets in the grace satellite datasets uncertainties arise due to signal filtering e g some useful signals are erased when we remove the high frequency noise and the coarse spatial and temporal resolutions of the grace dataseets long et al 2014 2015a long et al 2015b 2017 the uncertainties in the ghm datasets are caused by limited input datasets and an inability to accurately model complex hydrological processes scanlon et al 2018 hu et al 2019a to evaluate the robustness of our twsa results we conduct conducted uncertainty analyses on the monthly twsa values from the three grace satellite datasetsand the vic noah mosaic pcr and wghm models based on scanlon et al 2018 to ensure that the twsa uncertainties are comparable between different datasets we calculated the standard deviations stds with respect to the linear trends in each dataset the trend uncertainties reflect discrepancies in the slopes of the twsa in the three grace satellite datasets and the five models the multi model average of the linear monthly twsa trends derived from the three grace satellite datasets has a spatial distribution that is similar to those of the three grace datasets individually with negative trends located throughout most of casnw and positive trends occurring in the kunlun mountains and in northeastern kaz fig 4a c figure s17a for the other five models the spatial distributions of the mean linear trends had the weak negative trends in most of cas5 and weak positive trends in nw figure s17b the std values for the three grace dataset trends are smaller than 0 15 mm figure s17c while the std values for the five models are larger than 0 15 in most of casnw figure s17d to better monitor the terrestrial water cycle new datas from grace fo follow on interferometry synthetic aperture radar measurements more robust ghms and in situ observation networks should be incorporated into existing datasets using techniques such as plsr it is possible to improve the coarse spatial and temporal resolution of the grace satellite datasets hu et al 2019a tapley et al 2019 4 2 why are there differences in the grace ghm and lsm twsa trends possible explanations for the twsa differences between the grace ghmand lsm datasets have been explored in previous works scanlon et al 2018 2019 śliwińska et al 2019 however due to the large uncertainties caused by the different model structures or modeling approaches input forcing datasets e g climate forcing water use and land cover and model parameters and the complexity of hydrological processes at the regional and global scales schmied et al 2014 there has not yet been a consensus as to why these differences occur using our results we will address this issue with respect to the climate factors and human activity factors that contribute to the model and dataset uncertainties 4 2 1 effects of climate factors and human activity on twsa central asia hosts a number of complex water circulation and hydrologic processes that are further complicated by climate factors human activity and an inability to monitor important hydrological parameters such as the snowmelt runoff and groundwater chen et al 2019 li et al 2019 hu et al 2019a shen et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 the recent terrestrial water storage depletion in central asia has largely been attributed toa combination of climate factors and increased human activity deng and chen 2017 chen et al 2020 as seen in the cru dataset from 1980 to 2016 both the temperature 0 36 c 10a and pet 1 77 mm a increased significantly throughout central asia figure s18a c the precipitation only exhibited a weakly positive trend figure s18b increased temperatures lead to accelerated snow melting and glacier retreat which result in terrestrial water storage depletions throughout central asia brun et al 2017 yang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 from 2006 to 2016 the glacier mass change rate in central asia was 7 gt a during 2006 2016 zemp et al 2019 and from 2003 to 2010 the glacier mass balance retreat rate in the tianshan mountains was 5 6 gt a jacob et al 2012 the total annual seasonal delayed glacier melt rates are the highest in the aral basin 7 1 gt a followed by the tarim basin 3 6 gt a the balkhash basin 1 7 gt a and the chu issyk kul basin 0 6 gt a pritchard 2019 a positive glacier mass balance in the western kunlun mountains resulted in an increased terrestrial water storage in the southern tarim river basin yao et al 2012 deng and chen 2017 this data suggests that climate affects tws indirectly through changes in the mountain glaciers and in the snow cover due to increased anthropogenic activity the extent of the irrigated areas in central asia increased by 60 from 1962 to 2002 oberhänsli et al 2007 which drastically increased the groundwater withdrawal and significantly decreased the input water flow into the aral sea shibuo et al 2006 warming temperatures and shrinking lakes results in strong negative twsa trends throughout western central asia shi et al 2014 deng and chen 2017 4 2 2 major factors of uncertainty in the grace ghm and lsm it is possible that the sources of uncertainty in the grace satellite datasets the ghm and the lsms contribute to the twsa differences observed between the eight datasets models used in this study döll et al 2014a 2014b scanlon et al 2018 2019 śliwińska et al 2019 two major sources of uncertainty in the grace satellite datasets are the signal filtering processes and the low spatial resolution while bias signal loss due to low pass filtering of the grace satellite datasets and leakage errors signal gain from the surrounding due to low pass filtering can be corrected using the additive approach with synthetic data from lsms longuevergne et al 2010 the low spatial resolution remains a large source of potential error in the water storage ideally this low spatial resolution can be resolved by statistical downscaling or dynamical downscaling approaches because the ghms used in this study pcr globwb 2 and wghm are mainly based on water balance calculations these models account for human actions such as water usage and reservoir management scanlon et al 2018 2019 discrepancies between the ghm and the grace twsa trends arise due to differences in the initial conditions input datasets e g climate forcing and land cover model structures calibration and inclusion of human involvement scanlon et al 2018 schmied et al 2014 in addition an incomplete understanding of hydrological processes at the regional and global scales creates epistemic uncertainties schmied et al 2014 in pcr globwb 2 the forcing data set is based on time series of monthly precipitation temperatures and reference evaporation from the cru ts 3 2 data set of harris et al 2014 these variables have been downscaled to daily values using era40 1958 1978 and era interim 1979 2015 and that downscaling is a source of uncertainty in the model outputs due to structural errors this model cannot incorporate glacier and ice processes the groundwater response time or the effects of wetlands sutanudjaja et al 2018 because the wghm model include the monthly total runoff time series it accounts for both natural and anthropogenic changes in hydrological features such as groundwater recharge river discharge and water storage in diverse storage locations döll et al 2003 2012 werth and güntner 2010 schmied et al 2014 however to reduce model uncertainties wghm baseflow estimates evapotranspiration estimates snowmelt estimates the water balance calculations for wetlands and lakes and for the assessments of the land use and land cover alcamo et al 2003 must be improved with a lack of high quality input data it is unrealistic to expect wghm or any other hydrological model to compute accurate runoff and discharge döll et al 2003 by neglecting river channel losses and evaporation of runoff from small ephemeral ponds most models do a poorer job of simulating trends in semiarid and arid basins than they do in humid basins in all basins where discharge is controlled by man made reservoirs it is likely that the seasonality inaccurate because the wghm does not include information related to reservoir management with overly simplistic snow modeling algorithms wghm yields poor estimates of the discharge in snow dominated basins döll et al 2003 wghm does not include changes in irrigation water use efficiency crop patterns or groundwater abstractions as a fraction of total abstractions döll et al 2014a uncertainties in the estimated groundwater depletion stem from the fact that wghm simulates groundwater dynamics using a simple water balance approach rather than by considering hydraulic head gradients döll et al 2014a therefore although the global wghm model simulates the most important storage compartments including surface water and groundwater the simulation accuracy of this conceptual model was originally low for river discharge in snow dominated and semi arid regions döll et al 2003 2014a 2014b for the gldas lsms employed in this study i e vic noah and mosaic the initial conditions input datasets e g climate forcing and land cover model structures and calibration algorithms are sources of uncertainty for the output data of these lsms while the lsms account for water storage in the canopy snow and soil moisture these one dimensional models do not simulate lateral flow gldas lsms integrate observational data into the models in order to produce global summaries of land surface states e g soil moisture storage and fluxes e g evapotranspiration runoff that self consistent balanced with respect to water and energy and spatially and temporally continuous the parameters of the lsms are described in table s2 of scanlon et al 2018 the gldas lsms generally account for sub grid variability with vegetation tiles and grid cells but do not include water bodies such as rivers reservoirs and wetlands furthermore the lsms include a detailed soil vegetation atmosphere transfer scheme for simulating vegetation but neglect the effects of irrigated crops scanlon et al 2018 2019 4 2 3 potential factors causing the twsa differences in variousdatasets the sources of uncertainty in the grace datasets the ghms and the lsms may contribute to the observed differences between these datasets in the central asia twsa trends as discussed previously these uncertainties typically arise due to neglecting important parameters or parameter simplification the inability to accurate model the complexities in certain water circulation and and hydrologic processes e g snow mass loss glacier mass loss and irrigation as well as the questionable accuracy of the regional hydro climate data e g precipitation et and pet may also play a part in creating twsa variations for the first aspect the uncertainties of twsa derived from grace are straight forward caused by the two major factors of the filtering process and the coarse spatial resolution long et al 2014 2015a long et al 2015b 2017 for ghms and lsms the initial conditions input datasets and model structure contribute to the large uncertainties of twsa surface water storage and groundwater storage are not included in the lsms which result in the underestimation of the twsa depletion derived from grace although the most important storage compartments including surface water and groundwater are simulated in ghms there are still large uncertainties caused by the limited input data at regional and global scales especially in the arid and semiarid regions döll et al 2014a 2014b scanlon et al 2018 2019 in the second aspect as a typical arid and semi arid region central asia is governed by a highly complex water circulation and hydrologic processes that are very sensitive to regional climate changes and anthropogenic activity chen 2012 hu et al 2019a additionally due to a lack of accessibility it is very difficult to obtain in situ hydrological data in central asia hu et al 2014 2016a 2016b 2018 the lack of independent accurate model constraints heavily impacts the forcing datasets that form the basis of the ghms and lsms and the data that is used to calibrate the grace ghm and lsm datasets to minimize the twsa differences in various datasets we recommend that the grace satellite datasets should incorporate higher resolution data e g grace follow on and employ more effective filtering techniques we also suggest that future ghms and lsms should find more sophisticated ways to represent complex hydrologic processes in future moreover the integration of complimentary observation data to further constrain the simulation and calibration of single storage compartments is encouraged 4 3 impacts of irrigation on the twsa depletion agriculture water withdrawal i e irrigation accounts for 90 of the total water withdrawal 91 of the agriculture water withdrawal occurs in surface waters and the residual withdrawal 9 is from groundwater sources fao water report 39 2013 from 1940 to 1999 the irrigation area and the corresponding water withdrawal in the aral sea basin dramatically increased from 52 3 k m3 and 385 104 hm2 to 108 9 km3 and 789 6 104 hm2 deng et al 2010b for a more in depth investigation into the impact of irrigation on twsa in the casnw refer to our previous study hu et al 2019a which compares the twsa values in irrigated regions and non irrigated regions figure s19a shows the irrigated regions in casnw this data was extracted from the global map of irrigation areas gmia v5 0 of the fao http www fao org nr water aquastat irrigationmap index10 stm in this analysis a grid that covered irrigated areas was defined as an irrigated grid otherwise it was a non irrigated grid based on this definition 132 irrigated grids and 537 non irrigated grids were identified figure s19b the annual twsa of the irrigated grids was compared with the averaged twsa of their surrounding non irrigated grids based on student s t test at the 95 significance level the irrigated grids without any surrounding non irrigated grids were excluded in the comparison twsa in 19 of the irrigated grids red grids in figure s19b were significantly different from their surrounding non irrigated grids based on this result we infer that agricultural irrigation exerts considerable influence over the twsa the average twsa depletion rate in the irrigated grids 4 58 mm a is slightly higher than that of the adjacent non irrigated grids 4 55 mm a which indicates that agricultural irrigation exacerbates the twsa depletion moreover the largest twsa depletion which occurs in the aral sea basin is caused by the shrinking of the aral sea micklin 1988 deng et al 2010b pekel et al 2016 however 81 of the irrigated grids with no significant difference compared with their surrounding non irrigated grids due to the limited inclusion of complex hydrological processes in the grace datasets it is difficult to accurately quantify the relationship between irrigation and twsa in central asia 4 4 possible sustainable water resource management strategies due to climate change and anthropogenic activity the available water resources in the arid regions of central asia precipitously declined between 2003 and 2014 as the population continues to grow the increased water withdrawal will continue to negatively impact the tws in the arid regions of central asia the heightened water demand and the declining tws may result in serious environmental and ecological issues such as groundwater depletion water pollution and desertification deng et al 2010a 2010b moreover the lack of available water may aggravate the water related conflicts between these five countries therefore strategies to achieve the sdgs in central asia are desperately needed the mismatch between the natural distribution of the water resources and the actual water use is one of the key drivers of water resource issues in central asia with respect to these five countries 90 of the natural water resources are located in kaz kgz and tjk but these three countries account for less than 40 of the total water use by contrast 10 of the natural water sources are located in uzb and tkm but the water usage in these two countries accounts for 65 of the total water usage in all five countries deng et al 2010a 2010b therefore developing and promoting transboundary water sharing agreements will help to balance competing water demands and defuse potential conflicts united nations strengthening cooperation for rational and efficient use of water and energy resources in central asia r new york un 2004 in central asia the agricultural water withdrawal specifically irrigation accounts for more than 60 of the total water withdrawal therefore reducing the agricultural water consumption is another possible sustainable water resource management strategy for example by using more efficient equipment or by planting crops that require less water agricultural users can reduce the overall agricultural withdrawal deng et al 2010a 2010b creating a water saving society controlling the rapidly increase population and recharging the groundwater at high flow years are other possible strategies that could be employed as sustainable water resource management techniques in the arid regions of central asia 5 conclusions in this study we analyzed the dynamical variations simulation and prediction and sustainable development in the water resources in the arid regions of central asia our sources for this study include three grace satellite datasets i e csr gfz and jpl and five ghms i e vic noah mosaic pcr and wghm that span the time period from 2003 to 2014 with three climate factors temperature precipitation and pet as the predictor variables we used plsr a machine learning approach to simulate and predict the monthly twsa we explored the state of the water resources in the arid regions of central asia by examining the relationships between the observed twsa changes and driving forces such as cultivated area population three water resource variables two water use variables and the water stress due to a lack of observational data we only compared the linear trends of twsa between the grace datasets and the ghms datasets our major findings are as follows 1 with the exception of the mosaic model most of the models underestimated the terrestrial water storage depletion values derived from the grace datasets the grace datasets and the vic mosaic and pcr models exhibited significant decreasing twsa trends at monthly seasonal and annual scales in the arid regions of central asia from the grace satellite datasets we observed negative monthly trends in northern and central xinjiang and in northern western and southern cas5 while the ghms only generate negative twsa trends the grace satellite datasets and the lsms reveal positive twsa trends in northeastern kaz and southern xinjiang 2 between 2003 and 2014 the average terrestrial water storage rate of change and the average water mass loss produced

4678,sustainable water resource management requires a clear understanding of the spatial variation and seasonal recharge of groundwater and their links to local precipitation a combined spatial analysis of the stable isotope composition of groundwater surface water and precipitation could help to understand groundwater sources and recharge processes in this study we collected 297 groundwater and stream water samples across ethiopia and analyzed them for the oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios the isotope data were then interpolated into isoscapes for the entire country using the cokriging method based on their spatial autocorrelation and covariance with elevation annual mean precipitation and temperature these are the first groundwater and stream isoscapes for ethiopia by comparing the spatial isotopic distribution of the two water resources with local precipitation we showed distinct groundwater recharge patterns in different regions in terms of their water sources timing seasonality and the degree of surface and groundwater interaction we found that the groundwater recharge was generally biased towards the main rainy season however in the relatively dry southeastern ethiopia groundwater could receive significant input from infrequent high intensity rainfalls associated with tropical cyclones but additional precipitation and groundwater isotope data are needed to further test our hypothesis in this data poor region overall this study has largely expanded the spatial coverage of water stable isotope data and filled significant data gaps in ethiopia which could be used to provide vital information in the arid and semi arid parts of the country where water resources are critical in climate change adaptation strategies keywords isotope d excess isoscape groundwater recharge ethiopia 1 introduction groundwater is the largest freshwater resource in the world providing drinking water for one third of the world population and close to half of agricultural water use döll et al 2012 in the arid and semi arid regions such as tropical africa groundwater has been used as a fallback resource during prolonged drought macdonald et al 2019 the reliance on groundwater has grown tremendously as demand for water increases due to population growth urban expansion and changing consumption patterns vörösmarty et al 2000 boretti and rosa 2019 the majority of growth in water demand especially for irrigation of agricultural lands wada et al 2012 occurs in countries with emerging economies as they gradually shift away from relying only on rain fed subsistence farming at the same time global climate change may profoundly affect the hydrologic cycle causing additional stress on water resources e g taylor et al 2013 hamed et al 2018 bedaso et al 2019 future impacts of climate change on groundwater resources vary by region and are subject to uncertainties associated with regional climate projections holman et al 2012 these issues are particularly significant for eastern africa where various studies have indicated highly complex and variable rainfall patterns rainfall in the region is influenced by the interplay of diverse local e g topography regional e g moisture transport and global e g sea surface temperature driving forces leading to great seasonal and inter annual variability nicholson 2017 such complexity leads to both uncertainties in establishing historical trends williams et al 2012 brown et al 2017 and poor performance of climate models in simulating regional rainfall amount and seasonality yang et al 2015 moreover there is limited understanding of the linkage between precipitation and groundwater resources and the seasonal contribution of precipitation to groundwater this is partly due to a lack of high quality spatiotemporal precipitation isotope data in studying the hydro climatic processes and links with groundwater recharge bedaso et al 2020 the last few decades have seen a considerable increase in the application of stable isotope systems hydrogen 1h 2h and oxygen 16o 18o to study the hydrologic cycle and water resources for example stable isotopes have been used to study groundwater origin and flow dynamics kebede et al 2008 bretzler et al 2011 identify seasonal groundwater recharge winograd et al 1998 jasechko et al 2014 bedaso et al 2019 estimate groundwater recharge abbott et al 2000 adomako et al 2010 and examine surface and groundwater interaction abiye et al 2015 besides establishing spatial and temporal isotope variation in groundwater and precipitation and their relationship with climatic factors such as rainfall amount and the temperature is of vital importance in paleoclimate interpretation white et al 1997 rozanski et al 1993 bedaso et al 2020 bedaso and wu 2020 these advances are partly attributed to the development of laser spectroscopic techniques that make isotopic measurements more accessible and less expensive the basic premise of using stable isotope as a tracer in the hydrological environment is that hydrogen and oxygen isotopes fractionate due to mass differences during phase changes dansgaard 1964 during evaporation lighter isotopologues e g 1h2 16o 1h2h16o 1h2 18o of water preferentially escape to the vapor phase leaving the heavier ones in the residual water whereas during condensation heavier isotopologues leave the vapor phase leaving lighter ones in the remaining cloud therefore changes in the hydrologic processes are reflected by changes in isotopic ratios of water and controlled by atmospheric processes and moisture sources dansgaard 1964 these conservative natural isotope tracers are unaffected by geological interactions and environmental and human degradation of water quality as water moves through the hydrologic cycle clark and fritz 1997 liu et al 2014 as a result comparing the isotopic composition of precipitation to groundwater provides information on the timing amount and mechanism of groundwater recharge abbott et al 2000 jones et al 2000 jasechko et al 2014 these applications rely on the availability of precipitation and groundwater isotope data although previous groundwater isotope data are available in parts of ethiopia e g levin et al 2009 kebede and travi 2012 precipitation isotope data are limited to addis ababa and absent in other parts of ethiopia until the last few years bedaso et al 2020 lemma et al 2020 as a result previous attempts to explain the source of groundwater as well as to link precipitation to seasonal and spatial isotope variation were not fully substantiated the spatial coverage of stable water isotope data has been greatly increased by recent sampling campaigns in ethiopia e g bedaso et al 2020 with the help of accessible water isotope measurements technology building significantly on our previous work on precipitation isotopes at multiple sites in ethiopia this paper further establishes the spatial variations of groundwater and stream water isotopes based on these isotope datasets we further examined the relative contribution of seasonal precipitation to groundwater the availability of spatial isotope data also enables the construction of isoscapes an interpolated surface of continuous isotope data which can be used to provide estimations for data poor and inaccessible parts of the country isoscapes are used to investigate links between rainfall and groundwater in many places such as australia hollins et al 2018 mexico wassenaar et al 2009 and south africa west et al 2014 de wet ruan et al 2020 isoscapes also have the potential application in forensic and archeological investigations sharp et al 2003 west et al 2009 animal migration studies e g kelly et al 2002 hobson et al 2012 identification of individuals in the unlikely case of large scale loss of life in natural disasters e g fraser et al 2006 and providing baseline information for hydrological studies and interpreting paleoclimate data kendall and coplen 2001 this paper has four objectives 1 present the groundwater and stream water isotope data collected throughout ethiopia and examine their spatial variations 2 identify the source and origin of groundwater at three geographic locations in northwestern highlands debre markos gondar and jimma and one location in the southeastern highlands jijiga of ethiopia 3 characterize the contributions of seasonal precipitation to groundwater and potential impacts of extreme events at those sites 4 develop the first groundwater and stream water isoscapes for ethiopia based on which the link between precipitation and groundwater is examined 2 study area this study focuses on ethiopia a country located in eastern africa with an area of 1 1 million km2 fig 1 its topography is characterized by central highlands surrounded by low lying areas in the peripheral part of the country the ethiopian rift valley erv divides the highland into northwestern highlands and southeastern highlands with a range of altitude from 125 m below sea level in the northeast to above 4500 m in the northwestern highland fig 1a the climate in ethiopia ranges from warm desert climates bwh in the lowlands to humid subtropical climate cwb in the highlands ethiopia s hydro climate is divided into three main regions based on rainfall seasonality southwestern ethiopia experiences one rainy season from february through november while central and northeast ethiopia experience two major rainy seasons short rain locally called belg from february to may and the main rainy season locally called kiremt from june to september degefu 1987 diro et al 2009 the southern part of the country also experiences two rainy seasons the main rainy season from march to may and the short rains from october to november however southern ethiopia receives considerably less annual rainfall amounts than the rest of the country fig 1b the annual rainfall amount is considerably different in different regions of the country ranging from 150 mm in the low lying arid regions to over 2000 mm in the highland regions degefu 1987 ethiopia s geographic location also plays a major role in various spatial and temporal rainfall patterns fig 1 the seasonal migration of the tropical rain belt controls rainfall seasonality nicholson 2018 during the main rainy season june september the tropical rain belt is located in northern ethiopia where the country is under the influence of southwesterly and southerly monsoon flows at the end of the rainy season the tropical rain belt gradually moves southward until early october and remains south of ethiopia through march during this time the country is under the influence of dry northeasterly trade winds degefu 1987 this seasonal north south migration of the tropical rain belt leads to the bimodal rainfall season in the southern part of ethiopia and the uni modal rainy season in the northern part as a result the country obtains moisture from multiple sources including the indian ocean the mediterranean and red seas central africa and the gulf of guinea reaches viste and sorteberg 2013 bedaso et al 2020 reported an initial analysis of seasonal moisture sources and found that summer precipitation obtains moisture from the south i e indian ocean and central africa whereas moisture mainly comes from the north and east during the rest of the year ethiopia also experiences a range of climate conditions within a short distance that range from the warm arid desert climate in the lowlands to the humid subtropical climate on the highlands in ethiopia the occurrence and movement of groundwater are in part determined by geologic structures and geomorphic features and the aquifers show highly variable hydraulic characteristics and recharge rates ayenew et al 2008 the national hydrogeological map scale 1 2 000 000 shows aquifer types depth and distribution and was first developed by the ethiopian institute of geological surveys eigs 1993 the last two decades have seen more detailed hydrogeological studies from small catchments e g demlie et al 2008 alemayehu et al 2011 to large river basins e g ayenew et al 2008 and at regional scales e g ayenew et al 2008 kebede et al 2008 the main aquifer systems in ethiopia include 1 fractured volcanic rocks mostly found in central highland 2 sedimentary rocks with open pore spaces and fractures in the abay basin mekelle outliers and eastern highlands associated with cavern topography 3 low storage metamorphic rocks located in peripheral lowlands and 4 alluvial and lacustrine deposits found in local depressions filled grabens and the rift valley more details can be found in kebede 2013 despite the small areal coverage of the alluvial and lacustrine deposits they store more than half of the groundwater in the country and are mostly characterized by shallow water tables kebede 2013 3 materials and methods 3 1 field sample collection a total of 184 groundwater samples and 113 spring and stream water samples were collected between may june 2018 from the most accessible part of ethiopia for hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o stable isotope analysis fig 1 this study focuses on shallow groundwater wells i e 20 m in depth due to a lack of hydrogeological data in most parts of the country ayenew et al 2008 we mainly relied on interviews of residents and homes for well depth information we avoided stagnant i e infrequently pumped wells deep wells and well water with high temperature t 30 oc due to geothermal energy where isotopic composition could be modified by secondary processes such as evaporation and rock water interactions craig 1963 shallow groundwater wells and samples from small streams were collected close to roads cities and areas with easy access to ensure local representation of water isotopes rivers that drain large areas are excluded sample metadata were collected at the same time including gps coordinates altitude etc water samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm filter during sampling whenever possible spring water samples were collected at the source samples were collected using glass vials with polyseal lined caps and further covered with parafilm to prevent evaporative loss samples were then stored at 4 oc until isotope analysis was performed 3 2 isotope analyses samples were analyzed at the university of dayton water isotope laboratory δ2h and δ18o were measured on a picarro l2130 i liquid water isotope analyzer via cavity ring down spectroscopy following the conventional analytical procedure we bracketed five samples by three standards each sample was measured 6 times but the first 3 results were discarded to avoid the memory effect between samples all isotopic analysis results were reported as the δ notation relative to the international standard of vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow in per mil the analytical precision was 0 08 for δ18o and 0 4 for δ2h a second order isotopic variable d excess defined as d δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 was also calculated as it provides information on precipitation moisture source and secondary evaporation from terrestrial water bodies the isotope data were checked for the impact of hydrothermal activities using the δ18o δ2h plot in waters affected by geothermal activities the δ18o usually shifts to more positive values while δ2h values are similar to the local meteoric waters the absence of 18o shift in our data indicates that the samples are unaffected by high temperature craig 1963 3 3 additional isotope data to increase spatial coverage we included additional groundwater isotope data from previous fieldwork between 2009 and 2018 44 samples and published data 117 samples from sklash and mwangi 1991 levin et al 2009 wynn and bedaso 2010 alemayehu et al 2011 2017 we also used the daily precipitation amount and precipitation isotope data collected for previous studies bedaso et al 2020 at four locations debre markos gondar jimma and jijiga these stations are located at different elevation and climatic zones with varied rainfall amounts and seasonality fig 1 and table 1 the precipitation isotope data were collected for all days with rainfall from august 2012 to november 2013 to avoid seasonal bias in analysis we used one whole year of data from august 2012 to july 2013 this selection results in 146 samples for debre markos 117 samples for gondar 71 samples for jijiga and 169 samples for jimma the precipitation isotope data were used to characterize seasonal isotope variation develop site specific local meteoric water lines lmwl and compare with groundwater and surface water data long term monthly precipitation isotope data for addis ababa were also downloaded from the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip database 3 4 isotopic mixing model based on the principle of isotopic mass balance the seasonal amount weighted average isotope values together with the groundwater isotope values are used in a two component mixing model to determine the relative contribution of wet and dry season precipitation to groundwater the model is specified as follows δ 18 o gw δ 18 o ws x δ 18 o ds 1 x where δ18ogw is the average isotopic composition of groundwater δ18ows δ18ods is the amount weighted average wet dry season precipitation isotope value and x and 1 x represent the relative contribution to groundwater recharge from precipitation during wet and dry seasons respectively this calculation was performed for each of the four locations where precipitation isotope data was collected the groundwater isotopic values were derived as the mean of all groundwater samples within 50 km of the precipitation sampling locations 3 5 construction of isoscapes isoscapes are interpolated surface of continuous isotope data past studies mainly used spatial regression models to interpolate the isotope values based on a selection of environmental factors such as elevation temperature precipitation distance to ocean latitude and longitude wassenaar et al 2009 west et al 2014 stahl et al 2020 given the significant spatial autocorrelation of the isotope data supplementary information table s1 we opted to use a geostatistical model based on the cokriging method to construct the isoscapes using arcgis 9 6 3 5 1 environmental data environmental data were collected from different sources for climate data we used the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf ear interim monthly temperature and precipitation reanalysis data from 1979 to 2018 downloaded from https apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full moda levtype sfc they are gridded datasets at the spatial resolution of 0 125 degrees for elevation we used the global 30 arc second elevation gtopo30 dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 km it was downloaded from the us geological survey usgs earth explorer data portal https earthexplorer usgs gov all datasets were projected to africa equidistant conic coordinate system and resampled to 5 km for further analysis 3 5 2 cokriging cokriging is a multivariate variant of the ordinary kriging method and it estimates values for a poorly sampled variable the predictand with help of one or more well sampled predictor variables that are correlated with the predictand the covariables cokriging uses both the autocorrelation for the predictand i e the isotope values and the covariables and the cross correlations between the predictand and the covariables to interpolate values between sample points given the computation intensity only up to three covariables can be used for cokriging in arcgis to choose the covariables we evaluated the correlation between the isotope values and a set of environmental factors known to affect water isotopes including elevation mean annual precipitation mean annual temperature and distance to ocean table s2 since location information is inherent in geostatistical models locational variables such as longitude and latitude are usually not used as covariables the results show that elevation has the strongest correlations with both the groundwater and surface water isotopic values although the magnitude of the altitude effect is generally small with the δ18o elevation slope of 0 09 per 100 m for groundwater and 0 1 per 100 m for stream water strong correlations are also found between the isotope values and mean annual precipitation amount and temperature these correlations are in general stronger in surface stream water than groundwater isotopes although some correlation exists between the isotopic values and the distance to the ocean we do not believe this is a reliable predictand because previous studies show that moisture does not necessarily come from the nearest ocean bedaso et al 2020 viste and sorteberg 2013 therefore based on this analysis we selected elevation annual precipitation amount and temperature as the covariables to spatially interpolate the isotope values using the cokriging method we used cross validation to evaluate the performance of each cokriging model in cross validation we first used all data to estimate model parameters we then removed each data point one at a time and predicted a value at that point and defined the error as the difference between predicted and observed values at the omitted point after the error was determined for all points we then calculated the root mean squared error rmse for each model and compared them to data range and variation in addition we calculated the standard error se of prediction for all interpolated region to assess the uncertainty of model predictions se can be used to calculate the confidence intervals at various probability levels e g se for 67 and 2se for 95 3 6 other statistical methods a variety of standard statistical tests were used to summarize and analyze data including t test for comparison of sample means and f test for comparison of sample variance linear regression is used to construct precipitation groundwater and stream water lines meteoric water lines mwls were constructed as the amount weighted linear regression lines between δ2h and δ18o to reduce a bias towards small rainfall events finally f test is used to compare the difference between the regression line slopes ross 2014 these analyses were carried out using r v 4 0 3 4 results 4 1 groundwater stream and precipitation isotope composition groundwater and stream isotopes are known to integrate the precipitation isotope values and show smaller ranges than precipitation fig 2 and table 2 based on the amount weighted t test mean δ18o and δ2h values of the groundwater and stream show no statistically significant differences with those of precipitation however based on the amount weighted f test for equality of variance both the groundwater f 7 30 p 0 01 and stream water f 4 85 p 0 01 δ18o values have statistically significant lower variance than precipitation the results are similar for groundwater f 10 65 p 0 01 and stream water f 9 42 p 0 01 δ2h values there is no statistically significant difference in mean groundwater and stream δ18o δ2h value but the groundwater and stream water isotope show distinct regional differences figs 3 5 besides groundwater δ18o values show a significantly lower variance than stream water f 0 68 p 0 01 the variance of groundwater δ2h is also slightly lower than those of stream water but the difference is not statistically significant f 0 89 p 0 36 deuterium excess on the other hand presents a different picture the d excess values of groundwater t 9 85 p 0 01 and stream water t 9 57 p 0 01 are significantly lower than precipitation d excess but they all have similar variance the lower mean d excess values in stream and groundwater compared to local precipitation suggest an evaporative loss of rainwater before it reaches the aquifer and as it flows through streams however precipitation d excess can also show seasonal and spatial variation depending on the source of moisture and atmospheric conditions dansgaard 1964 guan et al 2013 the long term 1961 2016 addis ababa gnip monthly precipitation isotope dataset is used to define the national meteoric water line δ2h 7 61 0 09 δ18o 13 32 0 23 n 284 the addis ababa meteoric water line is compared with the local meteoric water line lmwl derived from all daily precipitation isotope data at the four sampling locations in the country over the course of one year δ2h 7 48 0 09 δ18o 15 74 0 24 n 503 groundwater line gwl δ2h 5 54 0 20 δ18o 7 84 0 43 n 214 and stream water line swl δ2h 5 01 0 13 δ18o 7 51 0 28 n 250 based on data collected for this study fig 2 the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ 18o 10 craig 1961 is also plotted for comparison the lmwl derived from our daily precipitation isotope data is similar to the long term addis ababa mwl the gwl and swl slopes are similar to each other but they are significantly smaller than the lmwl f 8 73 p 0 01 for gwl f 15 751 p 0 01 for swl fig 2 the lower slope of swl indicates possible evaporation in streams especially in the warmer regions such as in the afar depression the lower slope of gwl also suggests that the groundwater is probably recharged from these evaporated streams as well as soil water and rainwater after evaporative enrichment the δ18o δ2h and d excess groundwater isotopes in ethiopia are within the range of precipitation isotope values reported by bedaso et al 2020 and shown in fig 2 table 3 the spatial groundwater isotope variation in ethiopia generally reflects the precipitation isotope distribution as in the case with ethiopian precipitation there is no difference in average δ18o and δ2h values of groundwater between the northwestern and southeastern highlands fig 4a however there is a distinct difference in the d excess values between the two highlands fig 4c the high d excess values 10 in the northwestern highlands indicate continental recycled moisture source whereas low d excess values 10 in the southern and eastern part of the country indicate direct ocean moisture source bedaso et al 2020 the gradual eastward decrease in d excess values from central ethiopian highlands to the afar depression shows the relative increase in evaporative enrichment of meteoric water due to warmer and drier climate thus the highest δ18o and δ2h values of groundwater in the afar depression along with low d excess values signify extensive evaporation of meteoric water before recharge the low δ18o values and close to 10 d excess values of groundwater in southern ethiopia could imply rapid infiltration of water with minimal evaporation or recharge from high intensity and 18o 2h depleted precipitation that results in local flash flooding and rapid recharge before significant evaporation stream water isotope composition is subject to more variability than groundwater due to diverse environmental and hydrologic conditions in different river basins table s3 in larger river basins local precipitation is an important component of streamflow in the headwater and stream isotopes reflect precipitation events more in the headwater region than downstream kendall and coplen 2001 some streams could also reflect groundwater isotopes because they are sustained by groundwater discharge kendall and coplen 2001 the average isotopic composition of stream and groundwater are comparable in most river basins in ethiopia and reflect local rainfall tables s3 and s4 however the average stream d excess values are distinctly lower than the groundwater values in the awash 6 2 vs 9 1 and danakil basins 9 2 vs 14 3 which might indicate evaporation of stream water in contrast in the genale dawa basin 14 7 vs 8 6 the average stream d excess value is higher than groundwater this difference suggests possible source differences for streams and groundwater streams located in the northern high elevated part of the basin mainly receive water from precipitations with high d excess values 10 whereas most of the groundwater in the southern part of the basin is recharged by high intensity local precipitation from indian monsoon that experience minimal evaporation before recharge 4 2 spatial isotope patterns isoscapes the interpolated continuous surface of δ18o δ2h and d excess values i e isoscapes and their standard errors se were established for shallow groundwater fig 4 and streams fig 5 in ethiopia cross validation results show that the average root mean square errors rmse range between 12 and 16 of the data range and 71 84 of data standard deviation table 4 there is no obvious spatial clustering of the errors suggesting no systematic under or over estimation at different locations the uncertainty of model prediction se gradually increases as we move away from the sampling points and in regions with large elevation changes it is relatively smaller for variables that show stronger correlations with covariables such as stream water δ2h given the levels of uncertainty isoscapes should be used with caution particularly in data poor regions such as the ogaden basin and western lowlands the isoscapes show clear spatial groundwater and stream isotope variation with several distinct regional patterns in general groundwater δ18o and δ2h show similar spatial patterns fig 4a and b the lowest groundwater δ18o δ2h values are in the range between 4 6 and 3 7 22 and 15 and are found in central ethiopia at the headwater region of the abay awash rift valley and omo gibe basins as well as in the lowlands of the genale dawa basin in southern ethiopia the most enriched groundwater δ18o δ2h values range between 0 5 and 1 7 7 2 and 12 0 and are observed in the northeastern part of ethiopia in the afar depression the southwestern lowlands of ethiopia in baro akobo basin and the southern portion of omo gibe basin intermediate groundwater δ18o and δ2h values occur in the northwestern highlands southeastern highlands and the ogaden basin groundwater d excess values also show clear spatial patterns fig 4c most parts of the country exhibit d excess values 10 except in the southern and northeastern portions of the country the highest groundwater d excess values 14 mostly occur in the northwestern highlands and parts of central and southeastern highlands the lowest d excess values 9 occur in the afar depression and the southern ethiopian lowlands intermediate groundwater d excess values 9 14 are common in the rest of the country mainly in the southeastern portion of the country including the ogaden and wabi sebele basins where we have limited sampling points stream water is a good spatial integrator of the isotopic composition of precipitation collected in a basin kendall and coplen 2001 for mapping the spatial distribution of stream isotopes and ensure their local representation we only collected water samples from small tributary streams that integrate small catchment areas our result shows that streams δ18o and δ2h generally show similar spatial patterns as groundwater isotopes fig 5a b however groundwater and stream δ18o and δ2h exhibit some regional differences fig 4a b and 5a b mainly in the main ethiopian rift valley and southern ethiopia the most enriched stream isotopes δ18o and δ2h values were found in northern ethiopia the northeastern part of ethiopia in the awash basin and the southwestern part of ethiopia in the rift valley and omo gibe basin fig 5a the stream d excess also shows a distinct spatial pattern where we see low d excess values in areas with enriched δ18o and δ2h values in warmer parts of the country e g the afar depression on the other hand the western highlands are characterized by relatively high d excess values that correspond with high d excess values from the rainy season precipitation reported in the region tekleab et al 2014 5 discussions 5 1 comparison of groundwater with local precipitation precipitation is the ultimate source of groundwater ethiopian precipitation isotopes show a distinct seasonal pattern and spatial distribution bedaso et al 2020 the seasonality of the isotopic composition precipitation is more distinct in the western highlands range of δ18o 21 but less distinct in the southeastern highlands at jijiga range of δ18o 15 bedaso et al 2020 in the western highlands during the wet season jjas precipitation isotope compositions are typically more depleted than during the dry season rainfall mainly in mam months in the southeastern highland at jijiga although there is no distinct seasonality in the isotopic composition of precipitation the lowest δ18o and δ2h values are recorded with precipitation associated with monsoon and tropical cyclonic activities bedaso et al 2020 we found a notable seasonal and regional difference in water isotopes fig 3 while wet season precipitation meteoric water lines are similar to the global meteoric lines with an overall slope of 8 04 0 13 the dry season meteoric water line shows lower slopes with an overall slope of 7 04 0 13 fig 3 similarly d excess exhibits distinct spatial patterns where the values are higher than the global average 10 craig 1961 in the western highland and lower in jijiga bedaso et al 2020 these spatial d excess variations have been attributed to differences in atmospheric conditions and moisture source as the eastern half of the country obtains moisture directly from the indian ocean while the western part of the country obtains precipitation from continental recycled moisture levin et al 2009 bedaso et al 2020 the comparison of mean groundwater isotope values and seasonal amount weighted mean precipitation isotope could show the relative importance of groundwater recharge at different seasons jasechko et al 2014 bedaso et al 2019 identifying seasonal groundwater recharge relies on a distinct difference in the wet season june september and dry season october may precipitation isotopic composition and d excess values table 3 fig 3 the average δ18o and δ2h values of groundwater at all four locations within 50 km in debre markos gondar jimma and jijiga are lower than the annual amount weighted precipitation isotopes values table 3 fig 3 the isotopic composition of groundwater at debre markos gondar and jimma is very close to the wet season precipitation isotope average showing the importance of wet season rainfall as a source for groundwater recharge fig 3 high intensity rainfalls in the summer could particularly be important as low intensity rainfall in the dry atmosphere can be subjected to higher evaporation dansgaard 1964 based on the isotope mixing model eq 1 and using the amount weighted seasonal average isotope values the wet season contribution to groundwater is 96 for debre markos 97 for gondar and 75 for jimma the standard error a measure of uncertainty for the estimate is 12 for debre markos 35 for gondar and 11 for jimma for comparison wet season precipitation contribution to total annual precipitation is 81 for debre markos 78 for gondar and 49 for jimma our results highlight the importance of high intensity summer rainfall for groundwater recharge and it is consistent with other previous studies at other locations in the tropics e g jasechko and taylor 2015 in jijiga the average groundwater isotope values are lower than the precipitation average of both seasons this is likely caused by the exceptional recharge associated with a few intense storm events with extremely low isotope values the lowest precipitation isotope values in jijiga are associated with tropical systems that affect the area mostly in november and december in fig 3c the most 18o depleted precipitations collected in november 2013 bedaso et al 2020 are associated with cyclone 3a that affected the horn of africa in mid november 2013 the groundwater in the southeastern arid and semi arid part of ethiopia could get substantial recharge from these extreme but rare rainfall events that result in flash flooding in a changing climate groundwater recharge from rare but extreme tropical cyclones could become an essential water source in arid and semi arid regions 5 2 regional groundwater recharge pattern a combined evaluation of the spatial distribution of δ18o δ2h and d excess of groundwater and streams figs 4 5 and 6 along with precipitation isotopes provides a way to infer hydrological processes and the nature of groundwater recharge fig 7 as discussed earlier precipitation is the ultimate source of groundwater and streams and their isotopic compositions reflect local precipitation however the isotopic composition of stream and groundwater could decouple due to evaporative enrichment and differences in the integration time of the two reservoirs i e groundwater represents a longer time average than streams in the absence of large scale and dense precipitation isotopes stream and groundwater isotopic compositions serve as a reliable proxy and important to trace hydrological processes and understand groundwater recharge e g wassenaar et al 2009 hollins et al 2018 as inferred from the stream and groundwater isoscapes we identified five generalized regions with distinct groundwater recharge pattern fig 7 however no clear boundary between regions are defined comparison of the mean δ18o of groundwater and streams in these regions show a statistically significant difference in regions b and c whereas no statistically significant difference was obtained in regions a and d due to insufficient data we were not able to compare stream and groundwater isotopic compositions in region e in mountainous central ethiopia groundwater isotopes are characterized by relatively low δ18o and δ2h values and high d excess values the isotopic composition of the groundwater is similar to that of local precipitation reported in the region e g tekleab et al 2014 bedaso et al 2020 this similarity suggests minimal evaporation of rainwater due to rapid infiltration in highly permeable fractured volcanic rocks either exposed to the surface or with thin soil cover fig 7 however the isotopic compositions of streams are relatively enriched fig 5a and b and the difference between stream and groundwater isotopes are high and statistically significant fig 6a and b this may suggest the evaporation of surface water such as runoff from precipitation and springs or streams from groundwater discharge at the foothills of the mountains the streams downstream are subject to further evaporation and hence enriched in heavier isotopes and characterized by lower d excess values figs 4 and 5 northwestern ethiopia shows intermediate groundwater and stream δ18o and δ2h values in the northern half and slightly more enriched isotopic composition in the southern and western part of the region towards the lowlands fig 7 the isotopic composition of groundwater and stream do not show a statistically significant difference this region has high groundwater d excess values 10 similar to the values of summer rainy season precipitation reported by bedaso et al 2020 this similarity alludes to the importance of summer rainfall as the main source of groundwater source whereas light rain in the short rain dry season is mostly evaporated and does not make a significant contribution to the groundwater the aquifers in this region are dominated by fractured volcanic rocks with high storage capacity and recharged mainly by high rainfall during the rainy season ayenew et al 2008 the slightly enriched groundwater isotope compositions in the western highland compared to the adjacent mountainous regions suggest evaporation of water sources before diffuse recharge through thick soils fig 7 on the contrary the groundwater in the western lowlands exhibits relatively high δ18o and δ2h and low d excess fig 4a c and 5a c this suggests potential recharge from evaporated water sources such as over flooded streams and rivers or wetlands as indicated by kebede 2013 and signifies extensive surface and groundwater interaction alemayehu et al 2017 however due to the lack of precipitation isotope data in the western lowlands making a direct link between precipitation and groundwater is not possible at this moment the afar depression part of the lower awash basin fig 7 is a lowland area with a warmer and drier climate this region is widely covered by quaternary alluvial and lacustrine deposits underlain by volcanic rocks aquifers kebede 2013 it is characterized by high groundwater and stream δ18o and δ2h but low 10 d excess values fig 4c and 5c although there are no long term precipitation isotope data available in the region wynn and bedaso 2010 reported an average precipitation δ18o of 1 5 ranging between 6 1 and 2 0 and low 10 d excess the isotopic composition of groundwater and stream shows a statistically significant difference this may suggest the importance of local 18o enriched rainfall as the main groundwater recharge source than contributions from streams previous observation by ayenew et al 2008 also indicated relatively low 50 mm y groundwater recharge from seasonal floods and stream beds however the southern and western parts of the afar depression obtain groundwater recharge from the surrounding highlands and streams and rivers with headwater located in the central highlands the difference in the nature and source of groundwater between the northern and southern sections of the afar depression is attributed to the geological and structural control on groundwater movement between the highlands and the rift floor kebede et al 2008 southern ethiopia shows a distinct δ18o δ2h and d excess pattern fig 4a c 5a c and 6a c the northern part of the region is dominated by volcanic rocks the southern part is mainly covered by alluvial sediments and karst sedimentary sequence compared with the northern part of the region the southern lowlands have lower δ18o δ2h and d excess values this spatial variation suggests a difference in the source of groundwater recharge the high groundwater d excess values in the north are consistent with previously reported values for precipitation in the headwater areas including the bale mountains lemma et al 2020 the high d excess implies recycled moisture in precipitation as a source of groundwater the low groundwater δ18o and δ2h values in the southern lowlands and northern kenya sklash and mwangi 1991 indicate preferential groundwater recharge from isotopically depleted precipitation and our result concurs with woldemariyam and ayenew 2016 fig 7 on the other hand southeastern ethiopia is a data poor region fig 1 but with the limited available data the region is characterized by 18o and 2h depleted groundwater composition and low d excess values 10 the average groundwater δ18o and δ2h from jijiga is comparable to local rainfall at jijiga fig 3 the low groundwater d excess is also consistent with jijiga s precipitation and might indicate groundwater recharge from indian monsoon rainfall the low δ18o and δ2h values of groundwater as in the case for other tropical arid and semi arid regions imply the importance of high intensity rainfalls derived from monsoon and cyclonic activities and their associated flooding as a source of groundwater recharge lawrence and gedzelman 1996 tashie et al 2016 the groundwater recharge for this region is consistent with regional work by kebede 2013 however additional precipitation surface and groundwater isotope data are needed to better characterize this region in general the isotopic composition of groundwater in ethiopia shows spatial variability and it mostly reflects local precipitation however in some cases it deviates from local precipitation when groundwater is potentially recharged from evaporated surface water sources such as stream flooding in the western ethiopian lowland in baro akobo and omo gibe basins such deviation also occurs for aquifers in the rift escarpments and rift valley floors recharged by precipitation from the central ethiopian highlands kebede 2013 it is also possible that large rivers originating from higher elevations recharge low land aquifers as evidenced in other studies sharp 2017 overall our results are consistent with previous observations that the isotopic composition of groundwater is mostly close to the annual amount weighted local precipitation fig 3 e g clark and fritz 1997 but biased towards the main rainy season precipitation e g winograd et al 1998 jasechko et al 2014 bedaso et al 2019 and in some locations it might be influenced by high intensity rainfall jasechko and taylor 2015 li et al 2018 we recognize the lack of precipitation stream and groundwater isotope data from western low lands and southeastern ethiopia these regions show relatively higher uncertainty on the isoscape models fig 4d f and 5d f otherwise our data and models provide a reliable first order evaluation of groundwater recharge patterns at a coarser and regional scale the continuing effort of water isotope monitoring from data poor regions of ethiopia and further fine resolution modeling is critical to improving the understanding and utility of isotopes in the region seasonal monitoring of stream isotope and a better understanding of seasonal moisture sources for different parts of the country could improve future hydrological studies and lay the foundation to understand the effect of climate change on water resources in the region 6 conclusions our results show the spatial distribution of groundwater and stream isotopes in ethiopia δ18o and δ2h of stream and groundwater show coherent spatial variability in most parts of the country with some significant decoupling between the two in some areas the close examination of groundwater stream and precipitation isotope compositions sheds light on the timing and nature of groundwater recharge in general groundwater isotopic values are similar to amount weighted isotope values of local precipitation with biases towards the main rainy season indicating the importance of high intensity storms for groundwater recharge the major groundwater recharge mechanisms in different parts of ethiopia include rapid infiltration of rain water in the central highland mountains region diffused groundwater recharge in the northwestern highlands selective recharge from heavier storms with lower isotopic values in southern ethiopia and recharge from evaporated river over flood and wetlands in the western lowlands despite limited data in southeastern ethiopia our result from jijiga suggests the importance of rainfall derived from tropical cyclones as a source of groundwater recharge however we recommend further monitoring of water isotopes in this region detailed consideration of the geology and hydrogeology at a smaller scale would further refine our understanding of surface and groundwater interaction at a basin scale such a holistic approach is critical in creating a sustainable groundwater management plan in the ever changing climate that has unprecedented impacts on the hydrologic cycle and water

4678,sustainable water resource management requires a clear understanding of the spatial variation and seasonal recharge of groundwater and their links to local precipitation a combined spatial analysis of the stable isotope composition of groundwater surface water and precipitation could help to understand groundwater sources and recharge processes in this study we collected 297 groundwater and stream water samples across ethiopia and analyzed them for the oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios the isotope data were then interpolated into isoscapes for the entire country using the cokriging method based on their spatial autocorrelation and covariance with elevation annual mean precipitation and temperature these are the first groundwater and stream isoscapes for ethiopia by comparing the spatial isotopic distribution of the two water resources with local precipitation we showed distinct groundwater recharge patterns in different regions in terms of their water sources timing seasonality and the degree of surface and groundwater interaction we found that the groundwater recharge was generally biased towards the main rainy season however in the relatively dry southeastern ethiopia groundwater could receive significant input from infrequent high intensity rainfalls associated with tropical cyclones but additional precipitation and groundwater isotope data are needed to further test our hypothesis in this data poor region overall this study has largely expanded the spatial coverage of water stable isotope data and filled significant data gaps in ethiopia which could be used to provide vital information in the arid and semi arid parts of the country where water resources are critical in climate change adaptation strategies keywords isotope d excess isoscape groundwater recharge ethiopia 1 introduction groundwater is the largest freshwater resource in the world providing drinking water for one third of the world population and close to half of agricultural water use döll et al 2012 in the arid and semi arid regions such as tropical africa groundwater has been used as a fallback resource during prolonged drought macdonald et al 2019 the reliance on groundwater has grown tremendously as demand for water increases due to population growth urban expansion and changing consumption patterns vörösmarty et al 2000 boretti and rosa 2019 the majority of growth in water demand especially for irrigation of agricultural lands wada et al 2012 occurs in countries with emerging economies as they gradually shift away from relying only on rain fed subsistence farming at the same time global climate change may profoundly affect the hydrologic cycle causing additional stress on water resources e g taylor et al 2013 hamed et al 2018 bedaso et al 2019 future impacts of climate change on groundwater resources vary by region and are subject to uncertainties associated with regional climate projections holman et al 2012 these issues are particularly significant for eastern africa where various studies have indicated highly complex and variable rainfall patterns rainfall in the region is influenced by the interplay of diverse local e g topography regional e g moisture transport and global e g sea surface temperature driving forces leading to great seasonal and inter annual variability nicholson 2017 such complexity leads to both uncertainties in establishing historical trends williams et al 2012 brown et al 2017 and poor performance of climate models in simulating regional rainfall amount and seasonality yang et al 2015 moreover there is limited understanding of the linkage between precipitation and groundwater resources and the seasonal contribution of precipitation to groundwater this is partly due to a lack of high quality spatiotemporal precipitation isotope data in studying the hydro climatic processes and links with groundwater recharge bedaso et al 2020 the last few decades have seen a considerable increase in the application of stable isotope systems hydrogen 1h 2h and oxygen 16o 18o to study the hydrologic cycle and water resources for example stable isotopes have been used to study groundwater origin and flow dynamics kebede et al 2008 bretzler et al 2011 identify seasonal groundwater recharge winograd et al 1998 jasechko et al 2014 bedaso et al 2019 estimate groundwater recharge abbott et al 2000 adomako et al 2010 and examine surface and groundwater interaction abiye et al 2015 besides establishing spatial and temporal isotope variation in groundwater and precipitation and their relationship with climatic factors such as rainfall amount and the temperature is of vital importance in paleoclimate interpretation white et al 1997 rozanski et al 1993 bedaso et al 2020 bedaso and wu 2020 these advances are partly attributed to the development of laser spectroscopic techniques that make isotopic measurements more accessible and less expensive the basic premise of using stable isotope as a tracer in the hydrological environment is that hydrogen and oxygen isotopes fractionate due to mass differences during phase changes dansgaard 1964 during evaporation lighter isotopologues e g 1h2 16o 1h2h16o 1h2 18o of water preferentially escape to the vapor phase leaving the heavier ones in the residual water whereas during condensation heavier isotopologues leave the vapor phase leaving lighter ones in the remaining cloud therefore changes in the hydrologic processes are reflected by changes in isotopic ratios of water and controlled by atmospheric processes and moisture sources dansgaard 1964 these conservative natural isotope tracers are unaffected by geological interactions and environmental and human degradation of water quality as water moves through the hydrologic cycle clark and fritz 1997 liu et al 2014 as a result comparing the isotopic composition of precipitation to groundwater provides information on the timing amount and mechanism of groundwater recharge abbott et al 2000 jones et al 2000 jasechko et al 2014 these applications rely on the availability of precipitation and groundwater isotope data although previous groundwater isotope data are available in parts of ethiopia e g levin et al 2009 kebede and travi 2012 precipitation isotope data are limited to addis ababa and absent in other parts of ethiopia until the last few years bedaso et al 2020 lemma et al 2020 as a result previous attempts to explain the source of groundwater as well as to link precipitation to seasonal and spatial isotope variation were not fully substantiated the spatial coverage of stable water isotope data has been greatly increased by recent sampling campaigns in ethiopia e g bedaso et al 2020 with the help of accessible water isotope measurements technology building significantly on our previous work on precipitation isotopes at multiple sites in ethiopia this paper further establishes the spatial variations of groundwater and stream water isotopes based on these isotope datasets we further examined the relative contribution of seasonal precipitation to groundwater the availability of spatial isotope data also enables the construction of isoscapes an interpolated surface of continuous isotope data which can be used to provide estimations for data poor and inaccessible parts of the country isoscapes are used to investigate links between rainfall and groundwater in many places such as australia hollins et al 2018 mexico wassenaar et al 2009 and south africa west et al 2014 de wet ruan et al 2020 isoscapes also have the potential application in forensic and archeological investigations sharp et al 2003 west et al 2009 animal migration studies e g kelly et al 2002 hobson et al 2012 identification of individuals in the unlikely case of large scale loss of life in natural disasters e g fraser et al 2006 and providing baseline information for hydrological studies and interpreting paleoclimate data kendall and coplen 2001 this paper has four objectives 1 present the groundwater and stream water isotope data collected throughout ethiopia and examine their spatial variations 2 identify the source and origin of groundwater at three geographic locations in northwestern highlands debre markos gondar and jimma and one location in the southeastern highlands jijiga of ethiopia 3 characterize the contributions of seasonal precipitation to groundwater and potential impacts of extreme events at those sites 4 develop the first groundwater and stream water isoscapes for ethiopia based on which the link between precipitation and groundwater is examined 2 study area this study focuses on ethiopia a country located in eastern africa with an area of 1 1 million km2 fig 1 its topography is characterized by central highlands surrounded by low lying areas in the peripheral part of the country the ethiopian rift valley erv divides the highland into northwestern highlands and southeastern highlands with a range of altitude from 125 m below sea level in the northeast to above 4500 m in the northwestern highland fig 1a the climate in ethiopia ranges from warm desert climates bwh in the lowlands to humid subtropical climate cwb in the highlands ethiopia s hydro climate is divided into three main regions based on rainfall seasonality southwestern ethiopia experiences one rainy season from february through november while central and northeast ethiopia experience two major rainy seasons short rain locally called belg from february to may and the main rainy season locally called kiremt from june to september degefu 1987 diro et al 2009 the southern part of the country also experiences two rainy seasons the main rainy season from march to may and the short rains from october to november however southern ethiopia receives considerably less annual rainfall amounts than the rest of the country fig 1b the annual rainfall amount is considerably different in different regions of the country ranging from 150 mm in the low lying arid regions to over 2000 mm in the highland regions degefu 1987 ethiopia s geographic location also plays a major role in various spatial and temporal rainfall patterns fig 1 the seasonal migration of the tropical rain belt controls rainfall seasonality nicholson 2018 during the main rainy season june september the tropical rain belt is located in northern ethiopia where the country is under the influence of southwesterly and southerly monsoon flows at the end of the rainy season the tropical rain belt gradually moves southward until early october and remains south of ethiopia through march during this time the country is under the influence of dry northeasterly trade winds degefu 1987 this seasonal north south migration of the tropical rain belt leads to the bimodal rainfall season in the southern part of ethiopia and the uni modal rainy season in the northern part as a result the country obtains moisture from multiple sources including the indian ocean the mediterranean and red seas central africa and the gulf of guinea reaches viste and sorteberg 2013 bedaso et al 2020 reported an initial analysis of seasonal moisture sources and found that summer precipitation obtains moisture from the south i e indian ocean and central africa whereas moisture mainly comes from the north and east during the rest of the year ethiopia also experiences a range of climate conditions within a short distance that range from the warm arid desert climate in the lowlands to the humid subtropical climate on the highlands in ethiopia the occurrence and movement of groundwater are in part determined by geologic structures and geomorphic features and the aquifers show highly variable hydraulic characteristics and recharge rates ayenew et al 2008 the national hydrogeological map scale 1 2 000 000 shows aquifer types depth and distribution and was first developed by the ethiopian institute of geological surveys eigs 1993 the last two decades have seen more detailed hydrogeological studies from small catchments e g demlie et al 2008 alemayehu et al 2011 to large river basins e g ayenew et al 2008 and at regional scales e g ayenew et al 2008 kebede et al 2008 the main aquifer systems in ethiopia include 1 fractured volcanic rocks mostly found in central highland 2 sedimentary rocks with open pore spaces and fractures in the abay basin mekelle outliers and eastern highlands associated with cavern topography 3 low storage metamorphic rocks located in peripheral lowlands and 4 alluvial and lacustrine deposits found in local depressions filled grabens and the rift valley more details can be found in kebede 2013 despite the small areal coverage of the alluvial and lacustrine deposits they store more than half of the groundwater in the country and are mostly characterized by shallow water tables kebede 2013 3 materials and methods 3 1 field sample collection a total of 184 groundwater samples and 113 spring and stream water samples were collected between may june 2018 from the most accessible part of ethiopia for hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o stable isotope analysis fig 1 this study focuses on shallow groundwater wells i e 20 m in depth due to a lack of hydrogeological data in most parts of the country ayenew et al 2008 we mainly relied on interviews of residents and homes for well depth information we avoided stagnant i e infrequently pumped wells deep wells and well water with high temperature t 30 oc due to geothermal energy where isotopic composition could be modified by secondary processes such as evaporation and rock water interactions craig 1963 shallow groundwater wells and samples from small streams were collected close to roads cities and areas with easy access to ensure local representation of water isotopes rivers that drain large areas are excluded sample metadata were collected at the same time including gps coordinates altitude etc water samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm filter during sampling whenever possible spring water samples were collected at the source samples were collected using glass vials with polyseal lined caps and further covered with parafilm to prevent evaporative loss samples were then stored at 4 oc until isotope analysis was performed 3 2 isotope analyses samples were analyzed at the university of dayton water isotope laboratory δ2h and δ18o were measured on a picarro l2130 i liquid water isotope analyzer via cavity ring down spectroscopy following the conventional analytical procedure we bracketed five samples by three standards each sample was measured 6 times but the first 3 results were discarded to avoid the memory effect between samples all isotopic analysis results were reported as the δ notation relative to the international standard of vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow in per mil the analytical precision was 0 08 for δ18o and 0 4 for δ2h a second order isotopic variable d excess defined as d δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 was also calculated as it provides information on precipitation moisture source and secondary evaporation from terrestrial water bodies the isotope data were checked for the impact of hydrothermal activities using the δ18o δ2h plot in waters affected by geothermal activities the δ18o usually shifts to more positive values while δ2h values are similar to the local meteoric waters the absence of 18o shift in our data indicates that the samples are unaffected by high temperature craig 1963 3 3 additional isotope data to increase spatial coverage we included additional groundwater isotope data from previous fieldwork between 2009 and 2018 44 samples and published data 117 samples from sklash and mwangi 1991 levin et al 2009 wynn and bedaso 2010 alemayehu et al 2011 2017 we also used the daily precipitation amount and precipitation isotope data collected for previous studies bedaso et al 2020 at four locations debre markos gondar jimma and jijiga these stations are located at different elevation and climatic zones with varied rainfall amounts and seasonality fig 1 and table 1 the precipitation isotope data were collected for all days with rainfall from august 2012 to november 2013 to avoid seasonal bias in analysis we used one whole year of data from august 2012 to july 2013 this selection results in 146 samples for debre markos 117 samples for gondar 71 samples for jijiga and 169 samples for jimma the precipitation isotope data were used to characterize seasonal isotope variation develop site specific local meteoric water lines lmwl and compare with groundwater and surface water data long term monthly precipitation isotope data for addis ababa were also downloaded from the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip database 3 4 isotopic mixing model based on the principle of isotopic mass balance the seasonal amount weighted average isotope values together with the groundwater isotope values are used in a two component mixing model to determine the relative contribution of wet and dry season precipitation to groundwater the model is specified as follows δ 18 o gw δ 18 o ws x δ 18 o ds 1 x where δ18ogw is the average isotopic composition of groundwater δ18ows δ18ods is the amount weighted average wet dry season precipitation isotope value and x and 1 x represent the relative contribution to groundwater recharge from precipitation during wet and dry seasons respectively this calculation was performed for each of the four locations where precipitation isotope data was collected the groundwater isotopic values were derived as the mean of all groundwater samples within 50 km of the precipitation sampling locations 3 5 construction of isoscapes isoscapes are interpolated surface of continuous isotope data past studies mainly used spatial regression models to interpolate the isotope values based on a selection of environmental factors such as elevation temperature precipitation distance to ocean latitude and longitude wassenaar et al 2009 west et al 2014 stahl et al 2020 given the significant spatial autocorrelation of the isotope data supplementary information table s1 we opted to use a geostatistical model based on the cokriging method to construct the isoscapes using arcgis 9 6 3 5 1 environmental data environmental data were collected from different sources for climate data we used the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf ear interim monthly temperature and precipitation reanalysis data from 1979 to 2018 downloaded from https apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full moda levtype sfc they are gridded datasets at the spatial resolution of 0 125 degrees for elevation we used the global 30 arc second elevation gtopo30 dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 km it was downloaded from the us geological survey usgs earth explorer data portal https earthexplorer usgs gov all datasets were projected to africa equidistant conic coordinate system and resampled to 5 km for further analysis 3 5 2 cokriging cokriging is a multivariate variant of the ordinary kriging method and it estimates values for a poorly sampled variable the predictand with help of one or more well sampled predictor variables that are correlated with the predictand the covariables cokriging uses both the autocorrelation for the predictand i e the isotope values and the covariables and the cross correlations between the predictand and the covariables to interpolate values between sample points given the computation intensity only up to three covariables can be used for cokriging in arcgis to choose the covariables we evaluated the correlation between the isotope values and a set of environmental factors known to affect water isotopes including elevation mean annual precipitation mean annual temperature and distance to ocean table s2 since location information is inherent in geostatistical models locational variables such as longitude and latitude are usually not used as covariables the results show that elevation has the strongest correlations with both the groundwater and surface water isotopic values although the magnitude of the altitude effect is generally small with the δ18o elevation slope of 0 09 per 100 m for groundwater and 0 1 per 100 m for stream water strong correlations are also found between the isotope values and mean annual precipitation amount and temperature these correlations are in general stronger in surface stream water than groundwater isotopes although some correlation exists between the isotopic values and the distance to the ocean we do not believe this is a reliable predictand because previous studies show that moisture does not necessarily come from the nearest ocean bedaso et al 2020 viste and sorteberg 2013 therefore based on this analysis we selected elevation annual precipitation amount and temperature as the covariables to spatially interpolate the isotope values using the cokriging method we used cross validation to evaluate the performance of each cokriging model in cross validation we first used all data to estimate model parameters we then removed each data point one at a time and predicted a value at that point and defined the error as the difference between predicted and observed values at the omitted point after the error was determined for all points we then calculated the root mean squared error rmse for each model and compared them to data range and variation in addition we calculated the standard error se of prediction for all interpolated region to assess the uncertainty of model predictions se can be used to calculate the confidence intervals at various probability levels e g se for 67 and 2se for 95 3 6 other statistical methods a variety of standard statistical tests were used to summarize and analyze data including t test for comparison of sample means and f test for comparison of sample variance linear regression is used to construct precipitation groundwater and stream water lines meteoric water lines mwls were constructed as the amount weighted linear regression lines between δ2h and δ18o to reduce a bias towards small rainfall events finally f test is used to compare the difference between the regression line slopes ross 2014 these analyses were carried out using r v 4 0 3 4 results 4 1 groundwater stream and precipitation isotope composition groundwater and stream isotopes are known to integrate the precipitation isotope values and show smaller ranges than precipitation fig 2 and table 2 based on the amount weighted t test mean δ18o and δ2h values of the groundwater and stream show no statistically significant differences with those of precipitation however based on the amount weighted f test for equality of variance both the groundwater f 7 30 p 0 01 and stream water f 4 85 p 0 01 δ18o values have statistically significant lower variance than precipitation the results are similar for groundwater f 10 65 p 0 01 and stream water f 9 42 p 0 01 δ2h values there is no statistically significant difference in mean groundwater and stream δ18o δ2h value but the groundwater and stream water isotope show distinct regional differences figs 3 5 besides groundwater δ18o values show a significantly lower variance than stream water f 0 68 p 0 01 the variance of groundwater δ2h is also slightly lower than those of stream water but the difference is not statistically significant f 0 89 p 0 36 deuterium excess on the other hand presents a different picture the d excess values of groundwater t 9 85 p 0 01 and stream water t 9 57 p 0 01 are significantly lower than precipitation d excess but they all have similar variance the lower mean d excess values in stream and groundwater compared to local precipitation suggest an evaporative loss of rainwater before it reaches the aquifer and as it flows through streams however precipitation d excess can also show seasonal and spatial variation depending on the source of moisture and atmospheric conditions dansgaard 1964 guan et al 2013 the long term 1961 2016 addis ababa gnip monthly precipitation isotope dataset is used to define the national meteoric water line δ2h 7 61 0 09 δ18o 13 32 0 23 n 284 the addis ababa meteoric water line is compared with the local meteoric water line lmwl derived from all daily precipitation isotope data at the four sampling locations in the country over the course of one year δ2h 7 48 0 09 δ18o 15 74 0 24 n 503 groundwater line gwl δ2h 5 54 0 20 δ18o 7 84 0 43 n 214 and stream water line swl δ2h 5 01 0 13 δ18o 7 51 0 28 n 250 based on data collected for this study fig 2 the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ 18o 10 craig 1961 is also plotted for comparison the lmwl derived from our daily precipitation isotope data is similar to the long term addis ababa mwl the gwl and swl slopes are similar to each other but they are significantly smaller than the lmwl f 8 73 p 0 01 for gwl f 15 751 p 0 01 for swl fig 2 the lower slope of swl indicates possible evaporation in streams especially in the warmer regions such as in the afar depression the lower slope of gwl also suggests that the groundwater is probably recharged from these evaporated streams as well as soil water and rainwater after evaporative enrichment the δ18o δ2h and d excess groundwater isotopes in ethiopia are within the range of precipitation isotope values reported by bedaso et al 2020 and shown in fig 2 table 3 the spatial groundwater isotope variation in ethiopia generally reflects the precipitation isotope distribution as in the case with ethiopian precipitation there is no difference in average δ18o and δ2h values of groundwater between the northwestern and southeastern highlands fig 4a however there is a distinct difference in the d excess values between the two highlands fig 4c the high d excess values 10 in the northwestern highlands indicate continental recycled moisture source whereas low d excess values 10 in the southern and eastern part of the country indicate direct ocean moisture source bedaso et al 2020 the gradual eastward decrease in d excess values from central ethiopian highlands to the afar depression shows the relative increase in evaporative enrichment of meteoric water due to warmer and drier climate thus the highest δ18o and δ2h values of groundwater in the afar depression along with low d excess values signify extensive evaporation of meteoric water before recharge the low δ18o values and close to 10 d excess values of groundwater in southern ethiopia could imply rapid infiltration of water with minimal evaporation or recharge from high intensity and 18o 2h depleted precipitation that results in local flash flooding and rapid recharge before significant evaporation stream water isotope composition is subject to more variability than groundwater due to diverse environmental and hydrologic conditions in different river basins table s3 in larger river basins local precipitation is an important component of streamflow in the headwater and stream isotopes reflect precipitation events more in the headwater region than downstream kendall and coplen 2001 some streams could also reflect groundwater isotopes because they are sustained by groundwater discharge kendall and coplen 2001 the average isotopic composition of stream and groundwater are comparable in most river basins in ethiopia and reflect local rainfall tables s3 and s4 however the average stream d excess values are distinctly lower than the groundwater values in the awash 6 2 vs 9 1 and danakil basins 9 2 vs 14 3 which might indicate evaporation of stream water in contrast in the genale dawa basin 14 7 vs 8 6 the average stream d excess value is higher than groundwater this difference suggests possible source differences for streams and groundwater streams located in the northern high elevated part of the basin mainly receive water from precipitations with high d excess values 10 whereas most of the groundwater in the southern part of the basin is recharged by high intensity local precipitation from indian monsoon that experience minimal evaporation before recharge 4 2 spatial isotope patterns isoscapes the interpolated continuous surface of δ18o δ2h and d excess values i e isoscapes and their standard errors se were established for shallow groundwater fig 4 and streams fig 5 in ethiopia cross validation results show that the average root mean square errors rmse range between 12 and 16 of the data range and 71 84 of data standard deviation table 4 there is no obvious spatial clustering of the errors suggesting no systematic under or over estimation at different locations the uncertainty of model prediction se gradually increases as we move away from the sampling points and in regions with large elevation changes it is relatively smaller for variables that show stronger correlations with covariables such as stream water δ2h given the levels of uncertainty isoscapes should be used with caution particularly in data poor regions such as the ogaden basin and western lowlands the isoscapes show clear spatial groundwater and stream isotope variation with several distinct regional patterns in general groundwater δ18o and δ2h show similar spatial patterns fig 4a and b the lowest groundwater δ18o δ2h values are in the range between 4 6 and 3 7 22 and 15 and are found in central ethiopia at the headwater region of the abay awash rift valley and omo gibe basins as well as in the lowlands of the genale dawa basin in southern ethiopia the most enriched groundwater δ18o δ2h values range between 0 5 and 1 7 7 2 and 12 0 and are observed in the northeastern part of ethiopia in the afar depression the southwestern lowlands of ethiopia in baro akobo basin and the southern portion of omo gibe basin intermediate groundwater δ18o and δ2h values occur in the northwestern highlands southeastern highlands and the ogaden basin groundwater d excess values also show clear spatial patterns fig 4c most parts of the country exhibit d excess values 10 except in the southern and northeastern portions of the country the highest groundwater d excess values 14 mostly occur in the northwestern highlands and parts of central and southeastern highlands the lowest d excess values 9 occur in the afar depression and the southern ethiopian lowlands intermediate groundwater d excess values 9 14 are common in the rest of the country mainly in the southeastern portion of the country including the ogaden and wabi sebele basins where we have limited sampling points stream water is a good spatial integrator of the isotopic composition of precipitation collected in a basin kendall and coplen 2001 for mapping the spatial distribution of stream isotopes and ensure their local representation we only collected water samples from small tributary streams that integrate small catchment areas our result shows that streams δ18o and δ2h generally show similar spatial patterns as groundwater isotopes fig 5a b however groundwater and stream δ18o and δ2h exhibit some regional differences fig 4a b and 5a b mainly in the main ethiopian rift valley and southern ethiopia the most enriched stream isotopes δ18o and δ2h values were found in northern ethiopia the northeastern part of ethiopia in the awash basin and the southwestern part of ethiopia in the rift valley and omo gibe basin fig 5a the stream d excess also shows a distinct spatial pattern where we see low d excess values in areas with enriched δ18o and δ2h values in warmer parts of the country e g the afar depression on the other hand the western highlands are characterized by relatively high d excess values that correspond with high d excess values from the rainy season precipitation reported in the region tekleab et al 2014 5 discussions 5 1 comparison of groundwater with local precipitation precipitation is the ultimate source of groundwater ethiopian precipitation isotopes show a distinct seasonal pattern and spatial distribution bedaso et al 2020 the seasonality of the isotopic composition precipitation is more distinct in the western highlands range of δ18o 21 but less distinct in the southeastern highlands at jijiga range of δ18o 15 bedaso et al 2020 in the western highlands during the wet season jjas precipitation isotope compositions are typically more depleted than during the dry season rainfall mainly in mam months in the southeastern highland at jijiga although there is no distinct seasonality in the isotopic composition of precipitation the lowest δ18o and δ2h values are recorded with precipitation associated with monsoon and tropical cyclonic activities bedaso et al 2020 we found a notable seasonal and regional difference in water isotopes fig 3 while wet season precipitation meteoric water lines are similar to the global meteoric lines with an overall slope of 8 04 0 13 the dry season meteoric water line shows lower slopes with an overall slope of 7 04 0 13 fig 3 similarly d excess exhibits distinct spatial patterns where the values are higher than the global average 10 craig 1961 in the western highland and lower in jijiga bedaso et al 2020 these spatial d excess variations have been attributed to differences in atmospheric conditions and moisture source as the eastern half of the country obtains moisture directly from the indian ocean while the western part of the country obtains precipitation from continental recycled moisture levin et al 2009 bedaso et al 2020 the comparison of mean groundwater isotope values and seasonal amount weighted mean precipitation isotope could show the relative importance of groundwater recharge at different seasons jasechko et al 2014 bedaso et al 2019 identifying seasonal groundwater recharge relies on a distinct difference in the wet season june september and dry season october may precipitation isotopic composition and d excess values table 3 fig 3 the average δ18o and δ2h values of groundwater at all four locations within 50 km in debre markos gondar jimma and jijiga are lower than the annual amount weighted precipitation isotopes values table 3 fig 3 the isotopic composition of groundwater at debre markos gondar and jimma is very close to the wet season precipitation isotope average showing the importance of wet season rainfall as a source for groundwater recharge fig 3 high intensity rainfalls in the summer could particularly be important as low intensity rainfall in the dry atmosphere can be subjected to higher evaporation dansgaard 1964 based on the isotope mixing model eq 1 and using the amount weighted seasonal average isotope values the wet season contribution to groundwater is 96 for debre markos 97 for gondar and 75 for jimma the standard error a measure of uncertainty for the estimate is 12 for debre markos 35 for gondar and 11 for jimma for comparison wet season precipitation contribution to total annual precipitation is 81 for debre markos 78 for gondar and 49 for jimma our results highlight the importance of high intensity summer rainfall for groundwater recharge and it is consistent with other previous studies at other locations in the tropics e g jasechko and taylor 2015 in jijiga the average groundwater isotope values are lower than the precipitation average of both seasons this is likely caused by the exceptional recharge associated with a few intense storm events with extremely low isotope values the lowest precipitation isotope values in jijiga are associated with tropical systems that affect the area mostly in november and december in fig 3c the most 18o depleted precipitations collected in november 2013 bedaso et al 2020 are associated with cyclone 3a that affected the horn of africa in mid november 2013 the groundwater in the southeastern arid and semi arid part of ethiopia could get substantial recharge from these extreme but rare rainfall events that result in flash flooding in a changing climate groundwater recharge from rare but extreme tropical cyclones could become an essential water source in arid and semi arid regions 5 2 regional groundwater recharge pattern a combined evaluation of the spatial distribution of δ18o δ2h and d excess of groundwater and streams figs 4 5 and 6 along with precipitation isotopes provides a way to infer hydrological processes and the nature of groundwater recharge fig 7 as discussed earlier precipitation is the ultimate source of groundwater and streams and their isotopic compositions reflect local precipitation however the isotopic composition of stream and groundwater could decouple due to evaporative enrichment and differences in the integration time of the two reservoirs i e groundwater represents a longer time average than streams in the absence of large scale and dense precipitation isotopes stream and groundwater isotopic compositions serve as a reliable proxy and important to trace hydrological processes and understand groundwater recharge e g wassenaar et al 2009 hollins et al 2018 as inferred from the stream and groundwater isoscapes we identified five generalized regions with distinct groundwater recharge pattern fig 7 however no clear boundary between regions are defined comparison of the mean δ18o of groundwater and streams in these regions show a statistically significant difference in regions b and c whereas no statistically significant difference was obtained in regions a and d due to insufficient data we were not able to compare stream and groundwater isotopic compositions in region e in mountainous central ethiopia groundwater isotopes are characterized by relatively low δ18o and δ2h values and high d excess values the isotopic composition of the groundwater is similar to that of local precipitation reported in the region e g tekleab et al 2014 bedaso et al 2020 this similarity suggests minimal evaporation of rainwater due to rapid infiltration in highly permeable fractured volcanic rocks either exposed to the surface or with thin soil cover fig 7 however the isotopic compositions of streams are relatively enriched fig 5a and b and the difference between stream and groundwater isotopes are high and statistically significant fig 6a and b this may suggest the evaporation of surface water such as runoff from precipitation and springs or streams from groundwater discharge at the foothills of the mountains the streams downstream are subject to further evaporation and hence enriched in heavier isotopes and characterized by lower d excess values figs 4 and 5 northwestern ethiopia shows intermediate groundwater and stream δ18o and δ2h values in the northern half and slightly more enriched isotopic composition in the southern and western part of the region towards the lowlands fig 7 the isotopic composition of groundwater and stream do not show a statistically significant difference this region has high groundwater d excess values 10 similar to the values of summer rainy season precipitation reported by bedaso et al 2020 this similarity alludes to the importance of summer rainfall as the main source of groundwater source whereas light rain in the short rain dry season is mostly evaporated and does not make a significant contribution to the groundwater the aquifers in this region are dominated by fractured volcanic rocks with high storage capacity and recharged mainly by high rainfall during the rainy season ayenew et al 2008 the slightly enriched groundwater isotope compositions in the western highland compared to the adjacent mountainous regions suggest evaporation of water sources before diffuse recharge through thick soils fig 7 on the contrary the groundwater in the western lowlands exhibits relatively high δ18o and δ2h and low d excess fig 4a c and 5a c this suggests potential recharge from evaporated water sources such as over flooded streams and rivers or wetlands as indicated by kebede 2013 and signifies extensive surface and groundwater interaction alemayehu et al 2017 however due to the lack of precipitation isotope data in the western lowlands making a direct link between precipitation and groundwater is not possible at this moment the afar depression part of the lower awash basin fig 7 is a lowland area with a warmer and drier climate this region is widely covered by quaternary alluvial and lacustrine deposits underlain by volcanic rocks aquifers kebede 2013 it is characterized by high groundwater and stream δ18o and δ2h but low 10 d excess values fig 4c and 5c although there are no long term precipitation isotope data available in the region wynn and bedaso 2010 reported an average precipitation δ18o of 1 5 ranging between 6 1 and 2 0 and low 10 d excess the isotopic composition of groundwater and stream shows a statistically significant difference this may suggest the importance of local 18o enriched rainfall as the main groundwater recharge source than contributions from streams previous observation by ayenew et al 2008 also indicated relatively low 50 mm y groundwater recharge from seasonal floods and stream beds however the southern and western parts of the afar depression obtain groundwater recharge from the surrounding highlands and streams and rivers with headwater located in the central highlands the difference in the nature and source of groundwater between the northern and southern sections of the afar depression is attributed to the geological and structural control on groundwater movement between the highlands and the rift floor kebede et al 2008 southern ethiopia shows a distinct δ18o δ2h and d excess pattern fig 4a c 5a c and 6a c the northern part of the region is dominated by volcanic rocks the southern part is mainly covered by alluvial sediments and karst sedimentary sequence compared with the northern part of the region the southern lowlands have lower δ18o δ2h and d excess values this spatial variation suggests a difference in the source of groundwater recharge the high groundwater d excess values in the north are consistent with previously reported values for precipitation in the headwater areas including the bale mountains lemma et al 2020 the high d excess implies recycled moisture in precipitation as a source of groundwater the low groundwater δ18o and δ2h values in the southern lowlands and northern kenya sklash and mwangi 1991 indicate preferential groundwater recharge from isotopically depleted precipitation and our result concurs with woldemariyam and ayenew 2016 fig 7 on the other hand southeastern ethiopia is a data poor region fig 1 but with the limited available data the region is characterized by 18o and 2h depleted groundwater composition and low d excess values 10 the average groundwater δ18o and δ2h from jijiga is comparable to local rainfall at jijiga fig 3 the low groundwater d excess is also consistent with jijiga s precipitation and might indicate groundwater recharge from indian monsoon rainfall the low δ18o and δ2h values of groundwater as in the case for other tropical arid and semi arid regions imply the importance of high intensity rainfalls derived from monsoon and cyclonic activities and their associated flooding as a source of groundwater recharge lawrence and gedzelman 1996 tashie et al 2016 the groundwater recharge for this region is consistent with regional work by kebede 2013 however additional precipitation surface and groundwater isotope data are needed to better characterize this region in general the isotopic composition of groundwater in ethiopia shows spatial variability and it mostly reflects local precipitation however in some cases it deviates from local precipitation when groundwater is potentially recharged from evaporated surface water sources such as stream flooding in the western ethiopian lowland in baro akobo and omo gibe basins such deviation also occurs for aquifers in the rift escarpments and rift valley floors recharged by precipitation from the central ethiopian highlands kebede 2013 it is also possible that large rivers originating from higher elevations recharge low land aquifers as evidenced in other studies sharp 2017 overall our results are consistent with previous observations that the isotopic composition of groundwater is mostly close to the annual amount weighted local precipitation fig 3 e g clark and fritz 1997 but biased towards the main rainy season precipitation e g winograd et al 1998 jasechko et al 2014 bedaso et al 2019 and in some locations it might be influenced by high intensity rainfall jasechko and taylor 2015 li et al 2018 we recognize the lack of precipitation stream and groundwater isotope data from western low lands and southeastern ethiopia these regions show relatively higher uncertainty on the isoscape models fig 4d f and 5d f otherwise our data and models provide a reliable first order evaluation of groundwater recharge patterns at a coarser and regional scale the continuing effort of water isotope monitoring from data poor regions of ethiopia and further fine resolution modeling is critical to improving the understanding and utility of isotopes in the region seasonal monitoring of stream isotope and a better understanding of seasonal moisture sources for different parts of the country could improve future hydrological studies and lay the foundation to understand the effect of climate change on water resources in the region 6 conclusions our results show the spatial distribution of groundwater and stream isotopes in ethiopia δ18o and δ2h of stream and groundwater show coherent spatial variability in most parts of the country with some significant decoupling between the two in some areas the close examination of groundwater stream and precipitation isotope compositions sheds light on the timing and nature of groundwater recharge in general groundwater isotopic values are similar to amount weighted isotope values of local precipitation with biases towards the main rainy season indicating the importance of high intensity storms for groundwater recharge the major groundwater recharge mechanisms in different parts of ethiopia include rapid infiltration of rain water in the central highland mountains region diffused groundwater recharge in the northwestern highlands selective recharge from heavier storms with lower isotopic values in southern ethiopia and recharge from evaporated river over flood and wetlands in the western lowlands despite limited data in southeastern ethiopia our result from jijiga suggests the importance of rainfall derived from tropical cyclones as a source of groundwater recharge however we recommend further monitoring of water isotopes in this region detailed consideration of the geology and hydrogeology at a smaller scale would further refine our understanding of surface and groundwater interaction at a basin scale such a holistic approach is critical in creating a sustainable groundwater management plan in the ever changing climate that has unprecedented impacts on the hydrologic cycle and water

4679,the utility of a particular tracer to perform hydrograph separations depends on the dominant watershed properties combined with meteorological patterns therefore drawing conclusions from one tracer can be misleading combining information from multiple tracers can reveal complimentary insights that advance our knowledge of runoff generating processes we performed hydrograph separations during spring snowmelt and for one summer rain event at two seasonally arid montane watersheds in southeastern wyoming using two independent tracer systems stable water isotopes 18o and 2h 1 4 h resolution and specific conductance sc 15 min resolution event water dominated streamflow generation during snowmelt using both tracers but much lower uncertainty in hydrograph separations were achieved during this period with sc than with stable isotope tracers the stable isotopic composition of pre event and event water were too similar which led to large degrees of uncertainty stable isotopes of stream water did not vary as much as sc throughout the year and indicated the dominance of stream water derived from snowmelt during the main snowmelt period high frequency stream water isotopic composition was remarkably consistent despite considerable variability measured in snowpack and snowmelt samples stable isotope measurements were useful for partitioning streamflow during a summer rain event when source waters were more isotopically distinct and suggested the dominance of pre event water at generating streamflow despite the inability to partition event and pre event streamflow during snowmelt relationships between isotopic composition sc and watershed properties helped to understand mechanisms for streamflow generation for instance line conditioned excess lc excess on the rising limb of the main snowmelt period was significantly positively correlated to the amount of rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions the fastest moving compartment of event flow supporting evidence that freshly melted snow with relatively higher lc excess preferentially contributed to rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions during fall low flow stream conditions the isotopic value of streamflow was significantly positively correlated to elevation where the highest elevation watersheds had the highest delta values this relationship was contradictory to what was expected i e elevation effect and may be explained by extensive snowpack fractionation occurring later in the season in deeper snowpacks located at higher elevations or by a larger amount rainfall with enriched isotopic composition relative to snowmelt occurring at higher elevations through synthesizing patterns in two different natural tracers in conjunction with watershed properties insights into the dominant controls on streamflow generation were gained from seasonally arid snowmelt dominated headwater watersheds keywords catchment runoff snowmelt tracers water stable isotopes specific conductance 1 introduction characterizing how watersheds store and release precipitation as streamflow in a given region is a cornerstone of hydrology estimating the sources of streamflow is fraught with uncertainty but imperative for managing and sustaining water resources in a changing environment this is particularly important in seasonally arid mountainous areas where snowmelt is vital for downstream human and ecological use but drought and warming have increased the risk of severe water shortages milly and dunne 2020 natural tracers provide a way of estimating the sources of streamflow typically natural tracer studies that explore hydrological processes involve fewer data and computational requirements compared to traditional distributed numerical models uhlenbrook and leibundgut 2002 studies using geochemical pinder and jones 1969 or isotopic dincer et al 1970 tracers have become popular cost effective techniques used to investigate runoff generation in data limited watersheds over the past 50 years klaus and mcdonnell 2013 natural tracers integrate real world complexity in flow pathway distributions which are highly variable in time under different watershed conditions and provide a means to map how water mixes as it traverses the landscape van der velde et al 2015 further heterogeneity in watershed properties can lead to discrepancy between the scale of direct point field measurements and that of model sub units blöschl 2001 mcguire et al 2007 such that tracer based information may be more informative or representative for model development the utility of a particular tracer or tracers to elucidate runoff processes will depend on the reactivity of the tracer and the watershed s geochemical and meteorological characteristics for example stable water isotopes 18o and 2h are generally considered to behave conservatively in low temperature environments i e the ratios of stable isotopes are negligibly affected by the organic and geologic materials water molecules may pass through kendall and caldwell 1998 however physical phase changes result in isotopic fractionation that must be resolved for accurate characterization of streamflow sources when groundwater i e old water or pre event water is isotopically distinct from snowmelt or rain i e new water or event water a hydrograph can typically be separated into flow components based on unique isotopic composition of the time variable source waters with relatively high confidence and accuracy genereux 1998 hydrograph separation using stable water isotopes has been fundamental to increasing our knowledge of how older groundwater can dominate total streamflow during rain or snowmelt events in forested humid catchments sklash and farvolden 1979 buttle 1994 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 in addition fluctuations in stable isotopes of water have been used to estimate mean transit times maloszewski et al 1992 mean residence times mcguire et al 2002 young water fractions kirchner 2016 and water ages ala aho et al 2017 in contrast to stable isotopes of water the inverse relationship between geochemical solute concentrations and stream discharge during storm events i e rain or snowmelt has been used to separate the hydrograph into different physical sources of streamflow that have significant differences in contact time leading to the observed differences in solute concentration pilgrim et al 1979 miller et al 2014 depending on the geochemical tracer soil and subsurface geochemical properties chemical equilibrium may be achieved in weeks to months thus making chemical tracers less valuable for partitioning streamflow into old and new sources because waters with residence times of months and years could have the same chemical composition maher 2011 however water originating from distinct landscape positions often results in unique geochemical evolution that can be used to trace the physical origins of stream water for example burns et al 2001 were able to partition streamflow into distinct physical origins riparian groundwater rock outcrop runoff and hillslope runoff using five different solutes due to the unique geochemical evolution associated with these flow pathways when multiple different solutes are used in hydrograph separations multiple flow pathways may be inferred given there are unique geographic sources within a watershed that cause specific geochemical evolution for each solute used independent of the tracer considered all mass balance hydrograph separation techniques assume that end member concentrations are known unique and constant sklash and farvolden 1979 in reality the end member chemical and or isotopic composition is rarely constant or truly known and assumptions are made based on relatively few numbers of samples delsman et al 2013 these assumptions will be more appropriate in certain circumstances based on the chemical or isotopic tracer combined with the geochemical and meteorological characteristics of a watershed hrachowitz et al 2013 for instance snowpack metamorphism and subsequent melt events have been shown in numerous studies to lead to progressively higher isotope ratios i e higher delta values and less variability in meltwater isotopic composition compared to the initial deposited snow hooper and shoemaker 1986 taylor et al 2002 lee et al 2010 dahlke and lyon 2013 beria et al 2018 although the isotopic composition of meltwater is considered to be less variable than fresh snowfall or snowpack beria et al 2018 the progressive enrichment must be accounted for in hydrograph separation models to accurately characterize runoff contribution liu et al 2004 meltwater enrichment of heavy isotopes of h and o and isotopic variability is very difficult to measure and quantify in large watersheds where it is impractical to measure snowmelt across a representative amount of elevations slopes and vegetation types all which are known to affect the isotopic composition of snow koeniger et al 2008 dahlke and lyon 2013 biederman et al 2014 von freyberg et al 2020 in addition wind redistribution can displace a substantial amount of snow and lead to favorable conditions for snow sublimation to occur in which the net effect on isotopic composition is difficult to predict especially in complex terrain beria et al 2018 in snowmelt dominated and seasonally arid watersheds like those located in the southern rocky mountains snow is the primary contributor to groundwater recharge earman et al 2006 jasechko et al 2014 groundwater stores that sustain streamflow in between snowmelt and rain events are thus often isotopically indistinguishable from runoff driven by snowmelt event water in these types of environments jin et al 2012 using stable isotopes of water to understand runoff generation with end member mixing analysis under such conditions may lead to ambiguous hydrograph separations with large degrees of uncertainty genereux 1998 despite redundancy between snowmelt and groundwater end member isotopic composition runoff events due to water sources with unique isotopic composition such as glacial melt cable et al 2011 or rain cowie et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 can still be exploited to quantify runoff generation sources using stable water isotopes in contrast to stable isotopes of water specific conductance sc shows large annual variation with stream discharge such that the lowest value occurs during peak streamflow conditions in snowmelt dominated seasonally arid watersheds miller et al 2020 since geochemistry is typically derived from weathering low concentrations during peak flows is indicative of dilution from snowmelt which has a much lower concentration compared to pre event water hornberger et al 2001 godsey et al 2009 for this reason specific conductance sc a measurement of the ionic content in water has been successfully applied to partition streamflow sources in the southern rocky mountains caine 1989 miller et al 2014 bearup et al 2014 rumsey et al 2015 2020 miller et al 2020 further sc can be monitored continuously using relatively inexpensive automated loggers making it attractive in the remote and harsh environments that cover much of the southern rocky mountains it is important to assess hydrologic geologic and geochemical information in combination with stable isotope data to avoid misleading conclusions gained from one source of information alone kendall and caldwell 1998 chemical and isotopic tracers used in conjunction can yield complimentary results that add to our knowledge of flow pathway development and runoff generation mechanisms jin et al 2012 in this paper we combine several years of weekly stream water stable isotope 2h and 18o values with continuous monitoring of steam discharge and sc for nine nested watersheds in southeastern wyoming in the southern rocky mountain region to elucidate streamflow generation processes in seasonally arid snowmelt dominated watersheds these watersheds are relatively understudied but critical for regional hydrology since mountain watersheds have a disproportionate influence on downstream conditions in addition to the weekly stream water stable isotope values for the nine watersheds we also consider high frequency 1 4 hourly stream water stable isotope data for two of the watersheds during part of the main snowmelt period and during a rainfall event results from the isotope hydrograph separations are compared to a recent study that used sc to separate perennial i e pre event and annual i e event contributions to streamflow in the same watersheds miller et al 2020 during the main snowmelt period graphical techniques were further used to separate annual contributions into rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions representing water with the relatively fastest hydrologic response and delayed annual contributions representing water with relatively longer residence time in the watershed before becoming streamflow miller et al 2020 our goal was to quantify the major sources of runoff contributing to streamflow generation for the watersheds under snowmelt and summer rainfall events and relate these to prevailing physical characteristics of the landscape across the watersheds further by considering both isotopic and geochemical tracers at differing temporal scales we seek to leverage the complimentary information provided by each tracer for separating runoff sources and provide guidance for studies in similar regions looking to utilize tracers 2 study site 2 1 site description our study watersheds are located in the snowy range southeast wyoming the northernmost extent of the southern rocky mountains fig 1 miller et al 2020 the study watersheds range in elevation from 2570 to 3619 m and areal extent from 0 53 to 63 0 km2 table 1 streamflow was monitored at nine locations along libby creek and the north fork of the little laramie and their tributaries lower numbers in the watershed names correspond to upstream sampling locations while higher numbers correspond to downstream sampling locations evergreen forest is the dominant land cover classification and is most prevalent at lower elevations figure s1 table s1 homer and fry 2016 at higher elevations shrub scrub and grassland herbaceous are more common with intermittent lakes and wetlands a mix of metasedimentary and metavolcanic units from the early proterozoic and glacial deposits from the pleistocene holocene dominate the bedrock geology of the study area figure s2 table s2 wyoming state geological survey 2014 metasedimentary rocks from the libby creek group are common at the highest elevations the surficial geology is dominated by glaciated bedrock at higher elevations while glacial deposits consisting of scattered slope wash residuum grus alluvium colluvium and landslide deposits are more common at lower elevations figure s3 table s3 case et al 1998 the surficial geology of gold100 is markedly different than the other

munn and arneson 1998 haplocryalfs and dystrocryepts occupy most of the area haplocryalfs tend to occur on low relief areas while dystrocryepts occupy forests on glacial deposits and on steep slopes cryaquepts and minor histisols are present in riparian areas munn and arneson 1998 a thin 1 m regolith layer that thickens towards the bottom of hillslopes was detected in nonm100 using seismic refraction surveys thayer et al 2018 a porosity transition indicated by the survey suggests that the top layer of upper regolith has a relatively high hydraulic conductivity capable of draining quickly the decline in porosity with depth creates conditions that favor shallow lateral subsurface flow through the upper regolith layer fullhart et al 2019 seasonal snowpack typically covers the

in the following analyses 1 weekly samples from the nine study watersheds and 2 high frequency samples collected from nonm100 and libb400 water samples for analysis of stable water isotopes 18o and 2h were collected from stream monitoring sites at approximately weekly intervals using manual grab samples from april 6 2013 to september 21 2017 making this dataset one of the largest stream water isotope records in the rocky mountains sampling in winter months december march was limited by site access and collected less frequently only samples collected during the three predefined hydrograph phases were used in the following analyses which resulted in between 53 and 79 total samples for each watershed total n 589 samples only the weekly samples were used compared isotope values with watershed properties to maintain consistent record lengths sample bottles were completely filled zero head space wrapped with parafilm stored upside down and refrigerated until analysis to prevent isotopic fractionation automated samples of stream water were collected teledyne isco lincoln ne usa at two watersheds nonm100 and libb400 during part of the main snowmelt period from may 23 2017 to june 16 2017 and during a rain event from august 8 2017 to august 11 2017 automated samplers were programed to collect stream water every 1 4 h during the main snowmelt period 222 and 200 samples were collected from nonm100 and libb400 respectively during the rain event 30 and 24 stream water samples were collected from nonm100 and libb400 respectively sample bottles were prepared with 5 mm depth of mineral oil to prevent evaporation and subsequent isotopic fractionation of water collected within the sample bottles after the autosampler capacity was full bottles were collected transferred to smaller bottles with zero head space and refrigerated until analysis fourteen depth integrated snowpack samples were collected from may 17 2017 to june 28 2017 in nonm100 and libb400 snowpack sample locations were selected to represent a variety of elevations slope aspect and canopy coverage throughout the main snowmelt period eleven snowmelt samples were collected manually from the base of exposed snowpacks from may 27 2017 to june 28 2017 from numerous locations in nonm100 where the snowpack was actively melting far from the main stream channel of nonm100 six rain samples were collected from an event on august 8 2017 that produced an average of 26 1 mm of rain measured from two tipping rain gauges located in nonm100 hobo rain gauge data logger onset computer corporation bourne ma usa four rain samples were funneled into sample bottles with zero head space using a large stainless steel tray the remaining two rain samples were collected from a bulk precipitation

tracers and assess the dominant controls of runoff generation from the nine watersheds at different hydrologic conditions the rising limb falling limb and low flow the main snowmelt period which includes the rising limb and falling limb phases was defined mathematically based on when the moving average seven day runoff was greater than 0 5 times the mean water year daily runoff miller et al 2020 this selected dates in which distinct snowmelt induced diurnal streamflow cycles were present which were used to separate rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions from annual contributions miller et al 2020 other criteria were tested but did not select the dates when diurnal streamflow cycles were present with better accuracy the rising limb encompasses the time between the beginning of the main snowmelt period and the date of maximum stream discharge the falling limb encompasses the time between the date of maximum stream discharge and the last day of the main snowmelt period of the hydrograph the low flow hydrograph phase was selected based on the lowest 30 of streamflow recorded after the main snowmelt period this approximation selected times in between rain and snowmelt events in which streamflow was assumed to be primarily derived from older sources to assess the effect of the underlying geologic formations on streamflow generation cross 1949 stream stage and electrical conductivity loggers were installed each year prior to the main snowmelt period but at slightly different dates for each gaging site depending on accessibility of the sites to account for variability in installation date we calculated cumulative streamflow for each year at each site and only analyzed the records after 3 of the annual streamflow had occurred this approximation resulted in each year s analysis beginning immediately prior to the main snowmelt period instead of an arbitrary fixed start date and allowed for consistent inter site and inter annual comparisons each year of analysis concluded at the end of the water year september 30 3 2 hydrograph separation we used a mass balance methodology similar to that developed by pinder and jones 1969 to separate pre event water and event water from the total hydrograph using natural tracers 1 c t q pe q e 2 c t q t c pe q pe c e q e where c and q represent concentration or isotopic composition and discharge respectively and subscripts t pe and e refer to total pre event and event respectively the quantity of pre event water can be solved by rearranging eqs 1 and 2 3 q pe q t c t c e c pe c e several assumptions must be made for accurate interpretation of eq 3 sklash and farvolden 1979 buttle 1994 namely 1 pre event and event water have unique composition 2 the composition of pre event and event water are constant in space and time or changes can be accounted for 3 soil water contribution to streamflow is small or has similar composition of event water and 4 surface storage has a minor contribution to streamflow stream discharge qt was monitored directly using stage measurements and rating curves total stream concentration ct was measured in situ using data loggers in the case of using specific conductance sc as a tracer or from manual grab samples in the case of using stable water isotopes as a tracer the concentration of pre event water cpe was estimated from low flow stream tracer concentrations prior to the onset of a particular event when total streamflow is assumed to be entirely derived from relatively older groundwater the concentration of event water ce were determined from snowpack snowmelt and rain samples there is uncertainty inherent to these two component hydrograph separations associated with our ability to resolve endmembers relative to the central assumptions behind eq 3

contributions to total streamflow at the 95 confidence interval fpe and fe are the fractions of total streamflow from pre event and event water respectively w c pe is the standard deviation associated with the concentration of pre event water samples multiplied by the t value from the student s t distribution w c e is the standard deviation related to observations of ce multiplied by the t value and w c t is the analytical error multiplied by the t value 3 2 1 stable isotope end member estimation automated samplers were used to collect stream water samples from nonm100 and libb400 during part of the 2017 main snowmelt period and a rain event that occurred in early august 2017 snowpack n 14 and snowmelt n 11 samples were analyzed for 18o and 2h to define the event water end member for the snowmelt events to simulate the gradual positive enrichment observed in snowpack and snowmelt samples a second order polynomial regression r2 0 24 was fit to the snowpack and snowmelt samples which was used to calculate the isotopic composition of event water at individual time steps fig s4 this empirical relationship was needed to satisfy the second assumption listed above a second order polynomial was selected as it had the best fit of all simple relationships tested and provided a relatively conservative enrichment rate with time such that subsequent hydrograph separations were more realistic i e not 100 event water over the entire snowmelt period for the snowmelt events the pre event end member was estimated from the mean low flow stream water isotopic composition from each watershed from 2013 to 2017 n 23 for nonm100 n 19 for libb400 occasionally stream water isotopic composition did not fall in between the composition of pre event and event water in these rare cases to avoid negative pre event or event contributions the pre event or event contribution was set to 100 depending on whether the stream water isotopic composition was above or below the end member compositions six rain samples were analyzed for 18o and 2h to define the event end member for the rain event pre event end members for the rain event were estimated from the mean stream water isotopic composition prior to the beginning of the rain event 3 2 1 1 specific conductance end member estimation continuous records of sc and streamflow at nonm100 and libb400 were used to separate the hydrograph into pre event and event water results presented in this study only include the times in which subsequent stable water isotope samples were collected from autosamplers in nonm100 and libb400 the event water end member concentration c e was estimated from the mean sc measured from 13 snow and 10 snowmelt samples for both the snowmelt and rain event we followed methodology from miller et al 2014 to estimate the pre event end member concentration at each watershed by selecting the 99th percentile of the sc data to account for potential outliers associated with spikes in sc data caused by datalogger malfunction continuous estimation of pre event water contribution was calculated using eq 3 based on these defined end members from 2016 to 2018 during the rain event the sc event water end member concentration c e was estimated from the sc measured from 6 rain samples 4 results 4 1 summary of stream water isotopic composition and specific conductance 4 1 1 stable isotopes of water stable isotope data sampled from stream water in the nine watersheds showed little variation during the main snowmelt period i e rising limb and falling limb hydrograph phases fig 2 table 2 stream water isotopic composition δ18o δ2h during the rising and falling limb phases were not significantly different among any of the watersheds according to the tukey test p 0 05 isotopic composition of stream water during the rising and falling limb phases were similar to the snowmelt samples fig 5 in contrast during low flow conditions all study watersheds indicated enrichment in the heavy isotopes i e less negative delta values in this case and the isotopic composition of individual watersheds became more distinguishable fig 2 study watersheds located at higher elevation that received more snowfall and generated more area weighted total runoff fig 1 tables 1 and 6 tended to have the most enriched less negative low flow isotopic compositions figs 2 and 8 table 2 according to the tukey test p 0 05 the stream water isotopic composition δ18o δ2h during low flow was significantly more enriched for libb100 libb200 libb400 nash100 and nash200 relative to gold100 nfll100 nfll200 and nonm100 fig 6 while all watersheds showed enrichment in the heavy isotopes during the low flow hydrograph phase relative to the main snowmelt period rising or falling limb hydrograph phases differences between isotopic composition in low flow samples and main snowmelt period samples were most pronounced at the higher elevation watersheds 4 1 2 specific conductance specific conductance measured in the nine watersheds had the lowest values during the main snowmelt period i e rising limb and falling limb hydrograph phases table 3 low flow sc was much greater across all watersheds the lowest sc measured during the main snowmelt period occurred in gold100 a watershed with a unique surficial geology dominated by grus and residuum mixed with alluvium nonm100 had the most consistent sc and the lowest stream water temperature during all hydrograph phases table 3 in general watersheds located in the western portion of the study area gold100 libb100 libb200 libb400 and nonm100 were associated with lower stream water temperature and sc 4 2 event based hydrograph separation in nonm100 and libb400 4 2 1 snowmelt snowpack samples were more negative mean 19 94 δ18o

to eq 3 event water accounted for 66 5 and 71 3 of the snowmelt event in libb400 and nonm100 respectively table 4 however the isotopic values of low flow in libb400 and nonm100 used to define the pre event end member were too similar to the snowmelt isotopic composition for meaningful application of eq 3 resulting in 113 1 and 153 4 uncertainty according to eq 4 table 4 when sc was used as a tracer the event end member concentration was assigned a value of 21 6 µs cm based on the mean value measured from 13 snow and 10 snowmelt samples the sc of these samples ranged from 9 8 µs cm to 42 1 µs cm and the standard deviation across all 23 samples was 10 5 µs cm in contrast to stable isotopes using sc as a natural tracer to partition the hydrograph during the main snowmelt period produced similar pre event and event water contributions compared to stable isotopes of water but with much less uncertainty due to more unique end members according to eq 3 and 4 event water contributed 74 4 and 70 5 to total streamflow during the snowmelt event with 17 0 and 19 3 uncertainty in libb400 and nonm100 respectively table 4 4 2 2 rain the rain samples were more enriched less negative in the

stable isotopes of water proved to be more useful at partitioning streamflow into event and pre event sources during the august 2017 rain event that produced 26 1 mm of rain on august 8 2017 due to the uniqueness of end members fig 3 using eq 3 pre event water contributed 95 8 to total streamflow during the rain event for both libb400 and nonm100 fig 6 and table 4 uncertainty according to eq 4 was 6 8 and 5 6 for libb400 and nonm100 respectively table 4 the isotopic composition of stream water in the smaller watershed nonm100 responded almost immediately to the rise in streamflow while the isotopic value of stream water in the larger watershed libb400 was delayed by one day relative to the change in streamflow associated with the rain event fig 6 the sc measured in 6 rain samples was comparable to the sc measured from snowpack and snowmelt samples mean 21 8 µs cm sd 2 35 µs cm results using sc as a natural tracer were similar to 18o but indicated slightly less pre event water contribution to total streamflow according to eqs 3 and 4 pre event water contributed 70 5 and 83 2 of total streamflow during the august rain event with 5 6 and 6 4 uncertainty in libb400 and nonm100 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 relationships between stream water isotopic composition specific conductance and discharge while stream water isotopic composition proved to be less useful for partitioning the hydrograph into dominant runoff sources during the main snowmelt period interesting patterns and relationships emerged when analyzing the isotopic composition during different hydrograph phases and combining this information with our geochemical and graphical hydrograph separation techniques for example lc excess during the rising limb of the annual hydrograph was significantly positively correlated to rising limb rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions pearson s r 0 93 p 0 05 fig 7 a this mathematical relationship between 2h and 18o lc excess can help distinguish the different origins of water a value of 0 would plot along the local meteoric water line lmwl negative values indicate evaporative sources that plot below the lwml and positive values plot above the lmwl previous work has shown that the first meltwater produced plots above the lmwl positive lc excess values while subsequent melt events produce water that plots progressively below the lmwl negative lc excess values due to isotopic enrichment associated with the fractionation of snowmelt e g clark and fritz 1997 liao et al 2005 in our study watersheds that produced the most rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions during the rising limb presumably from early rapid snowmelt occurring on fully saturated conditions coincided with the highest lc excess in rising limb stream water isotopic composition mean lc excess from stream water samples during the falling limb of the annual hydrograph was found to be significantly positively correlated to the mean daily sc discharge hysteresis index during the falling limb calculated in miller et al 2020 pearson s r 0 88 p 0 05 fig 7b larger positive values for this index indicate a more circular hysteretic relationship between sc and stream discharge that was interpreted as greater flowpath variability compared to watersheds with values closer to zero which indicated a more linear relationship between sc and stream discharge miller et al 2020 the watersheds that had the largest daily hysteresis index during the falling limb coincided with the highest stream water lc excess during the same period and were some of the largest study watersheds high stream water lc excess during the falling limb could be indicative of a greater proportion of early snowmelt contribution to streamflow relative to the smaller watersheds that showed lower falling limb stream water lc excess and near zero daily sc discharge hysteresis indices indicative of a more well mixed environment with less flowpath variability while it was unexpected that most of the rising limb stream water isotopic composition plotted above the lwml the snowpack and snowmelt samples also plotted well above these lines albeit within the range of uncertainty in fact other studies in cold regions have reported positive lc excess values from streamflow kong et al 2014 sprenger et al 2016 precipitation samples used to define the lmwl were primarily collected from one site and were predominately collected from rain samples which may explain why the snowpack snowmelt and stream water samples deviate from the lmwl mercer et al 2020 in addition seasonal variability in the relationship between δ18o and δ2h may not be captured by the lmw thus a sinusoidal isoscape may better represent precipitation δ18o and δ2h rather than the long term mean isoscape allen et al 2018 rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions are thought to occur as the result of a combination of rapid shallow subsurface flow and saturation excess overland flow created by daily snowmelt pulses miller et al 2020 watersheds with higher proportions of rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions on the rising limb had lower stream water δ2h and δ18o values which could be indicative of a greater contribution of snowmelt water that tends to be relatively depleted in the heavy isotopes compared to pre event water in addition watersheds with lower proportions of rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions have a larger amount of glacial deposits in their bedrock and surficial geologies tables s2 and s3 which we interpret to have more rapid drainage capabilities thus reducing the occurrence of rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions 5 2 relationships between stream water isotopic composition and watershed properties some of the strongest relationships with stream water isotopic composition and watershed properties emerged during the low flow hydrograph phase a strong significant positive correlation was found between low flow stream water δ18o and δ2h values and elevation pearson s r 0 92 p 0 05 fig 8a low flow stream water isotopic composition was also highly positively correlated to the proportion of bedrock geology covered by metasedimentary rocks associated with the libby creek formation pearson s r 0 71 p 0 05 although this is likely due to the fact that metasedimentary rocks are more common at higher elevation in our study area watersheds with greater mean elevations and greater snow depth precipitation and total runoff had higher δ18o values in low flow stream water samples compared to lower elevation watersheds if we assume that snowmelt have the lowest delta values relative to low flow pre event water this pattern is opposite of what we may expect the elevation effect and could be due to variety of reasons one hypothesis for the strong positive relationship between elevation and low flow stream water isotopic composition is that deeper snowpacks located at higher elevations undergo more enrichment due to isotopic fractionation that occurs throughout the main snowmelt period e g hooper and shoemaker 1986 taylor et al 2002 lee et al 2010 snowmelt that occurred during the most saturated conditions could preferentially contribute to streamflow and produce rapid diurnal streamflow fluctuations with relatively highest lc excess values fig 7a compared to late season snowmelt late season snowmelt which is more abundant at higher elevations would preferentially recharge groundwater due to lower overall saturated conditions throughout the watersheds which could explain why higher elevation watersheds relative to lower elevation watersheds show a larger difference in stream water isotopic composition during the low flow hydrograph phase compared to the main snowmelt period thus late snowmelt occurring in higher elevation watersheds could be much more enriched in the heavy isotopes relative to lower elevation watersheds which melt out much earlier in the year making the low flow stream water δ2h and δ18o values of lower elevation watersheds appear to be more dominated by snowmelt than in reality compared to higher elevation watersheds the positive relationship between elevation and low flow stream water isotopic composition could be indicative of a reverse elevation effect caused by winter storms moving from high elevations to low elevations common on leeward sides of mountain ranges such as our study watersheds however no correlation between the isotopic composition of snowpack snowmelt samples collected for this study was observed with mean watershed elevation which has been reported in other studies conducted on the leeward sides of mountain ranges mast et al 1995 koeniger et al 2008 in addition there was no relationship r2 0 004 between elevation and the isotopic composition of 281 snowpack samples not presented in this study collected from 2013 to 2014 ranging in elevation from 2640 m to 3387 m an alternative hypothesis is that higher elevation watersheds are cooler and have lower evapotranspiration rates relative to warmer lower elevation watersheds at higher elevations summer rain which is much more enriched in the heavy isotopes relative to snowmelt may preferentially contribute to streamflow compared to lower elevation watersheds with higher evapotranspiration rates a third possibility for the relationship is that shallow aquifers lakes and wetlands in high elevation areas are more connected than in lower elevation areas to lakes and wetland surface waters which undergo enrichment of heavy isotopes during summer evaporation e g ala aho et al 2018 welch et al 2018 while elevation was significantly negatively correlated to mean low flow lc excess pearson s r 0 71 p 0 05 it was not as strong as the relationship between elevation and mean low flow stream water δ2h and δ18o values pearson s r 0 92 p 0 05 watershed lake and wetland percentage is highly correlated to mean watershed elevation r2 0 95 thus it is difficult to disentangle the effects of lakes versus precipitation on the isotopic composition observed in low flow stream water samples extensive surface water snowmelt and rain isotopic sampling campaigns across a range of elevations would help to confirm these hypotheses line conditioned excess lc excess during low flow conditions was significantly negatively correlated to south facing exposure pearson s r 0 89 p 0 05 fig 8b watersheds with a higher proportion of south facing areas were associated with negative lc excess indicative of more evaporative environments relative to watersheds with a higher proportion of north facing area streamflow contribution from soil water and shallow groundwater from south facing hillslopes likely undergoes more evaporation resulting in more negative lc excess low flow stream water composition relative to north facing hillslopes line conditioned excess during low flow conditions was also significantly negatively correlated to mean watershed elevation pearson s r 0 71 p 0 05 this relationship may be explained by the large abundance of shallow lakes and wetlands located at higher elevations which could also contribute to the observed pattern between low flow stream water δ18o and δ2h values and elevation 5 3 choosing the right tracer for the right application stable isotopes of water proved rather limited in their ability to separate dominant runoff sources during snowmelt in libb400 and nonm100 due non uniquely defined end members fig 3 of course ambiguity in end members adds to uncertainty in hydrograph separations with natural tracers using a mass balance approach for this snowmelt dominated seasonally arid region pre event water derived from older groundwater is primarily recharged by snowmelt and thus is typically indistinguishable isotopically from snowmelt fig 3 the inability to quantify a distinction isotopically between groundwater and snowmelt water leads to excessive amounts of uncertainty when performing hydrograph separation table 4 jin et al 2012 further the snowmelt event end member δ18o values increased to values higher than that of the stream water towards the end of the main snowmelt period fig 5 this resulted in all of the stream water being completely attributed to event flow which is physically unrealistic that pre event flow would completely cease during this time if we had only used snowpack samples to define the event isotopic composition of event water hydrograph separations during the snowmelt period would have produced less uncertainty due to the snowpack samples being less enriched in the heavy isotopes relative to snowmelt however progressive isotopic enrichment of heavy isotopes throughout the main snowmelt period well documented in other studies e g hooper and shoemaker 1986 taylor et al 2002 lee et al 2010 was evident in our samples although our snowpack and snowmelt sampling schemes could have been more exhaustive in space and time a more comprehensive sampling scheme likely would not have overcome the non uniqueness in end member isotopic composition thus the increase in sampling resolution required to detect isotopic differences between snowmelt and groundwater would not merit the resources that would need to be spent to conduct a wide scale snowmelt isotopic sampling campaign it would be very difficult if not impossible to collect snowmelt samples at high temporal resolution across the wide ranges of elevation vegetation and slope aspect needed to fully characterize the isotopic composition of snowmelt at the watershed scale in contrast to the highly variable snowpack and snowmelt stable isotope values stream water isotopic composition was steady during the main snowmelt period fig 5 the standard deviations measured from sub daily stream water isotope samples rarely exceeded the analytical uncertainty 0 2 δ18o no daily patterns emerged from the high frequency stream water isotope data unlike a study in a bavarian alps a more humid region showing distinct diurnal isotopic variability in stream water during snowmelt herrmann et al 1981 the authors attributed the diurnal oscillations in stream water isotopic composition to regular pulsations from the melting snow humid regions are different from seasonally arid regions in that the isotopic composition of pre event water is usually different to that of snowmelt which can lead to the observed diurnal stream water isotopic variability during snowmelt specific conductance sc on the other hand proved to be a better natural tracer compared to stable isotopes of water for partitioning the dominant streamflow sources during snowmelt in our seasonally arid snowmelt dominated watersheds and indicated that event water contributions to total streamflow during the snowmelt period were 70 5 and 74 4 in nonm100 and libb400 respectively table 4 when comparing tracers for the snowmelt season it is clear that sc provided separations with much less uncertainty compared to stable water isotopes table 4 a large degree of the hydrograph separation uncertainty when using sc was due to a relatively few number of snow and snowmelt samples that had a moderate degree of variability used to define the event end member further snowmelt induced diurnal streamflow cycles resulted in diurnal sc cycles that mirrored the diurnal streamflow cycles miller et al 2020 the timing of these cycles was not always completely synchronized leading to daily sc discharge hysteresis these diurnal hysteretic patterns were quantified using a hysteresis index that provided information on regional runoff generation and flow pathway development miller et al 2020 for example during snowmelt induced diurnal streamflow cycles the daily low of stream water sc occurred after the daily high in stream discharge implying that rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions with relatively lower sc arrived after delayed annual contribution peaks and preferentially contrived on the falling limb of diurnal cycles this pattern supports threshold streamflow generation behavior where connectivity must occur before daily meltwater with the relatively lowest sc contributes to streamflow tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 interestingly the direction of sc discharge hysteresis observed at the annual scale was opposite to pattern that was identified at daily scales suggesting that faster flow pathways with presumably lower sc dominate streamflow on the rising limb of the annual hydrograph relative to the falling limb miller et al 2020 in contrast to the main snowmelt period hydrograph separations using stable isotopes of water were more successful less uncertain during the august rain event due to the isotopic composition of rain being much more enriched in the heavy isotopes relative to pre event conditions however only a small number of stream water isotope samples during the rain event were available to estimate the contribution of event water to total runoff fig 6 if samples had been collected more infrequently which is common in most isotope hydrograph separation studies we would have completely missed the short period in which stream water isotope composition responded to the rain event prior to and after the rain event sc was lower than the concentration used as the pre event end member which likely led to the lower proportions of pre event water contribution to streamflow compared to the stable isotope approach had we assigned the sc measured in the stream immediately prior to the rain event as the pre event end member the results would be similar to the isotope hydrograph separation 95 pre event water however it is more realistic to assign a consistent pre event water end member measured from the highest sc ever recorded at these sites 6 conclusions the applicability of a particular tracer to perform hydrograph separations will depend on the dominant watershed properties combined with meteorological patterns here we showed that specific conductance sc is a cost effective natural tracer for partitioning hydrographs into the dominant runoff sources in seasonally arid snowmelt dominated watersheds where groundwater and snowmelt are often indistinguishable isotopically hydrograph separations performed using sc revealed the dominance of even water for generating streamflow during the main snowmelt period high frequency stream water isotopic compositions measured during snowmelt were consistent despite considerable variability in isotopic composition measured in snowpack and snowmelt samples utility in stable water isotopes were found during a summer rain event when source waters were isotopically distinct and by combining stable isotope data with geochemical and graphical hydrograph separation techniques despite the inability of stable water isotopes for partitioning dominant streamflow sources during snowmelt patterns emerged between stream water isotopic composition and watershed properties at different times of the year that increased our understanding on streamflow generation under different hydrologic conditions stream water lc excess on the rising limb was significantly positively correlated to the amount of rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions suggesting a greater contribution of early snowmelt water that tends to have relatively higher lc excess relative to later snowmelt occurred when rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions were greater during low flow conditions stream water isotopic composition was found to be significantly correlated to watershed properties drawing conclusions from one tracer can be misleading but combining information from multiple tracers can reveal complimentary insights that advance our knowledge on runoff generation from headwater catchments funding this work

4679,the utility of a particular tracer to perform hydrograph separations depends on the dominant watershed properties combined with meteorological patterns therefore drawing conclusions from one tracer can be misleading combining information from multiple tracers can reveal complimentary insights that advance our knowledge of runoff generating processes we performed hydrograph separations during spring snowmelt and for one summer rain event at two seasonally arid montane watersheds in southeastern wyoming using two independent tracer systems stable water isotopes 18o and 2h 1 4 h resolution and specific conductance sc 15 min resolution event water dominated streamflow generation during snowmelt using both tracers but much lower uncertainty in hydrograph separations were achieved during this period with sc than with stable isotope tracers the stable isotopic composition of pre event and event water were too similar which led to large degrees of uncertainty stable isotopes of stream water did not vary as much as sc throughout the year and indicated the dominance of stream water derived from snowmelt during the main snowmelt period high frequency stream water isotopic composition was remarkably consistent despite considerable variability measured in snowpack and snowmelt samples stable isotope measurements were useful for partitioning streamflow during a summer rain event when source waters were more isotopically distinct and suggested the dominance of pre event water at generating streamflow despite the inability to partition event and pre event streamflow during snowmelt relationships between isotopic composition sc and watershed properties helped to understand mechanisms for streamflow generation for instance line conditioned excess lc excess on the rising limb of the main snowmelt period was significantly positively correlated to the amount of rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions the fastest moving compartment of event flow supporting evidence that freshly melted snow with relatively higher lc excess preferentially contributed to rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions during fall low flow stream conditions the isotopic value of streamflow was significantly positively correlated to elevation where the highest elevation watersheds had the highest delta values this relationship was contradictory to what was expected i e elevation effect and may be explained by extensive snowpack fractionation occurring later in the season in deeper snowpacks located at higher elevations or by a larger amount rainfall with enriched isotopic composition relative to snowmelt occurring at higher elevations through synthesizing patterns in two different natural tracers in conjunction with watershed properties insights into the dominant controls on streamflow generation were gained from seasonally arid snowmelt dominated headwater watersheds keywords catchment runoff snowmelt tracers water stable isotopes specific conductance 1 introduction characterizing how watersheds store and release precipitation as streamflow in a given region is a cornerstone of hydrology estimating the sources of streamflow is fraught with uncertainty but imperative for managing and sustaining water resources in a changing environment this is particularly important in seasonally arid mountainous areas where snowmelt is vital for downstream human and ecological use but drought and warming have increased the risk of severe water shortages milly and dunne 2020 natural tracers provide a way of estimating the sources of streamflow typically natural tracer studies that explore hydrological processes involve fewer data and computational requirements compared to traditional distributed numerical models uhlenbrook and leibundgut 2002 studies using geochemical pinder and jones 1969 or isotopic dincer et al 1970 tracers have become popular cost effective techniques used to investigate runoff generation in data limited watersheds over the past 50 years klaus and mcdonnell 2013 natural tracers integrate real world complexity in flow pathway distributions which are highly variable in time under different watershed conditions and provide a means to map how water mixes as it traverses the landscape van der velde et al 2015 further heterogeneity in watershed properties can lead to discrepancy between the scale of direct point field measurements and that of model sub units blöschl 2001 mcguire et al 2007 such that tracer based information may be more informative or representative for model development the utility of a particular tracer or tracers to elucidate runoff processes will depend on the reactivity of the tracer and the watershed s geochemical and meteorological characteristics for example stable water isotopes 18o and 2h are generally considered to behave conservatively in low temperature environments i e the ratios of stable isotopes are negligibly affected by the organic and geologic materials water molecules may pass through kendall and caldwell 1998 however physical phase changes result in isotopic fractionation that must be resolved for accurate characterization of streamflow sources when groundwater i e old water or pre event water is isotopically distinct from snowmelt or rain i e new water or event water a hydrograph can typically be separated into flow components based on unique isotopic composition of the time variable source waters with relatively high confidence and accuracy genereux 1998 hydrograph separation using stable water isotopes has been fundamental to increasing our knowledge of how older groundwater can dominate total streamflow during rain or snowmelt events in forested humid catchments sklash and farvolden 1979 buttle 1994 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 in addition fluctuations in stable isotopes of water have been used to estimate mean transit times maloszewski et al 1992 mean residence times mcguire et al 2002 young water fractions kirchner 2016 and water ages ala aho et al 2017 in contrast to stable isotopes of water the inverse relationship between geochemical solute concentrations and stream discharge during storm events i e rain or snowmelt has been used to separate the hydrograph into different physical sources of streamflow that have significant differences in contact time leading to the observed differences in solute concentration pilgrim et al 1979 miller et al 2014 depending on the geochemical tracer soil and subsurface geochemical properties chemical equilibrium may be achieved in weeks to months thus making chemical tracers less valuable for partitioning streamflow into old and new sources because waters with residence times of months and years could have the same chemical composition maher 2011 however water originating from distinct landscape positions often results in unique geochemical evolution that can be used to trace the physical origins of stream water for example burns et al 2001 were able to partition streamflow into distinct physical origins riparian groundwater rock outcrop runoff and hillslope runoff using five different solutes due to the unique geochemical evolution associated with these flow pathways when multiple different solutes are used in hydrograph separations multiple flow pathways may be inferred given there are unique geographic sources within a watershed that cause specific geochemical evolution for each solute used independent of the tracer considered all mass balance hydrograph separation techniques assume that end member concentrations are known unique and constant sklash and farvolden 1979 in reality the end member chemical and or isotopic composition is rarely constant or truly known and assumptions are made based on relatively few numbers of samples delsman et al 2013 these assumptions will be more appropriate in certain circumstances based on the chemical or isotopic tracer combined with the geochemical and meteorological characteristics of a watershed hrachowitz et al 2013 for instance snowpack metamorphism and subsequent melt events have been shown in numerous studies to lead to progressively higher isotope ratios i e higher delta values and less variability in meltwater isotopic composition compared to the initial deposited snow hooper and shoemaker 1986 taylor et al 2002 lee et al 2010 dahlke and lyon 2013 beria et al 2018 although the isotopic composition of meltwater is considered to be less variable than fresh snowfall or snowpack beria et al 2018 the progressive enrichment must be accounted for in hydrograph separation models to accurately characterize runoff contribution liu et al 2004 meltwater enrichment of heavy isotopes of h and o and isotopic variability is very difficult to measure and quantify in large watersheds where it is impractical to measure snowmelt across a representative amount of elevations slopes and vegetation types all which are known to affect the isotopic composition of snow koeniger et al 2008 dahlke and lyon 2013 biederman et al 2014 von freyberg et al 2020 in addition wind redistribution can displace a substantial amount of snow and lead to favorable conditions for snow sublimation to occur in which the net effect on isotopic composition is difficult to predict especially in complex terrain beria et al 2018 in snowmelt dominated and seasonally arid watersheds like those located in the southern rocky mountains snow is the primary contributor to groundwater recharge earman et al 2006 jasechko et al 2014 groundwater stores that sustain streamflow in between snowmelt and rain events are thus often isotopically indistinguishable from runoff driven by snowmelt event water in these types of environments jin et al 2012 using stable isotopes of water to understand runoff generation with end member mixing analysis under such conditions may lead to ambiguous hydrograph separations with large degrees of uncertainty genereux 1998 despite redundancy between snowmelt and groundwater end member isotopic composition runoff events due to water sources with unique isotopic composition such as glacial melt cable et al 2011 or rain cowie et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 can still be exploited to quantify runoff generation sources using stable water isotopes in contrast to stable isotopes of water specific conductance sc shows large annual variation with stream discharge such that the lowest value occurs during peak streamflow conditions in snowmelt dominated seasonally arid watersheds miller et al 2020 since geochemistry is typically derived from weathering low concentrations during peak flows is indicative of dilution from snowmelt which has a much lower concentration compared to pre event water hornberger et al 2001 godsey et al 2009 for this reason specific conductance sc a measurement of the ionic content in water has been successfully applied to partition streamflow sources in the southern rocky mountains caine 1989 miller et al 2014 bearup et al 2014 rumsey et al 2015 2020 miller et al 2020 further sc can be monitored continuously using relatively inexpensive automated loggers making it attractive in the remote and harsh environments that cover much of the southern rocky mountains it is important to assess hydrologic geologic and geochemical information in combination with stable isotope data to avoid misleading conclusions gained from one source of information alone kendall and caldwell 1998 chemical and isotopic tracers used in conjunction can yield complimentary results that add to our knowledge of flow pathway development and runoff generation mechanisms jin et al 2012 in this paper we combine several years of weekly stream water stable isotope 2h and 18o values with continuous monitoring of steam discharge and sc for nine nested watersheds in southeastern wyoming in the southern rocky mountain region to elucidate streamflow generation processes in seasonally arid snowmelt dominated watersheds these watersheds are relatively understudied but critical for regional hydrology since mountain watersheds have a disproportionate influence on downstream conditions in addition to the weekly stream water stable isotope values for the nine watersheds we also consider high frequency 1 4 hourly stream water stable isotope data for two of the watersheds during part of the main snowmelt period and during a rainfall event results from the isotope hydrograph separations are compared to a recent study that used sc to separate perennial i e pre event and annual i e event contributions to streamflow in the same watersheds miller et al 2020 during the main snowmelt period graphical techniques were further used to separate annual contributions into rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions representing water with the relatively fastest hydrologic response and delayed annual contributions representing water with relatively longer residence time in the watershed before becoming streamflow miller et al 2020 our goal was to quantify the major sources of runoff contributing to streamflow generation for the watersheds under snowmelt and summer rainfall events and relate these to prevailing physical characteristics of the landscape across the watersheds further by considering both isotopic and geochemical tracers at differing temporal scales we seek to leverage the complimentary information provided by each tracer for separating runoff sources and provide guidance for studies in similar regions looking to utilize tracers 2 study site 2 1 site description our study watersheds are located in the snowy range southeast wyoming the northernmost extent of the southern rocky mountains fig 1 miller et al 2020 the study watersheds range in elevation from 2570 to 3619 m and areal extent from 0 53 to 63 0 km2 table 1 streamflow was monitored at nine locations along libby creek and the north fork of the little laramie and their tributaries lower numbers in the watershed names correspond to upstream sampling locations while higher numbers correspond to downstream sampling locations evergreen forest is the dominant land cover classification and is most prevalent at lower elevations figure s1 table s1 homer and fry 2016 at higher elevations shrub scrub and grassland herbaceous are more common with intermittent lakes and wetlands a mix of metasedimentary and metavolcanic units from the early proterozoic and glacial deposits from the pleistocene holocene dominate the bedrock geology of the study area figure s2 table s2 wyoming state geological survey 2014 metasedimentary rocks from the libby creek group are common at the highest elevations the surficial geology is dominated by glaciated bedrock at higher elevations while glacial deposits consisting of scattered slope wash residuum grus alluvium colluvium and landslide deposits are more common at lower elevations figure s3 table s3 case et al 1998 the surficial geology of gold100 is markedly different than the other study watersheds with high proportions of grus alluvium and residuum soils are highly variable both regionally and locally and are affected by slope aspect slope position biota climate and geology munn and arneson 1998 haplocryalfs and dystrocryepts occupy most of the area haplocryalfs tend to occur on low relief areas while dystrocryepts occupy forests on glacial deposits and on steep slopes cryaquepts and minor histisols are present in riparian areas munn and arneson 1998 a thin 1 m regolith layer that thickens towards the bottom of hillslopes was detected in nonm100 using seismic refraction surveys thayer et al 2018 a porosity transition indicated by the survey suggests that the top layer of upper regolith has a relatively high hydraulic conductivity capable of draining quickly the decline in porosity with depth creates conditions that favor shallow lateral subsurface flow through the upper regolith layer fullhart et al 2019 seasonal snowpack typically covers the study area for over half of the year with most snow accumulation beginning in october and melting out by june meteorological data from the brooklyn lake snotel station site number 367 3121 m located

in the following analyses 1 weekly samples from the nine study watersheds and 2 high frequency samples collected from nonm100 and libb400 water samples for analysis of stable water isotopes 18o and 2h were collected from stream monitoring sites at approximately weekly intervals using manual grab samples from april 6 2013 to september 21 2017 making this dataset one of the largest stream water isotope records in the rocky mountains sampling in winter months december march was limited by site access and collected less frequently only samples collected during the three predefined hydrograph phases were used in the following analyses which resulted in between 53 and 79 total samples for each watershed total n 589 samples only the weekly samples were used compared isotope values with watershed properties to maintain consistent record lengths sample bottles were completely filled zero head space wrapped with parafilm stored upside down and refrigerated until analysis to prevent isotopic fractionation automated samples of stream water were collected teledyne isco lincoln ne usa at two watersheds nonm100 and libb400 during part of the main snowmelt period from may 23 2017 to june 16 2017 and during a rain event from august 8 2017 to august 11 2017 automated samplers were programed to collect stream water every 1 4 h during the main snowmelt period 222 and 200 samples were collected from nonm100 and libb400 respectively during the rain event 30 and 24 stream water samples were collected from nonm100 and libb400 respectively sample bottles were prepared with 5 mm depth of mineral oil to prevent evaporation and subsequent isotopic fractionation of water collected within the sample bottles after the autosampler capacity was full bottles were collected transferred to smaller bottles with zero head space and refrigerated until analysis fourteen depth integrated snowpack samples were collected from may 17 2017 to june 28 2017 in nonm100 and libb400 snowpack sample locations were selected to represent a variety of elevations slope aspect and canopy coverage throughout the main snowmelt period eleven snowmelt samples were collected manually from the base of exposed snowpacks from may 27 2017 to june 28 2017 from numerous locations in nonm100 where the snowpack was actively melting far from the main stream channel of nonm100 six rain samples were collected from an event on august 8 2017 that produced an average of 26 1 mm of rain measured from two tipping rain gauges located in nonm100 hobo rain gauge data logger onset computer corporation bourne ma usa four rain samples were funneled into sample bottles with zero head space using a large stainless steel tray the remaining two rain samples were collected from a bulk precipitation

tracers and assess the dominant controls of runoff generation from the nine watersheds at different hydrologic conditions the rising limb falling limb and low flow the main snowmelt period which includes the rising limb and falling limb phases was defined mathematically based on when the moving average seven day runoff was greater than 0 5 times the mean water year daily runoff miller et al 2020 this selected dates in which distinct snowmelt induced diurnal streamflow cycles were present which were used to separate rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions from annual contributions miller et al 2020 other criteria were tested but did not select the dates when diurnal streamflow cycles were present with better accuracy the rising limb encompasses the time between the beginning of the main snowmelt period and the date of maximum stream discharge the falling limb encompasses the time between the date of maximum stream discharge and the last day of the main snowmelt period of the hydrograph the low flow hydrograph phase was selected based on the lowest 30 of streamflow recorded after the main snowmelt period this approximation selected times in between rain and snowmelt events in which streamflow was assumed to be primarily derived from older sources to assess the effect of the underlying geologic formations on streamflow generation cross 1949 stream stage and electrical conductivity loggers were installed each year prior to the main snowmelt period but at slightly different dates for each gaging site depending on accessibility of the sites to account for variability in installation date we calculated cumulative streamflow for each year at each site and only analyzed the records after 3 of the annual streamflow had occurred this approximation resulted in each year s analysis beginning immediately prior to the main snowmelt period instead of an arbitrary fixed start date and allowed for consistent inter site and inter annual comparisons each year of analysis concluded at the end of the water year september 30 3 2 hydrograph separation we used a mass balance methodology similar to that developed by pinder and jones 1969 to separate pre event water and event water from the total hydrograph using natural tracers 1 c t q pe q e 2 c t q t c pe q pe c e q e where c and q represent concentration or isotopic composition and discharge respectively and subscripts t pe and e refer to total pre event and event respectively the quantity of pre event water can be solved by rearranging eqs 1 and 2 3 q pe q t c t c e c pe c e several assumptions must be made for accurate interpretation of eq 3 sklash and farvolden 1979 buttle 1994 namely 1 pre event and event water have unique composition 2 the composition of pre event and event water are constant in space and time or changes can be accounted for 3 soil water contribution to streamflow is small or has similar composition of event water and 4 surface storage has a minor contribution to streamflow stream discharge qt was monitored directly using stage measurements and rating curves total stream concentration ct was measured in situ using data loggers in the case of using specific conductance sc as a tracer or from manual grab samples in the case of using stable water isotopes as a tracer the concentration of pre event water cpe was estimated from low flow stream tracer concentrations prior to the onset of a particular event when total streamflow is assumed to be entirely derived from relatively older groundwater the concentration of event water ce were determined from snowpack snowmelt and rain samples there is uncertainty inherent to these two component hydrograph separations associated with our ability to resolve endmembers relative to the central assumptions behind eq 3 uncertainty was quantified following methods presented by genereux 1998 4 w pe f pe c e c pe w c pe 2 f e c e c pe w c e 2 1 c e c pe w c t 2 where wpe represents the uncertainty in pre event contributions to total streamflow at the 95 confidence interval fpe and fe are the fractions of total streamflow from pre event and event water respectively w c pe is the standard deviation associated with the concentration of pre event water samples multiplied by the t value from the student s t distribution w c e is the standard deviation related to observations of ce multiplied by the t value and w c t is the analytical error multiplied by the t value 3 2 1 stable isotope end member estimation automated samplers were used to collect stream water samples from nonm100 and libb400 during part of the 2017 main snowmelt period and a rain event that occurred in early august 2017 snowpack n 14 and snowmelt n 11 samples were analyzed for 18o and 2h to define the event water end member for the snowmelt events to simulate the gradual positive enrichment observed in snowpack and snowmelt samples a second order polynomial regression r2 0 24 was fit to the snowpack and snowmelt samples which was used to calculate the isotopic composition of event water at individual time steps fig s4 this empirical relationship was needed to satisfy the second assumption listed above a second order polynomial was selected as it had the best fit of all simple relationships tested and provided a relatively conservative enrichment rate with time such that subsequent hydrograph separations were more realistic i e not 100 event water over the entire snowmelt period for the snowmelt events the pre event end member was estimated from the mean low flow stream water isotopic composition from each watershed from 2013 to 2017 n 23 for nonm100 n 19 for libb400 occasionally stream water isotopic composition did not fall in between the composition of pre event and event water in these rare cases to avoid negative pre event or event contributions the pre event or event contribution was set to 100 depending on whether the stream water isotopic composition was above or below the end member compositions six rain samples were analyzed for 18o and 2h to define the event end member for the rain event pre event end members for the rain event were estimated from the mean stream water isotopic composition prior to the beginning of the rain event 3 2 1 1 specific conductance end member estimation continuous records of sc and streamflow at nonm100 and libb400 were used to separate the hydrograph into pre event and event water results presented in this study only include the times in which subsequent stable water isotope samples were collected from autosamplers in nonm100 and libb400 the event water end member concentration c e was estimated from the mean sc measured from 13 snow and 10 snowmelt samples for both the snowmelt and rain event we followed methodology from miller et al 2014 to estimate the pre event end member concentration at each watershed by selecting the 99th percentile of the sc data to account for potential outliers associated with spikes in sc data caused by datalogger malfunction continuous estimation of pre event water contribution was calculated using eq 3 based on these defined end members from 2016 to 2018 during the rain event the sc event water end member concentration c e was estimated from the sc measured from 6 rain samples 4 results 4 1 summary of stream water isotopic composition and specific conductance 4 1 1 stable isotopes of water stable isotope data sampled from stream water in the nine watersheds showed little variation during the main snowmelt period i e rising limb and falling limb hydrograph phases fig 2 table 2 stream water isotopic composition δ18o δ2h during the rising and falling limb phases were not significantly different among any of the watersheds according to the tukey test p 0 05 isotopic composition of stream water during the rising and falling limb phases were similar to the snowmelt samples fig 5 in contrast during low flow conditions all study watersheds indicated enrichment in the heavy isotopes i e less negative delta values in this case and the isotopic composition of individual watersheds became more distinguishable fig 2 study watersheds located at higher elevation that received more snowfall and generated more area weighted total runoff fig 1 tables 1 and 6 tended to have the most enriched less negative low flow isotopic compositions figs 2 and 8 table 2 according to the tukey test p 0 05 the stream water isotopic composition δ18o δ2h during low flow was significantly more enriched for libb100 libb200 libb400 nash100 and nash200 relative to gold100 nfll100 nfll200 and nonm100 fig 6 while all watersheds showed enrichment in the heavy isotopes during the low flow hydrograph phase relative to the main snowmelt period rising or falling limb hydrograph phases differences between isotopic composition in low flow samples and main snowmelt period samples were most pronounced at the higher elevation watersheds 4 1 2 specific conductance specific conductance measured in the nine watersheds had the lowest values during the main snowmelt period i e rising limb and falling limb hydrograph phases table 3 low flow sc was much greater across all watersheds the lowest sc measured during the main snowmelt period occurred in gold100 a watershed with a unique surficial geology dominated by grus and residuum mixed with alluvium nonm100 had the most consistent sc and the lowest stream water temperature during all hydrograph phases table 3 in general watersheds located in the western portion of the study area gold100 libb100 libb200 libb400 and nonm100 were associated with lower stream water temperature and sc 4 2 event based hydrograph separation in nonm100 and libb400 4 2 1 snowmelt snowpack samples were more negative mean 19 94 δ18o

to eq 3 event water accounted for 66 5 and 71 3 of the snowmelt event in libb400 and nonm100 respectively table 4 however the isotopic values of low flow in libb400 and nonm100 used to define the pre event end member were too similar to the snowmelt isotopic composition for meaningful application of eq 3 resulting in 113 1 and 153 4 uncertainty according to eq 4 table 4 when sc was used as a tracer the event end member concentration was assigned a value of 21 6 µs cm based on the mean value measured from 13 snow and 10 snowmelt samples the sc of these samples ranged from 9 8 µs cm to 42 1 µs cm and the standard deviation across all 23 samples was 10 5 µs cm in contrast to stable isotopes using sc as a natural tracer to partition the hydrograph during the main snowmelt period produced similar pre event and event water contributions compared to stable isotopes of water but with much less uncertainty due to more unique end members according to eq 3 and 4 event water contributed 74 4

stable isotopes of water proved to be more useful at partitioning streamflow into event and pre event sources during the august 2017 rain event that produced 26 1 mm of rain on august 8 2017 due to the uniqueness of end members fig 3 using eq 3 pre event water contributed 95 8 to total streamflow during the rain event for both libb400 and nonm100 fig 6 and table 4 uncertainty according to eq 4 was 6 8 and 5 6 for libb400 and nonm100 respectively table 4 the isotopic composition of stream water in the smaller watershed nonm100 responded almost immediately to the rise in streamflow while the

comparable to the sc measured from snowpack and snowmelt samples mean 21 8 µs cm sd 2 35 µs cm results using sc as a natural tracer were similar to 18o but indicated slightly less pre event water contribution to total streamflow according to eqs 3 and 4 pre event water contributed 70 5 and 83 2 of total streamflow during the august rain event with 5 6 and 6 4 uncertainty in libb400 and nonm100 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 relationships between stream water isotopic composition specific conductance and discharge while stream water isotopic composition proved to be less useful for partitioning the hydrograph into dominant runoff sources during the main snowmelt period interesting patterns and relationships emerged when analyzing the isotopic composition during different hydrograph phases and combining this information with our geochemical and graphical hydrograph separation techniques for example lc excess during the rising limb of the annual hydrograph was significantly positively correlated to rising limb rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions pearson s r 0 93 p 0 05 fig 7 a this mathematical relationship between 2h and 18o lc excess can help distinguish the different origins of water a value of 0 would plot along the local meteoric water line lmwl negative values indicate evaporative sources that plot below the lwml and positive values plot above the lmwl previous work has shown that the first meltwater produced plots above the lmwl positive lc excess values while subsequent melt events produce water that plots progressively below the lmwl negative lc excess values due to isotopic enrichment associated with the fractionation of snowmelt e g clark and fritz 1997 liao et al 2005 in our study watersheds that produced the most rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions during the rising limb presumably from early rapid snowmelt occurring on fully saturated conditions coincided with the highest lc excess in rising limb stream water isotopic composition mean lc excess from stream water samples during the falling limb of the annual hydrograph was found to be significantly positively correlated to the mean daily sc discharge hysteresis index during the falling limb calculated in miller et al 2020 pearson s r 0 88 p 0 05 fig 7b larger positive values for this index indicate a more circular hysteretic relationship between sc and stream discharge that was interpreted as greater flowpath variability compared to watersheds with values closer to zero which indicated a more linear relationship between sc and stream discharge miller et al 2020 the watersheds that had the largest daily hysteresis index during the falling limb coincided with the highest stream water lc excess during the same period and were some of the largest study watersheds high stream water lc excess during the falling limb could be indicative of a greater proportion of early snowmelt contribution to streamflow relative to the smaller watersheds that showed lower falling limb stream water lc excess and near zero daily sc discharge hysteresis indices indicative of a more well mixed environment with less flowpath variability while it was unexpected that most of the rising limb stream water isotopic composition plotted above the lwml the snowpack and snowmelt samples also plotted well above these lines albeit within the range of uncertainty in fact other studies in cold regions have reported positive lc excess values from streamflow kong et al 2014 sprenger et al 2016 precipitation samples used to define the lmwl were primarily collected from one site and were predominately collected from rain samples which may explain why the snowpack snowmelt and stream water samples deviate from the lmwl mercer et al 2020 in addition seasonal variability in the relationship between δ18o and δ2h may not be captured by the lmw thus a sinusoidal isoscape may better represent precipitation δ18o and δ2h rather than the long term mean isoscape allen et al 2018 rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions are thought to occur as the result of a combination of rapid shallow subsurface flow and saturation excess overland flow created by daily snowmelt pulses miller et al 2020 watersheds with higher proportions of rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions on the rising limb had lower stream water δ2h and δ18o values which could be indicative of a greater contribution of snowmelt water that tends to be relatively depleted in the heavy isotopes compared to pre event water in addition watersheds with lower proportions of rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions have a larger amount of glacial deposits in their bedrock and surficial geologies tables s2 and s3 which we interpret to have more rapid drainage capabilities thus reducing the occurrence of rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions 5 2 relationships between stream water isotopic composition and watershed properties some of the strongest relationships with stream water isotopic composition and watershed properties emerged during the low flow hydrograph phase a strong significant positive correlation was found between low flow stream water δ18o and δ2h values and elevation pearson s r 0 92 p 0 05 fig 8a low flow stream water isotopic composition was also highly positively correlated to the proportion of bedrock geology covered by metasedimentary rocks associated with the libby creek formation pearson s r 0 71 p 0 05 although this is likely due to the fact that metasedimentary rocks are more common at higher elevation in our study area watersheds with greater mean elevations and greater snow depth precipitation and total runoff had higher δ18o values in low flow stream water samples compared to lower elevation watersheds if we assume that snowmelt have the lowest delta values relative to low flow pre event water this pattern is opposite of what we may expect the elevation effect and could be due to variety of reasons one hypothesis for the strong positive relationship between elevation and low flow stream water isotopic composition is that deeper snowpacks located at higher elevations undergo more enrichment due to isotopic fractionation that occurs throughout the main snowmelt period e g hooper and shoemaker 1986 taylor et al 2002 lee et al 2010 snowmelt that occurred during the most saturated conditions could preferentially contribute to streamflow and produce rapid diurnal streamflow fluctuations with relatively highest lc excess values fig 7a compared to late season snowmelt late season snowmelt which is more abundant at higher elevations would preferentially recharge groundwater due to lower overall saturated conditions throughout the watersheds which could explain why higher elevation watersheds relative to lower elevation watersheds show a larger difference in stream water isotopic composition during the low flow hydrograph phase compared to the main snowmelt period thus late snowmelt occurring in higher elevation watersheds could be much more enriched in the heavy isotopes relative to lower elevation watersheds which melt out much earlier in the year making the low flow stream water δ2h and δ18o values of lower elevation watersheds appear to be more dominated by snowmelt than in reality compared to higher elevation watersheds the positive relationship between elevation and low flow stream water isotopic composition could be indicative of a reverse elevation effect caused by winter storms moving from high elevations to low elevations common on leeward sides of mountain ranges such as our study watersheds however no correlation between the isotopic composition of snowpack snowmelt samples collected for this study was observed with mean watershed elevation which has been reported in other studies conducted on the leeward sides of mountain ranges mast et al 1995 koeniger et al 2008 in addition there was no relationship r2 0 004 between elevation and the isotopic composition of 281 snowpack samples not presented in this study collected from 2013 to 2014 ranging in elevation from 2640 m to 3387 m an alternative hypothesis is that higher elevation watersheds are cooler and have lower evapotranspiration rates relative to warmer lower elevation watersheds at higher elevations summer rain which is much more enriched in the heavy isotopes relative to snowmelt may preferentially contribute to streamflow compared to lower elevation watersheds with higher evapotranspiration rates a third possibility for the relationship is that shallow aquifers lakes and wetlands in high elevation areas are more connected than in lower elevation areas to lakes and wetland surface waters which undergo enrichment of heavy isotopes during summer evaporation e g ala aho et al 2018 welch et al 2018 while elevation was significantly negatively correlated to mean low flow lc excess pearson s r 0 71 p 0 05 it was not as strong as the relationship between elevation and mean low flow stream water δ2h and δ18o values pearson s r 0 92 p 0 05 watershed lake and wetland percentage is highly correlated to mean watershed elevation r2 0 95 thus it is difficult to disentangle the effects of lakes versus precipitation on the isotopic composition observed in low flow stream water samples extensive surface water snowmelt and rain isotopic sampling campaigns across a range of elevations would help to confirm these hypotheses line conditioned excess lc excess during low flow conditions was significantly negatively correlated to south facing exposure pearson s r 0 89 p 0 05 fig 8b watersheds with a higher proportion of south facing areas were associated with negative lc excess indicative of more evaporative environments relative to watersheds with a higher proportion of north facing area streamflow contribution from soil water and shallow groundwater from south facing hillslopes likely undergoes more evaporation resulting in more negative lc excess low flow stream water composition relative to north facing hillslopes line conditioned excess during low flow conditions was also significantly negatively correlated to mean watershed elevation pearson s r 0 71 p 0 05 this relationship may be explained by the large abundance of shallow lakes and wetlands located at higher elevations which could also contribute to the observed pattern between low flow stream water δ18o and δ2h values and elevation 5 3 choosing the right tracer for the right application stable isotopes of water proved rather limited in their ability to separate dominant runoff sources during snowmelt in libb400 and nonm100 due non uniquely defined end members fig 3 of course ambiguity in end members adds to uncertainty in hydrograph separations with natural tracers using a mass balance approach for this snowmelt dominated seasonally arid region pre event water derived from older groundwater is primarily recharged by snowmelt and thus is typically indistinguishable isotopically from snowmelt fig 3 the inability to quantify a distinction isotopically between groundwater and snowmelt water leads to excessive amounts of uncertainty when performing hydrograph separation table 4 jin et al 2012 further the snowmelt event end member δ18o values increased to values higher than that of the stream water towards the end of the main snowmelt period fig 5 this resulted in all of the stream water being completely attributed to event flow which is physically unrealistic that pre event flow would completely cease during this time if we had only used snowpack samples to define the event isotopic composition of event water hydrograph separations during the snowmelt period would have produced less uncertainty due to the snowpack samples being less enriched in the heavy isotopes relative to snowmelt however progressive isotopic enrichment of heavy isotopes throughout the main snowmelt period well documented in other studies e g hooper and shoemaker 1986 taylor et al 2002 lee et al 2010 was evident in our samples although our snowpack and snowmelt sampling schemes could have been more exhaustive in space and time a more comprehensive sampling scheme likely would not have overcome the non uniqueness in end member isotopic composition thus the increase in sampling resolution required to detect isotopic differences between snowmelt and groundwater would not merit the resources that would need to be spent to conduct a wide scale snowmelt isotopic sampling campaign it would be very difficult if not impossible to collect snowmelt samples at high temporal resolution across the wide ranges of elevation vegetation and slope aspect needed to fully characterize the isotopic composition of snowmelt at the watershed scale in contrast to the highly variable snowpack and snowmelt stable isotope values stream water isotopic composition was steady during the main snowmelt period fig 5 the standard deviations measured from sub daily stream water isotope samples rarely exceeded the analytical uncertainty 0 2 δ18o no daily patterns emerged from the high frequency stream water isotope data unlike a study in a bavarian alps a more humid region showing distinct diurnal isotopic variability in stream water during snowmelt herrmann et al 1981 the authors attributed the diurnal oscillations in stream water isotopic composition to regular pulsations from the melting snow humid regions are different from seasonally arid regions in that the isotopic composition of pre event water is usually different to that of snowmelt which can lead to the observed diurnal stream water isotopic variability during snowmelt specific conductance sc on the other hand proved to be a better natural tracer compared to stable isotopes of water for partitioning the dominant streamflow sources during snowmelt in our seasonally arid snowmelt dominated watersheds and indicated that event water contributions to total streamflow during the snowmelt period were 70 5 and 74 4 in nonm100 and libb400 respectively table 4 when comparing tracers for the snowmelt season it is clear that sc provided separations with much less uncertainty compared to stable water isotopes table 4 a large degree of the hydrograph separation uncertainty when using sc was due to a relatively few number of snow and snowmelt samples that had a moderate degree of variability used to define the event end member further snowmelt induced diurnal streamflow cycles resulted in diurnal sc cycles that mirrored the diurnal streamflow cycles miller et al 2020 the timing of these cycles was not always completely synchronized leading to daily sc discharge hysteresis these diurnal hysteretic patterns were quantified using a hysteresis index that provided information on regional runoff generation and flow pathway development miller et al 2020 for example during snowmelt induced diurnal streamflow cycles the daily low of stream water sc occurred after the daily high in stream discharge implying that rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions with relatively lower sc arrived after delayed annual contribution peaks and preferentially contrived on the falling limb of diurnal cycles this pattern supports threshold streamflow generation behavior where connectivity must occur before daily meltwater with the relatively lowest sc contributes to streamflow tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 interestingly the direction of sc discharge hysteresis observed at the annual scale was opposite to pattern that was identified at daily scales suggesting that faster flow pathways with presumably lower sc dominate streamflow on the rising limb of the annual hydrograph relative to the falling limb miller et al 2020 in contrast to the main snowmelt period hydrograph separations using stable isotopes of water were more successful less uncertain during the august rain event due to the isotopic composition of rain being much more enriched in the heavy isotopes relative to pre event conditions however only a small number of stream water isotope samples during the rain event were available to estimate the contribution of event water to total runoff fig 6 if samples had been collected more infrequently which is common in most isotope hydrograph separation studies we would have completely missed the short period in which stream water isotope composition responded to the rain event prior to and after the rain event sc was lower than the concentration used as the pre event end member which likely led to the lower proportions of pre event water contribution to streamflow compared to the stable isotope approach had we assigned the sc measured in the stream immediately prior to the rain event as the pre event end member the results would be similar to the isotope hydrograph separation 95 pre event water however it is more realistic to assign a consistent pre event water end member measured from the highest sc ever recorded at these sites 6 conclusions the applicability of a particular tracer to perform hydrograph separations will depend on the dominant watershed properties combined with meteorological patterns here we showed that specific conductance sc is a cost effective natural tracer for partitioning hydrographs into the dominant runoff sources in seasonally arid snowmelt dominated watersheds where groundwater and snowmelt are often indistinguishable isotopically hydrograph separations performed using sc revealed the dominance of even water for generating streamflow during the main snowmelt period high frequency stream water isotopic compositions measured during snowmelt were consistent despite considerable variability in isotopic composition measured in snowpack and snowmelt samples utility in stable water isotopes were found during a summer rain event when source waters were isotopically distinct and by combining stable isotope data with geochemical and graphical hydrograph separation techniques despite the inability of stable water isotopes for partitioning dominant streamflow sources during snowmelt patterns emerged between stream water isotopic composition and watershed properties at different times of the year that increased our understanding on streamflow generation under different hydrologic conditions stream water lc excess on the rising limb was significantly positively correlated to the amount of rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions suggesting a greater contribution of early snowmelt water that tends to have relatively higher lc excess relative to later snowmelt occurred when rapid diurnal snowmelt contributions were greater during low flow conditions stream water isotopic composition was found to be significantly correlated to watershed properties drawing conclusions from one
