22825,drilling risers are crucial connection of subsea wellhead and floating drilling platform fracture failure of deepwater drilling risers is the most serious accident in offshore drilling which would lead to disastrous consequences this paper presents a bayesian network bn model to conduct risk analysis for fracture failure of deepwater drilling riser a bow tie bt model is developed to identify the risk factors associated with fracture failure and the potential consequences subsequently evidence theory is used to calculate the prior probability of the input event and the developed bt model is mapped into bn to carry out risk analysis of fracture failure of drilling riser finally the probability updating is implemented using forward reasoning in bn model when new evidence is obtained and a dynamic risk profile of fracture failure and consequence status are performed using probability adaption of bn with the occurrence of the new identified critical factors over a period of time the application of the developed model is demonstrated through a case study and some suggestions drawn from the investigation are presented to further mitigate the risk and the severity of accident consequences of drilling riser fracture failure during drilling operations keywords risk analysis bn deepwater drilling riser fracture failure evidence theory 1 introduction the deepwater drilling riser system is an important device for connecting floating drilling platform with subsea wellhead the primary functions of the drilling riser system include isolating sea water circulating drilling fluid supporting the choke and kill c k lines guiding the drilling tools and compensating for the heave motion of the drilling platform liu et al 2013 however the drilling riser system is subjected to many complex loads such as strong wind large waves and high current which significantly affect the safety of drilling riser since 1983 such major drilling riser accidents as fracture failure of drilling riser unplanned disconnect of connector leakage of c k lines collapse of drilling riser main pipe failure of the auxiliary equipment and grounding of the suspended riser column during typhoon evacuation can be found throughout the references reviews holand 1999 2001 kirton et al 2004 xu et al 2013 liu et al 2013 chang et al 2018a on 21 may 2003 a drilling riser fracture occurred when the drillship discoverer enterprise started pulling the drill string from the bottom of the well hole in a bp development well in 6015 ft of water in the gulf of mexico as shown in fig 1 kirton et al 2004 the possible reason of the accident was overlarge top tension applied to the risers large offset of the platform and thinned wall thickness of the riser joint caused by wear of the main pipe with the rotating drill pipe during drilling operations however the fracture failure of the drilling riser system may occur at any location during the actual drilling operations depending on the weakest point of the drilling riser wellhead system from well control perspective it is required that the weakest point of the drilling riser wellhead system should be above the blowout preventers bops if riser fracture failure occurs above the bops well control can still be maintained by remotely operating the bops however fracture failure of the subsea wellhead system below the bops is not acceptable the weak point analysis of the drilling riser system is out of the scope for this research therefore it could be assumed in this paper that the location of fracture failure occurs above the bops which is the acceptable region of fracture failure as shown in fig 2 sonawane et al 2012 in 2017 the first domestic drilling riser joint was developed in baoji oilfield machinery co ltd of china and it has experienced a series of factory tests before actual offshore application risk analysis of fracture failure of the developed riser joint is required to reduce the fracture probability and mitigate the consequences caused by the possible accident furthermore with more and more drilling riser joints currently in service approaching their design lives their fracture failure probabilities increase due to corrosion wear and the accumulated fatigue caused by dynamic loadings risk analysis is an important tool to develop strategies to prevent accident and devise mitigative measures khakzad et al 2013a chang et al 2018b in recent years many studies have contributed to risk analysis on drilling riser ambrose et al 2001 studied the risk of key drilling riser operations and calculated the annual risk of drilling riser failure carr 2014 used monte carlo simulation to investigate the probabilities of failure of risers and pipelines due to corrosion defects chang et al 2018a proposed a methodology for failure probability analysis for emergency disconnect operations of drilling riser system using bn chang et al 2018b proposed a fuzzy petri net fpn methodology to evaluate the comprehensive risk of drilling riser however studies for fracture failure of deepwater drilling riser from risk perspective can be found sporadically in literature thus it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive study to address the failure probability analysis of drilling riser fracture for the actual engineering requirements bn is a widely used probabilistic method for reasoning and it can be used to perform both forward and backward analysis abimbola et al 2015 khakzad et al 2013b besides bn can dynamically update the initial belief of input events based on bayesian theory and new evidence obtained over time which is called dynamic risk analysis khakzad et al 2013a demonstrated the application of bt and bn methods in conducting quantitative risk analysis of drilling operations khakzad et al 2013b illustrated how bn helps to overcome the static nature and conditional dependency of bt model abimbola et al 2015 used bn to conduct safety and risk analysis of managed pressure drilling operation bhandari et al 2015 conducted a dynamic safety analysis of deepwater managed pressure drilling and underbalanced drilling operations using bn afenyo et al 2017 presented a methodology for the risk analysis of arctic shipping accident using bn yang et al 2017 established a systematic corrosion failure model through bt analysis and mapped the bt model into a bn model to conduct failure analysis of subsea pipelines induced by corrosion arzaghi et al 2018 developed a methodology for probabilistic modeling of corrosion fatigue deterioration in offshore structures using dynamic bn the present work is aimed at developing a bn model for risk analysis of drilling riser fracture failure which can be used to evaluate the probabilities of fracture failure and different failure consequences resulting from safety barriers failure the rest of the paper is structured as follows in section 2 a brief introduction of bt and bn as well as the risk analysis techniques are presented in section 3 the risk analysis methodology framework for fracture failure of drilling riser is proposed hazard identification and the accident scenario modeling of fracture failure for drilling riser using bow tie approach are presented in section 4 section 5 gives the application of bn model in risk analysis of fracture failure of drilling riser the conclusions of this paper are presented in section 6 2 safety analysis techniques 2 1 evidence theory evidence theory was evolved during the 1970s by the combined effort of dempster and shafer ds yang and kim 2006 sentz and ferson 2002 it is used to characterize the uncertainty induced by partial ignorance knowledge deficiency or inconsistency about a system from expert s judgment in risk analysis field ferdous et al 2013 after that yager 1987 expanded the original ds combination rule and formed the yanger combination rule evidence theory uses three basic parameters i e basic probability assignment bpa belief measure bel and plausibility measure pl to characterize the uncertainty in a belief structure the belief structure represents a continuous interval belief plausibility in which true probability may lie a narrow belief structure indicates more precise probabilities the main contribution of ds theory is a combination rule to aggregate multi expert knowledge according to their individual degrees of belief uncertainty is characterized starting with a definition of the frame of discernment ω the ω represents a set of mutually exclusive elements that allows a total of 2 ω subsets in a power set p where ω is the cardinality of the set for example the function states of input event include two states success s and failure f therefore the ω s f the power set p includes four subsets including φ a null set s f s f the last subset s f accounts for the ignorance of an expert s knowledge due to incomplete and lacking information about a system ferdous et al 2009 the basic probability assignment bpa sometimes known as belief mass is represented m p i to distribute the probability provided by the expert for each subset belonging to the power set p such that the sum of the proportion is 1 considering the ignorance or incomplete information in the expert knowledge and the unassigned bpa i e m s f 1 m s m f the bpa can be given by eq 1 1 m p i 0 1 m φ 0 p i p m p i 1 the belief measure bel and plausibility measure pl sometimes termed as lower and upper bounds for a set p i are defined as the sum of all the bpas of the proper subsets p k of the set of interest p i i e p k p i the bel and pl measures for the belief structure can be expressed by eq 2 and eq 3 2 b e l p i p k p i m p k 3 p l p i p k p i φ m p k in evidence theory ds rule and yager rule can be used to aggregate knowledge from different experts and a combined brief structure can be provided by the knowledge aggregation operation sadiq et al 2007 however when the conflict between information sources is large ds combination rule will produce counterintuitive results and show numerical instability while yager combination rule can provide comparatively stable and robust results ferdous et al 2009 in the present study yager combination rule in eqs 4 and 5 are utilized in evidence theory to aggregate multi experts knowledge 4 m 1 2 p i 0 f o r p i φ p a p b p i m 1 p a m 2 p b f o r p i ω p a p b p i m 1 p a m 2 p b k f o r p i ω 5 k p a p b φ m 1 p a m p b 2 where m 1 p a and m 2 p b are two sets of evidence for the same input event collected from two experts m 1 2 p i is the combined knowledge of two experts for an input event and k measures the degree of conflict between the two experts the belief structure for the prior probability of the event obtained by yager combination rule is belief plausibility the interval obtained from the belief and plausibility measures gives the belief structure of expert knowledge the belief structure takes the ignorance and conflicts in multi expert knowledge into account and provides a range for the event probability ferdous et al 2009 bet estimate gives a point estimate in a belief structure similar to defuzzification which can be estimated by the following eq 6 6 b e t p p p m p i p i where p i is the cardinality number of elements in the set p i 2 2 safety barriers safety barriers are implemented to protect people environment and assets from hazards or dangers which are physical or non physical methods to prevent or mitigate the occurrence of undesired events or accidents skogdalen and vinnem 2012 rausand 2013 divides safety barriers functions into proactive and reactive functions according to whether the service time is before or after a specific undesired event barriers that are intended to function before an undesired event are proactive while barriers that are intended to function after the event are reactive among them the proactive barriers are set to reduce the possibility of an accident and prevent the occurrence of behaviors and events such as warning signs guidance guides and inspection and the reactive barriers are used to mitigate the consequences of an accident limit the spread of the consequence or weaken it to some extent such as human response rescue or evacuate according to swiss cheese model an accident is formed by the sequential occurrence of multiple failure events reason 1990 in this process if an appropriate safety barrier can be established a failure event will be prevented in the whole process in this way the event development sequence is terminated by the safety barrier so as to avoid the occurrence of accident consequence 2 3 bow tie method a bow tie model is a combination of a fault tree ft on the left and an event tree et on the right which can present a complete accidental scenario starting from the potential causes of failure and ends with the consequence delvosalle et al 2005 fig 3 shows a typical bow tie model which consists of different components such as basic events bei intermediate events iei top event te safety barriers sbi and accident consequences ci it helps to understand which possible combination of input events will lead to the top event in the fault tree and which safety function failures will escalate the top event to a particular consequence in the event tree khakzad et al 2012 2 4 bayesian network bn is a graphical and inference method which describes the relationship between causes and consequences cai et al 2016 it consists of nodes arc and condition probability tables cpts nodes represent random variable arcs represent condition dependence between nodes and cpts define transition logic from child node to parent node the joint probability distribution p u of a set of variables u a a 1 a 2 a 3 a n in the bn can be described as eq 7 khakzad et al 2013b 7 p u i 1 n p a i p a a i where pa a i is the parent set of variables a i the main advantage of bn is in probability updating when new observation or evidence e is given khakzad et al 2013b the posterior probabilities of variables can be represented as eq 8 8 p u e p u e p e p u e u p u e 3 proposed methodology framework for fracture failure of drilling riser in a typical conventional quantitative risk analysis four steps are involved i e hazard identification frequency analysis consequence analysis and risk quantification rausand 2013 considering the specialty of drilling riser fracture and the simplicity of accident evolution process of fracture failure the proposed methodology framework shown in fig 4 involved the following five main steps 1 defining system and collecting necessary information in this step the necessary information of drilling riser is collected including data information at all stages empirical knowledge from research paper and the tacit knowledge from domain experts which should have been collected first in order to provide a basis for hazard identification 2 hazard identification the potential hazards which may lead to occurrence of drilling riser fracture failure are identified using ft analysis fracture failure of drilling riser is chosen as the top event in the construction of the ft based on the sequential failure of relative safety barriers the accident scenarios after fracture occurrence are modeled through an et analysis that starts with the fracture failure and develops with success or failure of safety barriers eventually a complete accident scenario from causes to consequences is developed by integrating the ft and the et into a bt model 3 model development the purpose of this stage is to develop a quantitative calculation model it includes two aspects i e determination of probability and bn modeling usually evidence theory is utilized to aggregate multi expert s knowledge into probabilities when the probabilities of input events are uncertain due to data deficiency or limited information for a system meanwhile the developed bt model is mapped into bn model by the mapping algorithm in khakzad et al 2013b and the interdependences among input events can be considered by bn modeling 4 risk analysis the failure probability of top event and end state consequences are calculated by bn model probability analysis includes two parts i e probability updating and probability adaption the former is used to predict the fracture failure probability of drilling riser and to achieve the posterior probability of each risk factor supposed a fracture failure accident occurs probability adaption is another important application of bn it is used for probability updating based on the new information accumulated over time where the new information can be the occurrences of certain input events or the accident precursors 5 risk decision making the calculated results and conclusions from the steps described above can provide reference for risk decision making and propose preventive measures to reduce the probabilities of fracture failure of drilling riser and its consequences 4 scenario modeling for fracture failure of drilling riser with bow tie method 4 1 risk identification for fracture failure of drilling riser a ft shown in fig 5 is developed to identify the potential hazards that may cause drilling riser fracture failure the fracture failure of drilling riser may occur due to either internal or external factors external factors include vortex induced vibration viv fatigue drilling platform drives off or drifts off with connected risers and undetected damage of drilling risers while internal factors include weld seam defects and initial defects of riser main pipe undetected by nde nondestructive examination the initial defects in riser main pipe and weld seam defects are inherent during manufacturing procedure which would lead to drilling riser fracture when external loads exist the viv fatigue is an induction risk factor when the drilling risers are subjected to high current in general the viv suppression devices are installed to the drilling risers to mitigate and even eliminate viv by disturbing the flow field behind the risers also the drilling platform drives off or drifts off with connected risers is another cause of drilling riser fracture liu et al 2013 when dynamic positioning dp system can no longer hold the position the increasing offset due to wind waves and current will cause large horizontal force and bending moment to the drilling riser system and the emergency disconnect ed must be activated to avoid possible fracture accident of drilling riser chang et al 2018a undetected damage of drilling risers is also an important hazardous factor that can lead to fracture failure of the drilling risers it results from the combination of the appearance of damage for riser components and detection failure damage factors for riser components are identified including bolt fatigue crack bolt corrosion and thinned wall thickness of the main pipe of drilling riser the wall thickness of the drilling riser main pipe will be thinned due to riser corrosion or wear the riser corrosion may occur on the internal or outer surface of a riser the reason for corrosion of outer surface is anti corrosion coating failure additionally the riser wear may occur due to potential contact of the rotating drill pipe with the internal surface of the main pipe in general the drilling risers will be retrieved for inspection and maintenance after a drilling campaign is finished and the riser joints are taken onshore at regular intervals about 5 years for full inspection and maintenance in the process of detection human errors and unprofessional detection equipment may lead to the inaccuracy of the results so that the potential defects might not be found fig 5 a d presents the fault tree for fracture failure of drilling riser of which the input events are listed in table 7 4 2 safety barrier for fracture failure of drilling riser the occurrence of catastrophic accident is usually due to failure of safety barriers successively not failure of single barrier skogdalen and vinnem 2012 considering the specialty of fracture failure of drilling risers the authors intended to establish the safety barrier model as shown in fig 6 from the perspective of preventing escalation of the accident and mitigating consequences caused by the accident with respect to the fracture failure of the drilling risers there are four main safety barriers to prevent escalation of drilling riser fracture accident the recoil control of the tensioner system is the first barrier after the fracture of the drilling riser as drilling risers are tensioned structures and a certain amount of additional overpull is needed to keep the riser in tension chang et al 2018a once the drilling riser fractures the huge potential energy stored in the drilling riser column under top tension will release quickly resulting in large axial displacement and acceleration in short time if this movement cannot be controlled by recoil control of the tensioner system it may damage the drilling riser system and equipments along the recoil path the bop autoshear and deadman system is the second barrier to prevent the potential occurrence of blowout accident of the well the main control system used to control the bop shutdown function cannot respond once the riser fractures as the communication cable between central control room on the drilling floor and the subsea bops has been pulled apart by the broken riser and subsequently the bop autoshear and deadman system will function automatically to secure the well the last two barriers are the human response and the emergency equipments after the bops operations are completed and the well is under control the emergency personnel of platform should respond quickly according to the pre prepared emergency plans taylor et al 2018 the specific operations of human response for the drilling riser fracture accident include retrieving the suspended riser column after offsetting the drilling vessel to the safe position observing the states of the remaining riser column and employing the cutting tools to cut off the riser column just above the lmrp by manipulating the remotely operated vehicle figs 7 and 8 depict the cutting procedure of the peripheral lines and the main pipe by using wire saw and circular saw respectively bill et al 2004 after that the new drilling risers will be deployed and reconnected to the lmrp and subsequently the well will be plugged and abandoned temporarily as the lmrp bop should be pulled out for the further test obviously the timely human response can minimize accidents consequences however the human response requires necessary emergency equipments such as spare drilling risers cutting tools if the emergency equipments are lacking in the rescue process the downtime of the drilling platform will increase and larger economic losses will be caused by the accident in the above mentioned safety barriers shown in table 7 the failure of different barrier functions will lead to different consequences 4 3 bow tie model for fracture failure of drilling riser an et is developed based on the analysis of the safety barriers shown in fig 6 and the developed bt model for fracture failure of drilling riser by integrating ft in section 4 1 and et in section 4 2 is depicted in fig 9 the consequences of riser fracture shown in table 1 consist of eight categories c1 drilling fluid leakage well under control safely retrieval of all subsea equipments short downtime general economic losses c2 drilling fluid leakage well under control safely retrieval of all subsea equipments shorter downtime larger economic losses c3 drilling fluid leakage well under control partial drilling riser column bops and wellhead equipment cannot be retrieved medium downtime major economic losses c4 drilling fluid leakage well out of control partial drilling riser column bops and wellhead equipment cannot be retrieved longer downtime huge economic losses c5 drilling fluid leakage well under control the equipment along the recoil path of the drilling riser is seriously damaged safely retrieval of all subsea equipments shorter downtime larger economic losses c6 drilling fluid leakage well under control the equipment along the recoil path of the drilling riser is seriously damaged safely retrieval of all subsea equipments medium downtime major economic losses c7 drilling fluid leakage well under control the equipment along the recoil path of the drilling riser is seriously damaged drilling riser column bops and wellhead equipment cannot be retrieved longer downtime huge economic losses c8 drilling fluid leakage well out of control the equipment along the recoil path of the drilling riser is seriously damaged drilling riser column bops and wellhead equipment cannot be retrieved longer downtime huge economic losses 5 fracture failure risk analysis of drilling riser with bn model 5 1 bn mapping from bt in order to conduct a case specific risk analysis a bn of fracture failure of drilling riser is developed through the mapping from the bt model as shown in fig 10 the left part of the bt model is ft mapping from the ft into the bn includes a graphical and numerical translation bobbio et al 2001 khakzad et al 2013b in the graphical step the structure of bn is developed from the ft such that input events intermediate events and the top events of the ft are represented as root nodes intermediate nodes and the leaf nodes in the equivalent bn respectively the nodes of bn are connected in the same way as the corresponding events in the ft in the numerical step occurrence probabilities of the input events are assigned to the corresponding root nodes as prior probability for each intermediate node as well as the leaf node a cpt is assigned cpts illustrate how intermediate node are related to precedent intermediate or root nodes the right part of the bt model is et mapping from the et into bn model is just like that of a ft being mapped into bn model which also includes a graphical and numerical translation similarly in the graphical step the structure of bn is developed from the et such that safety barriers and the consequences of the et are represented as safety nodes and the consequence nodes in the equivalent bn respectively in addition the conditional dependencies between safety barriers are also considered and there must be a connection between each safety node and the consequence node only if the probabilities of the states of the consequence nodes are influenced by the failure or the success of that safety node in the numerical step the probabilities of safety barriers are considered as the prior probabilities of safety nodes and the cpts are assigned to the corresponding consequence nodes the conditional dependencies among elements of bn are assigned in cpts the logical gate of ft and experience based judgment are used to determine cpts in bn model li et al 2016 the logical gate of ft represents deterministic relationship between input events and intermediate events the logical and gate and or gate of ft are transformed into cpts of bn respectively by the mapping algorithm due to the complexity and uncertainty of the system the amending values in cpts can be determined by expert judgments rather than strict success or failure the amended cpts are shown in table 2 and table 3 in fact all of the uncertain relationships between input events and the intermediate events used in bn model are defined by cpts for simplicity other cpts will not be given any more noting that the computed results may be subjected to a margin of error because the input data are obtained from expert judgments and reference reviews resulting in some possible errors actually the probabilities of input events cannot be quantified accurately since they are uncertainty or unknown in this paper multi expert judgments are used to quantify the prior probabilities of input events three related experts from the oil company as listed in table 4 are invited to judge the empirical probability and cpts based on their experiences the probabilities of input events are estimated by combining empirical probability with evidence theory firstly the experts are asked to fill out three separate data sheets by their experiences namely occurrence possibility survey tables of input events knowledge of experts is presented in table 5 then the knowledge from different experts is aggregated and the prior possibilities of input events are calculated using eqs 4 6 in section 2 1 finally table 5 gives the estimated bels and pls as well as prior probabilities of input events the bn of fracture failure is developed using graphical network interface genie software u o pittsburgh 2014 with setting the prior probabilities in bn model shown in fig 10 the probability of fracture failure of drilling riser is estimated to be 1 56e 02 the probabilities of eight consequences of the accident are calculated and shown in table 6 5 2 probability updating in order to obtain the posterior probabilities of input events and identify the critical events probability updating is performed by introducing evidence into bn for example the posterior probability of event x i is calculated as p x i y through giving a certain state of event y the most common type of evidence used in probability updating is the knowledge about the top event or a specific consequence in this paper the fracture failure of drilling riser is adopted as evidence for calculating posterior probabilities of input events while the consequence c8 is adopted as evidence for calculating posterior probabilities of safety barriers the posterior probabilities of event x i and safety barriers s i are the p x i fracture failure and p s i consequence c8 respectively which are shown in table 7 as shown in fig 11 by comparing the posterior probabilities with the prior probabilities of the input events the critical input events can be identified the critical input events which are the input events with a high posterior probability and a high increasing probability will provide meaningful information for drilling operations and preventive actions to avoid fracture failure of riser in table 7 it is observed that x4 x9 x15 x16 x20 and x21 have the highest increasing probability and significant posterior probability values these critical events are x4 initial defects of riser main pipe undetected by nde x9 without periodic detection of drilling riser wall thickness x15 riser wear x16 bolt fatigue crack x20 failure of emergency disconnect and x21 failure of dp system thus more attention should be paid to all of these critical events during normal drilling operations additionally it can be found that the posterior probabilities of safety barriers also have an obvious increase compared to prior probabilities the safety barriers s1 s2 should have been failed when consequence c8 occurs the most probable accident evolution paths for fracture failure of drilling risers are found through the influence strength implemented by bn reasoning which are listed as follows i x4 initial defects of riser main pipe undetected by nde fracture failure of deepwater drilling riser ii x9 without periodic detection for drilling riser wall thickness detection failure undetected damage of drilling risers fracture failure of deepwater drilling riser iii x15 riser wear or x16 bolt fatigue crack damage of riser components fracture failure of deepwater drilling riser iv x20 failure of emergency disconnect and x21 failure of dp system drilling platform drift off with connected risers fracture failure of deepwater drilling riser note that the internal factors include only one evolution path of high probability while external factors include three evolution paths of high probability in addition according to strength of influence the bop autoshear and deadman system barrier has the widest arc connecting to consequence node which indicates it has a big effect on accident consequence hence in order to prevent catastrophic accident regular maintenance must be taken to improve the reliability of bop autoshear and deadman system barrier 5 3 probability adaption another important application of bn is probability adaption it is used for probability updating based on the new information accumulated over time where the new information could be the occurrences of certain input events or the accident precursors the critical events for failure of drilling riser fracture were identified by probability updating and their occurrences were recorded over a period of time in this study a hypothetical case in which the occurrences of identified critical events have been recorded for a time interval of 3 months over two years table 8 is included as an example to illustrate how to realize probability adaption normally the average drilling cycle for a well is about 3 months it is worth noting that the occurrence record of critical events represents whether the events occur or not and it is not the actual occurrence record of the events for example x16 refers to the critical event of bolt fatigue crack if this event occurs during the drilling operations it will exist during this drilling cycle until it is detected and replaced at the end of this cycle otherwise it will remain in the next cycle the prior probabilities can be adapted after observing the occurrences of these critical events over two years and the revised probability p can be calculated as follows meel and seider 2006 yang et al 2017 chang et al 2018a 9 p a s n s where a and n denote the critical events experience count and total experience count respectively and s represents the occurrence record of the critical events over two years using these recorded data the prior probabilities of these critical events can be revised using eq 9 and the revised probabilities of critical events are shown in table 9 dynamic probabilities of the top event and consequences can be obtained using probability updating by setting the revised probabilities in bn fig 12 shows a dynamic failure probability of drilling riser fracture and the dynamic occurrence probabilities of c2c8 as well as that of c1 are depicted in figs 13 and 14 respectively noting that the month 0 in figs 12 14 represent the prior probabilities of the top event and consequences from the initial to the 6th month it can be clearly seen from fig 12 that the fracture failure probability of drilling riser increases sharply from the initial 1 56e 02 to 1 83e 02 with the occurrence of critical events x21 failure of dp system during the first drilling cycle then with the occurrence of critical events x4 initial defects of riser main pipe undetected by nde x16 bolt fatigue crack and x20 failure of emergency disconnect in the next cycle the fracture failure probability is evaluated as the peak value 2 23e 02 from the 6th to the 12th month the fracture failure probability of drilling riser decreases slightly from 2 23e 02 to 1 93e 02 due to the equipment components in the critical events x4 and x16 be detected and replaced with the occurrence of critical event x15 riser wear and x21 failure of dp system the fracture failure probability continues to decrease to the lowest value 1 86e 02 the reason for the change of fracture failure probability from the 21st month to the 24th month is similar to that before hence the attention of operators should mainly focus on the wall thickness of drilling riser the reliability of bolt connectors ed and dp systems also it can be seen from fig 12 that regular inspection and maintenance have greatly reduced the probability of fracture failure of drilling riser therefore the relevant departments should strengthen the detection of the drilling riser system establish a unified inspection system and strictly enforce it figs 13 and 14 show the dynamic occurrence probabilities of c1 c2c8 respectively as depicted in fig 13 the occurrence probabilities of seven kinds of consequences have the same trend with the failure of safety barriers from the initial to 24th month and the occurrence probability of huge economic losses accident c8 is the lowest while the occurrence probability of general economic loss accident c1 is the highest among all the consequences from the perspective of the development of safety barriers control accidents the timely and effective implementation of the bop autoshear and deadman system and the human response barriers would change the accident consequences from serious to general loss resulting in the increase of occurrence probability of c1 as shown in fig 14 therefore it is necessary to strengthen the bops system maintenance and human emergency response exercises to mitigate the consequence severity of accidents 5 4 sensitivity analysis when a new methodology is developed it requires a careful validation to ensure its robustness a sensitivity analysis was carried out in this study to test the proposed model if the model is robust the obtained result would be sensitive but would not show abrupt variations to any minor change of the input parameters yang et al 2013 li et al 2019 it is assumed that the prior probabilities of critical events are subjected to a change of 10 with the assumption of the prior probability of critical event x4 being increased to 110 the probability of fracture failure of drilling riser increased from 1 56 to 1 59 when both of the prior probabilities of critical events x4 and x9 were increased to 110 the probability of fracture failure increased from 1 59 to 1 60 when the prior probabilities of critical events x4 x9 and x15 were increased to 110 the probability of fracture failure of drilling riser increased from 1 60 to 1 62 when the prior probabilities of critical events x4 x9 x15 and x20 were increased to 110 simultaneously the probability of fracture failure of drilling riser increased from 1 62 to 1 64 similarly the decrease of prior probabilities of the critical events will reduce the occurrence probability of the top event in the same way as shown in fig 15 as expected a slight change of prior probabilities for critical events induced the variation of probability of fracture failure in a reasonable way thus giving a validation of the developed model 6 summary and conclusions a novel bn model is developed for risk analysis of drilling riser fracture failure a ft model is developed to identify the hazards that may cause drilling riser fracture and an et model is developed to represent the process of accident evolution evidence theory is used to obtain the prior probability by aggregating knowledge from multi experts furthermore the developed bt model is mapped into bn to carry out risk analysis to calculate dynamic failure probabilities of drilling riser fracture and failure probabilities of consequences the present study indicates that the proposed model could be efficiently applied to fracture failure probability analysis of drilling riser the risk updating shows that x4 initial defects of riser main pipe undetected by nde x9 without periodic detection for drilling riser wall thickness x15 riser wear x16 bolt fatigue crack x20 failure of emergency disconnect and x21 failure of dp system are critical input events leading to riser fracture meanwhile the most probable accident evolution paths for fracture failure as well as the occurrence probabilities of different consequences of the fracture failure are figured out the dynamic risk profiles for the top event and consequences are derived from probability adaption which indicate change trend for risk of fracture failure and accident consequence due to the occur of critical events and the failure of safety barriers compared with other consequences the probability of the consequence c1 drilling fluid leakage well under control safely retrieval of all subsea equipments short downtime general economic losses is the highest therefore it is of great significance to take necessary prevention and control measures to mitigate the consequences of accidents additionally the fracture failure of drilling risers during drilling operations is an event with low occurrence probability and c8 drilling fluid leakage well out of control the equipment along the recoil path of the drilling riser is seriously damaged drilling riser column bops and wellhead equipment cannot be retrieved longer downtime huge economic losses is the worst consequence with the lowest occurrence probability the analysis results obtained from this study can be provided as the reference for risk decision making in drilling risers operations acknowledgement thanks are given to three anonymous domain experts for their input and insight without which this research would not have been possible besides

would lead to disastrous consequences this paper presents a bayesian network bn model to conduct risk analysis for fracture failure of deepwater drilling riser a bow tie bt model is developed to identify the risk factors associated with fracture failure and the potential consequences subsequently evidence theory is used to calculate the prior probability of the input event and the developed bt model is mapped into bn to carry out risk analysis of fracture failure of drilling riser finally the probability updating is implemented using forward reasoning in bn model when new evidence is obtained and a dynamic risk profile of fracture failure and consequence status are performed using probability adaption of bn with the occurrence of the new identified critical factors over a period of time the application of the developed model is demonstrated through a case study and some suggestions drawn from the investigation are presented to further mitigate the risk and the severity of accident consequences of drilling riser fracture failure during drilling operations keywords risk analysis bn deepwater drilling riser fracture failure evidence theory 1 introduction the deepwater drilling riser system is an important device for connecting floating drilling platform with subsea wellhead the primary functions of the drilling riser system include isolating sea water circulating drilling fluid supporting the choke and kill c k lines guiding the drilling tools and compensating for the heave motion of the drilling platform liu et al 2013 however the drilling riser system is subjected to many complex loads such as strong wind large waves and high current which significantly affect the safety of drilling riser since 1983 such major drilling riser accidents as fracture failure of drilling riser unplanned disconnect of connector leakage of c k lines collapse of drilling riser main pipe failure of the auxiliary equipment and grounding of the suspended riser column during typhoon evacuation can be found throughout the references reviews holand 1999 2001 kirton et al 2004 xu et al 2013 liu et al 2013 chang et al 2018a on 21 may 2003 a drilling riser fracture occurred when the drillship discoverer enterprise started pulling the drill string from the bottom of the well hole in a bp development well in 6015 ft of water in the gulf of mexico as shown in fig 1 kirton et al 2004 the possible reason of the accident was overlarge top tension applied to the risers large offset of the platform and thinned wall thickness of the riser joint caused by wear of the main pipe with the rotating drill pipe during drilling operations however the fracture failure of the drilling riser system may occur at any location during the actual drilling operations depending on the weakest point of the drilling riser wellhead system from well control perspective it is required that the weakest point of the drilling riser wellhead system should be above the blowout preventers bops if riser fracture failure occurs above the bops well control can still be maintained by remotely operating the bops however fracture failure of the subsea wellhead system below the bops is not acceptable the weak point analysis of the drilling riser system is out of the scope for this research therefore it could be assumed in this paper that the location of fracture failure occurs above the bops which is the acceptable region of fracture failure as shown in fig 2 sonawane et al 2012 in 2017 the first domestic drilling riser joint was developed in baoji oilfield machinery co ltd of china and it has experienced a series of factory tests before actual offshore application risk analysis of fracture failure of the developed riser joint is required to reduce the fracture probability and mitigate the consequences caused by the possible accident furthermore with more and more drilling riser joints currently in service approaching their design lives their fracture failure probabilities increase due to corrosion wear and the accumulated fatigue caused by dynamic loadings risk analysis is an important tool to develop strategies to prevent accident and devise mitigative measures khakzad et al 2013a chang et al 2018b in recent years many studies have contributed to risk analysis on drilling riser ambrose et al 2001 studied the risk of key drilling riser operations and calculated the annual risk of drilling riser failure carr 2014 used monte carlo simulation to investigate the probabilities of failure of risers and pipelines due to corrosion defects chang et al 2018a proposed a methodology for failure probability analysis for emergency disconnect operations of drilling riser system using bn chang et al 2018b proposed a fuzzy petri net fpn methodology to evaluate the comprehensive risk of drilling riser however studies for fracture failure of deepwater drilling riser from risk perspective can be found sporadically in literature thus it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive study to address the failure probability analysis of drilling riser fracture for the actual engineering requirements bn is a widely used probabilistic method for reasoning and it can be used to perform both forward and backward analysis abimbola et al 2015 khakzad et al 2013b besides bn can dynamically update the initial belief of input events based on bayesian theory and new evidence obtained over time which is called dynamic risk analysis khakzad et al 2013a demonstrated the application of bt and bn methods in conducting quantitative risk analysis of drilling operations khakzad et al 2013b illustrated how bn helps to overcome the static nature and conditional dependency of bt model abimbola et al 2015 used bn to conduct safety and risk analysis of managed pressure drilling operation bhandari et al 2015 conducted a dynamic safety analysis of deepwater managed pressure drilling and underbalanced drilling operations using bn afenyo et al 2017 presented a methodology for the risk analysis of arctic shipping accident using bn yang et al 2017 established a systematic corrosion failure model through bt analysis and mapped the bt model into a bn model to conduct failure analysis of subsea pipelines induced by corrosion arzaghi et al 2018 developed a methodology for probabilistic modeling of corrosion fatigue deterioration in offshore structures using dynamic bn the present work is aimed at developing a bn model for risk analysis of drilling riser fracture failure which can be used to evaluate the probabilities of fracture failure and different failure consequences resulting from safety barriers failure the rest of the paper is structured as follows in section 2 a brief introduction of bt and bn as well as the risk analysis techniques are presented in section 3 the risk analysis methodology framework for fracture failure of drilling riser is proposed hazard identification and the accident scenario modeling of fracture failure for drilling riser using bow tie approach are presented in section 4 section 5 gives the application of bn model in risk analysis of fracture failure of drilling riser the conclusions of this paper are presented in section 6 2 safety analysis techniques 2 1 evidence theory evidence theory was evolved during the 1970s by the combined effort of dempster and shafer ds yang and kim 2006 sentz and ferson 2002 it is used to characterize the uncertainty induced by partial ignorance knowledge deficiency or inconsistency about a system from expert s judgment in risk analysis field ferdous et al 2013 after that yager 1987 expanded the original ds combination rule and formed the yanger combination rule evidence theory uses three basic parameters i e basic probability assignment bpa belief measure bel and plausibility measure pl to characterize the uncertainty in a belief structure the belief structure represents a continuous interval belief plausibility in which true probability may lie a narrow belief structure indicates more precise probabilities the main contribution of ds theory is a combination rule to aggregate multi expert knowledge according to their individual degrees of belief uncertainty is characterized starting with a definition of the frame of discernment ω the ω represents a set of mutually exclusive elements that allows a total of 2 ω subsets in a power set p where ω is the cardinality of the set for example the function states of input event include two states success s and failure f therefore the ω s f the power set p includes four subsets including φ a null set s f s f the last subset s f accounts for the ignorance of an expert s knowledge due to incomplete and lacking information about a system ferdous et al 2009 the basic probability assignment bpa sometimes known as belief mass is represented m p i to distribute the probability provided by the expert for each subset belonging to the power set p such that the sum of the proportion is 1 considering the ignorance or incomplete information in the expert knowledge and the unassigned bpa i e m s f 1 m s m f the bpa can be given by eq 1 1 m p i 0 1 m φ 0 p i p m p i 1 the belief measure bel and plausibility measure pl sometimes termed as lower and upper bounds for a set p i are defined as the sum of all the bpas of the proper subsets p k of the set of interest p i i e p k p i the bel and pl measures for the belief structure can be expressed by eq 2 and eq 3 2 b e l p i p k p i m p k 3 p l p i p k p i φ m p k in evidence theory ds rule and yager rule can be used to aggregate knowledge from different experts and a combined brief structure can be provided by the knowledge aggregation operation sadiq et al 2007 however when the conflict between information sources is large ds combination rule will produce counterintuitive results and show numerical instability while yager combination rule can provide comparatively stable and robust results ferdous et al 2009 in the present study yager combination rule in eqs 4 and 5 are utilized in evidence theory to aggregate multi experts knowledge 4 m 1 2 p i 0 f o r p i φ p a p b p i m 1 p a m 2 p b f o r p i ω p a p b p i m 1 p a m 2 p b k f o r p i ω 5 k p a p b φ m 1 p a m p b 2 where m 1 p a and m 2 p b are two sets of evidence for the same input event collected from two experts m 1 2 p i is the combined knowledge of two experts for an input event and k measures the degree of conflict between the two experts the belief structure for the prior probability of the event obtained by yager combination rule is belief plausibility the interval obtained from the belief and plausibility measures gives the belief structure of expert knowledge the belief structure takes the ignorance and conflicts in multi expert knowledge into account and provides a range for the event probability ferdous et al 2009 bet estimate gives a point estimate in a belief structure similar to defuzzification which can be estimated by the following eq 6 6 b e t p p p m p i p i where p i is the cardinality number of elements in the set p i 2 2 safety barriers safety barriers are implemented to protect people environment and assets from hazards or dangers which are physical or non physical methods to prevent or mitigate the occurrence of undesired events or accidents skogdalen and vinnem 2012 rausand 2013 divides safety barriers functions into proactive and reactive functions according to whether the service time is before or after a specific undesired event barriers that are intended to function before an undesired event are proactive while barriers that are intended to function after the event are reactive among them the proactive barriers are set to reduce the possibility of an accident and prevent the occurrence of behaviors and events such as warning signs guidance guides and inspection and the reactive barriers are used to mitigate the consequences of an accident limit the spread of the consequence or weaken it to some extent such as human response rescue or evacuate according to swiss cheese model an accident is formed by the sequential occurrence of multiple failure events reason 1990 in this process if an appropriate safety barrier can be established a failure event will be prevented in the whole process in this way the event development sequence is terminated by the safety barrier so as to avoid the occurrence of accident consequence 2 3 bow tie method a bow tie model is a combination of a fault tree ft on the left and an event tree et on the right which can present a complete accidental scenario starting from the potential causes of failure and ends with the consequence delvosalle et al 2005 fig 3 shows a typical bow tie model which consists of different components such as basic events bei intermediate events iei top event te safety barriers sbi and accident consequences ci it helps to understand which possible combination of input events will lead to the top event in the fault tree and which safety function failures will escalate the top event to a particular consequence in the event tree khakzad et al 2012 2 4 bayesian network bn is a graphical and inference method which describes the relationship between causes and consequences cai et al 2016 it consists of nodes arc and condition probability tables cpts nodes represent random variable arcs represent condition dependence between nodes and cpts define transition logic from child node to parent node the joint probability distribution p u of a set of variables u a a 1 a 2 a 3 a n in the bn can be described as eq 7 khakzad et al 2013b 7 p u i 1 n p a i p a a i where pa a i is the parent set of variables a i the main advantage of bn is in probability updating when new observation or evidence e is given khakzad et al 2013b the posterior probabilities of variables can be represented as eq 8 8 p u e p u e p e p u e u p u e 3 proposed methodology framework for fracture failure of drilling riser in a typical conventional quantitative risk analysis four steps are involved i e hazard identification frequency analysis consequence analysis and risk quantification rausand 2013 considering the specialty of drilling riser fracture and the simplicity of accident evolution process of fracture failure the proposed methodology framework shown in fig 4 involved the following five main steps 1 defining system and collecting necessary information in this step the necessary information of drilling riser is collected including data information at all stages empirical knowledge from research paper and the tacit knowledge from domain experts which should have been collected first in order to provide a basis for hazard identification 2 hazard identification the potential hazards which may lead to occurrence of drilling riser fracture failure are identified using ft analysis fracture failure of drilling riser is chosen as the top event in the construction of the ft based on the sequential failure of relative safety barriers the accident scenarios after fracture occurrence are modeled through an et analysis that starts with the fracture failure and develops with success or failure of safety barriers eventually a complete accident scenario from causes to consequences is developed by integrating the ft and the et into a bt model 3 model development the purpose of this stage is to develop a quantitative calculation model it includes two aspects i e determination of probability and bn modeling usually evidence theory is utilized to aggregate multi expert s knowledge into probabilities when the probabilities of input events are uncertain due to data deficiency or limited information for a system meanwhile the developed bt model is mapped into bn model by the mapping algorithm in khakzad et al 2013b and the interdependences among input events can be considered by bn modeling 4 risk analysis the failure probability of top event and end state consequences are calculated by bn model probability analysis includes two parts i e probability updating and probability adaption the former is used to predict the fracture failure probability of drilling riser and to achieve the posterior probability of each risk factor supposed a fracture failure accident occurs probability adaption is another important application of bn it is used for probability updating based on the new information accumulated over time where the new information can be the occurrences of certain input events or the accident precursors 5 risk decision making the calculated results and conclusions from the steps described above can provide reference for risk decision making and propose preventive measures to reduce the probabilities of fracture failure of drilling riser and its consequences 4 scenario modeling for fracture failure of drilling riser with bow tie method 4 1 risk identification for fracture failure of drilling riser a ft shown in fig 5 is developed to identify the potential hazards that may cause drilling riser fracture failure the fracture failure of drilling riser may occur due to either internal or external factors external factors include vortex induced vibration viv fatigue drilling platform drives off or drifts off with connected risers and undetected damage of drilling risers while internal factors include weld seam defects and initial defects of riser main pipe undetected by nde nondestructive examination the initial defects in riser main pipe and weld seam defects are inherent during manufacturing procedure which would lead to drilling riser fracture when external loads exist the viv fatigue is an induction risk factor when the drilling risers are subjected to high current in general the viv suppression devices are installed to the drilling risers to mitigate and even eliminate viv by disturbing the flow field behind the risers also the drilling platform drives off or drifts off with connected risers is another cause of drilling riser fracture liu et al 2013 when dynamic positioning dp system can no longer hold the position the increasing offset due to wind waves and current will cause large horizontal force and bending moment to the drilling riser system and the emergency disconnect ed must be activated to avoid possible fracture accident of drilling riser chang et al 2018a undetected damage of drilling risers is also an important hazardous factor that can lead to fracture failure of the drilling risers it results from the combination of the appearance of damage for riser components and detection failure damage factors for riser components are identified including bolt fatigue crack bolt corrosion and thinned wall thickness of the main pipe of drilling riser the wall thickness of the drilling riser main pipe will be thinned due to riser corrosion or wear the riser corrosion may occur on the internal or outer surface of a riser the reason for corrosion of outer surface is anti corrosion coating failure additionally the riser wear may occur due to potential contact of the rotating drill pipe with the internal surface of the main pipe in general the drilling risers will be retrieved for inspection and maintenance after a drilling campaign is finished and the riser joints are taken onshore at regular intervals about 5 years for full inspection and maintenance in the process of detection human errors and unprofessional detection equipment may lead to the inaccuracy of the results so that the potential defects might not be found fig 5 a d presents the fault tree for fracture failure of drilling riser of which the input events are listed in table 7 4 2 safety barrier for fracture failure of drilling riser the occurrence of catastrophic accident is usually due to failure of safety barriers successively not failure of single barrier skogdalen and vinnem 2012 considering the specialty of fracture failure of drilling risers the authors intended to establish the safety barrier model as shown in fig 6 from the perspective of preventing escalation of the accident and mitigating consequences caused by the accident with respect to the fracture failure of the drilling risers there are four main safety barriers to prevent escalation of drilling riser fracture accident the recoil control of the tensioner system is the first barrier after the fracture of the drilling riser as drilling risers are tensioned structures and a certain amount of additional overpull is needed to keep the riser in tension chang et al 2018a once the drilling riser fractures the huge potential energy stored in the drilling riser column under top tension will release quickly resulting in large axial displacement and acceleration in short time if this movement cannot be controlled by recoil control of the tensioner system it may damage the drilling riser system and equipments along the recoil path the bop autoshear and deadman system is the second barrier to prevent the potential occurrence of blowout accident of the well the main control system used to control the bop shutdown function cannot respond once the riser fractures as the communication cable between central control room on the drilling floor and the subsea bops has been pulled apart by the broken riser and subsequently the bop autoshear and deadman system will function automatically to secure the well the last two barriers are the human response and the emergency equipments after the bops operations are completed and the well is under control the emergency personnel of platform should respond quickly according to the pre prepared emergency plans taylor et al 2018 the specific operations of human response for the drilling riser fracture accident include retrieving the suspended riser column after offsetting the drilling vessel to the safe position observing the states of the remaining riser column and employing the cutting tools to cut off the riser column just above the lmrp by manipulating the remotely operated vehicle figs 7 and 8 depict the cutting procedure of the peripheral lines and the main pipe by using wire saw and circular saw respectively bill et al 2004 after that the new drilling risers will be deployed and reconnected to the lmrp and subsequently the well will be plugged and abandoned temporarily as the lmrp bop should be pulled out for the further test obviously the timely human response can minimize accidents consequences however the human response requires necessary emergency equipments such as spare drilling risers cutting tools if the emergency equipments are lacking in the rescue process the downtime of the drilling platform will increase and larger economic losses will be caused by the accident in the above mentioned safety barriers shown in table 7 the failure of different barrier functions will lead to different consequences 4 3 bow tie model for fracture failure of drilling riser an et is developed based on the analysis of the safety barriers shown in fig 6 and the developed bt model for fracture failure of drilling riser by integrating ft in section 4 1 and et in section 4 2 is depicted in fig 9 the consequences of riser fracture shown in table 1 consist of eight categories c1 drilling fluid leakage well under control safely retrieval of all subsea equipments short downtime general economic losses c2 drilling fluid leakage well under control safely retrieval of all subsea equipments shorter downtime larger economic losses c3 drilling fluid leakage well under control partial drilling riser column bops and wellhead equipment cannot be retrieved medium downtime major economic losses c4 drilling fluid leakage well out of control partial drilling riser column bops and wellhead equipment cannot be retrieved longer downtime huge economic losses c5 drilling fluid leakage well under control the equipment along the recoil path of the drilling riser is seriously damaged safely retrieval of all subsea equipments shorter downtime larger economic losses c6 drilling fluid leakage well under control the equipment along the recoil path of the drilling riser is seriously damaged safely retrieval of all subsea equipments medium downtime major economic losses c7 drilling fluid leakage well under control the equipment along the recoil path of the drilling riser is seriously damaged drilling riser column bops and wellhead equipment cannot be retrieved longer downtime huge economic losses c8 drilling fluid leakage well out of control the equipment along the recoil path of the drilling riser is seriously damaged drilling riser column bops and wellhead equipment cannot be retrieved longer downtime huge economic losses 5 fracture failure risk analysis of drilling riser with bn model 5 1 bn mapping from bt in order to conduct a case specific risk analysis a bn of fracture failure of drilling riser is developed through the mapping from the bt model as shown in fig 10 the left part of the bt model is ft mapping from the ft into the bn includes a graphical and numerical translation bobbio et al 2001 khakzad et al 2013b in the graphical step the structure of bn is developed from the ft such that input events intermediate events and the top events of the ft are represented as root nodes intermediate nodes and the leaf nodes in the equivalent bn respectively the nodes of bn are connected in the same way as the corresponding events in the ft in the numerical step occurrence probabilities of the input events are assigned to the corresponding root nodes as prior probability for each intermediate node as well as the leaf node a cpt is assigned cpts illustrate how intermediate node are related to precedent intermediate or root nodes the right part of the bt model is et mapping from the et into bn model is just like that of a ft being mapped into bn model which also includes a graphical and numerical translation similarly in the graphical step the structure of bn is developed from the et such that safety barriers and the consequences of the et are represented as safety nodes and the consequence nodes in the equivalent bn respectively in addition the conditional dependencies between safety barriers are also considered and there must be a connection between each safety node and the consequence node only if the probabilities of the states of the consequence nodes are influenced by the failure or the success of that safety node in the numerical step the probabilities of safety barriers are considered as the prior probabilities of safety nodes and the cpts are assigned to the corresponding consequence nodes the conditional dependencies among elements of bn are assigned in cpts the logical gate of ft and experience based judgment are used to determine cpts in bn model li et al 2016 the logical gate of ft represents deterministic relationship between input events and intermediate events the logical and gate and or gate of ft are transformed into cpts of bn respectively by the mapping algorithm due to the complexity and uncertainty of the system the amending values in cpts can be determined by expert judgments rather than strict success or failure the amended cpts are shown in table 2 and table 3 in fact all of the uncertain relationships between input events and the intermediate events used in bn model are defined by cpts for simplicity other cpts will not be given any more noting that the computed results may be subjected to a margin of error because the input data are obtained from expert judgments and reference reviews resulting in some possible errors actually the probabilities of input events cannot be quantified accurately since they are uncertainty or unknown in this paper multi expert judgments are used to quantify the prior probabilities of input events three related experts from the oil company as listed in table 4 are invited to judge the empirical probability and cpts based on their experiences the probabilities of input events are estimated by combining empirical probability with evidence theory firstly the experts are asked to fill out three separate data sheets by their experiences namely occurrence possibility survey tables of input events knowledge of experts is presented in table 5 then the knowledge from different experts is aggregated and the prior possibilities of input events are calculated using eqs 4 6 in section 2 1 finally table 5 gives the estimated bels and pls as well as prior probabilities of input events the bn of fracture failure is developed using graphical network interface genie software u o pittsburgh 2014 with setting the prior probabilities in bn model shown in fig 10 the probability of fracture failure of drilling riser is estimated to be 1 56e 02 the probabilities of eight consequences of the accident are calculated and shown in table 6 5 2 probability updating in order to obtain the posterior probabilities of input events and identify the critical events probability updating is performed by introducing evidence into bn for example the posterior probability of event x i is calculated as p x i y through giving a certain state of event y the most common type of evidence used in probability updating is the knowledge about the top event or a specific consequence in this paper the fracture failure of drilling riser is adopted as evidence for calculating posterior probabilities of input events while the consequence c8 is adopted as evidence for calculating posterior probabilities of safety barriers the posterior probabilities of event x i and safety barriers s i are the p x i fracture failure and p s i consequence c8 respectively which are shown in table 7 as shown in fig 11 by comparing the posterior probabilities with the prior probabilities of the input events the critical input events can be identified the critical input events which are the input events with a high posterior probability and a high increasing probability will provide meaningful information for drilling operations and preventive actions to avoid fracture failure of riser in table 7 it is observed that x4 x9 x15 x16 x20 and x21 have the highest increasing probability and significant posterior probability values these critical events are x4 initial defects of riser main pipe undetected by nde x9 without periodic detection of drilling riser wall thickness x15 riser wear x16 bolt fatigue crack x20 failure of emergency disconnect and x21 failure of dp system thus more attention should be paid to all of these critical events during normal drilling operations additionally it can be found that the posterior probabilities of safety barriers also have an obvious increase compared to prior probabilities the safety barriers s1 s2 should have been failed when consequence c8 occurs the most probable accident evolution paths for fracture failure of drilling risers are found through the influence strength implemented by bn reasoning which are listed as follows i x4 initial defects of riser main pipe undetected by nde fracture failure of deepwater drilling riser ii x9 without periodic detection for drilling riser wall thickness detection failure undetected damage of drilling risers fracture failure of deepwater drilling riser iii x15 riser wear or x16 bolt fatigue crack damage of riser components fracture failure of deepwater drilling riser iv x20 failure of emergency disconnect and x21 failure of dp system drilling platform drift off with connected risers fracture failure of deepwater drilling riser note that the internal factors include only one evolution path of high probability while external factors include three evolution paths of high probability in addition according to strength of influence the bop autoshear and deadman system barrier has the widest arc connecting to consequence node which indicates it has a big effect on accident consequence hence in order to prevent catastrophic accident regular maintenance must be taken to improve the reliability of bop autoshear and deadman system barrier 5 3 probability adaption another important application of bn is probability adaption it is used for probability updating based on the new information accumulated over time where the new information could be the occurrences of certain input events or the accident precursors the critical events for failure of drilling riser fracture were identified by probability updating and their occurrences were recorded over a period of time in this study a hypothetical case in which the occurrences of identified critical events have been recorded for a time interval of 3 months over two years table 8 is included as an example to illustrate how to realize probability adaption normally the average drilling cycle for a well is about 3 months it is worth noting that the occurrence record of critical events represents whether the events occur or not and it is not the actual occurrence record of the events for example x16 refers to the critical event of bolt fatigue crack if this event occurs during the drilling operations it will exist during this drilling cycle until it is detected and replaced at the end of this cycle otherwise it will remain in the next cycle the prior probabilities can be adapted after observing the occurrences of these critical events over two years and the revised probability p can be calculated as follows meel and seider 2006 yang et al 2017 chang et al 2018a 9 p a s n s where a and n denote the critical events experience count and total experience count respectively and s represents the occurrence record of the critical events over two years using these recorded data the prior probabilities of these critical events can be revised using eq 9 and the revised probabilities of critical events are shown in table 9 dynamic probabilities of the top event and consequences can be obtained using probability updating by setting the revised probabilities in bn fig 12 shows a dynamic failure probability of drilling riser fracture and the dynamic occurrence probabilities of c2c8 as well as that of c1 are depicted in figs 13 and 14 respectively noting that the month 0 in figs 12 14 represent the prior probabilities of the top event and consequences from the initial to the 6th month it can be clearly seen from fig 12 that the fracture failure probability of drilling riser increases sharply from the initial 1 56e 02 to 1 83e 02 with the occurrence of critical events x21 failure of dp system during the first drilling cycle then with the occurrence of critical events x4 initial defects of riser main pipe undetected by nde x16 bolt fatigue crack and x20 failure of emergency disconnect in the next cycle the fracture failure probability is evaluated as the peak value 2 23e 02 from the 6th to the 12th month the fracture failure probability of drilling riser decreases slightly from 2 23e 02 to 1 93e 02 due to the equipment components in the critical events x4 and x16 be detected and replaced with the occurrence of critical event x15 riser wear and x21 failure of dp system the fracture failure probability continues to decrease to the lowest value 1 86e 02 the reason for the change of fracture failure probability from the 21st month to the 24th month is similar to that before hence the attention of operators should mainly focus on the wall thickness of drilling riser the reliability of bolt connectors ed and dp systems also it can be seen from fig 12 that regular inspection and maintenance have greatly reduced the probability of fracture failure of drilling riser therefore the relevant departments should strengthen the detection of the drilling riser system establish a unified inspection system and strictly enforce it figs 13 and 14 show the dynamic occurrence probabilities of c1 c2c8 respectively as depicted in fig 13 the occurrence probabilities of seven kinds of consequences have the same trend with the failure of safety barriers from the initial to 24th month and the occurrence probability of huge economic losses accident c8 is the lowest while the occurrence probability of general economic loss accident c1 is the highest among all the consequences from the perspective of the development of safety barriers control accidents the timely and effective implementation of the bop autoshear and deadman system and the human response barriers would change the accident consequences from serious to general loss resulting in the increase of occurrence probability of c1 as shown in fig 14 therefore it is necessary to strengthen the bops system maintenance and human emergency response exercises to mitigate the consequence severity of accidents 5 4 sensitivity analysis when a new methodology is developed it requires a careful validation to ensure its robustness a sensitivity analysis was carried out in this study to test the proposed model if the model is robust the obtained result would be sensitive but would not show abrupt variations to any minor change of the input parameters yang et al 2013 li et al 2019 it is assumed that the prior probabilities of critical events are subjected to a change of 10 with the assumption of the prior probability of critical event x4 being increased to 110 the probability of fracture failure of drilling riser increased from 1 56 to 1 59 when both of the prior probabilities of critical events x4 and x9 were increased to 110 the probability of fracture failure increased from 1 59 to 1 60 when the prior probabilities of critical events x4 x9 and x15 were increased to 110 the probability of fracture failure of drilling riser increased from 1 60 to 1 62 when the prior probabilities of critical events x4 x9 x15 and x20 were increased to 110 simultaneously the probability of fracture failure of drilling riser increased from 1 62 to 1 64 similarly the decrease of prior probabilities of the critical events will reduce the occurrence probability of the top event in the same way as shown in fig 15 as expected a slight change of prior probabilities for critical events induced the variation of probability of fracture failure in a reasonable way thus giving a validation of the developed model 6 summary and conclusions a novel bn model is developed for risk analysis of drilling riser fracture failure a ft model is developed to identify the hazards that may cause drilling riser fracture and an et model is developed to represent the process of accident evolution evidence theory is used to obtain the prior probability by aggregating knowledge from multi experts furthermore the developed bt model is mapped into bn to carry out risk analysis to calculate dynamic failure probabilities of drilling riser fracture and failure probabilities of consequences the present study indicates that the proposed model could be efficiently applied to fracture failure probability analysis of drilling riser the risk updating shows that x4 initial defects of riser main pipe undetected by nde x9 without periodic detection for drilling riser wall thickness x15 riser wear x16 bolt fatigue crack x20 failure of emergency disconnect and x21 failure of dp system are critical input events leading to riser fracture meanwhile the most probable accident evolution paths for fracture failure as well as the occurrence probabilities of different consequences of the fracture failure are figured out the dynamic risk profiles for the top event and consequences are derived from probability adaption which indicate change trend for risk of fracture failure and accident consequence due to the occur of critical events and the failure of safety barriers compared with other consequences the probability of the consequence c1 drilling fluid leakage well under control safely retrieval of all subsea equipments short downtime general economic losses is the highest therefore it is of great significance to take necessary prevention and control measures to mitigate the consequences of accidents additionally the fracture failure of drilling risers during drilling operations is an event with low occurrence probability and c8 drilling fluid leakage well out of control the equipment along the recoil path of the drilling riser is seriously damaged drilling riser column bops and wellhead equipment cannot be retrieved longer downtime huge economic losses is the worst consequence with the lowest occurrence probability the analysis results obtained from this study can be provided as the reference for risk decision making in drilling risers operations acknowledgement thanks are given to three anonymous domain experts for their input and insight without which this research would not have been possible besides

22826,artificial downwelling potentially counteracts severe eutrophication and hypoxia in coastal regions the entrainment that commonly occurs in the downwelling induced plume can develop around a

engineering parameters keywords coastal hypoxia artificial downwelling negatively buoyant plume te flow rate eiv 2010 msc 00 01 99 00 1 introduction decomposition of accumulated organic matter in bottom waters together with weak ventilation leads to coastal hypoxia worldwide greater than 400 coastal hypoxic zones covering an area of more than 245 000 square kilometers have been reported to pose a potential risk to marine ecosystems diaz and rosenberg 2008 while plans for nutrient load reduction play a fundamental role in environmental management for coastal hypoxia conley 2012 large scale ecological engineering is being recognized as important support for these plans and for the subsequent improvement of hypoxic conditions stigebrandt and gustafsson 2007 conley et al 2009 have discussed engineering solutions to coastal hypoxia and suggested that below pycnocline ventilation might become the most realistic alternative in the future the ecological benefits that increasing ventilation brings to hypoxic regions include recovery of the oxygen level reduction in hydrogen sulfide and ammonia levels counteraction of eutrophication and increases in benthic biomass mizumukai et al 2008 ouchi et al 2008 sasaki et al 2009 stigebrandt et al 2015a b over the past decade artificial downwelling concepts using renewable energy resources have been proposed to increase ventilation below the pycnocline ouchi et al 1998 sasaki et al 2009 carstens 2008 antonini et al 2012 2015 2016 stigebrandt et al 2015a xiao et al 2018 in these concepts surface oxygen rich water is transported downward into the hypoxic bottom through an erect pipe fig 1 the flow discharged from the pipe outlet rises immediately because fresher and warmer surface water has a lower density than the ambient water the resultant buoyant plume entrains ambient dense water during the upward motion steadily losing its buoyancy as the plume reaches beneath the pycnocline it becomes neutrally buoyant and horizontally spreads out in a process referred to as detrainment or interleaving a compensatory downward flow occurs far away from the discharge point to replenish the water entrained by the plume completing a circulation below the pycnocline stigebrandt and kalén 2013 bendtsen et al 2013 observation have proved that the circulation flow is tens of times greater than the initial pipe flow to increase destratification and ventilation stigebrandt et al 2015a it is therefore possible to mitigate coastal hypoxia on a relatively large scale via artificial downwelling as a major driver of below pycnocline circulation however the entrainment process of artificial downwelling has not been quantitatively discussed in the literature this paper focus on the total entrained te flow rate of artificial downwelling that represents the total volume flux of the entrainment the te flow rate is defined as a surface integral of normal velocity positive value denotes toward inside over the front of a downwelling induced buoyant plume that is under a horizontal plane at x fig 1 the te flow rate reaches its maximum when the entrainment transverses into the detrainment this peak value referred to as the terminal te flow rate quantifies the ventilation capacity of artificial downwelling moreover the terminal te flow rate plays a key role in the design of highly efficient artificial downwelling since it is expected as high as possible to generate sufficiently strong ventilation with relatively low energy consumption traditionally the te flow rate of artificial downwelling can be indirectly obtained by measuring compensatory downward flow during field experiments stigebrandt et al 2015a employed a wind driven pump to generate downwelling flow at the by fjord in the baltic in their experiment the volume flux of compensatory downward flow at a specific depth was estimated by multiplying the downward speed of the isohaline surface by the horizontal downwelling affected area this volume flux is equal to the te flow rate at the same depth provided the mass conservation is satisfied moreover in a tracer release experiment conducted by bendtsen et al 2013 the total detrainment namely the terminal te flow rate was obtained based on measurement of the spreading velocity of rhodamine below the pycnocline the above results from field observations have been used for parameterizations and validations of regional models but provide no additional information about the te flow rate as the operating conditions of the artificial downwelling change coupling plume models with regional models shows good performance in hydrodynamic studies of artificial downwelling on horizontal scales of 1 10 km sasaki et al 2009 bendtsen et al 2013 the physical interaction between the downwelling induced plume and the far field flow is resolved by treating the entrainment as mass source terms in each vertical grid cell of the plume region but to date these terms have been empirically specified without detailed scrutiny which may lead to inaccurate prediction of the te flow rate a proper choice to determinate the te flow rate is to study the near field plume dynamics of artificial downwelling at the pipe outlet downwelling flow is typically a negatively buoyant jet and can be numerically simulated using either reynolds averaged turbulence models huai and li 2001 oliver et al 2008 abou elhaggag et al 2011 gildeh et al 2015 or integral models jirka 2004 carazzo et al 2010 both of which show good agreement with laboratory experiments turner 1966 baines et al 1990 zhang and baddour 1998 burridge and hunt 2012 theories for negatively buoyant jets can precisely describe basic flow characteristics but the parameters appearing in the theoretical formulas still need to be experimentally determined morton et al 1956 baines et al 1990 in this paper a standard k ε turbulence model is used to numerically study negatively buoyant jets in a stagnant and homogeneous ambient medium the simulation data which agree well with present theories and experiments can be used to understand the hydrodynamics of downwelling flow in a stagnant hypoxic basin it is argued that an ambient cross flow weak though always occurs even in a stagnant hypoxic basin consider a buoyancy acceleration of 0 04 m s 2 and an ambient cross flow speed of 0 1 m s as typical conditions of a hypoxic basin the ambient froude number is 0 5 for a pipe diameter of 1 m which can be calculated from eq 10 by replacing the initial jet flow speed u 0 with the ambient cross flow speed this dimensionless number is much less than almost source densimetric froude numbers used in the study indicating that weak ambient currents affect little the plume dynamics compared with downwelling discharges an algebraic formula fitted to the simulation data predicts the te flow rate by which the terminal te flow rate can be quantitatively determined the efficiency index of ventilation eiv unit m3 j which is defined as the terminal te flow rate per unit rate of energy supply is applied to perform the optimal design of a tidal pump a typical downwelling device our study provides not only a quantitative method for determining the te flow rate that can be used to define the mass source terms in coupled regional models but also technical advice for energy management of artificial downwelling the paper is structured as follows in sections 2 and 3 the numerical model is introduced and verified by comparisons with convincing experiments from the literature in section 4 methods for calculating the te flow rate and eiv are presented in section 5 the te flow rate and the eiv of a tidal pump are discussed in section 6 the concluding remarks are summarized 2 numerical

ambient fluid lin and armfield 2000 their hydrodynamics can be analyzed using schemes based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations k ε turbulence models have successful applications in desalination industry oliver et al 2008 abou elhaggag et al 2011 gildeh et al 2015 in which brine discharges are numerically studied as negatively buoyant jets these turbulence models reproduce well the basic characteristics of negatively buoyant jets such as trajectories and maximum penetration height and are readily available in commercial cfd packages we use the standard k ε turbulence model to close the reynolds averaged governing equations of negatively buoyant jets the vertical intrusion from a round source is assumed to occur in a homogeneous and stagnant ambient medium and therefore be axisymetric unlike the case of a downwelling flow it is heavy salt water that is injected upward into fresh water in our numerical study which can be compared with the most laboratory experiments in the literature however these two cases have exactly the same solution since they are a pair of mirror cases as long as their relative density differences remain equal therefore the simulation data are also available for the prediction of a downwelling flow the origin of two dimensional cylindrical coordinates is set to the center of the pipe outlet as shown in fig 2 a the reynolds averaged governing equations for mass momentum transported species and the standard k ε turbulence model launder and spalding 1983 can be written as follows continuity equation 1 1 r u r x v r r 0 momentum

directions respectively u and v are the velocity components in the corresponding directions respectively ρ is the fluid density ρ a is the fluid density of the ambient medium and g is the acceleration due to gravity μ e is the effective turbulent viscosity and can be expressed as c μ ρ k 2 ε in the high reynolds number limit the molecular viscosity is much less than the turbulent viscosity where c μ is a constant 0 09 and k and ε represent the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate of the turbulent energy respectively species transport equation 4 ρ θ i t 1 r ρ u θ i r x ρ v θ i r r 1 r x μ e s c r θ i x r μ e s c r θ i r i 1 2 n where θ i represents transported species such as salinity s and temperature t and s c is the turbulent schmidt number for each species it has been proved that s c is usually within the range from 0 6 to 1 gildeh et al 2015 and equals 0 6 for a pure plume craske et al 2017 we adopt s c 0 6 in the case study because the downwelling flow evolves quickly into a buoyant plume after discharge oliver et al 2008 standard k ε turbulence model 5 ρ k t 1 r ρ u k r x ρ v k r r 1 r x μ e σ k r k x r μ e σ k r k r g k g b ρ ε 6 ρ ε t 1 r ρ u ε r x ρ v ε r r 1 r x μ e

seawater 2 2 model setup a 2d computational domain was adopted for the numerical study all the simulations were conducted at the laboratory scale for comparisons with convincing experiments the computational domain is 100 cm in the x direction and 50 cm in the r direction fig 2 a heavy salt water is injected upward into the fresh water through nozzles with three radii of r 0 0 55 cm 0 975 cm fig 2 b and 1 950 cm all of which project a distance of 20 cm above the bottom wall the relatively large distance between the discharge point and the top wall allows full development of dense jets without the influence of boundary effects the boundary conditions for solving the numerical model are as follows gildeh et al 2015 pipe outlet u v s t k ε u 0 0 s 0 t 0 0 06 u 0 2 0 03 u 0 3 r 0 bottom wall x v s t k ε 0 u 0 central axis r u s t k ε 0 v 0 top wall x s t 0 u v k ε 0 pipe wall r s t 0 u v k ε 0 farfield r u v s t k ε 0 where u 0 is the uniform distribution of the mean flow speed of the dense jet which approximates the turbulent velocity profile across the pipe outlet and s 0 and t 0 are the initial salinity and temperature of the dense jet respectively in the case study the water temperature is uniformly set to 20 c in the whole computational domain thus salinity is the single transported species there are series of u 0 and s 0 involved in the case study whereas the stagnant and homogeneous ambient medium is specified by initializing both the velocity magnitude and salinity to zero in the fluid domain the operating conditions are listed in table 1 the source densimetric froude numbers are designed to vary from 1 35 to 14 47 covering almost the full effective range of artificial downwelling in real applications all the reynolds numbers are not less than 2000 since in this situation negatively buoyant jets are fully turbulent williamson et al 2008 similar to the downwelling flow in real applications the computational meshes are block structured consisting of quadrilateral grid cells fig 2 b presents the mesh using a pipe radius of 0 975 cm the minimum grid with δ r 0 2 r 0 can be seen neighboring the pipe outlet where the initial jet produces large radial gradients in both axial velocity and species concentration at places where large gradients exist the grid resolution should be sufficiently fine to approach the physically real solution yet the computational cost will increase simultaneously as the grid size diminishes a proper choice of δ r can be made based on grid independence checks four meshes with different degrees of refinement were thus generated and their solutions were compared for δ r and the total numbers of grid cells please refer to table 2 for the operating conditions of case 4 1 the density distributions along the central axis and profiles of axial velocity at x 2 cm are plotted in fig 3 a and b indicating that an economical mesh size is δ r 0 2 r 0 since no evident variation of the solution results from using higher grid resolution the time step is supposed to be less than δ r u 0 in compliance with the cfl condition in the overall domain the minimum δ r is 1 1 mm and the maximum velocity u 0 is 0 34 m s which requires a proper value of the time step to be less than 0 0032 s the time step is chosen to be 0 003 s at the start of the iterations then it follows an adaptive strategy with minimum and maximum step change factors of 0 5 and 2 respectively at each time step the iterations will not stop until the absolute residuals of all variables are lower than 10 5 but there is a limit of 50 iterations at most 3 model validation 3 1 dimensionless variables before the numerical results are compared with experiments we shall first describe physical ideas about negatively buoyant jets this leads to the proper choice of parameters used for the comparisons consider heavy salt water vertically discharged upward into a stagnant ambient medium the dense jet will steadily loses its momentum because of the opposing buoyancy the injected water reaches a maximum height as the momentum of the dense jet goes to zero and then falls back around the upflow replacing the lighter water that could mix with the upflow the density of the upflow is thus increased and its top descends from the initial maximum height to a lower position that fluctuates slightly around a mean steady height baines et al 1990 a similar phenomenon can be found in the case of artificial downwelling in which less dense fluid vertically discharges downward into a dense ambient medium the initial maximum height x m the mean steady height x s and the ratio between them x m x s describe the upward motion of dense jets on which many studies focus on their quantitative analysis baines et al 1990 gives the scaling for the mean steady height 9 x s r 0 c 0 f r 0 where the c 0 is constant at 2 46 baines et al 1990 turner 1966 and f r 0 is the source densimetric froude number as follows 10 f r 0 u 0 g ρ a ρ 0 ρ 0 r 0 where u 0 is the uniform distribution of the mean flow speed of the dense jet g is the gravity acceleration ρ a and ρ 0 are the ambient and the initial fluid density respectively eq 9 is suitable for the most cases but leads to overestimation of the mean steady height when f r 0 is relative low based on a theoretical analysis and laboratory experiments kaye and hunt 2006 extended the pioneer work to low and intermediate froude number suggesting that 11 x s r 0 0 94 f r 0 2 3 0 5 f r 0 1 03 very weak 0 90 f r 0 2 1 03 f r 0 2 73 weak 2 46 f r 0 2 73 f r 0 15 forced these changes in the dependence of the mean steady height on the source densimetric froude number provide the criteria by which negatively buoyant jets are classified into three regimes very weak weak and forced the classification is also confirmed by the experiments in burridge and hunt 2012 although the transition between weak and forced fountains might be disputable e g f r 0 7 rather than 2 73 is considered as the critical point according to zhang and baddour 1998 the scaled x s can still be expressed as a piecewise function of f r 0 the initial penetration height can be obtained based on the results of the mean steady height corrected with the ratio x m x s according to burridge and hunt 2012 this ratio widely scatters between 0 4 and 1 5 for weak and very weak fountains f r 0 2 73 and tends to a constant 1 43 for forced fountains f r 0 2 73 another parameter that has attracted increasing interest from researchers is the te flow rate of turbulent fountains which determines the terminal volume flux of a fountain and the rate of dilution burridge and hunt 2016 performed experimental measurements of the te flow rate where a turbulent fountain was discharged their findings encompass f r 0 for all classes of negatively buoyant jets identified to date the te flow rate at the discharge point q e 0 scaled by the source flow rate q 0 is presented based on fitting a curve to their experimental data as follows 12 q e 0 q 0 0 37 f r 0 2 3 0 5 f r 0 0 98 0 38 f r 0 2 0 98 f r 0 1 86 0 71 f r 0 1 86 f r 0 15 limited by the measurement technique however there is a lack of experimental data regarding the te flow rate at any positions other that at the discharging source 3 2 comparisons with laboratory experiments the numerical model is validated by comparisons of x s r 0 x m x s and q e 0 q 0 with laboratory data from the literature simulations were performed under different density differences initial pipe flow speeds and pipe radius in the postprocessing procedure the penetration height of the jet is determined such that the salinity at the central axis becomes 3 of its initial value and its time series of the scaled value are presented in fig 4 for three source densimetric froude numbers the dimensionless time is adopted as τ t g u 0 where g is the buoyancy acceleration expressed as ρ 0 ρ a ρ 0 g for all the curves the scaled penetration heights are positively related to the froude numbers initial pulses come first with steady stages left behind x m r 0 is the peak value of the initial pulse while x s r 0 is calculated as a time averaged value for the steady stage the slight increases in the dimensionless penetration height during the steady periods can be explained by the stagnant diffusion of the salt in water this process is extremely slow and thus can be neglected fig 5 a shows a comparison of the scaled mean steady height for froude numbers between 1 35 and 14 47 the simulation data within this range basically agree with the scalings described in the literature for f r 0 2 73 the simulated cases are not sufficient to determine the dependence of scaled mean steady height on f r 0 but their deviations from experiments or theoretical prediction are estimated to be no more than 20 for f r 0 2 73 the simulations indicate a linear dependence of the scaled mean steady height on f r 0 with a constant slope of 2 02 on average this result is closer to the theoretical prediction of hunt and debugne 2016 2 16 than the experiments from burridge and hunt 2012 2 46 negative deviations could be partly explained by the fact that the rans scheme underestimates the reaching of turbulent eddies by averaging them the ratio x m x s versus f r 0 is scattered in fig 5 b the figure shows no evident difference between the numerical results and experiments for f r 0 2 73 across which the ratio decreases by some 13 from 1 4 to 1 2 as the source densimetric froude number continues to increase both the ratio predicted by simulations and that obtained from experiments steadily increase to reach a constant the constant given by the simulation is 1 53 and very close to the theoretical prediction of 1 52 while that given by experiments is 1 43 during the experimental measurements there were abnormally high values of the ratio across the range of froude number between 2 73 and 10 because the forced fountain induces an initial vortex that integrates with the top front of the fountain leading to visual overestimation of the initial penetration height the validity of our model is further confirmed by the results regarding the scaled te flow rate at the discharging point q e 0 according to the definition the simulated te flow rate can be obtained by computing the integral of the entrainment on the sharp interface between the buoyant plume and its outside consider a control volume enclosed by the interface and a horizontal cross section of the plume fig 6 the volume flux across inside the interface should equal the volume flux across outside the cross section of the plume minus mass source terms if any such that continuity is maintained for the incompressible fluid consequently the te flow rate can be calculated by subtracting the mass source from the integral of the axial velocity on the cross section of the plume which is more achievable than performing a direct integral on the interface in the present study the interface is determined by the isosurface of 3 of the initial salinity then the te flow rate can be expressed as follows 13 q e x 0 r 0 03 x 2 π r u r x d r q x where r 0 03 x is the radius of the interface at the depth level x and s x represents the mass source defined as below 14 q x 0 x 0 q 0 x 0 accordingly q e 0 x 0 is the integral result minus the initial pipe flow rate the model results for q e 0 or q e 0 scaled by q 0 are shown in fig 7 they remain in good agreement with experiments for the studied range of densimeric froude number similar to the scaled mean steady height there is a linear dependence stage for a relatively high densimeric froude number the constant slope fitted to the simulation data is 0 61 with a negative deviation of 14 1 from that given by burridge and hunt 2016 such a difference should be acceptable when the numerical model is used to predict the te flow rate in artificial downwelling engineering 4 calculation methods 4 1 te flow rate an analytical expression of the te flow rate developed from simulation data provides basis for the latter discussion on the terminal te flow rate which represents the capacity of ventilation moreover the formulation of the te flow rate is applied in the definition of eiv to optimize engineering parameters for artificial downwelling all the calculation methods is based on the main assumption that the downwelling induced plume reaches steady state in a stagnant medium the evolution of a downwelling flow is shown as fig 8 in which the negatively buoyant plume first reaches its maximum penetration and then moves back to the steady point the plume in the steady state is divided into two regions according to the type of leading forces exerting on the plume in the interaction region fig 8 d the initial jet interacts with the reverse main flow where the entrainment dynamics is governed by momentum flux and buoyancy flux the dimensionless te flow rate in this region has been specified as a linear function of the distance from the mean steady penetration height baines et al 1990 15 q e x q 0 a 0 x s x r 0 q e 0 q 0 a 0 x r 0 x 0 baines et al 1993 considers a 0 almost constant for a strong source but related to f r 0 for a weak source however the constant is still uncertain because of a lack of experimental data this assumption is confirmed by the simulation results fig 9 a presents the linear fitting process for dimensionless te flow rate using different values of a 0 the fitted a 0 almost scatters between 0 29 and 0 33 with no tendency to increase or decrease except for a few greater values within the range of weak fountains e g a 0 0 3581 for f r 0 3 85 considering that the studied range of f r mainly characterizes forced fountains the coefficient a 0 can be assumed to be constant which is determined by minimizing the norm of an error vector that comprises all the residuals of fitted te flow rates from simulation results it can be seen in fig 9 b that the lowest point appears when a 0 0 321 using this value leads to a good prediction of the te flow rate with deviations of no more than 17 9 from the simulation results the above linear dependence is maintained until the reverse main flow starts climbing along the downwelling pipe without any momentum source involved a pure buoyant plume is then evolved in the plume region fig 8 d the initial buoyancy flux f 0 and the distance from the source x govern the entrainment rate ε unit m s as the following form bendtsen et al 2013 16 ε ε 0 f 0 1 3 x 1 3 x 0 where f 0 can be further expressed as ρ 0 ρ a ρ a g π u 0 r 0 2 and ε 0 is the entrainment coefficient and parameterized as 0 25 according to the observational data bendtsen et al 2013 moreover ε can be expressed as the derivative form of 1 2 π r 0 03 d q e d x with the boundary condition q e q e 0 at x 0 then te flow rate in the second stage can be written as follows 17 q e x q e 0 0 x ε 0 f 0 1 3 x 1 3 2 π r 0 03 d x where r 0 03 is the radius of isosurface of 3 salinity mentioned above which is weakly dependent on the variable x according to the simulation results eq 17 can be updated to the following form if r 0 03 r 0 is assumed to be only related to the f r 0 and ε 0 a constant 18 q e x q 0 q e 0 q 0 3 π 1 3 r 0 03 ε 0 r 0 f r 0 2 3 x r 0 2 3 however eq 18 is temporarily unavailable because of the uncertain algebraic relation between r 0 03 r 0 and f r 0 moreover there is no strong reason for a constant entrainment coefficient ε 0 a more general expression for the dimensionless te flow rate is 19 q e x q 0 q e 0 q 0 b 0 x r 0 a 1 where the coefficients a 1 and b 0 are the values producing the best fit between the equation and model results as we did for the coefficient a 1 fig 10 a presents the curve fitting process for the dimensionless te flow rate using different values of a 1 and b 0 the best fitting a 1 and b 0 across the studied range of f r 0 are scattered as shown in fig 10 b for a single pipe radius a 1 stays steady around a constant as f r 0 changes suggesting independence of a 1 from f r 0 on the other hand the pipe radius affects the best fitting a 1 increasing the pipe radius fourfold results in a decrease of a 1 from approximately 0 75 to 0 6 which may be explained by geometric effects that are not considered here for simplification within the range of 1 35 f r 0 14 6 an average value of 0 683 for a 1 can be adopted which is very close to the power exponent 2 3 in eq 18 notably the influence of f r 0 can be observed in the data for the best fitting b 0 the functional relation between b 0 and f r 0 conforms to 2 5816 f r 0 0 676 this formula exactly matches the relation b 0 f r 0 2 3 given by eq 18 indicating that r 0 03 r 0 is unrelated to f r 0 to summarize the te flow rate along the pipe direction can be written as the following piecewise function verified within the interval of f r 0 from 1 36 to 14 6 20 q e x q 0 q e 0 q 0 0 321 x r 0 x r 0 0 q e 0 q 0 2 582 f r 0 0 676 x r 0 0 683 h r 0 x r 0 0 where q e 0 q 0 a 0 x s r 0 i e 0 65 f r 0 for x s r 0 2 03 f r 0 from the simulation data h is the distance between the discharging source and the final position that negatively buoyant plume could reach along the pipe direction 4 2 eiv for artificial downwelling the most severe challenge for practical applications of artificial downwelling is due to limited energy resources in the open sea or high prices of using land based electricity to maintain the downward flow the power supply must be sufficient to work against the buoyancy due to stratification however this may result in too high a cost for large scale engineering not to mention fabrication deployment and maintenance stigebrandt and gustafsson 2007 energy management should be a pressing need for the development of economically viable artificial downwelling it is expected that a proper design of downwelling devices should ensure ventilation as strong as possible while keeping the energy consumption relatively low in the case of artificial downwelling the te flow rate at the depth of the pycnocline q e p acts as a key index reflecting the effect of ventilation the ratio between q e p and the rate of energy supply see eq 21 can quantify the capacity of ventilation per unit energy supply and is referred to as the efficiency index of ventilation eiv unit m 3 j in this paper optimizing the energy utilization of artificial downwelling is equivalent to maximizing the eiv although calculation of q e including q e h has been discussed in section 4 1 the initial flow speed u 0 is regarded as a predetermined value for more practical usage we need to consider how u 0 is determined by a given specific rate of energy supply 21 efficiency index of ventilation eiv q e p rate of energy supply a tidal pump which consists of a vertical pipe with its upper end rigidly connected to a 90 o bend is chosen as the application object in the paper the pump can bring oxygen rich and light surface water down toward a denser ambient medium where hypoxia is liable to occur for this type of downwelling device the rate of energy supply is specified via the following form 22 rate of energy supply 1 2 ρ 0 u h 3 s a r e a where u h represents the horizontal current speed at the pump entrance and s the area of pump entrance given by π d 2 4 if u h is known the downwelling flow speed i e the initial flow speed u 0 can be calculated based on the principle of energy equilibrium fan et al 2013 according to xiao et al 2018 we have 23 1 2 ρ 0 u h 2 δ p ρ δ p l where δ p ρ represents the pressure difference produced by the stratification if a downwelling flow exists the density values at the pipe inlet and all along the downwelling pipe are equal and are generally different from the density of the surrounding water δ p ρ can be calculated from the integral of the density difference along the pipe length hsieh et al 1978 24 δ p ρ x i n x o u t ρ x ρ 0 g d x where x i n and x o u t are the depths of the pipe inlet and outlet respectively and ρ x is the surrounding density profile in real environments where artificial downwelling is carried out stratification is usually sufficiently intense to cause an approximate two layer water body therefore downwelling flow can be assumed to be discharged into a homogeneous dense ambient medium where ρ x is as follows 25 ρ x ρ a x above the pycnocline ρ 0 x below the pycnocline eventually δ p ρ ρ a ρ 0 h g where h is the distance between the lower end of the pump and the pycnocline the second term on the righthand side of eq 23 δ p l represents the total pressure loss in the downwelling pipe which can be written in a general form of the kinetic energy of the pipe flow times a total loss coefficient ξ t 26 δ p l ξ t 1 2 ρ

flow rate in section 4 1 formulation of the te flow rate was conducted based on fitting a curve to all of the simulation results leading to achievement of eq 20 however there are deviations of the predictions based on eq 20 from real solutions for the parameterization of the empirical coefficients that we defined to confirm the validity of the proposed formula fig 11 presents both the calculation results of eq 20 and numerical data for representative values of f r 0 i e 1 36 3 85 and 7 69 where the horizontal ordinate is chosen as distance from the maximum penetration height of the initial jet scaled by the pipe radius the te flow rate scaled by the initial pipe flow rate increases as the negatively buoyant plume becomes farther away from the maximum penetration height the results reproduce the different characteristics in two regions prescribed in section 4 1 fig 8 d for a steady state negatively buoyant plume in the interaction region the scaled te flow rate governed by both buoyancy flux and momentum flux is linearly dependent on the distance which means the entrainment rate as the derivative of the te flow rate is a constant in the plume region the entrainment rate mainly determined by the buoyancy flux starts with a sudden increase due to no constraint from detrainment of the initial jet but then decreases as the buoyancy flux is continually reduced by passive turbulent diffusion the scaled te flow rate thus have a weaker tendency to increase as the plume moves farer away the discharging point beside reproducing different stages of ambient entrainment the curve lines of the fitted function and numerical results exhibit good agreement deviations of the curve lines are in general no more than 5 of the corresponding simulation data for the smallest source densimetric froude number adopted in the study f r 0 1 36 a relatively large deviation appears in the latter half of the curve line because the power exponent a 1 eventually taken as an average of 0 683 is greater than the best fitting a 1 under f r 0 1 36 however the resulting error of approximately 10 does not affect the generality of the fitted function in practical use the terminal te flow rate is defined as the te flow rate at the transition point of the entrainment into the detrainment which quantifies the final bulk dilution of many discharge practices such as brine discharge heated effluent and artificial downwelling as a consequence this parameter is of primary interest in the following discussion we can calculate the terminal te flow rate from eq 20 by inserting x h into it 33 q e p q 0 0 65 f r 0 2 582 f r 0 0 676 h r 0 0 683 as an indicator of relative importance of the initial momentum force to the buoyancy the source densimetric froude number f r 0 is the only parameter affecting the scaled te flow rate if the h r 0 is fixed it can be seen in eq 33 that the first term on the right side of eq 33 is positively related to f r 0 this dependence can be explained by that the first term is contributed by the entrainment in the interaction region in which the momentum force favors the entrainment whereas the buoyancy against the momentum force constrains the entrainment the entrainment dynamics becomes quite different in the plume region the buoyancy is the main reason for the entrainment since the plume is fully developed in this region therefore an increase in the initial buoyancy which means an decrease in f r 0 decreases the second term quantifying the total entrainment in the plume region the dependence of the second term on f r 0 indicates that the initial momentum force plays a role as well an explaination should be the initial momentum force related to starting buoyancy in the plume region a stronger momentum force entrains more ambient water in the interaction region resulting in a weaker starting buoyancy and thus the less total entrainment in the plume region 5 2 terminal te flow rate initial jet velocity and relative density difference for a more practical purpose the scaled te flow rate is further analyzed in terms of the initial jet velocity and relative density difference two of which quantify the initial momentum force and the buoyancy respectively we first choose initial jet velocity as a single factor to reveal its relationship with the final enlargement of the initial jet flow rate see fig 12 a the calculation of the ratio q e p q 0 is confined to 1 36 f r 0 14 47 which is an effective range for the present study in either case of relative density difference equal to 0 004 or 0 008 the ratio decreases from near 15 to its lowest point at 9 when u 0 increases from the initial value to three times that value such a tendency can be seen in the second term on the right side of eq 33 which means ambient entrainment in the plume region primarily contributes to the terminal te flow rate the reason is that the starting buoyancy in the plume region is weakened by the increase of initial momentum force resulting in a decrease in scaled terminal te flow rate if u 0 continues to increase entrainment in the interaction region becomes dominant to control the scaled terminal te flow rate the higher u 0 is the greater the initial momentum force is which helps strengthen the entrainment of the initial jet and hence increases the scaled terminal te flow rate this rise is no more than 10 similar variation should exist in the other two curves for larger relative density differences although not within the effective range the relative density difference affects the terminal scaled te flow rate in a different way with the initial jet velocity for a range of low relative density differences the entrainment in the interaction region is the major contributor to the terminal scaled te flow rate therefore the buoyancy keep the initial jet from entraining ambient water which is confirmed in fig 12 b that an increase in a low relative density difference causes a sharp decline in the scaled terminal te flow rate for a range of high relative density differences the major entrainment moves from the interaction region into the plume region increasing the relative density difference now favors the entrainment in the plume region to reach a higher scaled terminal te flow rate fig 12 b shows that the bottom values of the scaled terminal te flow rate are at the middle interval of the relative density difference the minimum point shifts to the right as the initial jet velocity increases from 0 4 to 1 0 m s indicating a strengthening outreach of the initial jet in terms of the entrainment it is suggested that sufficiently uniform mixture with the ambient can facilitate the de stratification process and increase below pycnocline ventilation in the places where artificial downwelling has been carried out including many closed bays seas and estuarine regions the water depth is almost less than 100 m but there is intense stratification due to a considerable salinity discrepancy provided the relative density difference for artificial downwelling ranges from 0 to 0 012 and the downward flow speed is from 0 2 to 1 2 m s the total entrained volume flux of ambient water can reach 9 15 times the initial volume flux of the downward flow when the negatively buoyant plume reaches below the pycnocline 5 3 terminal te flow rate geometric parameters d and h the geometric effect on the scaled terminal te flow rate is discussed in terms of the pipe diameter d and the distance between the pycnocline and the discharging point h eq 33 is used again to plot the scaled terminal te flow rate as a function of these two geometric dimensions fig 13 a presents the variation of the scaled terminal te flow rate with the pipe diameter as the pipe diameter increases from approximately 0 2 to 1 2 m the scaled terminal te flow rate for four different values of h simultaneously decrease by a half according to eq 33 the pipe diameter 2 r 0 exert influence on the scaled terminal te flow rate via the source densimetric froude number f r 0 and the ratio h r 0 for a range of small diameter it is reasonable to mainly consider the first term on the right side of eq 33 since the source densimetric froude number is large in this case the pipe diameter affects the scaled terminal flow rate in the way similar to the relative density difference for a range of large diameter the second term on the right side of eq 33 becomes more important however instead of rising like in the case of the relative density difference the scaled terminal flow rate continues to decrease as the pipe diameter increases such a decreasing tendency for a range of large diameter can be explained by that the water mass discharged from a pipe with a larger diameter has a lower specific surface area surface area to volume ratio suggesting a lower proportion of plume water being involved the entrainment for a prescribed diameter variation of the position where initial jet flow is discharged also changes scaled terminal te flow rate fig 13 b illustrates how scaled terminal te flow rate is related to the position of discharging point for a pipe diameter of 0 4 m the ratio increases from 9 8 to 18 2 within the range of h from 2 to 18 m such a growth tendency is due to continuous entrainment as long as the buoyant plume moves along the pipe what deserves more attention is the derivative of the curve line which decreases as h increases the derivative of the scaled terminal te flow rate to h represents the entrainment velocity at x h the gradual decline in the entrainment velocity is mainly due to the persistent loss of the buoyancy flux resulting from dilution of the plume 5 4 eiv of the tidal pump horizontal current speed and relative density difference in the present and next sections the eiv see section 4 1 of the tidal pump is discussed with the goal of evaluating the energy utilization of the pump thus providing a basis for the optimal design of engineering parameters according to the definition the eiv equals the ratio of the terminal te flow rate to the rate of energy supply the magnitude of the horizontal current speed u h not only determines how the rate of energy supply but also has a direct link to the downward flow speed thus affecting terminal te flow rate the eiv is plotted versus u h for various relative density differences in fig 14 a where the curve lines begin indicates f r 0 1 35 neighboring the critical point of driving downwelling flow minimum current speed required to drive the flow artificial downwelling requires a relatively fast tidal current under large density differences additionally the figure suggests that the eiv basically decreases with increased u h the decrease can be attributable to a slower growth speed of the terminal te flow rate with u h than that of rate of energy supply which is a cubic function of u h it should be noted that weak increment appears at the front ends of the curves to understand this behavior a functional relationship between downward flow speed u 0 and u h is recommended here where u 0 is sensitive to u h at the critical point with considerable increase for little excess of the critical current speed xiao et al 2018 since the terminal te flow is a monotonously increasing function of u 0 it should quickly rise as well so as to offset the decline in eiv due to the increase of u h as the stratification becomes stronger this counteraction extends to a wider range of u h which explains the eiv of the pump being like a constant under strong stratification consider the horizontal current speed as an invariable value then the relative density difference affects eiv of the pump due to variation in the terminal te flow rate the terminal te flow rate can be written as the ratio of the terminal te flow rate to the downwelling flow rate times the downwelling flow rate the former has been discussed in section 5 2 for relative density difference increasing from 0 to 0 008 the ratio declines first and then increases on the other the downwelling flow rate is dependent on relative density difference and will decrease to zero as long as the stratification is sufficiently strong xiao et al 2018 the calculation indicates that the terminal te flow rate continuously decreases as the relatively large density difference becomes larger furthermore the eiv versus relative density difference is presented in fig 14 b the eiv is a monotonously decreasing function of the relative density difference with a gently decreasing tendency as a whole under high current speed the curve trend for the eiv is similar to that of the downwelling flow rate in the case of u h 1 2 m s the downwelling flow rate was found from the calculation to be steady over the range of 0 002 ρ a ρ 0 ρ 0 0 007 while the steady range for u h 0 6 m s is much narrower provided the pump works for days and weeks such a time scale is a little larger than that of tidal currents but much shorter than that of the stratification with a seasonal variation it is therefore reasonable to consider the stratification as stable the main factor resulting in fluctuation of the eiv is therefore tidal currents in the area of strong stratification the eiv of the pump almost remains constant to improve this value requires discussion of the effects of the pump geometry 5 5 eiv of the tidal pump geometric parameters d h and r d the dimensions of the pump include pipe diameter d the distance from the pump outlet to the pycnocline h and the bend ratio r d pipes with too large or too small a diameter are not available for deployment under intense flow condition in this section pipe diameters of 0 2 1 2 m were investigated for four values of the bend ratio fig 15 a increasing d always decrases the eiv of the pump this can be understood by considering the eiv as the product of the scaled terminal te flow rate q e h q 0 the ratio of downwelling flow rate to incident flow rate on the section area of the pump q 0 q h u 0 u h and the inverse of dynamic pressure of incident flow 1 1 2 ρ 0 u h 2 in the light of the total loss coefficient for artificial downwelling the pipe diameter affects the frictional loss coefficient by the term l d and has a weak impact on the bend loss coefficient due to the reynolds number as the pipe diameter increases the total loss coefficient decreases resulting in a higher downwelling flow speed u 0 where the ratio u 0 u h becomes greater but the scaled terminal te flow rate q e h q 0 almost decreases in addition fig 13 a has shown that q e h q 0 is negatively related to the pipe diameter which together with the former yields the final dependence shown in fig 15 a a tidal pump with 1 2 m in diameter maintains the eiv at approximately 0 007 m3 j which is 27 less than that with a pipe diameter of 0 2 m in contrast to the pipe diameter variation in the bend ratio seems to have little influence on the eiv fig 15 b presents the variation of the eiv for a wide range of bend ratio from 0 5 to 4 the increments are confined to the range of relatively small bend ratio with no more than 8 the main reason is the sharp decline in bending losses as the bend ratio increases from 0 5 to 2 therefore the resultant downwelling flow speed increases sharply thus increasing the eiv behind the point r d 2 eiv is close to a constant the recommended value for r d is between 1 5 and 2 5 as presented in previous studies regarding the pipe diameter it is better to use a relatively small value with safety limits the third parameter h make a difference in the deployment of the tidal pump but its optimal design has not yet been reported increasing h tends to produce a large scaled terminal te flow rate fig 13 b but the pressure difference due to stratification simultaneously increases to weaken the downward flow discharge the above opposite terms make it possible to study the goldilocks effect to obtain the optimal position at which the eiv is the highest fig 15 c presents the eiv versus h for two pipe diameters and bend ratios the peak value appears when h is between 9 and 11 m with weak dependences on the pipe diameter and bend ratio for d 0 5 m and r d 2 using the optimal h leads to an improvement in the eiv from 0 0070 to 0 0086 m3 j 6 concluding remarks the standard k ε turbulence model is employed to simulate negatively buoyant jets in a stagnant and homogeneous ambient medium our numerical results agree well with traditional theories and experiments and therefore can be used to formulate the te flow rate of a negatively buoyant flow an algebraic formula fitted to the simulation data predicts the te flow rate which permits quantitative analysis of the terminal te flow rate of artificial downwelling and efficiency index of ventilation for a tidal pump our concluding remarks are summarized below the scaled te flow rate along the pipe direction can be calculated from the proposed piecewise function eq 20 which is not only important for calculating the terminal te flow rate and eiv for artificial downwelling but also gives a proper definition of mass source terms representing entrainment in far field plume models the terminal te flow rate represents the te flow rate at the transition point from entrainment to detrainment i e x h the ratio of the terminal te flow rate to the initial jet flow rate decreases first as either the initial jet velocity or the relative density difference become larger but then increase increasing the pipe diameter continuously reduces the ratio in contrast increasing h helps augment the ratio the eiv is defined as the terminal te flow rate per unit rate of energy supply that can be produced this index reflects the efficiency of ventilation in artificial downwelling engineering the calculations in this work indicate that the eiv of the tidal pump is negatively related to both the horizontal current speed except for near the critical current speed and the relative density difference the effect of the pump geometry is also analyzed to provide technical advice regarding energy management of artificial downwelling it is shown that a large pipe diameter tends to yield a low eiv while the bend ratio weakly affects the eiv for a typical environmental condition i e a horizontal current speed of 1 2 m s and relative density difference of 0 004 we suggest a bend ratio of 1 5 2 5 and relatively small pipe diameter h plays an important role in the design of deployment of the tidal pump a proper length of the tidal pump below the pycnocline should be maintained from 9 to 11 m to gain the highest eiv in this paper the discussion of the dynamics of negatively buoyant plume is confined to a stagnant ambient medium in nature however a horizontal current always occurs at the pipe outlet and the trajectory of the plume is sensitive to this situation future studies should compare the entrainment of a negatively buoyant jet in stagnant ambient with that subject to a horizontal flow acknowledgements this research is financially funded by the national key research and development

22826,artificial downwelling potentially counteracts severe eutrophication and hypoxia in coastal regions the entrainment that commonly occurs in the downwelling induced plume can develop around a compensatory downward flow at a scale of kilometers which favors below pycnocline ventilation and thus mitigates hypoxia in bottom water however little discussion has been made on the entrainment of artificial downwelling the paper focus on the total entrained te flow rate that represents the magnitude of entrainment transport injection of a negatively buoyant jet from a round pipe into a stagnant and homogeneous ambient medium is numerically studied using a verified standard k ε turbulence model in which different initial pipe flow speeds density differences and pipe radii are involved previous theories and experiments confirm the numerical model an empirical formula is fitted to the simulation data to calculate the te flow rate which permit quantitative analysis of the capacity of ventilation for artificial downwelling the efficiency index of ventilation eiv is also defined and applied to study a typical downwelling device i e a tidal pump to suggest optimal engineering parameters keywords coastal hypoxia artificial downwelling negatively buoyant plume te flow rate eiv 2010 msc 00 01 99 00 1 introduction decomposition of accumulated organic matter in bottom waters together with weak ventilation leads to coastal hypoxia worldwide greater than 400 coastal hypoxic zones covering an area of more than 245 000 square kilometers have been reported to pose a potential risk to marine ecosystems diaz and rosenberg 2008 while plans for nutrient load reduction play a fundamental role in environmental management for coastal hypoxia conley 2012 large scale ecological engineering is being recognized as important support for these plans and for the subsequent improvement of hypoxic conditions stigebrandt and gustafsson 2007 conley et al 2009 have discussed engineering solutions to coastal hypoxia and suggested that below pycnocline ventilation might become the most realistic alternative in the future the ecological benefits that increasing ventilation brings to hypoxic regions include recovery of the oxygen level reduction in hydrogen sulfide and ammonia levels counteraction of eutrophication and increases in benthic biomass mizumukai et al 2008 ouchi et al 2008 sasaki et al 2009 stigebrandt et al 2015a b over the past decade artificial downwelling concepts using renewable energy resources have been proposed to increase ventilation below the pycnocline ouchi et al 1998 sasaki et al 2009 carstens 2008 antonini et al 2012 2015 2016 stigebrandt et al 2015a xiao et al 2018 in these concepts surface oxygen rich water is transported downward into the hypoxic bottom through an erect pipe fig 1 the flow discharged from the pipe outlet rises immediately because fresher and warmer surface water has a lower density than the ambient water the resultant buoyant plume entrains ambient dense water during the upward motion steadily losing its buoyancy as the plume reaches beneath the pycnocline it becomes neutrally buoyant and horizontally spreads out in a process referred to as detrainment or interleaving a compensatory downward flow occurs far away from the discharge point to replenish the water entrained by the plume completing a circulation below the pycnocline stigebrandt and kalén 2013 bendtsen et al 2013 observation have proved that the circulation flow is tens of times greater than the initial pipe flow to increase destratification and ventilation stigebrandt et al 2015a it is therefore possible to mitigate coastal hypoxia on a relatively large scale via artificial downwelling as a major driver of below pycnocline circulation however the entrainment process of artificial downwelling has not been quantitatively discussed in the literature this paper focus on the total entrained te flow rate of artificial downwelling that represents the total volume flux of the entrainment the te flow rate is defined as a surface integral of normal velocity positive value denotes toward inside over the front of a downwelling induced buoyant plume that is under a horizontal plane at x fig 1 the te flow rate reaches its maximum when the entrainment transverses into the detrainment this peak value referred to as the terminal te flow rate quantifies the ventilation capacity of artificial downwelling moreover the terminal te flow rate plays a key role in the design of highly efficient artificial downwelling since it is expected as high as possible to generate sufficiently strong ventilation with relatively low energy consumption traditionally the te flow rate of artificial downwelling can be indirectly obtained by measuring compensatory downward flow during field experiments stigebrandt et al 2015a employed a wind driven pump to generate downwelling flow at the by fjord in the baltic in their experiment the volume flux of compensatory downward flow at a specific depth was estimated by multiplying the downward speed of the isohaline surface by the horizontal downwelling affected area this volume flux is equal to the te flow rate at the same depth provided the mass conservation is satisfied moreover in a tracer release experiment conducted by bendtsen et al 2013 the total detrainment namely the terminal te flow rate was obtained based on measurement of the spreading velocity of rhodamine below the pycnocline the above results from field observations have been used for parameterizations and validations of regional models but provide no additional information about the te flow rate as the operating conditions of the artificial downwelling change coupling plume models with regional models shows good performance in hydrodynamic studies of artificial downwelling on horizontal scales of 1 10 km sasaki et al 2009 bendtsen et al 2013 the physical interaction between the downwelling induced plume and the far field flow is resolved by treating the entrainment as mass source terms in each vertical grid cell of the plume region but to date these terms have been empirically specified without detailed scrutiny which may lead to inaccurate prediction of the te flow rate a proper choice to determinate the te flow rate is to study the near field plume dynamics of artificial downwelling at the pipe outlet downwelling flow is typically a negatively buoyant jet and can be numerically simulated using either reynolds averaged turbulence models huai and li 2001 oliver et al 2008 abou elhaggag et al 2011 gildeh et al 2015 or integral models jirka 2004 carazzo et al 2010 both of which show good agreement with laboratory experiments turner 1966 baines et al 1990 zhang and baddour 1998 burridge and hunt 2012 theories for negatively buoyant jets can precisely describe basic flow characteristics but the parameters appearing in the theoretical formulas still need to be experimentally determined morton et al 1956 baines et al 1990 in this paper a standard k ε turbulence model is used to numerically study negatively buoyant jets in a stagnant and homogeneous ambient medium the simulation data which agree well with present theories and experiments can be used to understand the hydrodynamics of downwelling flow in a stagnant hypoxic basin it is argued that an ambient cross flow weak though always occurs even in a stagnant hypoxic basin consider a buoyancy acceleration of 0 04 m s 2 and an ambient cross flow speed of 0 1 m s as typical conditions of a hypoxic basin the ambient froude number is 0 5 for a pipe diameter of 1 m which can be calculated from eq 10 by replacing the initial jet flow speed u 0 with the ambient cross flow speed this dimensionless number is much less than almost source densimetric froude numbers used in the study indicating that weak ambient currents affect little the plume dynamics compared with downwelling discharges an algebraic formula fitted to the simulation data predicts the te flow rate by which the terminal te flow rate can be quantitatively determined the efficiency index of ventilation eiv unit m3 j which is defined as the terminal te flow rate per unit rate of energy supply is applied to perform the optimal design of a tidal pump a typical downwelling device our study provides not only a quantitative method for determining the te flow rate that can be used to define the mass source terms in coupled regional models but also technical advice for energy management of artificial downwelling the paper is structured as follows in sections 2 and 3 the numerical model is introduced and verified by comparisons with convincing experiments from the literature in section 4 methods for calculating the te flow rate and eiv are presented in section 5 the te flow rate and the eiv of a tidal pump are discussed in section 6 the concluding remarks are summarized 2 numerical

desalination industry oliver et al 2008 abou elhaggag et al 2011 gildeh et al 2015 in which brine discharges are numerically studied as negatively buoyant jets these turbulence models reproduce well the basic characteristics of negatively buoyant jets such as trajectories and maximum penetration height and are readily available in commercial cfd packages we use the standard k ε turbulence model to close the reynolds averaged governing equations of negatively buoyant jets the vertical intrusion from a round source is assumed to occur in a homogeneous and stagnant ambient medium and therefore be axisymetric unlike the case of a downwelling flow it is heavy salt water that is injected upward into fresh water in our numerical study which can be compared with the most laboratory experiments in the literature however these two cases have exactly the same solution since they are a pair of mirror cases as long as their relative density differences remain equal therefore the simulation data are also available for the prediction of a downwelling flow the origin of two dimensional cylindrical coordinates is set to the center of the pipe outlet as shown in fig 2 a the reynolds averaged

fig 2 b and 1 950 cm all of which project a distance of 20 cm above the bottom wall the relatively large distance between the discharge point and the top wall allows full development of dense jets without the influence of boundary effects the boundary conditions for solving the numerical model are as follows gildeh et al 2015 pipe outlet u v s t k ε u 0 0 s 0 t 0 0 06 u 0 2 0 03 u 0 3 r 0 bottom wall x v s t k ε 0 u 0 central axis r u s t k ε 0 v 0 top wall x s t 0 u v k ε 0 pipe wall r s t 0 u v k ε 0 farfield r u v s t k ε 0 where u 0 is the uniform distribution of the mean flow speed of the dense jet which approximates the turbulent velocity profile across the pipe outlet and s 0 and t 0 are the initial salinity and temperature of the dense jet respectively in the case study the water temperature is uniformly set to 20 c in the whole computational domain thus salinity is the single transported species there are series of u 0 and s 0 involved in the case study whereas the stagnant and homogeneous ambient medium is specified by initializing both the velocity magnitude and salinity to zero in the fluid domain the operating conditions are listed in table 1 the source densimetric froude numbers are designed to vary from 1 35 to 14 47 covering almost the full effective range of artificial downwelling in real applications all the reynolds numbers are not less than 2000 since in this situation negatively buoyant jets are fully turbulent williamson et al 2008 similar to the downwelling flow in real applications the computational meshes are block structured consisting of quadrilateral grid cells fig 2 b presents the mesh using a pipe radius of 0 975 cm the minimum grid with δ r 0 2 r 0 can be seen neighboring the pipe outlet where the initial jet produces large radial gradients in both axial velocity and species concentration at places where large gradients exist the grid resolution should be sufficiently fine to approach the physically real solution yet the computational cost will increase simultaneously as the grid size diminishes a proper choice of δ r can be made based on grid independence checks four meshes with different degrees of refinement were thus generated and their solutions were compared for δ r and the total numbers of grid cells please refer to table 2 for the operating conditions of case 4 1 the density distributions along the central axis and profiles of axial velocity at x 2 cm are plotted in fig 3 a and b indicating that an economical mesh size is δ r 0 2 r 0 since no evident variation of the solution results from using higher grid resolution the time step is supposed to be less than δ r u 0 in compliance with the cfl condition in the overall domain the minimum δ r is 1 1 mm and the maximum velocity u 0 is 0 34 m s which requires a proper value of the time step to be less than 0 0032 s the time step is chosen to be 0 003 s at the start of the iterations then it follows an adaptive strategy with minimum and maximum step change factors of 0 5 and 2 respectively at each time step the iterations will not stop until the absolute residuals of all variables are lower than 10 5 but there is a limit of 50 iterations at most 3 model validation 3 1 dimensionless variables before the numerical results are compared with experiments we shall first describe physical ideas about negatively buoyant jets this leads to the proper choice of parameters used for the comparisons consider heavy salt water vertically discharged upward into a stagnant ambient medium the dense jet will steadily loses its momentum because of the opposing buoyancy the injected water reaches a maximum height as the momentum of the dense jet goes to zero and then falls back around the upflow replacing the lighter water that could mix with the upflow the density of the upflow is thus increased and its top descends from the initial maximum height to a lower position that fluctuates slightly around a mean steady height baines et al 1990 a similar phenomenon can be found in the case of artificial downwelling in which less dense fluid vertically discharges downward into a dense ambient medium the initial maximum height x m the mean steady height x s and the ratio between them x m x s describe the upward motion of dense jets on which many studies focus on their quantitative analysis baines et al 1990 gives the scaling for the mean steady height 9 x s r 0 c 0 f r 0 where the c 0 is constant at 2 46 baines et al 1990 turner 1966 and f r 0 is the source densimetric froude number as follows 10 f r 0 u 0 g ρ a ρ 0 ρ 0 r 0 where u 0 is the uniform distribution of the mean flow speed of the dense jet g is the gravity acceleration ρ a and ρ 0 are the ambient and the initial fluid density respectively eq 9 is suitable for the most cases but leads to overestimation of the mean steady height when f r 0 is relative low based on a theoretical analysis and laboratory experiments kaye and hunt 2006 extended the pioneer work to low and intermediate froude number suggesting that 11 x s r 0 0 94 f r 0 2 3 0 5 f r 0 1 03 very weak 0 90 f r 0 2 1 03 f r 0 2 73 weak 2 46 f r 0 2 73 f r 0 15 forced these changes in the dependence of the mean steady height on the source densimetric froude number provide the criteria by which negatively buoyant jets are classified into three regimes very weak weak and forced the classification is also confirmed by the experiments in burridge and hunt 2012 although the transition between weak and forced fountains might be disputable e g f r 0 7 rather than 2 73 is considered as the critical point according to zhang and baddour 1998 the scaled x s can still be expressed as a piecewise function of f r 0 the initial penetration height can be obtained based on the results of the mean steady height corrected with the ratio x m x s according to burridge and hunt 2012 this ratio widely scatters between 0 4 and 1 5 for weak and very weak fountains f r 0 2 73 and tends to a constant 1 43 for forced fountains f r 0 2 73 another parameter that has attracted increasing interest from researchers is the te flow rate of turbulent fountains which determines the terminal volume flux of a fountain and the rate of dilution burridge and hunt 2016 performed experimental measurements of the te flow rate where a turbulent fountain was discharged their findings encompass f r 0 for all classes of negatively buoyant jets identified to date the te flow rate at the discharge point q e 0 scaled by the source flow rate q 0 is presented based on fitting a curve to their experimental data as follows 12 q e 0 q 0 0 37 f r 0 2 3 0 5 f r 0 0 98 0 38 f r 0 2 0 98 f r 0 1 86 0 71 f r 0 1 86 f r 0 15 limited by the measurement technique however there is a lack of experimental data regarding the te flow rate at any positions other that at the discharging source 3 2 comparisons with laboratory experiments the numerical model is validated by comparisons of x s r 0 x m x s and q e 0 q 0 with laboratory data from the literature simulations were performed under different density differences initial pipe flow speeds and pipe radius in the postprocessing procedure the penetration height of the jet is determined such that the salinity at the central axis becomes 3 of its initial value and its time series of the scaled value are presented in fig 4 for three source densimetric froude numbers the dimensionless time is adopted as τ t g u 0 where g is the buoyancy acceleration expressed as ρ 0 ρ a ρ 0 g for all the curves the scaled penetration heights are positively related to the froude numbers initial pulses come first with steady stages left behind x m r 0 is the peak value of the initial pulse while x s r 0 is calculated as a time averaged value for the steady stage the slight increases in the dimensionless penetration height during the steady periods can be explained by the stagnant diffusion of the salt in water this process is extremely slow and thus can be neglected fig 5 a shows a comparison of the scaled mean steady height for froude numbers between 1 35 and 14 47 the simulation data within this range basically agree with the scalings described in the literature for f r 0 2 73 the simulated cases are not sufficient to determine the dependence of scaled mean steady height on f r 0 but their deviations from experiments or theoretical prediction are estimated to be no more than 20 for f r 0 2 73 the simulations indicate a linear dependence of the scaled mean steady height on f r 0 with a constant slope of 2 02 on average this result is closer to the theoretical prediction of hunt and debugne 2016 2 16 than the experiments from burridge and hunt 2012 2 46 negative deviations could be partly explained by the fact that the rans scheme underestimates the reaching of turbulent eddies by averaging them the ratio x m x s versus f r 0 is scattered in fig 5 b the figure shows no evident difference between the numerical results and experiments for f r 0 2 73 across which the ratio decreases by some 13 from 1 4 to 1 2 as the source densimetric froude number continues to increase both the ratio predicted by simulations and that obtained from experiments steadily increase to reach a constant the constant given by the simulation is 1 53 and very close to the theoretical prediction of 1 52 while that given by experiments is 1 43 during the experimental measurements there were abnormally high values of the ratio across the range of froude number between 2 73 and 10 because the forced fountain induces an initial vortex that integrates with the top front of the fountain leading to visual overestimation of the initial penetration height the validity of our model is further confirmed by the results regarding the scaled te flow rate at the discharging point q e 0 according to the definition the simulated te flow rate can be obtained by computing the integral of the entrainment on the sharp interface between the buoyant plume and its outside consider a control volume enclosed by the interface and a horizontal cross section of the plume fig 6 the volume flux across inside the interface should equal the volume flux across outside the cross section of the plume minus mass source terms if any such that continuity is maintained for the incompressible fluid consequently the te flow rate can be calculated by subtracting the mass source from the integral of the axial velocity on the cross section of the plume which is more achievable than performing a direct integral on the interface in the present study the interface is determined by the isosurface of 3 of the initial salinity then the te flow rate can be expressed as follows 13 q e x 0 r 0 03 x 2 π r u r x d r q x where r 0 03 x is the radius of the interface at the depth level x and s x represents the mass source defined as below 14 q x 0 x 0 q 0 x 0 accordingly q e 0 x 0 is the integral result minus the initial pipe flow rate the model results for q e 0 or q e 0 scaled by q 0 are shown in fig 7 they remain in good agreement with experiments for the studied range of densimeric froude number similar to the scaled mean steady height there is a linear dependence stage for a relatively high densimeric froude number the constant slope fitted to the simulation data is 0 61 with a negative deviation of 14 1 from that given by burridge and hunt 2016 such a difference should be acceptable when the numerical model is used to predict the te flow rate in artificial downwelling engineering 4 calculation methods 4 1 te flow rate an analytical expression of the te flow rate developed from simulation data provides basis for the latter discussion on the terminal te flow rate which represents the capacity of ventilation moreover the formulation of the te flow rate is applied in the definition of eiv to optimize engineering parameters for artificial downwelling all the calculation methods is based on the main assumption that the downwelling induced plume reaches steady state in a stagnant medium the evolution of a downwelling flow is shown as fig 8 in which the negatively buoyant plume first reaches its maximum penetration and then moves back to the steady point the plume in the steady state is divided into two regions according to the type of leading forces exerting on the plume in the interaction region fig 8 d the initial jet interacts with the reverse main flow where the entrainment dynamics is governed by momentum flux and buoyancy flux the dimensionless te flow rate in this region has been specified as a linear function of the distance from the mean steady penetration height baines et al 1990 15 q e x q 0 a 0 x s x r 0 q e 0 q 0 a 0 x r 0 x 0 baines et al 1993 considers a 0 almost constant for a strong source but related to f r 0 for a weak source however the constant is still uncertain because of a lack of experimental data this assumption is confirmed by the simulation results fig 9 a presents the linear fitting process for dimensionless te flow rate using different values of a 0 the fitted a 0 almost scatters between 0 29 and 0 33 with no tendency to increase or decrease except for a few greater values within the range of weak fountains e g a 0 0 3581 for f r 0 3 85 considering that the studied range of f r mainly characterizes forced fountains the coefficient a 0 can be assumed to be constant which is determined by minimizing the norm of an error vector that comprises all the residuals of fitted te flow rates from simulation results it can be seen in fig 9 b that the lowest point appears when a 0 0 321 using this value leads to a good prediction of the te flow rate with deviations of no more than 17 9 from the simulation results the above linear dependence is maintained until the reverse main flow starts climbing along the downwelling pipe without any momentum source involved a pure buoyant plume is then evolved in the plume region fig 8 d the initial buoyancy flux f 0 and the distance from the source x govern the entrainment rate ε unit m s as the following form bendtsen et al 2013 16 ε ε 0 f 0 1 3 x 1 3 x 0 where f 0 can be further expressed as ρ 0 ρ a ρ a g π u 0 r 0 2 and ε 0 is the entrainment coefficient and parameterized as 0 25 according to the observational data bendtsen et al 2013 moreover ε can be expressed as the derivative form of 1 2 π r 0 03 d q e d x with the boundary condition q e q e 0 at x 0 then te flow rate in the second stage can be written as follows 17 q e x q e 0 0 x ε 0 f 0 1 3 x 1 3 2 π r 0 03 d x where r 0 03 is the radius of isosurface of 3 salinity mentioned above which is weakly dependent on the variable x according to the simulation results eq 17 can be updated to the following form if r 0 03 r 0 is assumed to be only related to the f r 0 and ε 0 a constant 18 q e x q 0 q e 0 q 0 3 π 1 3 r 0 03 ε 0 r 0 f r 0 2 3 x r 0 2 3 however eq 18 is temporarily unavailable because of the uncertain algebraic relation between r 0 03 r 0 and f r 0 moreover there is no strong reason for a constant entrainment coefficient ε 0 a more general expression for the dimensionless te flow rate is 19 q e x q 0 q e 0 q 0 b 0 x r 0 a 1 where the coefficients a 1 and b 0 are the values producing the best fit between the equation and model results as we did for the coefficient a 1 fig 10 a presents the curve fitting process for the dimensionless te flow rate using different values of a 1 and b 0 the best fitting a 1 and b 0 across the studied range of f r 0 are scattered as shown in fig 10 b for a single pipe radius a 1 stays steady around a constant as f r 0 changes suggesting independence of a 1 from f r 0 on the other hand the pipe radius affects the best fitting a 1 increasing the pipe radius fourfold results in a decrease of a 1 from approximately 0 75 to 0 6 which may be explained by geometric effects that are not considered here for simplification within the range of 1 35 f r 0 14 6 an average value of 0 683 for a 1 can be adopted which is very close to the power exponent 2 3 in eq 18 notably the influence of f r 0 can be observed in the data for the best fitting b 0 the functional relation between b 0 and f r 0 conforms to 2 5816 f r 0 0 676 this formula exactly matches the relation b 0 f r 0 2 3 given by eq 18 indicating that r 0 03 r 0 is unrelated to f r 0 to summarize the te flow rate along the pipe direction can be written as the following piecewise function verified within the interval of f r 0 from 1 36 to 14 6 20 q e x q 0 q e 0 q 0 0 321 x r 0 x r 0 0 q e 0 q 0 2 582 f r 0 0 676 x r 0 0 683 h r 0 x r 0 0 where q e 0 q 0 a 0 x s r 0 i e 0 65 f r 0 for x s r 0 2 03 f r 0 from the simulation data h is the distance between the discharging source and the final position that negatively buoyant plume could reach along the pipe direction 4 2 eiv for artificial downwelling the most severe challenge for practical applications of artificial downwelling is due to limited energy resources in the open sea or high prices of using land based electricity to maintain the downward flow the power supply must be sufficient to work against the buoyancy due to stratification however this may result in too high a cost for large scale engineering not to mention fabrication deployment and maintenance stigebrandt and gustafsson 2007 energy management should be a pressing need for the development of economically viable artificial downwelling it is expected that a proper design of downwelling devices should ensure ventilation as strong as possible while keeping the energy consumption relatively low in the case of artificial downwelling the te flow rate at the depth of the pycnocline q e p acts as a key index reflecting the effect of ventilation the ratio between q e p and the rate of energy supply see eq 21 can quantify the capacity of ventilation per unit energy supply and is referred to as the efficiency index of ventilation eiv unit m 3 j in this paper optimizing the energy utilization of artificial downwelling is equivalent to maximizing the eiv although calculation of q e including q e h has been discussed in section 4 1 the initial flow speed u 0 is regarded as a predetermined value for more practical usage we need to consider how u 0 is determined by a given specific rate of energy supply 21 efficiency index of ventilation eiv q e p rate of energy supply a tidal pump which consists of a vertical pipe with its upper end rigidly connected to a 90 o bend is chosen as the application object in the paper the pump can bring oxygen rich and light surface water down toward a denser ambient medium where hypoxia is liable to occur for this type of downwelling device the rate of energy supply is specified via the following form 22 rate of energy supply 1 2 ρ 0 u h 3 s a r e a where u h represents the horizontal current speed at the pump entrance and s the area of pump entrance given by π d 2 4 if u h is known the downwelling flow speed i e the initial flow speed u 0 can be calculated based on the principle of energy equilibrium fan et al 2013 according to xiao et al 2018 we have 23 1 2 ρ 0 u h 2 δ p ρ δ p l where δ p ρ represents the pressure difference produced by the stratification if a downwelling flow exists the density values at the pipe inlet and all along the downwelling pipe are equal and are generally different from the density of the surrounding water δ p ρ can be calculated from the integral of the density difference along the pipe length hsieh et al 1978 24 δ p ρ x i n x o u t ρ x ρ 0 g d x where x i n and x o u t are the depths of the pipe inlet and outlet respectively and ρ x is the surrounding density profile in real environments where artificial downwelling is carried out stratification is usually sufficiently intense to cause an approximate two layer water body therefore downwelling flow can be assumed to be discharged into a homogeneous dense ambient medium where ρ x is as follows 25 ρ x ρ a x above the pycnocline ρ 0 x below the pycnocline eventually δ p ρ ρ a ρ 0 h g where h is the distance between the lower end of the pump and the pycnocline the second term on the righthand side of eq 23 δ p l represents the total pressure loss in the downwelling pipe which can be written in a general form of the kinetic energy of the pipe flow times a total loss coefficient ξ t 26 δ p l ξ t 1 2 ρ 0 u 0 2 ξ t comprises the bending frictional entrance and exit loss terms defined by eq 27 27 ξ t λ l d ξ c ξ i n ξ o u t where l and d are the pipe length and diameter respectively and λ is the darcy weisbach friction factor since the downwelling flow in the pipe is mostly turbulent and can be iteratively solved via the colebrook white equation 28 1 λ 2 log δ 3 7 d 2 51 r e λ 29 re ρ 0 u 0 d μ where δ is the absolute roughness of the inner pipe wall which is affected by such processes as bio fouling and marine corrosion r e is the reynolds number and μ is the dynamic viscosity of water ξ c has been reported in xiao et al 2018 as follows 30 ξ c 0 217 re 0 17 0 95 2 r d 0 84 17 2 2 r d 1 12 where r is the curving radius of the bend ξ i n and ξ o u t are the entrance loss coefficient and the exit loss coefficient respectively ξ i n is nearly zero at the bend inlet because the direction the bend inlet toward is parallel to the incident flow direction such that there is no distortion of streamlines and large eddy dissipation ξ o u t is equal to 1 for an open ended pipe in stagnant water antonini et al 2015 eq 23 can be then be written in a new form 31 1 2 ρ 0 u h 2 δ p ρ λ l d ξ c 1 1 2 ρ 0 u 0 2 a computer program was developed in matlab to solve the presented algebraic model of the eiv for the tidal pump for the prescribed values of u h ρ a ρ 0 l d r h and δ the eiv can be obtained from the following calculation procedure define and initialize intermediate variables including u 0 ξ t and the residual of u 0 go into and repeat the iterative loop to solve u 0 until the residual of u 0 decreases to less than 0 001 u 0 is first updated by the real part of the following square root such that it is zero if the horizontal current fails to overcome the stratification 32 u 0 u h 2 2 ρ a ρ 0 ρ 0 h g ξ t then the new u 0 is used to produce a new reynolds number by which ξ t is updated and prepared for the next iteration use u 0 and eq 20 to calculate the source densimetric froude number f r 0 and the terminal te flow rate at the depth of the pycnocline q e h solve for the eiv via dividing q e h by the rate of energy supply 5 results and discussion 5 1 te flow rate in section 4 1 formulation of the te flow rate was conducted based on fitting a curve to all of the simulation results leading to achievement of eq 20 however there are deviations of the predictions based on eq 20 from real solutions for the parameterization of the empirical coefficients that we defined to confirm the validity of the proposed formula fig 11 presents both the calculation results of eq 20 and numerical data for representative values of f r 0 i e 1 36 3 85 and 7 69 where the horizontal ordinate is chosen as distance from the maximum penetration height of the initial jet scaled by the pipe radius the te flow rate scaled by the initial pipe flow rate increases as the negatively buoyant plume becomes farther away from the maximum penetration height the results reproduce the different characteristics in two regions prescribed in section 4 1 fig 8 d for a steady state negatively buoyant plume in the interaction region the scaled te flow rate governed by both buoyancy flux and momentum flux is linearly dependent on the distance which means the entrainment rate as the derivative of the te flow rate is a constant in the plume region the entrainment rate mainly determined by the buoyancy flux starts with a sudden increase due to no constraint from detrainment of the initial jet but then decreases as the buoyancy flux is continually reduced by passive turbulent diffusion the scaled te flow rate thus have a weaker tendency to increase as the plume moves farer away the discharging point beside reproducing different stages of ambient entrainment the curve lines of the fitted function and numerical results exhibit good agreement deviations of the curve lines are in general no more than 5 of the corresponding simulation data for the smallest source densimetric froude number adopted in the study f r 0 1 36 a relatively large deviation appears in the latter half of the curve line because the power exponent a 1 eventually taken as an average of 0 683 is greater than the best fitting a 1 under f r 0 1 36 however the resulting error of approximately 10 does not affect the generality of the fitted function in practical use the terminal te flow rate is defined as the te flow rate at the transition point of the entrainment into the detrainment which quantifies the final bulk dilution of many discharge practices such as brine discharge heated effluent and artificial downwelling as a consequence this parameter is of primary interest in the following discussion we can calculate the terminal te flow rate from eq 20 by inserting x h into it 33 q e p q 0 0 65 f r 0 2 582 f r 0 0 676 h r 0 0 683 as an indicator of relative importance of the initial momentum force to the buoyancy the source densimetric froude number f r 0 is the only parameter affecting the scaled te flow rate if the h r 0 is fixed it can be seen in eq 33 that the first term on the right side of eq 33 is positively related to f r 0 this dependence can be explained by that the first term is contributed by the entrainment in the interaction region in which the momentum force favors the entrainment whereas the buoyancy against the momentum force constrains the entrainment the entrainment dynamics becomes quite different in the plume region the buoyancy is the main reason for the entrainment since the plume is fully developed in this region therefore an increase in the initial buoyancy which means an decrease in f r 0 decreases the second term quantifying the total entrainment in the plume region the dependence of the second term on f r 0 indicates that the initial momentum force plays a role as well an explaination should be the initial momentum force related to starting buoyancy in the plume region a stronger momentum force entrains more ambient water in the interaction region resulting in a weaker starting buoyancy and thus the less total entrainment in the plume region 5 2 terminal te flow rate initial jet velocity and relative density difference for a more practical purpose the scaled te flow rate is further analyzed in terms of the initial jet velocity and relative density difference two of which quantify the initial momentum force and the buoyancy respectively we first choose initial jet velocity as a single factor to reveal its relationship with the final enlargement of the initial jet flow rate see fig 12 a the calculation of the ratio q e p q 0 is confined to 1 36 f r 0 14 47 which is an effective range for the present study in either case of relative density difference equal to 0 004 or 0 008 the ratio decreases from near 15 to its lowest point at 9 when u 0 increases from the initial value to three times that value such a tendency can be seen in the second term on the right side of eq 33 which means ambient entrainment in the plume region primarily contributes to the terminal te flow rate the reason is that the starting buoyancy in the plume region is weakened by the increase of initial momentum force resulting in a decrease in scaled terminal te flow rate if u 0 continues to increase entrainment in the interaction region becomes dominant to control the scaled terminal te flow rate the higher u 0 is the greater the initial momentum force is which helps strengthen the entrainment of the initial jet and hence increases the scaled terminal te flow rate this rise is no more than 10 similar variation should exist in the other two curves for larger relative density differences although not within the effective range the relative density difference affects the terminal scaled te flow rate in a different way with the initial jet velocity for a range of low relative density differences the entrainment in the interaction region is the major contributor to the terminal scaled te flow rate therefore the buoyancy keep the initial jet from entraining ambient water which is confirmed in fig 12 b that an increase in a low relative density difference causes a sharp decline in the scaled terminal te flow rate for a range of high relative density differences the major entrainment moves from the interaction region into the plume region increasing the relative density difference now favors the entrainment in the plume region to reach a higher scaled terminal te flow rate fig 12 b shows that the bottom values of the scaled terminal te flow rate are at the middle interval of the relative density difference the minimum point shifts to the right as the initial jet velocity increases from 0 4 to 1 0 m s indicating a strengthening outreach of the initial jet in terms of the entrainment it is suggested that sufficiently uniform mixture with the ambient can facilitate the de stratification process and increase below pycnocline ventilation in the places where artificial downwelling has been carried out including many closed bays seas and estuarine regions the water depth is almost less than 100 m but there is intense stratification due to a considerable salinity discrepancy provided the relative density difference for artificial downwelling ranges from 0 to 0 012 and the downward flow speed is from 0 2 to 1 2 m s the total entrained volume flux of ambient water can reach 9 15 times the initial volume flux of the downward flow when the negatively buoyant plume reaches below the pycnocline 5 3 terminal te flow rate geometric parameters d and h the geometric effect on the scaled terminal te flow rate is discussed in terms of the pipe diameter d and the distance between the pycnocline and the discharging point h eq 33 is used again to plot the scaled terminal te flow rate as a function of these two geometric dimensions fig 13 a presents the variation of the scaled terminal te flow rate with the pipe diameter as the pipe diameter increases from approximately 0 2 to 1 2 m the scaled terminal te flow rate for four different values of h simultaneously decrease by a half according to eq 33 the pipe diameter 2 r 0 exert influence on the scaled terminal te flow rate via the source densimetric froude number f r 0 and the ratio h r 0 for a range of small diameter it is reasonable to mainly consider the first term on the right side of eq 33 since the source densimetric froude number is large in this case the pipe diameter affects the scaled terminal flow rate in the way similar to the relative density difference for a range of large diameter the second term on the right side of eq 33 becomes more important however instead of rising like in the case of the relative density difference the scaled terminal flow rate continues to decrease as the pipe diameter increases such a decreasing tendency for a range of large diameter can be explained by that the water mass discharged from a pipe with a larger diameter has a lower specific surface area surface area to volume ratio suggesting a lower proportion of plume water being involved the entrainment for a prescribed diameter variation of the position where initial jet flow is discharged also changes scaled terminal te flow rate fig 13 b illustrates how scaled terminal te flow rate is related to the position of discharging point for a pipe diameter of 0 4 m the ratio increases from 9 8 to 18 2 within the range of h from 2 to 18 m such a growth tendency is due to continuous entrainment as long as the buoyant plume moves along the pipe what deserves more attention is the derivative of the curve line which decreases as h increases the derivative of the scaled terminal te flow rate to h represents the entrainment velocity at x h the gradual decline in the entrainment velocity is mainly due to the persistent loss of the buoyancy flux resulting from dilution of the plume 5 4 eiv of the tidal pump horizontal current speed and relative density difference in the present and next sections the eiv see section 4 1 of the tidal pump is discussed with the goal of evaluating the energy utilization of the pump thus providing a basis for the optimal design of engineering parameters according to the definition the eiv equals the ratio of the terminal te flow rate to the rate of energy supply the magnitude of the horizontal current speed u h not only determines how the rate of energy supply but also has a direct link to the downward flow speed thus affecting terminal te flow rate the eiv is plotted versus u h for various relative density differences in fig 14 a where the curve lines begin indicates f r 0 1 35 neighboring the critical point of driving downwelling flow minimum current speed required to drive the flow artificial downwelling requires a relatively fast tidal current under large density differences additionally the figure suggests that the eiv basically decreases with increased u h the decrease can be attributable to a slower growth speed of the terminal te flow rate with u h than that of rate of energy supply which is a cubic function of u h it should be noted that weak increment appears at the front ends of the curves to understand this behavior a functional relationship between downward flow speed u 0 and u h is recommended here where u 0 is sensitive to u h at the critical point with considerable increase for little excess of the critical current speed xiao et al 2018 since the terminal te flow is a monotonously increasing function of u 0 it should quickly rise as well so as to offset the decline in eiv due to the increase of u h as the stratification becomes stronger this counteraction extends to a wider range of u h which explains the eiv of the pump being like a constant under strong stratification consider the horizontal current speed as an invariable value then the relative density difference affects eiv of the pump due to variation in the terminal te flow rate the terminal te flow rate can be written as the ratio of the terminal te flow rate to the downwelling flow rate times the downwelling flow rate the former has been discussed in section 5 2 for relative density difference increasing from 0 to 0 008 the ratio declines first and then increases on the other the downwelling flow rate is dependent on relative density difference and will decrease to zero as long as the stratification is sufficiently strong xiao et al 2018 the calculation indicates that the terminal te flow rate continuously decreases as the relatively large density difference becomes larger furthermore the eiv versus relative density difference is presented in fig 14 b the eiv is a monotonously decreasing function of the relative density difference with a gently decreasing tendency as a whole under high current speed the curve trend for the eiv is similar to that of the downwelling flow rate in the case of u h 1 2 m s the downwelling flow rate was found from the calculation to be steady over the range of 0 002 ρ a ρ 0 ρ 0 0 007 while the steady range for u h 0 6 m s is much narrower provided the pump works for days and weeks such a time scale is a little larger than that of tidal currents but much shorter than that of the stratification with a seasonal variation it is therefore reasonable to consider the stratification as stable the main factor resulting in fluctuation of the eiv is therefore tidal currents in the area of strong stratification the eiv of the pump almost remains constant to improve this value requires discussion of the effects of the pump geometry 5 5 eiv of the tidal pump geometric parameters d h and r d the dimensions of the pump include pipe diameter d the distance from the pump outlet to the pycnocline h and the bend ratio r d pipes with too large or too small a diameter are not available for deployment under intense flow condition in this section pipe diameters of 0 2 1 2 m were investigated for four values of the bend ratio fig 15 a increasing d always decrases the eiv of the pump this can be understood by considering the eiv as the product of the scaled terminal te flow rate q e h q 0 the ratio of downwelling flow rate to incident flow rate on the section area of the pump q 0 q h u 0 u h and the inverse of dynamic pressure of incident flow 1 1 2 ρ 0 u h 2 in the light of the total loss coefficient for artificial downwelling the pipe diameter affects the frictional loss coefficient by the term l d and has a weak impact on the bend loss coefficient due to the reynolds number as the pipe diameter increases the total loss coefficient decreases resulting in a higher downwelling flow speed u 0 where the ratio u 0 u h becomes greater but the scaled terminal te flow rate q e h q 0 almost decreases in addition fig 13 a has shown that q e h q 0 is negatively related to the pipe diameter which together with the former yields the final dependence shown in fig 15 a a tidal pump with 1 2 m in diameter maintains the eiv at approximately 0 007 m3 j which is 27 less than that with a pipe diameter of 0 2 m in contrast to the pipe diameter variation in the bend ratio seems to have little influence on the eiv fig 15 b presents the variation of the eiv for a wide range of bend ratio from 0 5 to 4 the increments are confined to the range of relatively small bend ratio with no more than 8 the main reason is the sharp decline in bending losses as the bend ratio increases from 0 5 to 2 therefore the resultant downwelling flow speed increases sharply thus increasing the eiv behind the point r d 2 eiv is close to a constant the recommended value for r d is between 1 5 and 2 5 as presented in previous studies regarding the pipe diameter it is better to use a relatively small value with safety limits the third parameter h make a difference in the deployment of the tidal pump but its optimal design has not yet been reported increasing h tends to produce a large scaled terminal te flow rate fig 13 b but the pressure difference due to stratification simultaneously increases to weaken the downward flow discharge the above opposite terms make it possible to study the goldilocks effect to obtain the optimal position at which the eiv is the highest fig 15 c presents the eiv versus h for two pipe diameters and bend ratios the peak value appears when h is between 9 and 11 m with weak dependences on the pipe diameter and bend ratio for d 0 5 m and r d 2 using the optimal h leads to an improvement in the eiv from 0 0070 to 0 0086 m3 j 6 concluding remarks the standard k ε turbulence model is employed to simulate negatively buoyant jets in a stagnant and homogeneous ambient medium our numerical results agree well with traditional theories and experiments and therefore can be used to formulate the te flow rate of a negatively buoyant flow an algebraic formula fitted to the simulation data predicts the te flow rate which permits quantitative analysis of the terminal te flow rate of artificial downwelling and efficiency index of ventilation for a tidal pump our concluding remarks are summarized below the scaled te flow rate along the pipe direction can be calculated from the proposed piecewise function eq 20 which is not only important for calculating the terminal te flow rate and eiv for artificial downwelling but also gives a proper definition of mass source terms representing entrainment in far field plume models the terminal te flow rate represents the te flow rate at the transition point from entrainment to detrainment i e x h the ratio of the terminal te flow rate to the initial jet flow rate decreases first as either the initial jet velocity or the relative density difference become larger but then increase increasing the pipe diameter continuously reduces the ratio in contrast increasing h helps augment the ratio the eiv is defined as the terminal te flow rate per unit rate of energy supply that can be produced this index reflects the efficiency of ventilation in artificial downwelling engineering the calculations in this work indicate that the eiv of the tidal pump is negatively related to both the horizontal current speed except for near the critical current speed and the relative density difference the effect of the pump geometry is also analyzed to provide technical advice regarding energy management of artificial downwelling it is shown that a large pipe diameter tends to yield a low eiv while the bend ratio weakly affects the eiv for a typical environmental condition i e a horizontal current speed of 1 2 m s and relative density difference of 0 004 we suggest a bend ratio of 1 5 2 5 and relatively small pipe diameter h plays an important role in the design of deployment of the tidal pump a proper length of the tidal pump below the pycnocline should be maintained from 9 to 11 m to gain the highest eiv in this paper the discussion of the dynamics of negatively buoyant plume is confined to a stagnant ambient medium in nature however a horizontal current always occurs at the pipe outlet and the trajectory of the plume is sensitive to this situation future studies should compare the entrainment of a negatively buoyant jet in stagnant ambient with that subject to a horizontal flow acknowledgements this research is financially funded by the national key research and development

22827,the behavior of fully suspended slurry flow in horizontal pipeline can be simulated through two very distinct models the computational fluid dynamics cfd model and the delft head loss limit deposit velocity dhlldv model the predicted results from simulations are compared with a series of experiment data from the literature involving the effects of different particles volume concentration 9 42 particle size 90 440 μm mixture velocity 1 9 m s and pipe diameter 51 5 263 mm on hydraulic gradient and particles concentration distribution and revealing excellent agreements between two model predictions and the experimental data both cfd and dhlldv however still have some deviations in the near wall concentration distribution as for larger particles though it is observed that the accuracy for cfd will decline when particle size increases and further research is needed for improving the accuracy of the models for the near wall flow of larger particles it can be concluded that both cfd model and dhlldv model apply to calculations for fully suspended flow keywords fully suspended slurry flow concentration distribution hydraulic gradient dhlldv cfd 1 introduction slurry pipeline transport has gained its wide application in many engineering fields like dredging mining and chemistry due to its efficiency and economy it is worthwhile to do research on rheological properties particle dynamics and resistance characteristics to reduce pipeline resistance avoid pipe blockage and increase the transport distance it is also what the recent researchers are working on and therefore many simplified empirical formulas have been put forward but limitations appear because these formulas are different and have to be applied respectively to their own slurry and transport conditions obviously it is urgent to find a unified and convenient model applying to different slurries and different transport conditions which are quite common in real dredging the delft head loss limit deposit velocity dhlldv model put forward by miedema 2016 was established by summarizing and modifying many previous models the dhlldv model can not only identify different flow regimes according to the range of flow speed but also make corresponding calculations for different flow regimes at the same time with the rapid developing computer technology another method the computational fluid dynamics cfd model can analyze solid liquid two phase flow has also shown its potential in the field this approach gives a comprehensive and detailed consideration to rheological properties of both particles and fluid its micro analysis of the interaction between solid and liquid has greatly improved the accuracy in calculations depending on the correctness of the boundary conditions these two methods are not in any way related to each other however if they describe the physics correctly they should certainly deliver the same results therefore this study looks at the problem from two completely different points of view the comparisons between the two methodologies can find out the disadvantages of these two methods in calculating the slurry transport process and then help to work out their possible improvements 2 previous work based on a large amount of experimental data durand and condolios 1952 have found that the hydraulic gradient of the heterogeneous slurry flow is related to the froude number of the pipe flow later by introducing the drag coefficient of the particles in the water he has unified the experimental results of different particle sizes and put forward an empirical formula that has played a pioneering role this formula has been used by the majority of the european dredging industry although in the further study many researchers have found that the durand s formula does not match the experimental results of others it is still possible to obtain satisfactory results in the form of the formula by modifying the coefficients of the model newitt et al 1955 have proposed a semi empirical formula based on energy theory and gravity theory for heterogeneous flow newitt assumed that when the gravity particles continued to deposit the additional pressure loss would be produced due to the potential energy used to sustain the particle suspension in addition he also obtained the critical flow rate formula based on the transition between sliding bed and heterogeneous flow however there are some objections to the theoretical part of this formula and it is not applicable to higher concentration in wasp s 1963 research slurry consists of two parts the fine particles and water as a carrier fluid and the larger particles as transported particles according to durand the total resistance loss comprises two resistance losses from both the carrier and the larger particles wasp s model in the low velocity regime is as good as the model of durand and in the high velocity regime is as good as the equivalent liquid model the model successfully integrates inhomogeneous and homogeneous flow regimes in one model but it does not consider the possible presence of slip bed phenomena in heterogeneous flow regimes wilson s 1979 two layer model is based on force balance his model theoretically assumes the following the pipe is divided into the upper and lower layers the concentration of particles in each layer is uniform and the flow velocity is the same in the model momentum transfer is calculated by the shear force at the interface the model is widely used in sliding bed transportation the model from doron and barnea 1993 is a two layer model similar to the wilson model but the calculation is not accurate when there is a fixed bed at low flow rates hence they have improved the two layer model to a three layer model the two layer model is still used for high velocity while at low flow rate the second layer is subdivided into a fixed bed and a moving bed saskatchewan research council has proposed the src model and is updating the model over the years starting from shook and later continued by gillies and shook 2000 the theoretical basis behind the model remains unchanged in all versions they assume that the particles causing coulomb friction are in the lower layer while the other particles are fully suspended due to turbulence and evenly distributed in the pipe the model contains many physical parameters such as diameter particle size and flow rate this model is mainly used for the calculation of pressure drop and critical flow rate in the practice of coal transport kaushal et al 2005 also applied the wasp model but with a modified concentration profile their predictions for concentration distribution have been confirmed to be in good agreement with the experimental data of the researchers subsequently they modified the model by considering the effects of slurry concentration on particle diffusion the new model can be used for the calculation of higher concentration slurry and the obtained results are satisfactory based on previous models and a large amount of experimental data miedema 2016 has put forward the dhlldv model according to physics the model describes the main flow patterns fixed bed flow sliding bed flow heterogeneous flow pseudo homogeneous flow and sliding flow in slurry transportation the advantages of the model lie in its wider applicability its successful description of the above five phase transition and the excellent match of its calculations with corresponding experimental data most models mentioned above are empirical or semi empirical combining the fundamental physics and experimental data dredging companies are interested in this kind of models however scientists are more interested in the internal structure and detailed development of the flow which is also beneficial for further technology development with the help of the development of computer simulation technology the cfd method becomes more and more popular in studying the multiphase flow problem the cfd method allows scientists to get detailed internal structure of the flow ekambara et al 2009 have adopted a three dimensional numerical model based on particle flow dynamics and made analysis on the sensitivity of flow field when imposed with different interphase force by using ansys cfx the simulation obtains good accuracy after both drag force and turbulent diffusive force are considered whereas lift force and wall lubrication force have no significant influence on the calculation results in addition their research includes the effects of factors such as tube diameter 50 500 mm slurry volume concentration 8 45 particle size 90 500 μm and mixture flow rate 1 5 5 5 m s on the concentration distribution kaushal et al 2012 have used the eulerian eulerian model and the mixture model respectively to simulate the flow of the fine and high concentrated slurry particles in straight pipes they have found that the eulerian model predicts better results than the mixture model in terms of pressure drop and that the error of the mixture model increases as the slurry concentration rises gopaliya and kaushal 2015 after simulating the effects of particle size in the 53 2 mm pipe on pressure drop and concentration distribution have found that with the particle size increasing pressure drop per meter rises and the largest concentration area climbs from the bottom of the pipe kumar et al 2016 also simulating the flow of slurry in 263 mm pipe diameter under different conditions have found that the friction coefficient remained unchanged at the inlet section and the momentum transferring between particles and wall is strongly influenced by concentration and particle size and the turbulent viscosity of slurry flow decreases with the increasing concentration messa and malavasi 2015 have used the eulerian eulerian model to simulate the fully suspended solid liquid slurry in a horizontal pipe the particle shape is taken into account in calculating the viscosity of the mixture and the software phoenics is used to solve the mathematical model after calculated values are compared with the experimental data in the range of 90 640 μm for particle size and of 50 200 mm for pipe diameter the hydraulic gradient and the particle concentration distribution achieved good agreements in conclusion the cfd method has promoted the further research of the granular pipe flow and has revealed the pipe flow details to the researchers ensuring the accuracy of the key parameters for particle flows at the same time the existing empirical models not only have won better adaptability for being constantly revised and improved but also wider application due to their convenience and computing speeds in this study the cfd model and the dhlldv model are compared under different working conditions to evaluate their accuracy and adaptability aiming to give guidance for further improvements in these two models 3 numerical model 3 1 the dhlldv model the dhlldv model created by miedema 2017 is a new integrated model based on five main flow regimes fixed bed sliding bed heterogeneous transport homogeneous transport and sliding flow regime the model describes all flow regimes in a consistent way showing the velocity transition between the flow regimes this study chooses the heterogeneous transport and the homogeneous transport as the main flow regimes since these two are common in the dredging engineering 3 1 1 heterogeneous transport this main flow regime behaves in a way that solids interact with the pipe wall through collisions solids are distributed non uniformly over the cross section of the pipe with higher concentrations at the bottom of the pipe this may be caused by saltation or by brownian motions of the particles in turbulent transport the model in dhlldv model is based on the assumption that the excess hydraulic gradient is the result of energy losses including potential energy losses and kinetic energy losses the potential energy losses are dominated by the terminal settling velocity of the particles as well as hindered settling the kinetic energy losses are dominated by the ratio between the slip velocity of the particles and the terminal settling velocity of the particles the pressure loss is shown in the equation with 3 independent terms the viscous friction losses the potential energy losses and the kinetic energy losses are as follows 1 δ p m δ p l δ p s p o t δ p s k i n δ p l 1 δ p s p o t δ p l δ p s k i n δ p l 2 δ p m δ p l 1 ρ l v t 1 c v s κ c β v l s g r s

potential energy losses the potential energy losses is proportional to the volumetric concentration c v s the submerged density of the solids r s d and the terminal settling velocity of the particles v t while inversely proportional to the line speed v l s the friction factor λ l is influenced by the reynolds number r e of the flow in the pipe according to moody diagram the concentration eccentricity coefficient κ c is in the range of 0 6 1 depending on the asymmetry of the concentration profile over the vertical in the pipe the smaller this factor the smaller the potential energy losses β is the power index in the hindered settling equation of richardson and zaki 1954 the third item δ p s k i n is the kinetic energy losses the constant loss of kinetic energy is due to impact of the particles with the wall and also due to acceleration and deceleration in eddies the slip velocity v l s is defined as the difference between the average liquid velocity and the average particle velocity 3 1 2 homogeneous transport the behavior of this main flow regime is the particles are uniformly distributed over the cross section of the pipe due to the mixing capability of the turbulent flow the pressure losses behave according to darcy weisbach but with the mixture density as the liquid density for very fine particles the viscosity has to be adjusted by the apparent viscosity in the case of very fine particles and or very high line speeds the liquid density often can be replaced by the mixture density in the hydraulic gradient equations the velocity profile in a cross section of the pipe is considered to be symmetrical and the slip between the particles and the liquid is considered negligible the concentration is assumed to be uniform over the cross section this is often referred to as the equivalent liquid model elm miedema 2016 3 δ p m λ m ρ m v l s 2 δ l 2 g d p with λ m λ l but many researchers have found that depending on the line speed and possibly some other parameters there are certain deviations between the hydraulic gradient from the experiments and the elm calculations when particles are transported with relatively high line speeds the hydraulic gradient from the experiments is below the value of elm calculation the near wall lift results in an almost particle free viscous sub layer however in the case of very small particles with the stokes number smaller than 0 03 the hydraulic gradient from the experiments is usually higher than the elm calculation the reason is that the very fine particles can move together with the liquid so that the apparent kinematic viscosity of the mixture has a significant increase hence miedema proposed a ratio between the thicknesses of the viscous sublayer and the particle diameter δ v d with a maximum of 1 combined with a concentration profile and then obtained a modified one the relm model the equation is as follows 4 δ p m δ p l 1 r s d c v s δ v d 1 r s d c v s a c v ln ρ m ρ l λ l 8 1 2 a c v ln ρ

euler euler multiphase model is used to simulate the fully suspended flow in a way that different phases are treated mathematically as interpenetrating continua the fundamental equations of mass momentum and energy conservation are then solved for each phase the coupling of both phases is achieved through pressure and interphase exchange coefficients the model uses granular kinetic theory to describe interaction between particles and considers interfacial forces such as the drag force caused by the difference of phase speeds the virtual mass force due to particle acceleration the lift

experimental data this study has established several models of horizontal pipes with a variety of inner diameters d and lengths l 50d to ensure good accuracy in computations and to achieve convergence 20 exponential boundary layers are established along the wall with a growth factor of 1 2 each row of the boundary layer mesh is 20 thicker than the previous row and the height of the outermost layer is approximately 2 mm moreover the height of the first layer from the wall is expressed as a dimensionless parameter y where y 30 the total number of cells in each of these 3d models is approximately 300 000 as shown in fig 1 4 2 boundary conditions the velocity inlet condition is provided at the inlet specified values are assigned to the velocities and concentrations of both phases the pressure outlet condition with atmospheric pressure is applied at the outlet roughness height has a large effect on the pressure calculation it is taken as 0 2 mm according to the pipe materials the no slip boundary condition is used in the liquid phase the johnson and jackson 1987 partial slip boundary conditions are used in the solid phase to determine the tangential velocity and the particle temperature of the solid phase at the wall johnson and jackson have assumed that some particles continue to slip at the wall while other particles collide with each other the particle wall specularity coefficient φ represents the loss of tangential momentum at the collision between the particle and the wall φ is set as 0 05 in the previous calculation in view of its relation to the pipe wall roughness and of its value range from 0 to 1 4 3 solving process and convergence schemes a cfd software fluent 16 1 has been adopted to simulate the slurry flow through prescribed boundary conditions and turbulence model the finite volume method is used to discretize the basic governing equations of liquid solid two phase flow the pressure based separation algorithm is adopted to solve the conservation equations and the simple patankar spalding 1972 algorithm is used to realize the coupling of pressure field and velocity field in order to achieve stable calculation and quick solution the momentum equation adopts quick hayase et al 1992 discretization algorithm the volume fraction equation adopts the second order upwind scheme and the other control equations adopt the first order upwind scheme the time step is 0 001s root mean square residuals are used and the residuals for convergence are set equal to 10 5 5 analysis and discussion the cfd and dhlldv calculations have been carried out to match a wide range of experimental conditions for fully suspended flow then the hydraulic gradient and concentration distribution are compared respectively 5 1 flow stability analysis the paper first analyzes the particle flow along the pipeline it chooses slurry with particle size dp 440 μm and volume concentration cv 30 and being delivered at an average velocity of vm 3 m s to study how the flow regimes change in the pipeline in each of fig 2 and fig 3 ten sections of flow field cloud are taken from inlet to outlet at 5d intervals as shown in fig 2 particles will have higher velocity near the center of the pipe and lower velocity at the wall because the carrier fluid has zero velocity at the wall and strong shear in the turbulent boundary layer as fig 3 shows the slurry concentration in the pipe gradually shows a gradient with the flow of slurry decreasing at the upper part of the pipe and increasing at the lower part in the high concentration area of the lower part of the pipeline the carrier fluid needs to consume more energy to move the particles while the upper particles are weaker due to the mutual flow and the maximum velocity center gradually moves to the pipeline with the development of fluid flow the particle distribution remains unchanged the maximum particle flow velocity is constant and the peak velocity region remains unchanged from the above analysis it can be seen that the slurry flow before 40d is the developing flow in the inlet section and the fluid flow of the slurry fluid changes gradually with the flow after 40d the fully developed turbulent flow remains stable in order to assure the reliability of the numerical results analysis in the later simulation the section of the selected cloud is 50d and the characteristic curve takes the value of the vertical centerline of the 50d cross section 5 2 hydraulic gradient the hydraulic gradient showing the pipeline pressure loss is an important parameter in slurry pipeline transportation and determines the energy consumption of slurry pump therefore the hydraulic gradients calculated by both cfd and dhlldv models are made comparative analysis with experiment data of schaan et al 2000 kaushal et al 2005 gillies et al 2010 and matousek 2002 so as to verify these two models the parameters are shown on table 1 the hydraulic gradient calculation results shown in figs 4 9 it can be seen from figs 4 5 that the hydraulic gradient almost increases with the pace of the slurry velocity the flow regime is the fully suspended flow and the main pressure losses are caused by viscous friction losses the potential energy losses and the kinetic energy losses when the slurry line speed is less than 1 m s a little inflection point will appear in the dhlldv curve at that time when the flow regime of slurry transfers to the fixed bed flow the liquid has to flow through a restricted area above the bed resulting in higher pressure losses the hydraulic gradient experiment data are in good agreement with the cfd and dhlldv data fig 6 shows the hydraulic gradient curve when the pipe diameter increases to 103 mm the calculation results of dhlldv slightly deviate from the experimental data with the increasing of slurry concentration and velocity because the particle movement with its increasing concentration and velocity strengthens the influence on hydraulic gradient the calculation from equation 4 may have certain deviation when the pipe diameter increases to 150 mm and the particle diameter increases to 370 μm the result can be seen from fig 7 the calculated pressure data of cfd and dhlldv agree well with the experimental data at the slurry speed of 4 10 m s when the velocity is lower than 4 m s deviation happens to both the cfd and dhlldv calculations possibly due to changes in slurry flow regimes the cfd model shows not very obvious transition in flow regimes when slurry velocity is below critical velocity so the hydraulic gradient curve is still similar to that of fully suspended flow regime to have a further research in calculations of how larger particles flow at low velocities this paper has chosen the experiment data of kausual et al 2005 for comparative analysis with the particle diameter at 440 μm slurry concentration respectively at 20 and 30 and velocity ranging from 1 m s to 5 m s as shown in fig 8 from the comparison between cfd and dhlldv model and test data a reversal appears in the hydraulic gradient curve both of dhlldv and test data because the particle settling becomes dominant with the increasing of particle diameter and decreasing of line velocity when the slurry velocity is below critical velocity the flow regime of slurry will transfer from fully suspended flow to the sliding bed flow and then to the fix bed flow the pressure losses at the moment are mainly caused by the sliding friction of the solids and the viscous friction of the liquid the dhlldv chooses for each flow regime the corresponding empirical equation to make piecewise solution so the trend of curve is reversed when concentration is at 20 the calculation results from dhlldv are in good match with experiment data when the concentration is at 30 deviation happens when velocity is less than 2 m s there are good matches between cfd calculations and experiment data when the velocity is 3 5 m s when the velocity is below the critical one however particle settling escalates and euler euler model cannot apply to the flow regime resulting in divergent results besides for all the cases of above critical velocity test data of 4 different diameters are compared with the calculated data it can be seen from fig 9 that the predictions of hydraulic gradient in both cfd and dhlldv calculations are accurate in the sense of errors within 15 therefore both methods are feasible to predict the hydraulic gradient of fully suspended slurry flow 5 3 concentration distribution 21 groups of experimental conditions taken from gillies et al 2010 roco shook 1983 matousek 2002 and kaushal et al 2005 including diameter of pipeline d 51 5 263 mm particle size dp 90 440 μm and volume concentration of slurry cv 9 41 59 were selected to analyze the concentration distribution the main parameters of each experimental conditions are shown in table 2 the concentration distribution calculation results are shown in figs 10 15 figs 10 15 shows the comparisons between the simulated results and the experimental data in the particle volume fraction on the vertical center line of the pipe cross section under different conditions it can be seen from the figures that the simulation results of various working conditions with different pipe diameters have good agreement with the corresponding experimental data except fig 15 especially in the central part of the pipe both cfd and dhlldv show good consistency however there is a certain deviation between two calculated values and the experimental values in the upper and lower parts of the pipeline and the two curves show different trends of near wall concentration distribution these may come from the following reasons for one thing the tested data of near wall concentration may not be accurate a similar phenomenon has also been reported by gopaliya kaushal 2015 for another errors may occur because of the simplification of cfd and dhlldv in calculating near wall concentration in the cfd model the flow of turbulent core area is solved by the turbulent equations while the flow of near wall area viscous sublayer and transition layer is solved by the semi empirical equations i e the wall functions however if the wall condition cannot be selected correctly according to the real flow deviation still happens to the cfd model dhlldv model with its concentration calculations based on advection diffusion equation has modified the diffusion coefficient and also calculated the concentration distribution over the cross section of the pipe from the bottom to the top with the bottom concentration as the reference point this model replaces the vertical coordinate r d p with the fraction of the cross section f so that it can better calculate the average concentration in the cross sections meanwhile this model taking the limit deposit velocity ldv effect into consideration treats the ratio between the line speed and the ldv as an influential parameter for concentration distribution to improve the accuracy when particles have irregular movements in the near wall area owing to different forces error will occur in the calculation of concentration distribution to further explain this problem it should be pointed out that the concentration distribution is often calculated based on the advection diffusion equation in this equation the downwards transport flux of the solids at a certain location in the pipe equals the hindered settling velocity times the local concentration the upwards transport flux of the solids equals the concentration gradient times the diffusivity the diffusivities here cover both the turbulence diffusivity and momentum diffusivity in a stationary situation the upwards solid flux the downwards solid flux equals zero so no net solid flux in any direction it is often assumed that the diffusivity for particle momentum is equal to the turbulent diffusivity many analytical solutions are based on a constant diffusivity and also a calculated cross sectional averaged hindered settling velocity by using the average volumetric concentration in the pipe some of the assumptions in the above approach are questionable in reality the turbulent diffusivity is not a constant in a pipe but will be larger in the center of the pipe and smaller close to the pipe wall analytical solutions do not take this into account but the cfd calculations do the very small diffusivity near the pipe wall as a result of less turbulence near the pipe wall resulting in hardly any diffusion near the pipe wall this theory is correct for the turbulence diffusivity however if it is valid for the momentum diffusivity is questionable particles may behave independently of the eddies close to the pipe wall the assumption that the particle momentum diffusivity equals the turbulent diffusivity may be true for very small particles following the motions of the eddies but if the particles become too large they may only follow the large eddies and not the small eddies very large particles will behave independently of the eddies to make up for this flaw the relation between the sediment momentum diffusivity ε s and the turbulence diffusivity ε m is established by using a diffusivity ratio β according to mukhtar 1991 30 ε s β ε m later kaushal and tomita 2013 suggested a modified diffusivity ratio as shown in eq 17 where the diffusivity increases with the particle size 31 β k a u s h a l 1 93 77 d m d p d j d m w e 1 055 σ g c v s c v b in eq 17 d m is the mean particle diameter d p is the pipe diameter d j is the particle diameter j t h fraction of the particle size distribution psd d m w is the weighed mean particle diameter σ g is the psd grading coefficient c v s is the spatial volumetric concentration c v b is the spatial volumetric concentration of the bed however it is clear that they still use the advection diffusion equation it is a question whether this equation is still valid for larger particles in addition as can be seen from figs 10 12 the volume fraction of particles along the direction of gravity increases gradually and the maximum particle concentration appears at the bottom of the pipe but in figs 13 15 with the increase of particle diameter the concentration curve is observed to be reversed and the maximum particle concentration moves away from the bottom of the pipe according to the studies of kaushal tomita 2007 ekambara et al 2009 and gopaliya kaushal 2015 the near wall lift may be the reason one of the explanations is when the particle size exceeds the thickness of the viscous sublayer which is inversely proportional to the line speed the near wall lift force becomes dominant so that the particles will move upwards from the pipe bottom if the particle is bigger the phenomenon may disappear because the increased gravity force will hamper lift 6 conclusions this study initiates a new and comprehensive comparison between empirical equations and cfd model two different types of mathematical models cfd and dhlldv have been studied to analyze the same physics how fully suspended slurries flow in pipeline the following conclusions are obtained through the comparisons between calculated results and experimental data 1 both cfd and dhlldv are qualified to calculate fully suspended flow with their good matches with experimental data in terms of hydraulic gradient and concentration distribution when the velocity is below the critical one however particle settling escalates and euler euler model cannot apply to the flow regime resulting in divergent results hence a comparison among the cfd prediction dhlldv and experimental measurement at low flow velocities could not be made 2 the choices of models according to different flow regimes will have significant impact on the obtained cfd results for fully suspended flow euler euler model in cfd can offer accurate calculations of hydraulic gradient when flow regime changes from fully suspended flow to sliding bed flow or fix bed flow euler euler model in cfd is likely to have deviation in the calculation of hydraulic gradient 3 in the cfd calculation the boundary conditions on the wall are very important for the concentration distribution near the wall and also for the calculation of pressure gradient there will be a lot of efforts made to carefully tune the boundary condition on the pipe wall since the cfd model focuses on the micro details inside the flow structure as for the fine particles both cfd and dhlldv offer good calculations of concentration distribution but they have slight deviation for the near wall area as for large sized particles such deviation becomes more obvious in both cfd and dhlldv mainly because particles in near wall area move differently in turbulent core area the further research should improve the accuracy in simulating the particle movements in near wall area to sum up euler euler model can give a good simulation to fully suspended flow with its good match to experimental data and careful micro observation in flow despite its inaccuracy for larger particles dhlldv is a generally recognized model and is better suitable for dredging engineering with its accuracy in calculated results wide applicability to five typical flow regimes less time consumption and higher speed in calculation despite its negligence

22827,the behavior of fully suspended slurry flow in horizontal pipeline can be simulated through two very distinct models the computational fluid dynamics cfd model and the delft head loss limit deposit velocity dhlldv model the predicted results from simulations are compared with a series of experiment data from the literature involving the effects of different particles volume concentration 9 42 particle size 90 440 μm mixture velocity 1 9 m s and pipe diameter 51 5 263 mm on hydraulic gradient and particles concentration distribution and revealing excellent agreements between two model predictions and the experimental data both cfd and dhlldv however still have some deviations in the near wall concentration distribution as for larger particles though it is observed that the accuracy for cfd will decline when particle size increases and further research is needed for improving the accuracy of the models for the near wall flow of larger particles it can be concluded that both cfd model and dhlldv model apply to calculations for fully suspended flow keywords fully suspended slurry flow concentration distribution hydraulic gradient dhlldv cfd 1 introduction slurry pipeline transport has gained its wide application in many engineering fields like dredging mining and chemistry due to its efficiency and economy it is worthwhile to do research on rheological properties particle dynamics and resistance characteristics to reduce pipeline resistance avoid pipe blockage and increase the transport distance it is also what the recent researchers are working on and therefore many simplified empirical formulas have been put forward but limitations appear because these formulas are different and have to be applied respectively to their own slurry and transport conditions obviously it is urgent to find a unified and convenient model applying to different slurries and different transport conditions which are quite common in real dredging the delft head loss limit deposit velocity dhlldv model put forward by miedema 2016 was established by summarizing and modifying many previous models the dhlldv model can not only identify different flow regimes according to the range of flow speed but also make corresponding calculations for different flow regimes at the same time with the rapid developing computer technology another method the computational fluid dynamics cfd model can analyze solid liquid two phase flow has also shown its potential in the field this approach gives a comprehensive and detailed consideration to rheological properties of both particles and fluid its micro analysis of the interaction between solid and liquid has greatly improved the accuracy in calculations depending on the correctness of the boundary conditions these two methods are not in any way related to each other however if they describe the physics correctly they should certainly deliver the same results therefore this study looks at the problem from two completely different points of view the comparisons between the two methodologies can find out the disadvantages of these two methods in calculating the slurry transport process and then help to work out their possible improvements 2 previous work based on a large amount of experimental data durand and condolios 1952 have found that the hydraulic gradient of the heterogeneous slurry flow is related to the froude number of the pipe flow later by introducing the drag coefficient of the particles in the water he has unified the experimental results of different particle sizes and put forward an empirical formula that has played a pioneering role this formula has been used by the majority of the european dredging industry although in the further study many researchers have found that the durand s formula does not match the experimental results of others it is still possible to obtain satisfactory results in the form of the formula by modifying the coefficients of the model newitt et al 1955 have proposed a semi empirical formula based on energy theory and gravity theory for heterogeneous flow newitt assumed that when the gravity particles continued to deposit the additional pressure loss would be produced due to the potential energy used to sustain the particle suspension in addition he also obtained the critical flow rate formula based on the transition between sliding bed and heterogeneous flow however there are some objections to the theoretical part of this formula and it is not applicable to higher concentration in wasp s 1963 research slurry consists of two parts the fine particles and water as a carrier fluid and the larger particles as transported particles according to durand the total resistance loss comprises two resistance losses from both the carrier and the larger particles wasp s model in the low velocity regime is as good as the model of durand and in the high velocity regime is as good as the equivalent liquid model the model successfully integrates inhomogeneous and homogeneous flow regimes in one model but it does not consider the possible presence of slip bed phenomena in heterogeneous flow regimes wilson s 1979 two layer model is based on force balance his model theoretically assumes the following the pipe is divided into the upper and lower layers the concentration of particles in each layer is uniform and the flow velocity is the same in the model momentum transfer is calculated by the shear force at the interface the model is widely used in sliding bed transportation the model from doron and barnea 1993 is a two layer model similar to the wilson model but the calculation is not accurate when there is a fixed bed at low flow rates hence they have improved the two layer model to a three layer model the two layer model is still used for high velocity while at low flow rate the second layer is subdivided into a fixed bed and a moving bed saskatchewan research council has proposed the src model and is updating the model over the years starting from shook and later continued by gillies and shook 2000 the theoretical basis behind the model remains unchanged in all versions they assume that the particles causing coulomb friction are in the lower layer while the other particles are fully suspended due to turbulence and evenly distributed in the pipe the model contains many physical parameters such as diameter particle size and flow rate this model is mainly used for the calculation of pressure drop and critical flow rate in the practice of coal transport kaushal et al 2005 also applied the wasp model but with a modified concentration profile their predictions for concentration distribution have been confirmed to be in good agreement with the experimental data of the researchers subsequently they modified the model by considering the effects of slurry concentration on particle diffusion the new model can be used for the calculation of higher concentration slurry and the obtained results are satisfactory based on previous models and a large amount of experimental data miedema 2016 has put forward the dhlldv model according to physics the model describes the main flow patterns fixed bed flow sliding bed flow heterogeneous flow pseudo homogeneous flow and sliding flow in slurry transportation the advantages of the model lie in its wider applicability its successful description of the above five phase transition and the excellent match of its calculations with corresponding experimental data most models mentioned above are empirical or semi empirical combining the fundamental physics and experimental data dredging companies are interested in this kind of models however scientists are more interested in the internal structure and detailed development of the flow which is also beneficial for further technology development with the help of the development of computer simulation technology the cfd method becomes more and more popular in studying the multiphase flow problem the cfd method allows scientists to get detailed internal structure of the flow ekambara et al 2009 have adopted a three dimensional numerical model based on particle flow dynamics and made analysis on the sensitivity of flow field when imposed with different interphase force by using ansys cfx the simulation obtains good accuracy after both drag force and turbulent diffusive force are considered whereas lift force and wall lubrication force have no significant influence on the calculation results in addition their research includes the effects of factors such as tube diameter 50 500 mm slurry volume concentration 8 45 particle size 90 500 μm and mixture flow rate 1 5 5 5 m s on the concentration distribution kaushal et al 2012 have used the eulerian eulerian model and the mixture model respectively to simulate the flow of the fine and high concentrated slurry particles in straight pipes they have found that the eulerian model predicts better results than the mixture model in terms of pressure drop and that the error of the mixture model increases as the slurry concentration rises gopaliya and kaushal 2015 after simulating the effects of particle size in the 53 2 mm pipe on pressure drop and concentration distribution have found that with the particle size increasing pressure drop per meter rises and the largest concentration area climbs from the bottom of the pipe kumar et al 2016 also simulating the flow of slurry in 263 mm pipe diameter under different conditions have found that the friction coefficient remained unchanged at the inlet section and the momentum transferring between particles and wall is strongly influenced by concentration and particle size and the turbulent viscosity of slurry flow decreases with the increasing concentration messa and malavasi 2015 have used the eulerian eulerian model to simulate the fully suspended solid liquid slurry in a horizontal pipe the particle shape is taken into account in calculating the viscosity of the mixture and the software phoenics is used to solve the mathematical model after calculated values are compared with the experimental data in the range of 90 640 μm for particle size and of 50 200 mm for pipe diameter the hydraulic gradient and the particle concentration distribution achieved good agreements in conclusion the cfd method has promoted the further research of the granular pipe flow and has revealed the pipe flow details to the researchers ensuring the accuracy of the key parameters for particle flows at the same time the existing empirical models not only have won better adaptability for being constantly revised and improved but also wider application due to their convenience and computing speeds in this study the cfd model and the dhlldv model are compared under different working conditions to evaluate their accuracy and adaptability aiming to give guidance for further improvements in these two models 3 numerical model 3 1 the dhlldv model the dhlldv model created by miedema 2017 is a new integrated model based on five main flow regimes fixed bed sliding bed heterogeneous transport homogeneous transport and sliding flow regime the model describes all flow regimes in a consistent way showing the velocity transition between the flow regimes this study chooses the heterogeneous transport and the homogeneous transport as the main flow regimes since these two are common in the dredging engineering 3 1 1 heterogeneous transport this main flow regime behaves in a way that solids interact with the pipe wall through collisions solids are distributed non uniformly over the cross section of the pipe with higher concentrations at the bottom of the pipe this may be caused by saltation or by brownian motions of the particles in turbulent transport the model in dhlldv model is based on the assumption that the excess hydraulic gradient is the result of energy losses including potential energy losses and kinetic energy losses the potential energy losses are dominated by the terminal settling velocity of the particles as well as hindered settling the kinetic energy losses are dominated by the ratio between the slip velocity of the particles and the terminal settling velocity of the particles the pressure loss is shown in the equation with 3 independent terms the viscous friction losses the potential energy losses and the kinetic energy losses are as follows 1 δ p m δ p l δ p s p o t δ p s k i n δ p l 1 δ p s p o t δ p l δ p s k i n δ p l 2 δ p m δ p l 1 ρ l v t 1 c v s κ c β v l s g r s

potential energy losses the potential energy losses is proportional to the volumetric concentration c v s the submerged density of the solids r s d and the terminal settling velocity of the particles v t while inversely proportional to the line speed v l s the friction factor λ l is influenced by the reynolds number r e of the flow in the pipe according to moody diagram the concentration eccentricity coefficient κ c is in the range of 0 6 1 depending on the asymmetry of the concentration profile over the vertical in the pipe the smaller this factor the smaller the potential energy losses β is the power index in the hindered settling equation of richardson and zaki 1954 the third item δ p s k i n is the kinetic energy losses the constant loss of kinetic energy is due to impact of the particles with the wall and also due to acceleration and deceleration in eddies the slip velocity v l s is defined as the difference between the average liquid velocity and the average particle velocity 3 1 2 homogeneous transport the behavior of this main flow regime is the particles are uniformly distributed over the cross section of the pipe due to the mixing capability of the turbulent flow the pressure losses behave according to darcy weisbach but with the mixture density as the liquid density for very fine particles the viscosity has to be adjusted by the apparent viscosity in the case of very fine particles and or very high line speeds the liquid density often can be replaced by the mixture density in the hydraulic gradient equations the velocity profile in a cross section of the pipe is considered to be symmetrical and the slip between the particles and the liquid is considered negligible the concentration is assumed to be uniform over the cross section this is often referred to as the equivalent liquid model elm miedema 2016 3 δ p m λ m ρ m v l s 2 δ l 2 g d p with λ m λ l but many researchers have found that depending on the line speed and possibly some other parameters there are certain deviations between the hydraulic gradient from the experiments and the elm calculations when particles are transported with relatively high line speeds the hydraulic gradient from the experiments is below the value of elm calculation the near wall lift results in an almost particle free viscous sub layer however in the case of very small particles with the stokes number smaller than 0 03 the hydraulic gradient from the experiments is usually higher than the elm calculation the reason is that the very fine particles can move together with the liquid so that the apparent kinematic viscosity of the mixture has a significant increase hence miedema proposed a ratio between the thicknesses of the viscous sublayer and the particle diameter δ v d with a maximum of 1 combined with a concentration profile and then obtained a modified one the relm model the equation is as follows 4 δ p m δ p l 1 r s d c v s δ v d 1 r s d c v s a c v ln ρ m ρ l λ l 8 1 2 a c v ln ρ

euler euler multiphase model is used to simulate the fully suspended flow in a way that different phases are treated mathematically as interpenetrating continua the fundamental equations of mass momentum and energy conservation are then solved for each phase the coupling of both phases is achieved through pressure and interphase exchange coefficients the model uses granular kinetic theory to describe interaction between particles and considers interfacial forces such as the drag force caused by the difference of phase speeds the virtual mass force due to particle acceleration the lift

experimental data this study has established several models of horizontal pipes with a variety of inner diameters d and lengths l 50d to ensure good accuracy in computations and to achieve convergence 20 exponential boundary layers are established along the wall with a growth factor of 1 2 each row of the boundary layer mesh is 20 thicker than the previous row and the height of the outermost layer is approximately 2 mm moreover the height of the first layer from the wall is expressed as a dimensionless parameter y where y 30 the total number of cells in each of these 3d models is approximately 300 000 as shown in fig 1 4 2 boundary conditions the velocity inlet condition is provided at the inlet specified values are assigned to the velocities and concentrations of both phases the pressure outlet condition with atmospheric pressure is applied at the outlet roughness height has a large effect on the pressure calculation it is taken as 0 2 mm according to the pipe materials the no slip boundary condition is used in the liquid phase the johnson and jackson 1987 partial slip boundary conditions are used in the solid phase to determine the tangential velocity and the particle temperature of the solid phase at the wall johnson and jackson have assumed that some particles continue to slip at the wall while other particles collide with each other the particle wall specularity coefficient φ represents the loss of tangential momentum at the collision between the particle and the wall φ is set as 0 05 in the previous calculation in view of its relation to the pipe wall roughness and of its value range from 0 to 1 4 3 solving process and convergence schemes a cfd software fluent 16 1 has been adopted to simulate the slurry flow through prescribed boundary conditions and turbulence model the finite volume method is used to discretize the basic governing equations of liquid solid two phase flow the pressure based separation algorithm is adopted to solve the conservation equations and the simple patankar spalding 1972 algorithm is used to realize the coupling of pressure field and velocity field in order to achieve stable calculation and quick solution the momentum equation adopts quick hayase et al 1992 discretization algorithm the volume fraction equation adopts the second order upwind scheme and the other control equations adopt the first order upwind scheme the time step is 0 001s root mean square residuals are used and the residuals for convergence are set equal to 10 5 5 analysis and discussion the cfd and dhlldv calculations have been carried out to match a wide range of experimental conditions for fully suspended flow then the hydraulic gradient and concentration distribution are compared respectively 5 1 flow stability analysis the paper first analyzes the particle flow along the pipeline it chooses slurry with particle size dp 440 μm and volume concentration cv 30 and being delivered at an average velocity of vm 3 m s to study how the flow regimes change in the pipeline in each of fig 2 and fig 3 ten sections of flow field cloud are taken from inlet to outlet at 5d intervals as shown in fig 2 particles will have higher velocity near the center of the pipe and lower velocity at the wall because the carrier fluid has zero velocity at the wall and strong shear in the turbulent boundary layer as fig 3 shows the slurry concentration in the pipe gradually shows a gradient with the flow of slurry decreasing at the upper part of the pipe and increasing at the lower part in the high concentration area of the lower part of the pipeline the carrier fluid needs to consume more energy to move the particles while the upper particles are weaker due to the mutual flow and the maximum velocity center gradually moves to the pipeline with the development of fluid flow the particle distribution remains unchanged the maximum particle flow velocity is constant and the peak velocity region remains unchanged from the above analysis it can be seen that the slurry flow before 40d is the developing flow in the inlet section and the fluid flow of the slurry fluid changes gradually with the flow after 40d the fully developed turbulent flow remains stable in order to assure the reliability of the numerical results analysis in the later simulation the section of the selected cloud is 50d and the characteristic curve takes the value of the vertical centerline of the 50d cross section 5 2 hydraulic gradient the hydraulic gradient showing the pipeline pressure loss is an important parameter in slurry pipeline transportation and determines the energy consumption of slurry pump therefore the hydraulic gradients calculated by both cfd and dhlldv models are made comparative analysis with experiment data of schaan et al 2000 kaushal et al 2005 gillies et al 2010 and matousek 2002 so as to verify these two models the parameters are shown on table 1 the hydraulic gradient calculation results shown in figs 4 9 it can be seen from figs 4 5 that the hydraulic gradient almost increases with the pace of the slurry velocity the flow regime is the fully suspended flow and the main pressure losses are caused by viscous friction losses the potential energy losses and the kinetic energy losses when the slurry line speed is less than 1 m s a little inflection point will appear in the dhlldv curve at that time when the flow regime of slurry transfers to the fixed bed flow the liquid has to flow through a restricted area above the bed resulting in higher pressure losses the hydraulic gradient experiment data are in good agreement with the cfd and dhlldv data fig 6 shows the hydraulic gradient curve when the pipe diameter increases to 103 mm the calculation results of dhlldv slightly deviate from the experimental data with the increasing of slurry concentration and velocity because the particle movement with its increasing concentration and velocity strengthens the influence on hydraulic gradient the calculation from equation 4 may have certain deviation when the pipe diameter increases to 150 mm and the particle diameter increases to 370 μm the result can be seen from fig 7 the calculated pressure data of cfd and dhlldv agree well with the experimental data at the slurry speed of 4 10 m s when the velocity is lower than 4 m s deviation happens to both the cfd and dhlldv calculations possibly due to changes in slurry flow regimes the cfd model shows not very obvious transition in flow regimes when slurry velocity is below critical velocity so the hydraulic gradient curve is still similar to that of fully suspended flow regime to have a further research in calculations of how larger particles flow at low velocities this paper has chosen the experiment data of kausual et al 2005 for comparative analysis with the particle diameter at 440 μm slurry concentration respectively at 20 and 30 and velocity ranging from 1 m s to 5 m s as shown in fig 8 from the comparison between cfd and dhlldv model and test data a reversal appears in the hydraulic gradient curve both of dhlldv and test data because the particle settling becomes dominant with the increasing of particle diameter and decreasing of line velocity when the slurry velocity is below critical velocity the flow regime of slurry will transfer from fully suspended flow to the sliding bed flow and then to the fix bed flow the pressure losses at the moment are mainly caused by the sliding friction of the solids and the viscous friction of the liquid the dhlldv chooses for each flow regime the corresponding empirical equation to make piecewise solution so the trend of curve is reversed when concentration is at 20 the calculation results from dhlldv are in good match with experiment data when the concentration is at 30 deviation happens when velocity is less than 2 m s there are good matches between cfd calculations and experiment data when the velocity is 3 5 m s when the velocity is below the critical one however particle settling escalates and euler euler model cannot apply to the flow regime resulting in divergent results besides for all the cases of above critical velocity test data of 4 different diameters are compared with the calculated data it can be seen from fig 9 that the predictions of hydraulic gradient in both cfd and dhlldv calculations are accurate in the sense of errors within 15 therefore both methods are feasible to predict the hydraulic gradient of fully suspended slurry flow 5 3 concentration distribution 21 groups of experimental conditions taken from gillies et al 2010 roco shook 1983 matousek 2002 and kaushal et al 2005 including diameter of pipeline d 51 5 263 mm particle size dp 90 440 μm and volume concentration of slurry cv 9 41 59 were selected to analyze the concentration distribution the main parameters of each experimental conditions are shown in table 2 the concentration distribution calculation results are shown in figs 10 15 figs 10 15 shows the comparisons between the simulated results and the experimental data in the particle volume fraction on the vertical center line of the pipe cross section under different conditions it can be seen from the figures that the simulation results of various working conditions with different pipe diameters have good agreement with the corresponding experimental data except fig 15 especially in the central part of the pipe both cfd and dhlldv show good consistency however there is a certain deviation between two calculated values and the experimental values in the upper and lower parts of the pipeline and the two curves show different trends of near wall concentration distribution these may come from the following reasons for one thing the tested data of near wall concentration may not be accurate a similar phenomenon has also been reported by gopaliya kaushal 2015 for another errors may occur because of the simplification of cfd and dhlldv in calculating near wall concentration in the cfd model the flow of turbulent core area is solved by the turbulent equations while the flow of near wall area viscous sublayer and transition layer is solved by the semi empirical equations i e the wall functions however if the wall condition cannot be selected correctly according to the real flow deviation still happens to the cfd model dhlldv model with its concentration calculations based on advection diffusion equation has modified the diffusion coefficient and also calculated the concentration distribution over the cross section of the pipe from the bottom to the top with the bottom concentration as the reference point this model replaces the vertical coordinate r d p with the fraction of the cross section f so that it can better calculate the average concentration in the cross sections meanwhile this model taking the limit deposit velocity ldv effect into consideration treats the ratio between the line speed and the ldv as an influential parameter for concentration distribution to improve the accuracy when particles have irregular movements in the near wall area owing to different forces error will occur in the calculation of concentration distribution to further explain this problem it should be pointed out that the concentration distribution is often calculated based on the advection diffusion equation in this equation the downwards transport flux of the solids at a certain location in the pipe equals the hindered settling velocity times the local concentration the upwards transport flux of the solids equals the concentration gradient times the diffusivity the diffusivities here cover both the turbulence diffusivity and momentum diffusivity in a stationary situation the upwards solid flux the downwards solid flux equals zero so no net solid flux in any direction it is often assumed that the diffusivity for particle momentum is equal to the turbulent diffusivity many analytical solutions are based on a constant diffusivity and also a calculated cross sectional averaged hindered settling velocity by using the average volumetric concentration in the pipe some of the assumptions in the above approach are questionable in reality the turbulent diffusivity is not a constant in a pipe but will be larger in the center of the pipe and smaller close to the pipe wall analytical solutions do not take this into account but the cfd calculations do the very small diffusivity near the pipe wall as a result of less turbulence near the pipe wall resulting in hardly any diffusion near the pipe wall this theory is correct for the turbulence diffusivity however if it is valid for the momentum diffusivity is questionable particles may behave independently of the eddies close to the pipe wall the assumption that the particle momentum diffusivity equals the turbulent diffusivity may be true for very small particles following the motions of the eddies but if the particles become too large they may only follow the large eddies and not the small eddies very large particles will behave independently of the eddies to make up for this flaw the relation between the sediment momentum diffusivity ε s and the turbulence diffusivity ε m is established by using a diffusivity ratio β according to mukhtar 1991 30 ε s β ε m later kaushal and tomita 2013 suggested a modified diffusivity ratio as shown in eq 17 where the diffusivity increases with the particle size 31 β k a u s h a l 1 93 77 d m d p d j d m w e 1 055 σ g c v s c v b in eq 17 d m is the mean particle diameter d p is the pipe diameter d j is the particle diameter j t h fraction of the particle size distribution psd d m w is the weighed mean particle diameter σ g is the psd grading coefficient c v s is the spatial volumetric concentration c v b is the spatial volumetric concentration of the bed however it is clear that they still use the advection diffusion equation it is a question whether this equation is still valid for larger particles in addition as can be seen from figs 10 12 the volume fraction of particles along the direction of gravity increases gradually and the maximum particle concentration appears at the bottom of the pipe but in figs 13 15 with the increase of particle diameter the concentration curve is observed to be reversed and the maximum particle concentration moves away from the bottom of the pipe according to the studies of kaushal tomita 2007 ekambara et al 2009 and gopaliya kaushal 2015 the near wall lift may be the reason one of the explanations is when the particle size exceeds the thickness of the viscous sublayer which is inversely proportional to the line speed the near wall lift force becomes dominant so that the particles will move upwards from the pipe bottom if the particle is bigger the phenomenon may disappear because the increased gravity force will hamper lift 6 conclusions this study initiates a new and comprehensive comparison between empirical equations and cfd model two different types of mathematical models cfd and dhlldv have been studied to analyze the same physics how fully suspended slurries flow in pipeline the following conclusions are obtained through the comparisons between calculated results and experimental data 1 both cfd and dhlldv are qualified to calculate fully suspended flow with their good matches with experimental data in terms of hydraulic gradient and concentration distribution when the velocity is below the critical one however particle settling escalates and euler euler model cannot apply to the flow regime resulting in divergent results hence a comparison among the cfd prediction dhlldv and experimental measurement at low flow velocities could not be made 2 the choices of models according to different flow regimes will have significant impact on the obtained cfd results for fully suspended flow euler euler model in cfd can offer accurate calculations of hydraulic gradient when flow regime changes from fully suspended flow to sliding bed flow or fix bed flow euler euler model in cfd is likely to have deviation in the calculation of hydraulic gradient 3 in the cfd calculation the boundary conditions on the wall are very important for the concentration distribution near the wall and also for the calculation of pressure gradient there will be a lot of efforts made to carefully tune the boundary condition on the pipe wall since the cfd model focuses on the micro details inside the flow structure as for the fine particles both cfd and dhlldv offer good calculations of concentration distribution but they have slight deviation for the near wall area as for large sized particles such deviation becomes more obvious in both cfd and dhlldv mainly because particles in near wall area move differently in turbulent core area the further research should improve the accuracy in simulating the particle movements in near wall area to sum up euler euler model can give a good simulation to fully suspended flow with its good match to experimental data and careful micro observation in flow despite its inaccuracy for larger particles dhlldv is a generally recognized model and is better suitable for dredging engineering with its accuracy in calculated results wide applicability to five typical flow regimes less time consumption and higher speed in calculation despite its negligence

22828,the scope of this study is to investigate the effect of the kinematic rupture process on tsunami propagation and corresponding tsunami hazards in coastal regions it is significant for the tsunageneric earthquakes of long fault length and subsequent long duration of the fault rupture in the strike direction most previous studies on the tsunami hazard assessments of the manila trench did not consider the effect of the rupture process of huge plates the movements of the seabed near the earthquake source are calculated by okada model the free surface elevation triggered by the seafloor motion is modeled by the nonlinear shallow water equations the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and the 2011 japan tohoku tsunami are used to validate the numerical model by comparing with measurement data the numerical experiments of the tsunami propagation for the cases of different source rupture velocities in uniform depth and continental shelf are carried out to understand the mechanism of the changes of the tsunami arrival time and the tsunami amplitude due to the kinematic rupture process stimulated by the long duration of plate motion of 2004 indian ocean tsunami we propose several typical patterns of the rupture process of the long fault of the manila trench and analyze quantitatively on the role of the uncertain rupture process of tectonics source in tsunami propagation in the south china sea our results have highlighted that the slow rupture velocity will remarkable affect the tsunami arrival time and maximum amplitude in the south china sea comparing to the instantaneous rupture it is suggested that the rupture process is essential for assessments of the tsunami hazards generated by submarine mass failure with extreme long earthquake rupture source keywords tsunami 2004 indian ocean tsunami 2011 japan tohoku tsunami dynamic rupture process south china sea 1 introduction in recent years several giant tsunami events have brought devastating damage to the coastal communities the development of tsunami early warning system and assessment of the tsunami hazard for coastal regions with potential tsunami risk can been found in grilli et al 2007 for the 2004 indian ocean tsunami yamazaki and cheung 2011 for the 2010 chile tsunami and mori et al 2011 for the 2011 japan tsunami the full lifecycle of tsunami includes tsunami generation propagation runup and inundation in which tsunami generation is considered to be the first key stage for tsunami modelling for most of the tsunami models the seafloor deformation is calculated by the static elastic half space model okada 1985 1992 basically the rupture process could be ignored for assuming to be instantaneous rupture on the basis that earthquake rupture duration is relatively short comparing with the period of tsunami waves regarding the dynamic process of an earthquake associated with tsunami modelling the characteristic times can be defined as the rise time and the rupture time the rise time indicates the duration of slip for a given point on the fault which is found to be indeed short compared with the overall duration of earthquake and often around 10 heaton 1990 the rise time for 2011 japan tsunami was limited to 3 2 32 s shao et al 2011 another characteristic time of earthquake rupture process is rupture duration time geist 1998 1 τ l v r where l is the length of fault plate and v r is the rupture velocity in the strike direction of an earthquake for instance we summarize the rise time the rupture time and the rupture velocity of the recent large submarine earthquakes in table 1 main shock of a tsunageneric earthquake takes a few tens of seconds only which can be ignored comparing with the tsunami wave period of 30 min however the 2004 indian ocean earthquake is considered as an exception which had lasted for more than 1200 s like most of the tsunageneric earthquakes the fault plate movement of the 2011 japan tohoku earthquake had lasted for 3 4 min and released its most energy in 150 s shao et al 2011 satake et al 2013 the huge difference between these two events is due to the longer fault plane length and slower rupture velocity in the strike direction of the 2004 indian ocean earthquake as the motion duration of seismic plate continues a long time it is necessary to include the kinematic process into the computation of tsunami generation and propagation the rupture initiation time t x y at location x y can be can be defined as the sum of a constant rupture velocity and a perturbation value shao et al 2011 2 t x y d x 0 y 0 x y v r δ t x y where d x 0 y 0 x y is the on fault distance to the hypocenter x 0 y 0 where the first main shock appears δt x y is the perturbation value induced by the nonuniform rupture velocity in this study the rupture velocity is assumed to be constant since the rise time is comparatively smaller than the rupture time the effect of the rupture time on tsunami propagation will be considered basically the rupture velocity is of the order of 1 0 km s for the case of the 1992 nicaragua earthquake v r 1 0 1 5 km s kikuchi and kanamori 1995 as todorovska and trifunac 2001 summarized the rupture velocity of ordinary earthquake is in the range of 1 10 km s while some slow earthquakes 0 1 1 km s might consist of one or several high velocity rupture events however it is not reasonable for nearly 1000 km long tsunami source e g manila trench in the south china sea the most typical earthquake tsunami is 2004 indian ocean tsunami with a total length of fault segments reached 1260 km grilli et al 2007 in numerical simulations a long subduction zone can be divided into several fault segments the static okada model represents that the final seafloor deformations of all fault segments calculated by okada model appear simultaneously the dynamic okada model can be defined as that the final seafloor deformations of all fault segments is calculated by the okada model and the final deformation of the seafloor of each fault segments appears at different rupture initial time it is also noted that the static okada model is the limiting case of the dynamic okada model as v r km s for all fault segments previous studies have realized the importance of the kinematic effect of earthquake rupture process hammack 1973 studied the tsunami triggered by the bed motion with time displacement history both experimentally and theoretically both the hydrodynamic and acoustic effects were taken into account to implement tsunami modelling ohmachi et al 2001 they found that the two factors would produce larger difference of wave height in the near field but little difference in far field suppasri et al 2010 investigated the rupture velocity of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and implemented numerical experiments to analyze the effect of the kinematic tsunami source on tsunami generation and propagation in an open ocean of uniform depth saito 2013 derived a theoretical solution for the velocity potential of the free surface wave caused by the seafloor deformation and showed the rupture velocity might also play an important role in computing the near field wave height fukutani et al 2016 developed a practical method for probabilistic tsunami hazard assessments by accounting for the source rupture effects in uncertainty analysis of tsunami wave height and arrival time their study was carried out in water of uniform depth based on the nonlinear shallow water equations and unstructured grid gal et al 2018 investigated the source rupture effect of the 1947 gisborne tsunami and the 2011 tohoku tsunami they found that considering the motion of seafloor could generate larger tsunami amplitude with a resonance phenomenon actually when a tsunageneric earthquake appears in a subduction zone it is not clear how the wave propagation from deep water to shallow continental shelf will affect the distribution of wave amplitude in the domain the manila subduction zone is regarded to be a high potential of tsunamigenic earthquake source in the south china sea where the eurasian plate subducts beneath the philippine sea plate at a speed of 70 mm year the usgs workshop proposed six hypothetical fault segments along manila trench based on the trench azimuth kirby 2006 to assess the extreme tsunami hazard in the south china sea wu and huang 2009 suggested an extreme earthquake source model of m w 9 35 for manila trench according to the fault geometry of three largest historical tsunamis considering ten seismic cross sections and gps data megawati et al 2009 proposed a source model which discretized the manila trench into 33 rectangular elements another worst case source model of m w 9 30 along manila trench is developed by nguyen et al 2014 they incorporated the advantages of two former worst tsunami sources derived by wu and huang 2009 and megawati et al 2009 ren et al 2015 2017b investigated the wave amplitude and currents induced by the tsunami with source of nguyen et al 2014 based on the boussinesq equations and the shallow water equations respectively actually the extreme potential tsunami source in manila trench could be of 1000 km length of the subduction zone it needs further research in understanding the kinematic effect of the rupture process on tsunami generation and propagation and the subsequent uncertain quantification of the tsunami source in tsunami hazard assessment for the south china sea regions in this study we will first assess the effects of kinematic rupture process during the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and the 2011 japan tohoku tsunami by using the dynamic okada model and shallow water equation then for giant earthquakes with source extending 1000 km tsunami propagation scenarios are simulated for the cases of different rupture patterns and velocities the kinematic rupture effects when tsunami waves propagate in deep ocean and in continental shelf are analyzed further the model is used to investigate the extreme tsunami hazards in the south china sea a comparison of tsunami propagation scenarios with and without source rupture process in the south china sea is presented 2 numerical model and validation 2 1 numerical model the numerical model geoclaw is adopted to carry out the numerical simulation of tsunami generation and propagation leveque et al 2011 the okada model is used to generate seafloor deformation and to produces the resulting vertical deformation of the earth s surface complex earthquake fault surfaces are then divided into a set of rectangular fault segments with different orientation and slip properties the okada model is applied to each fault segment and then the resulting surface deformations are integrated into a final deformation of each segment as the okada model is linear the final static seafloor deformation should be linear superposition of the final deformation triggered by all fault segments 3 b 0 x y i 1 n b i 0 x y in which b i 0 x y denotes the final vertical deformation of the seafloor at location of x y triggered by the i th fault segment and b 0 x y refers to the total vertical deformation at location of x y triggered by all segments for the static okada model the bottom elevation function on a datum can be written as 4 b x y b 0 x y b 0 x y where b 0 x y is the initial submarine topography for the dynamic okada model as the temporal as well as spatial distribution of slip on the subduction zone are both included the bottom function can be written as 5 b t x y t i 1 n b i t x y t 0 t γ in which г is the source rupture duration b i t x y t and b t x y t represent the seafloor deformation at t moment induced by the i th fault segment and total deformation respectively the bottom deformation can be given at every time interval which is regarded as the dynamic okada model the time dependent bottom elevation is defined as 6 b x y t b 0 x y b t x y t 0 t γ b 0 x y b t x y γ t γ simultaneously the sea surface elevation is calculated by non linear shallow water equations which ignore wave dispersion effect are written as 7 h t x h u y h v 0 8 t h u x h u 2 1 2 g h 2 y h u v g h b x τ x 9 t h v x h u v y h v 2 1 2 g h 2 g h b y τ y where t is the time u x y t and v x y t are the depth averaged velocities in x and y directions respectively g is the gravity acceleration the total water depth h x y t b x y t η x y t b x y t is the bottom elevation function and η x y t is the free surface elevation the bottom friction terms are 10 τ x g n 2 h 7 3 h u h u 2 h v 2 τ y g n 2 h 7 3 h v h u 2 h v 2 the second order godunov s method is taken to discrete the governing equations this numerical model has been validated in real tsunami events regarding tsunami wave amplitude and velocities ren et al 2013 2017a arcos and leveque 2015 but source kinematic process has been ignored in the simulation in next sections the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and 2011 japan tohoku tsunami will be used to validate the model and the kinematic source effect will be discussed 2 2 2004 indian ocean tsunami the indian ocean tsunami has caused one of the most devastating coastal disasters in this century which has led to more than 200 000 people lose their lives fujii and satake 2007 the length of the subduction zone is around 1200 km 1300 km wang and liu 2006 pointed out that the seafloor deformation of 2004 indian ocean tsunami is complex and non uniform kowalik et al 2005 provided one impulsive source including two segments which were constrained by tsunami travel time following the main shock fujii and satake 2007 have applied inversion method to estimate the slip of 22 segments based on gauges and satellites measurements as they indicated the rupture velocity 1 0 km s can reproduce better results grilli et al 2007 refined the tsunami source by inversion method gps data and other details the rupture duration of 2004 indian ocean tsunami has exceeded 1200 s which reaches the order of the time of tsunami wave period the computational domain is from 70 e to 110 e 25 s to 25 n as shown in fig 1 the topography data is from the national geophysical data center the measurements of four gauges are used to validate the model the water depths at the monitoring locations are 18 m at hanimaadhoo 20 m at vishakhapatnam 21 m at male and 7m at belawan the data resolution is 1 arc minute the grids size is 2 arc minute the grid mesh is refined to 1 arc minute near gauges the courant number is set to be 0 75 and the manning coefficient is 0 024 whereas the depth is less than 500 m measurements of four gauges black triangle are adapted to compare with the simulation results the computed tsunami wave elevations along the tracks of the satellite altimeters after 2 h by jason 1 and topex yellow lines will be used to compare with the measured data herein we use the dynamic source model of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami proposed by grilli et al 2007 the tsunami source is divided into 5 segments as shown in fig 1 with the red area the total length of the subduction zone is around 1200 km the rupture time of five segments from south to north is 0 212 528 853 and 1213s respectively the rise time of these segments is equal to 60 s we simulate the tsunami propagation with the numerical model in both cases of the dynamic source model and the static source model the former takes into account of the kinematic effect of the rupture process the latter ignores motion duration of plates and assumes they rupture simultaneously a comparison among the computed the surface elevations with the dynamic source model and the static model and the measured data are shown in fig 2 the black dot line represents the measured data the red line stands for the dynamic source model the blue line is the static source model comparing the computed wave elevation with that measured data at hanimaadhoo and vishakhapatnam it is found that the dynamic source model could reproduce more accurate arrival time and tsunami amplitude at these locations the waveform is also well predicted at belawan by both models while more accurate arrival time of the leading trough can be provided by the dynamic source model the free surface elevation along the track of the satellite jason 1 appeal that both model could predict the first peak well while the dynamic source model could provide more reasonable result of the second peak for topex a space shift of two degrees exists for both source models while the static source model generates much larger wave amplitude looking at the comparison of the wave elevation at male because the gauge located in shallow coast and the bathymetry data is not fine enough for computation both models cannot simulate the crest amplitude of the leading wave well it is validated that the dynamic source model can better reproduce tsunami wave for the 2004 indian ocean tsunami events the maximum tsunami amplitude distribution is plotted fig 3 most of the tsunami waves distributes in the north of indian ocean and south of bengal bay islands and reefs near maldives screened out part of tsunami to propagate into western indian ocean the maximum amplitude around bengal bay exceeded 1 m which explains most death distributes around this region fig 4 presents the relative difference of maximum amplitude on the tsunami propagation between the dynamic source model and the static rupture model herein the kinematic source effects are described as the relative differences of maximum tsunami amplitude and the arrival time computed by the dynamic source model and the static source model the rupture direction is from south to north as labelled by arrow the dynamic rupture model produced larger wave amplitude ranged from 10 to 30 in bengal bay and north of indian ocean while it decreases tsunami amplitude near the equator the kinematic source effect is obvious in terms of increasing the tsunami wave height in the north of indian ocean and in bengal bay because the rupture process appears from the south to the north of the subduction zone and total time duration of the rupture process is around 1200s the waves triggered by the fifth fault segment will be superimposed on the waves generated by the fault segments 1 4 in the north region of indian ocean in the south region of indian ocean the maximum tsunami amplitude is dependent on the waves caused by the first fault segment only the superposition of the waves generated by all fault segments will increase the maximum tsunami amplitude predicted by the static source model in the north of indian ocean 2 3 2011 japan tohoku tsunami the 2011 japan tohoku earthquake and tsunami have caused extreme hazards including more than 20000 deaths and the damage of the fukushima daiichi nuclear plant fine et al 2013 popinet 2012 according to the field survey of mori et al 2011 the maximum runup exceeded 40 m the magnitude and seismic moment were estimated to be m w 9 1 and 5 59 1022 n m by usgs the earthquake was resulted from the pacific plate moving roughly westward relative to the north america plate at a velocity of 83 mm yr and beginning its westward descent beneath japan at the japan trench to estimate the slip distribution of the giant earthquake numerous studies have been conducted by using teleseismic data shao et al 2011 gps data tsunami wave data fujii et al 2011 or joint inversion method yokota et al 2011 wei et al 2014 regarding the inversion solution by tsunami wave data the linear shallow water equations were taken by fujii et al 2011 and the time duration was ignored the dispersion effect has been taken into account for inversion by saito et al 2011 and hossen et al 2015 the latter also considered the importance of the source kinematics satake et al 2013 applied a multiple time window inversion method by using 53 tsunami wave data from tide gauges coastal wave ocean bottom pressure and global positioning system to present a temporal and spatial slip distribution of the 2011 japan tsunami which is adopted in this study the uniform fault source or finite fault source has already been used to reproduce the tsunami propagation based on the shallow water equations or boussinesq equations see lay et al 2011 kirby et al 2013 ren et al 2013 wei et al 2013 arcos and leveque 2015 zhou et al 2014 it is still interesting to investigate the kinematic effect of tsunami source in the near field the dispersion effect is ignored both in tsunami source inversion and simulation because it is believed the dispersion effect is not significant in near field except the formation of undular bore baba et al 2015 li et al 2018 the computational domain is ranged from 140 e to 160 e 30 n to 45 n as shown in fig 5 the epicenter coastal gps wave gauges iwate n m s and miyagi m and dart buoys 21401 21413 21418 21419 are denoted by red star red triangle and white triangle respectively the evolution of seafloor deformation at 50 s interval is plotted in the yellow box the bathymetry data and grid resolution both are one arc minute while the coastal region is refined to be 0 5 min resolution fig 6 presents the time series of the free surface elevation of measurement dynamic model and static model at locations of several dart buoys and gps gauges generally the dynamic rupture process delays the arrival time of tsunami to the dart buoys which matches better with the measurements than the arrival time computed by the instantaneous rupture of the segments for the tsunami amplitude the difference between dynamic and static rupture is generally smaller probably because of the smaller earthquake area satake et al 2013 reported that the horizontal motion of the tsunami source could amplify approximately 20 40 wave amplitude due to the steep seafloor slope tappin et al 2014 presented the importance of the submarine landslide caused by the earthquake in tsunami generation in order to improve the tsunami amplitude prediction the horizontal effect of tsunami source in the okada model and the submarine landslide with volume of 500 km3 induced by the m w 9 0 earthquake of this event should be taken in account to investigate the kinematic effect of the rupture process on tsunami propagation fig 7 plots the difference of the maximum amplitude on the tsunami propagation between the dynamic source model and static rupture model of the 2011 tohoku tsunami for most regions the dynamic source model can reduce the computed tsunami amplitude comparing with the static rupture model the main reason is that the vertical displacement induced by the dynamic model would uplift and subside in the whole rupture duration while the static model may finish this process just in 1 s one belt region shows that the dynamic source model could amplify the wave amplitude it is because the subfault 0a with slip 10 7 m located the farthest from epicenter but began to rupture at 167 s which is later than most subfaults the tsunami wave induced by subfault 0a could be superimposed on the foregoing tsunami although the rupture duration of 2011 tohoku tsunami is relatively short 300 s and most numerical results which ignored source kinematic process can match well measurement it is stated that the rupture process will also play a certain role in near field simulation 3 kinematic source effect on uniform deep ocean and continental shelf as shown in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami the longer rupture plate 1000 km and slower rupture velocity often close to 1 km s will generate strong kinematic effect to understand how the source rupture process affects the surface wave propagation in deep ocean and from deep sea to continental shelf we carry out numerical experiments of the tsunami generation and propagation caused by the dynamic source model in a basin of uniform water depth regarding the average depth of atlantic ocean 3646 m indian ocean 3741 m pacific ocean 4280 m the uniform depth of 4000 m is adopted in this study although fukutani et al 2016 have evaluated wave uncertainties included rupture velocity and starting point on uniform depth of varies water depths but there are some aspects need to be clarified first of all they only used typical rupture velocity in their numerical experiment the comparison of propagation scenarios between different rupture velocities are absent secondly most submarine earthquakes will occur from the plate edge which located near steep seafloor therefore the investigation of effect of source motion process on tsunami propagation from deep sea to continental shelf is indeed required 3 1 on uniform deep ocean the setup of the numerical experiment is shown in fig 8 which is a square numerical wave basin with a length of 80 arc degree around 8889 km the grid size is 2 arc min and the total grid number is 5 76 million the courant number is 0 75 and bottom friction is ignored in the computation five fault plates with a length of 200 km and width of 100 km are located along the y axis the focal depth is 20 km the strike angle dip angle and slip angle are 0 12 and 90 respectively the total seismic moment has reached 6 0 1022 n m which is of the magnitude of 9 1 it is assumed that the fault will rupture from north to source with v r of 1 km s 2 km s 3 km s and km s eight virtual buoys away from fault 2000 km and 4000 km are arranged to measure the surface elevation the snapshots of the surface waves induced by earthquake with different rupture velocities in the first 1 h are plotted in fig 9 slowest rupture velocity affects the initial tsunami wave field obviously as the tsunami triggered by the first ruptured plate run earlier in the basin than the following waves time series of the free surface elevation at measured locations are presented in fig 10 in which the tsunami sources with the rupture velocity of 1 km s 2 km s 3 km s km s are denoted by red the dash dot line green line blue dash line and black line respectively generally the static source generates the largest wave amplitude and leads the shortest tsunami arrival time while the rupture velocity of 1 km s induces the smallest amplitude and longest arrival time in addition the slow velocity also generates tailing short waves which is obvious along the trench axis the waveform in the strike direction are coincident with n shape for the locations t1 t4 as described in tadepalli and synolakis 1994 numerical results show that the rupture velocity can affect the waveforms for the cases of different rupture velocities the computed wave elevation at the location near the trike direction shows different waveforms between that computed by the dynamic rupture model and the static rupture mode the maximum amplitude produced by the static source could be twice of that by the dynamic source of the rupture velocity 1 km s 3 2 from deep sea to continental shelf we focus on the evolution of tsunami wave from deep ocean to continental shelf typically the seafloor firstly rises from ocean to a wide continental slope and the seafloor becomes a shallow shelf closed to the shore the following typical data is used to describe the bathymetry the depth of deep water is chosen as 4 km h 0 which is closed to the average depth of pacific ocean and the width of continental slope and shelf are l slope 400 km and l shelf 150 km respectively with h b ꞌ 150 m depth of shelf break the normalized depth h b is written as h b h b ꞌ h 0 the depth of the continental slope can be expressed by 11 h 1 1 h b 1 4 x 1 4 0 x 1 1 which is the solution of the following equation 12 h x 1 h 3 4 c o n s t h 0 1 h 1 h b in which x 1 l slope the narrow continental shelf with constant slope is written by 13 h h b 1 l s l o p e l s h e l f x 1 1 1 x 1 l s l o p e l s h e l f 1 the continental slope rises from y axis x 0 as shown in fig 8 two cases of leading elevation wave and leading depression wave will be investigated four virtual gauges named s1 s4 at depth of 2000 m 1000 m 400 m and 50 m are arranged the grid resolution is 1 arc minute fig 11 and fig 12 represent the time series of the free surface elevation at different water depth induced by the tsunami source with the rupture velocity 1 km s 2 km s 3 km s km s it is interesting to note that except for the obvious delay in arrival time the influence of lower rupture velocity appears to be an increase of peak amplitudes at a given location in deep water and a decrease in more shallow water the mechanism of the phenomena needs to be appealed in further work 4 extreme tsunami propagation scenarios in south china sea 4 1 computational domain after investigating the kinematic effect of tsunami source on wave propagation in uniform deep ocean and continental shelf we will extend this method to quantitatively analyze the tsunami hazard in the south china sea the computational domain is from 99 e to 130 e and 1 s to 33 n as shown in fig 13 and the bathymetry data downloaded from etopo1 is one arc minute resolution some locations near important cities along china coast xiamen shantou hong kong zhanjiang sanya kaohsiung and kenting four locations near islands in south china sea yongshu island huangyan island zhongsha island and yongxing island and locations near countries around south china sea quy nhon brunei and manila are selected to investigate the behaviours of tsunami wave they are listed in table 2 4 2 sensitivity analysis before the numerical study three factors will be quantitatively assessed in sensitivity study to evaluate their effects on tsunami amplitude and arrival time in the south china sea in reality many other factors may also affect numerical results the coriolis effect was reported to have less influence on tsunami propagation trans pacific kirby et al 2013 the main reason is that the velocity is small during tsunami propagation in deep ocean which makes the coriolis effects small kowalik et al 2005 moreover the dispersion effect has been investigated for the extreme tsunami in the south china sea ren et al 2015 li et al 2018 the tsunami source of nguyen et al 2014 is taken to carry out to implement the following sensitivity analysis 4 2 1 grid resolution fig 14 depicts the time series of the free surface elevation at hong kong with different grid resolution 0 5 1 and 2 arc minute respectively the grid mesh with 1 arc minute resolution can produce the same results with a grid size of 0 5 arc minute while the result of 2 arc minute grid size underestimates the wave amplitude accordingly 1 arc minute grid resolution is adopted in this study 4 2 2 manning coefficient the bottom friction plays an important role when tsunami propagates in the coastal region even though it has less effect in deep ocean ren et al 2013 three typical manning parameters have been tested including n 0 0 012 0 024 fig 15 compares the time series of the free surface elevation at hong kong and sanya with different roughness the water depth at the two measured locations is 26 m and 60 m respectively overall they produce the same tsunami arrival time however the wave trough of the leading wave at hong kong is severely influenced by bottom friction the maximum amplitudes of the leading wave are 9 52m 9 16m 8 19m which indicates no bottom friction and n 0 012 generating wave amplitude by 16 and 12 more than results with n 0 024 tsunami wave near sanya has been less affected by the bottom friction as the bottom friction term is of magnitude o u 2 h 4 3 it will take effect in depths of 100 m or less in this case it will become more critical as the depth is less than 50 m in addition run up and inundation process are particularly affected by the roughness the manning coefficient is adopted by 0 024 in this study 4 2 3 tide effect the duration of tsunami events is shorter than the astronomical tide while the pre study has shown that it only needs 2 h for tsunami travelling from manila trench to china coasts therefore the tidal fluctuation process can be omitted in this simulation as the average tidal change varies between 1 5 m and 1 5 m from hainan island to lingding bay it is reasonable for us to investigate the influence of mean high tide 1 5 m and mean low tide 1 5 m on tsunami simulation fig 16 illustrates the tide effect on tsunami propagation in the south china sea fig 16a presents the contours of percentage changes in maximum amplitude between high tide and low tide it can be seen that tide effect is not significant in deep water but play a relatively important role in coasts of guangxi province guangdong province yangtze river estuary hangzhou bay and philippine islands due to different arrival times large difference presents in the southwest of south china sea figs 16b and c describe the surface elevation of time series at hong kong and singapore 104 6e 1 5n computed by different tides the tide effect does not make any difference at hong kong in term of arrival time and maximum amplitude of the leading wave but the tsunami wave arrives 10 min earlier with the high tide than low tide at singapore for its longer propagation distance overall the tide effect has little influence for computation of the arrival time tsunami in the south china sea regions however it should be considered in modelling inundation in coastal region for the probability tsunami hazard assessment ptha method 4 3 tsunami source although dao et al 2009 carried out numerical experiments taking the rupture velocity of 2 km s into account by using the source of megawati et al 2009 the results were uncomprehensive in this study the tsunami source of m w 9 3 of nguyen et al 2014 is adopted and the fault parameters are shown in table 3 it is suggested that the source of manila trench with a fault length of around 1000 km should experience complex rupture process it needs a long time to rupture all over the fault segments in this section several possible rupture scenarios are investigated by the dynamic okada model to provide a deep understanding with the role of kinematic source effect we will give the rupture time to every segment of the source from nguyen et al 2014 based on eq 2 with a rise time of 10 s the direction of rupture propagation and rupture velocity are considered in the computations three possibilities of rupture direction are identified as from north to south n s from south to north s n and from middle to both ends m the rupture velocities are considered as 1 m s 2 m s and 3 km s the rupture time of each segment for the eight scenarios are presented in table 4 4 4 results and discussion fig 17 plots comparisons of the time series of the free surface elevation at measured locations triggered by one static source and eight kinematic sources it is interesting to note that most wave patterns look like similar except for a few minutes of the phase difference however different fault rupture scenarios may induce obvious difference for the wave pattern and amplitude e g zhongsha and kenting table 5 summarizes the earliest arrival time of the tsunamis and their relative differences the instantaneous source will trigger the earliest arriving tsunami for all measured points while the latest tsunami is induced by source with rupture velocity of 1 km s the maximum time delay could be up to 18 min for the case 4 of the slowest fault rupture velocity of 1 km s and rupture from the south segment to the north segment of the fault the duration of the fault rupture process is equal to 923 s for case 4 in tables 5 and 6 the bold numbers show the greatest changes of the arrival time and the taunami amplitude respectively for a location among the different cases in fig 17 and table 6 it is noted that the dynamic rupture process does not affect the wave amplitude too much at some locations like zhanjiang 7 5 4 24 hong kong 5 8 22 and sanya 5 9 5 4 however the rupture process affects the wave amplitude significantly at other locations the difference of the maximum wave amplitude of huangyan and quy nhon is nearly 50 which should be considered in the tsunami warning and hazard assessment for the coastal regions table 6 presents the maximum amplitude induced by static source model and the percentage change case 1 case 4 and case 7 have produced the most differences in tsunami amplitude whose rupture velocities are noted as 1 km s it is concluded that the slowest rupture velocity would produce great difference in maximum amplitude especially at quy nhon 55 5 and huangyan island 45 5 compared with the static model to investigate the source kinematic effect on tsunami propagation in the south china sea fig 18 plots the different of the maximum amplitude on the tsunami propagation between different scenarios and static source model as shown the difference between maximum wave amplitude produced by fault rupture source and instantaneous rupture source are all relatively obvious near the manila trench it is noted that the rupture scenarios with rupture velocity of 1 km s will produce a notable difference of maximum tsunami amplitude in the far field moreover the regions with large difference distribute in the direction of fault rupture propagation and it is validated by the time series of the free surface elevation at measured locations the cases of rupture fault propagating at a constant speed of 1 km from north to south and from south to south will trigger larger wave amplitude in the south part of the south china sea and north region of manila trench respectively the changes of the maximum current velocity on the tsunami propagation between different scenarios and instantaneously rupture model are presented in fig 19 only scenarios with rupture velocity of 1 km s could generate obvious differences which are similar to the characteristics of the difference of maximum amplitude 5 concluding remarks in this article the dynamic okada model implemented in coupled with the nonlinear shallow water equations to study the effect of kinematic source rupture process on tsunami propagation the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and the 2011 japan tohoku tsunami are simulated to validate the numerical model through comparing with measurements the dynamic source model could match better with tsunami observations the numerical results suggest that the longer rupture duration could generate strong kinematic effect of the rupture process of a fault then the kinematic source effects on tsunami waves propagating in the open ocean of uniform depth and from deep sea to continental shelf are studied numerically a long fault with the total length of 1000 km is adopted as the virtual earthquake source the effects of kinematic earthquake rupture process on tsunami amplitude and arrival time is obvious the tsunami amplitude is more significantly affected in deep sea than in continental slope according to the slow rupture velocity of the 2004 indian ocean earthquake we also studied the effects of rupture process tsunami source along manila trench which has a similar rupture length as the 2004 sumatra earthquake numerical results show that the kinematic rupture process not only significantly delays the tsunami arrival time but also affects the amplitude the maximum difference of arrival time can reach 18 min and the relative difference of the maximum amplitude can be up to 55 5 the source rupture effects could generate much more complex difference on actual bathymetry it is demonstrated that the uncertain kinematic process of a long rupture fault on tsunami hazard assessment for the extreme tsunamis significant the mechanism of tsunami wave evolution in the continental slopes and the quantitative description of the uncertain of the kinematic process of fault source of the subduction zone in manila trench and the tide level for tsunami hazard assessment in the south china sea regions will be studied in further work acknowledgements this

22828,the scope of this study is to investigate the effect of the kinematic rupture process on tsunami propagation and corresponding tsunami hazards in coastal regions it is significant for the tsunageneric earthquakes of long fault length and subsequent long duration of the fault rupture in the strike direction most previous studies on the tsunami hazard assessments of the manila trench did not consider the effect of the rupture process of huge plates the movements of the seabed near the earthquake source are calculated by okada model the free surface elevation triggered by the seafloor motion is modeled by the nonlinear shallow water equations the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and the 2011 japan tohoku tsunami are used to validate the numerical model by comparing with measurement data the numerical experiments of the tsunami propagation for the cases of different source rupture velocities in uniform depth and continental shelf are carried out to understand the mechanism of the changes of the tsunami arrival time and the tsunami amplitude due to the kinematic rupture process stimulated by the long duration of plate motion of 2004 indian ocean tsunami we propose several typical patterns of the rupture process of the long fault of the manila trench and analyze quantitatively on the role of the uncertain rupture process of tectonics source in tsunami propagation in the south china sea our results have highlighted that the slow rupture velocity will remarkable affect the tsunami arrival time and maximum amplitude in the south china sea comparing to the instantaneous rupture it is suggested that the rupture process is essential for assessments of the tsunami hazards generated by submarine mass failure with extreme long earthquake rupture source keywords tsunami 2004 indian ocean tsunami 2011 japan tohoku tsunami dynamic rupture process south china sea 1 introduction in recent years several giant tsunami events have brought devastating damage to the coastal communities the development of tsunami early warning system and assessment of the tsunami hazard for coastal regions with potential tsunami risk can been found in grilli et al 2007 for the 2004 indian ocean tsunami yamazaki and cheung 2011 for the 2010 chile tsunami and mori et al 2011 for the 2011 japan tsunami the full lifecycle of tsunami includes tsunami generation propagation runup and inundation in which tsunami generation is considered to be the first key stage for tsunami modelling for most of the tsunami models the seafloor deformation is calculated by the static elastic half space model okada 1985 1992 basically the rupture process could be ignored for assuming to be instantaneous rupture on the basis that earthquake rupture duration is relatively short comparing with the period of tsunami waves regarding the dynamic process of an earthquake associated with tsunami modelling the characteristic times can be defined as the rise time and the rupture time the rise time indicates the duration of slip for a given point on the fault which is found to be indeed short compared with the overall duration of earthquake and often around 10 heaton 1990 the rise time for 2011 japan tsunami was limited to 3 2 32 s shao et al 2011 another characteristic time of earthquake rupture process is rupture duration time geist 1998 1 τ l v r where l is the length of fault plate and v r is the rupture velocity in the strike direction of an earthquake for instance we summarize the rise time the rupture time and the rupture velocity of the recent large submarine earthquakes in table 1 main shock of a tsunageneric earthquake takes a few tens of seconds only which can be ignored comparing with the tsunami wave period of 30 min however the 2004 indian ocean earthquake is considered as an exception which had lasted for more than 1200 s like most of the tsunageneric earthquakes the fault plate movement of the 2011 japan tohoku earthquake had lasted for 3 4 min and released its most energy in 150 s shao et al 2011 satake et al 2013 the huge difference between these two events is due to the longer fault plane length and slower rupture velocity in the strike direction of the 2004 indian ocean earthquake as the motion duration of seismic plate continues a long time it is necessary to include the kinematic process into the computation of tsunami generation and propagation the rupture initiation time t x y at location x y can be can be defined as the sum of a constant rupture velocity and a perturbation value shao et al 2011 2 t x y d x 0 y 0 x y v r δ t x y where d x 0 y 0 x y is the on fault distance to the hypocenter x 0 y 0 where the first main shock appears δt x y is the perturbation value induced by the nonuniform rupture velocity in this study the rupture velocity is assumed to be constant since the rise time is comparatively smaller than the rupture time the effect of the rupture time on tsunami propagation will be considered basically the rupture velocity is of the order of 1 0 km s for the case of the 1992 nicaragua earthquake v r 1 0 1 5 km s kikuchi and kanamori 1995 as todorovska and trifunac 2001 summarized the rupture velocity of ordinary earthquake is in the range of 1 10 km s while some slow earthquakes 0 1 1 km s might consist of one or several high velocity rupture events however it is not reasonable for nearly 1000 km long tsunami source e g manila trench in the south china sea the most typical earthquake tsunami is 2004 indian ocean tsunami with a total length of fault segments reached 1260 km grilli et al 2007 in numerical simulations a long subduction zone can be divided into several fault segments the static okada model represents that the final seafloor deformations of all fault segments calculated by okada model appear simultaneously the dynamic okada model can be defined as that the final seafloor deformations of all fault segments is calculated by the okada model and the final deformation of the seafloor of each fault segments appears at different rupture initial time it is also noted that the static okada model is the limiting case of the dynamic okada model as v r km s for all fault segments previous studies have realized the importance of the kinematic effect of earthquake rupture process hammack 1973 studied the tsunami triggered by the bed motion with time displacement history both experimentally and theoretically both the hydrodynamic and acoustic effects were taken into account to implement tsunami modelling ohmachi et al 2001 they found that the two factors would produce larger difference of wave height in the near field but little difference in far field suppasri et al 2010 investigated the rupture velocity of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and implemented numerical experiments to analyze the effect of the kinematic tsunami source on tsunami generation and propagation in an open ocean of uniform depth saito 2013 derived a theoretical solution for the velocity potential of the free surface wave caused by the seafloor deformation and showed the rupture velocity might also play an important role in computing the near field wave height fukutani et al 2016 developed a practical method for probabilistic tsunami hazard assessments by accounting for the source rupture effects in uncertainty analysis of tsunami wave height and arrival time their study was carried out in water of uniform depth based on the nonlinear shallow water equations and unstructured grid gal et al 2018 investigated the source rupture effect of the 1947 gisborne tsunami and the 2011 tohoku tsunami they found that considering the motion of seafloor could generate larger tsunami amplitude with a resonance phenomenon actually when a tsunageneric earthquake appears in a subduction zone it is not clear how the wave propagation from deep water to shallow continental shelf will affect the distribution of wave amplitude in the domain the manila subduction zone is regarded to be a high potential of tsunamigenic earthquake source in the south china sea where the eurasian plate subducts beneath the philippine sea plate at a speed of 70 mm year the usgs workshop proposed six hypothetical fault segments along manila trench based on the trench azimuth kirby 2006 to assess the extreme tsunami hazard in the south china sea wu and huang 2009 suggested an extreme earthquake source model of m w 9 35 for manila trench according to the fault geometry of three largest historical tsunamis considering ten seismic cross sections and gps data megawati et al 2009 proposed a source model which discretized the manila trench into 33 rectangular elements another worst case source model of m w 9 30 along manila trench is developed by nguyen et al 2014 they incorporated the advantages of two former worst tsunami sources derived by wu and huang 2009 and megawati et al 2009 ren et al 2015 2017b investigated the wave amplitude and currents induced by the tsunami with source of nguyen et al 2014 based on the boussinesq equations and the shallow water equations respectively actually the extreme potential tsunami source in manila trench could be of 1000 km length of the subduction zone it needs further research in understanding the kinematic effect of the rupture process on tsunami generation and propagation and the subsequent uncertain quantification of the tsunami source in tsunami hazard assessment for the south china sea regions in this study we will first assess the effects of kinematic rupture process during the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and the 2011 japan tohoku tsunami by using the dynamic okada model and shallow water equation then for giant earthquakes with source extending 1000 km tsunami propagation scenarios are simulated for the cases of different rupture patterns and velocities the kinematic rupture effects when tsunami waves propagate in deep ocean and in continental shelf are analyzed further the model is used to investigate the extreme tsunami hazards in the south china sea a comparison of tsunami propagation scenarios with and without source rupture process in the south china sea is presented 2 numerical model and validation 2 1 numerical model the numerical model geoclaw is adopted to carry out the numerical simulation of tsunami generation and propagation leveque et al 2011 the okada model is used to generate seafloor deformation and to produces the resulting vertical deformation of the earth s surface complex earthquake fault surfaces are then divided into a set of rectangular fault segments with different orientation and slip properties the okada model is applied to each fault segment and then the resulting surface deformations are integrated into a final deformation of each segment as the okada model is linear the final static seafloor deformation should be linear superposition of the final deformation triggered by all fault segments 3 b 0 x y i 1 n b i 0 x y in which b i 0 x y denotes the final vertical deformation of the seafloor at location of x y triggered by the i th fault segment and b 0 x y refers to the total vertical deformation at location of x y triggered by all segments for the static okada model the bottom elevation function on a datum can be written as 4 b x y b 0 x y b 0 x y where b 0 x y is the initial submarine topography for the dynamic okada model as the temporal as well as spatial distribution of slip on the subduction zone are both included the bottom function can be written as 5 b t x y t i 1 n b i t x y t 0 t γ in which г is the source rupture duration b i t x y t and b t x y t represent the seafloor deformation at t moment induced by the i th fault segment and total deformation respectively the bottom deformation can be given at every time interval which is regarded as the dynamic okada model the time dependent bottom elevation is defined as 6 b x y t b 0 x y b t x y t 0 t γ b 0 x y b t x y γ t γ simultaneously the sea surface elevation is calculated by non linear shallow water equations which ignore wave dispersion effect are written as 7 h t x h u y h v 0 8 t h u x h u 2 1 2 g h 2 y h u v g h b x τ x 9 t h v x h u v y h v 2 1 2 g h 2 g h b y τ y where t is the time u x y t and v x y t are the depth averaged velocities in x and y directions respectively g is the gravity acceleration the total water depth h x y t b x y t η x y t b x y t is the bottom elevation function and η x y t is the free surface elevation the bottom friction terms are 10 τ x g n 2 h 7 3 h u h u 2 h v 2 τ y g n 2 h 7 3 h v h u 2 h v 2 the second order godunov s method is taken to discrete the governing equations this numerical model has been validated in real tsunami events regarding tsunami wave amplitude and velocities ren et al 2013 2017a arcos and leveque 2015 but source kinematic process has been ignored in the simulation in next sections the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and 2011 japan tohoku tsunami will be used to validate the model and the kinematic source effect will be discussed 2 2 2004 indian ocean tsunami the indian ocean tsunami has caused one of the most devastating coastal disasters in this century which has led to more than 200 000 people lose their lives fujii and satake 2007 the length of the subduction zone is around 1200 km 1300 km wang and liu 2006 pointed out that the seafloor deformation of 2004 indian ocean tsunami is complex and non uniform kowalik et al 2005 provided one impulsive source including two segments which were constrained by tsunami travel time following the main shock fujii and satake 2007 have applied inversion method to estimate the slip of 22 segments based on gauges and satellites measurements as they indicated the rupture velocity 1 0 km s can reproduce better results grilli et al 2007 refined the tsunami source by inversion method gps data and other details the rupture duration of 2004 indian ocean tsunami has exceeded 1200 s which reaches the order of the time of tsunami wave period the computational domain is from 70 e to 110 e 25 s to 25 n as shown in fig 1 the topography data is from the national geophysical data center the measurements of four gauges are used to validate the model the water depths at the monitoring locations are 18 m at hanimaadhoo 20 m at vishakhapatnam 21 m at male and 7m at belawan the data resolution is 1 arc minute the grids size is 2 arc minute the grid mesh is refined to 1 arc minute near gauges the courant number is set to be 0 75 and the manning coefficient is 0 024 whereas the depth is less than 500 m measurements of four gauges black triangle are adapted to compare with the simulation results the computed tsunami wave elevations along the tracks of the satellite altimeters after 2 h by jason 1 and topex yellow lines will be used to compare with the measured data herein we use the dynamic source model of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami proposed by grilli et al 2007 the tsunami source is divided into 5 segments as shown in fig 1 with the red area the total length of the subduction zone is around 1200 km the rupture time of five segments from south to north is 0 212 528 853 and 1213s respectively the rise time of these segments is equal to 60 s we simulate the tsunami propagation with the numerical model in both cases of the dynamic source model and the static source model the former takes into account of the kinematic effect of the rupture process the latter ignores motion duration of plates and assumes they rupture simultaneously a comparison among the computed the surface elevations with the dynamic source model and the static model and the measured data are shown in fig 2 the black dot line represents the measured data the red line stands for the dynamic source model the blue line is the static source model comparing the computed wave elevation with that measured data at hanimaadhoo and vishakhapatnam it is found that the dynamic source model could reproduce more accurate arrival time and tsunami amplitude at these locations the waveform is also well predicted at belawan by both models while more accurate arrival time of the leading trough can be provided by the dynamic source model the free surface elevation along the track of the satellite jason 1 appeal that both model could predict the first peak well while the dynamic source model could provide more reasonable result of the second peak for topex a space shift of two degrees exists for both source models while the static source model generates much larger wave amplitude looking at the comparison of the wave elevation at male because the gauge located in shallow coast and the bathymetry data is not fine enough for computation both models cannot simulate the crest amplitude of the leading wave well it is validated that the dynamic source model can better reproduce tsunami wave for the 2004 indian ocean tsunami events the maximum tsunami amplitude distribution is plotted fig 3 most of the tsunami waves distributes in the north of indian ocean and south of bengal bay islands and reefs near maldives screened out part of tsunami to propagate into western indian ocean the maximum amplitude around bengal bay exceeded 1 m which explains most death distributes around this region fig 4 presents the relative difference of maximum amplitude on the tsunami propagation between the dynamic source model and the static rupture model herein the kinematic source effects are described as the relative differences of maximum tsunami amplitude and the arrival time computed by the dynamic source model and the static source model the rupture direction is from south to north as labelled by arrow the dynamic rupture model produced larger wave amplitude ranged from 10 to 30 in bengal bay and north of indian ocean while it decreases tsunami amplitude near the equator the kinematic source effect is obvious in terms of increasing the tsunami wave height in the north of indian ocean and in bengal bay because the rupture process appears from the south to the north of the subduction zone and total time duration of the rupture process is around 1200s the waves triggered by the fifth fault segment will be superimposed on the waves generated by the fault segments 1 4 in the north region of indian ocean in the south region of indian ocean the maximum tsunami amplitude is dependent on the waves caused by the first fault segment only the superposition of the waves generated by all fault segments will increase the maximum tsunami amplitude predicted by the static source model in the north of indian ocean 2 3 2011 japan tohoku tsunami the 2011 japan tohoku earthquake and tsunami have caused extreme hazards including more than 20000 deaths and the damage of the fukushima daiichi nuclear plant fine et al 2013 popinet 2012 according to the field survey of mori et al 2011 the maximum runup exceeded 40 m the magnitude and seismic moment were estimated to be m w 9 1 and 5 59 1022 n m by usgs the earthquake was resulted from the pacific plate moving roughly westward relative to the north america plate at a velocity of 83 mm yr and beginning its westward descent beneath japan at the japan trench to estimate the slip distribution of the giant earthquake numerous studies have been conducted by using teleseismic data shao et al 2011 gps data tsunami wave data fujii et al 2011 or joint inversion method yokota et al 2011 wei et al 2014 regarding the inversion solution by tsunami wave data the linear shallow water equations were taken by fujii et al 2011 and the time duration was ignored the dispersion effect has been taken into account for inversion by saito et al 2011 and hossen et al 2015 the latter also considered the importance of the source kinematics satake et al 2013 applied a multiple time window inversion method by using 53 tsunami wave data from tide gauges coastal wave ocean bottom pressure and global positioning system to present a temporal and spatial slip distribution of the 2011 japan tsunami which is adopted in this study the uniform fault source or finite fault source has already been used to reproduce the tsunami propagation based on the shallow water equations or boussinesq equations see lay et al 2011 kirby et al 2013 ren et al 2013 wei et al 2013 arcos and leveque 2015 zhou et al 2014 it is still interesting to investigate the kinematic effect of tsunami source in the near field the dispersion effect is ignored both in tsunami source inversion and simulation because it is believed the dispersion effect is not significant in near field except the formation of undular bore baba et al 2015 li et al 2018 the computational domain is ranged from 140 e to 160 e 30 n to 45 n as shown in fig 5 the epicenter coastal gps wave gauges iwate n m s and miyagi m and dart buoys 21401 21413 21418 21419 are denoted by red star red triangle and white triangle respectively the evolution of seafloor deformation at 50 s interval is plotted in the yellow box the bathymetry data and grid resolution both are one arc minute while the coastal region is refined to be 0 5 min resolution fig 6 presents the time series of the free surface elevation of measurement dynamic model and static model at locations of several dart buoys and gps gauges generally the dynamic rupture process delays the arrival time of tsunami to the dart buoys which matches better with the measurements than the arrival time computed by the instantaneous rupture of the segments for the tsunami amplitude the difference between dynamic and static rupture is generally smaller probably because of the smaller earthquake area satake et al 2013 reported that the horizontal motion of the tsunami source could amplify approximately 20 40 wave amplitude due to the steep seafloor slope tappin et al 2014 presented the importance of the submarine landslide caused by the earthquake in tsunami generation in order to improve the tsunami amplitude prediction the horizontal effect of tsunami source in the okada model and the submarine landslide with volume of 500 km3 induced by the m w 9 0 earthquake of this event should be taken in account to investigate the kinematic effect of the rupture process on tsunami propagation fig 7 plots the difference of the maximum amplitude on the tsunami propagation between the dynamic source model and static rupture model of the 2011 tohoku tsunami for most regions the dynamic source model can reduce the computed tsunami amplitude comparing with the static rupture model the main reason is that the vertical displacement induced by the dynamic model would uplift and subside in the whole rupture duration while the static model may finish this process just in 1 s one belt region shows that the dynamic source model could amplify the wave amplitude it is because the subfault 0a with slip 10 7 m located the farthest from epicenter but began to rupture at 167 s which is later than most subfaults the tsunami wave induced by subfault 0a could be superimposed on the foregoing tsunami although the rupture duration of 2011 tohoku tsunami is relatively short 300 s and most numerical results which ignored source kinematic process can match well measurement it is stated that the rupture process will also play a certain role in near field simulation 3 kinematic source effect on uniform deep ocean and continental shelf as shown in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami the longer rupture plate 1000 km and slower rupture velocity often close to 1 km s will generate strong kinematic effect to understand how the source rupture process affects the surface wave propagation in deep ocean and from deep sea to continental shelf we carry out numerical experiments of the tsunami generation and propagation caused by the dynamic source model in a basin of uniform water depth regarding the average depth of atlantic ocean 3646 m indian ocean 3741 m pacific ocean 4280 m the uniform depth of 4000 m is adopted in this study although fukutani et al 2016 have evaluated wave uncertainties included rupture velocity and starting point on uniform depth of varies water depths but there are some aspects need to be clarified first of all they only used typical rupture velocity in their numerical experiment the comparison of propagation scenarios between different rupture velocities are absent secondly most submarine earthquakes will occur from the plate edge which located near steep seafloor therefore the investigation of effect of source motion process on tsunami propagation from deep sea to continental shelf is indeed required 3 1 on uniform deep ocean the setup of the numerical experiment is shown in fig 8 which is a square numerical wave basin with a length of 80 arc degree around 8889 km the grid size is 2 arc min and the total grid number is 5 76 million the courant number is 0 75 and bottom friction is ignored in the computation five fault plates with a length of 200 km and width of 100 km are located along the y axis the focal depth is 20 km the strike angle dip angle and slip angle are 0 12 and 90 respectively the total seismic moment has reached 6 0 1022 n m which is of the magnitude of 9 1 it is assumed that the fault will rupture from north to source with v r of 1 km s 2 km s 3 km s and km s eight virtual buoys away from fault 2000 km and 4000 km are arranged to measure the surface elevation the snapshots of the surface waves induced by earthquake with different rupture velocities in the first 1 h are plotted in fig 9 slowest rupture velocity affects the initial tsunami wave field obviously as the tsunami triggered by the first ruptured plate run earlier in the basin than the following waves time series of the free surface elevation at measured locations are presented in fig 10 in which the tsunami sources with the rupture velocity of 1 km s 2 km s 3 km s km s are denoted by red the dash dot line green line blue dash line and black line respectively generally the static source generates the largest wave amplitude and leads the shortest tsunami arrival time while the rupture velocity of 1 km s induces the smallest amplitude and longest arrival time in addition the slow velocity also generates tailing short waves which is obvious along the trench axis the waveform in the strike direction are coincident with n shape for the locations t1 t4 as described in tadepalli and synolakis 1994 numerical results show that the rupture velocity can affect the waveforms for the cases of different rupture velocities the computed wave elevation at the location near the trike direction shows different waveforms between that computed by the dynamic rupture model and the static rupture mode the maximum amplitude produced by the static source could be twice of that by the dynamic source of the rupture velocity 1 km s 3 2 from deep sea to continental shelf we focus on the evolution of tsunami wave from deep ocean to continental shelf typically the seafloor firstly rises from ocean to a wide continental slope and the seafloor becomes a shallow shelf closed to the shore the following typical data is used to describe the bathymetry the depth of deep water is chosen as 4 km h 0 which is closed to the average depth of pacific ocean and the width of continental slope and shelf are l slope 400 km and l shelf 150 km respectively with h b ꞌ 150 m depth of shelf break the normalized depth h b is written as h b h b ꞌ h 0 the depth of the continental slope can be expressed by 11 h 1 1 h b 1 4 x 1 4 0 x 1 1 which is the solution of the following equation 12 h x 1 h 3 4 c o n s t h 0 1 h 1 h b in which x 1 l slope the narrow continental shelf with constant slope is written by 13 h h b 1 l s l o p e l s h e l f x 1 1 1 x 1 l s l o p e l s h e l f 1 the continental slope rises from y axis x 0 as shown in fig 8 two cases of leading elevation wave and leading depression wave will be investigated four virtual gauges named s1 s4 at depth of 2000 m 1000 m 400 m and 50 m are arranged the grid resolution is 1 arc minute fig 11 and fig 12 represent the time series of the free surface elevation at different water depth induced by the tsunami source with the rupture velocity 1 km s 2 km s 3 km s km s it is interesting to note that except for the obvious delay in arrival time the influence of lower rupture velocity appears to be an increase of peak amplitudes at a given location in deep water and a decrease in more shallow water the mechanism of the phenomena needs to be appealed in further work 4 extreme tsunami propagation scenarios in south china sea 4 1 computational domain after investigating the kinematic effect of tsunami source on wave propagation in uniform deep ocean and continental shelf we will extend this method to quantitatively analyze the tsunami hazard in the south china sea the computational domain is from 99 e to 130 e and 1 s to 33 n as shown in fig 13 and the bathymetry data downloaded from etopo1 is one arc minute resolution some locations near important cities along china coast xiamen shantou hong kong zhanjiang sanya kaohsiung and kenting four locations near islands in south china sea yongshu island huangyan island zhongsha island and yongxing island and locations near countries around south china sea quy nhon brunei and manila are selected to investigate the behaviours of tsunami wave they are listed in table 2 4 2 sensitivity analysis before the numerical study three factors will be quantitatively assessed in sensitivity study to evaluate their effects on tsunami amplitude and arrival time in the south china sea in reality many other factors may also affect numerical results the coriolis effect was reported to have less influence on tsunami propagation trans pacific kirby et al 2013 the main reason is that the velocity is small during tsunami propagation in deep ocean which makes the coriolis effects small kowalik et al 2005 moreover the dispersion effect has been investigated for the extreme tsunami in the south china sea ren et al 2015 li et al 2018 the tsunami source of nguyen et al 2014 is taken to carry out to implement the following sensitivity analysis 4 2 1 grid resolution fig 14 depicts the time series of the free surface elevation at hong kong with different grid resolution 0 5 1 and 2 arc minute respectively the grid mesh with 1 arc minute resolution can produce the same results with a grid size of 0 5 arc minute while the result of 2 arc minute grid size underestimates the wave amplitude accordingly 1 arc minute grid resolution is adopted in this study 4 2 2 manning coefficient the bottom friction plays an important role when tsunami propagates in the coastal region even though it has less effect in deep ocean ren et al 2013 three typical manning parameters have been tested including n 0 0 012 0 024 fig 15 compares the time series of the free surface elevation at hong kong and sanya with different roughness the water depth at the two measured locations is 26 m and 60 m respectively overall they produce the same tsunami arrival time however the wave trough of the leading wave at hong kong is severely influenced by bottom friction the maximum amplitudes of the leading wave are 9 52m 9 16m 8 19m which indicates no bottom friction and n 0 012 generating wave amplitude by 16 and 12 more than results with n 0 024 tsunami wave near sanya has been less affected by the bottom friction as the bottom friction term is of magnitude o u 2 h 4 3 it will take effect in depths of 100 m or less in this case it will become more critical as the depth is less than 50 m in addition run up and inundation process are particularly affected by the roughness the manning coefficient is adopted by 0 024 in this study 4 2 3 tide effect the duration of tsunami events is shorter than the astronomical tide while the pre study has shown that it only needs 2 h for tsunami travelling from manila trench to china coasts therefore the tidal fluctuation process can be omitted in this simulation as the average tidal change varies between 1 5 m and 1 5 m from hainan island to lingding bay it is reasonable for us to investigate the influence of mean high tide 1 5 m and mean low tide 1 5 m on tsunami simulation fig 16 illustrates the tide effect on tsunami propagation in the south china sea fig 16a presents the contours of percentage changes in maximum amplitude between high tide and low tide it can be seen that tide effect is not significant in deep water but play a relatively important role in coasts of guangxi province guangdong province yangtze river estuary hangzhou bay and philippine islands due to different arrival times large difference presents in the southwest of south china sea figs 16b and c describe the surface elevation of time series at hong kong and singapore 104 6e 1 5n computed by different tides the tide effect does not make any difference at hong kong in term of arrival time and maximum amplitude of the leading wave but the tsunami wave arrives 10 min earlier with the high tide than low tide at singapore for its longer propagation distance overall the tide effect has little influence for computation of the arrival time tsunami in the south china sea regions however it should be considered in modelling inundation in coastal region for the probability tsunami hazard assessment ptha method 4 3 tsunami source although dao et al 2009 carried out numerical experiments taking the rupture velocity of 2 km s into account by using the source of megawati et al 2009 the results were uncomprehensive in this study the tsunami source of m w 9 3 of nguyen et al 2014 is adopted and the fault parameters are shown in table 3 it is suggested that the source of manila trench with a fault length of around 1000 km should experience complex rupture process it needs a long time to rupture all over the fault segments in this section several possible rupture scenarios are investigated by the dynamic okada model to provide a deep understanding with the role of kinematic source effect we will give the rupture time to every segment of the source from nguyen et al 2014 based on eq 2 with a rise time of 10 s the direction of rupture propagation and rupture velocity are considered in the computations three possibilities of rupture direction are identified as from north to south n s from south to north s n and from middle to both ends m the rupture velocities are considered as 1 m s 2 m s and 3 km s the rupture time of each segment for the eight scenarios are presented in table 4 4 4 results and discussion fig 17 plots comparisons of the time series of the free surface elevation at measured locations triggered by one static source and eight kinematic sources it is interesting to note that most wave patterns look like similar except for a few minutes of the phase difference however different fault rupture scenarios may induce obvious difference for the wave pattern and amplitude e g zhongsha and kenting table 5 summarizes the earliest arrival time of the tsunamis and their relative differences the instantaneous source will trigger the earliest arriving tsunami for all measured points while the latest tsunami is induced by source with rupture velocity of 1 km s the maximum time delay could be up to 18 min for the case 4 of the slowest fault rupture velocity of 1 km s and rupture from the south segment to the north segment of the fault the duration of the fault rupture process is equal to 923 s for case 4 in tables 5 and 6 the bold numbers show the greatest changes of the arrival time and the taunami amplitude respectively for a location among the different cases in fig 17 and table 6 it is noted that the dynamic rupture process does not affect the wave amplitude too much at some locations like zhanjiang 7 5 4 24 hong kong 5 8 22 and sanya 5 9 5 4 however the rupture process affects the wave amplitude significantly at other locations the difference of the maximum wave amplitude of huangyan and quy nhon is nearly 50 which should be considered in the tsunami warning and hazard assessment for the coastal regions table 6 presents the maximum amplitude induced by static source model and the percentage change case 1 case 4 and case 7 have produced the most differences in tsunami amplitude whose rupture velocities are noted as 1 km s it is concluded that the slowest rupture velocity would produce great difference in maximum amplitude especially at quy nhon 55 5 and huangyan island 45 5 compared with the static model to investigate the source kinematic effect on tsunami propagation in the south china sea fig 18 plots the different of the maximum amplitude on the tsunami propagation between different scenarios and static source model as shown the difference between maximum wave amplitude produced by fault rupture source and instantaneous rupture source are all relatively obvious near the manila trench it is noted that the rupture scenarios with rupture velocity of 1 km s will produce a notable difference of maximum tsunami amplitude in the far field moreover the regions with large difference distribute in the direction of fault rupture propagation and it is validated by the time series of the free surface elevation at measured locations the cases of rupture fault propagating at a constant speed of 1 km from north to south and from south to south will trigger larger wave amplitude in the south part of the south china sea and north region of manila trench respectively the changes of the maximum current velocity on the tsunami propagation between different scenarios and instantaneously rupture model are presented in fig 19 only scenarios with rupture velocity of 1 km s could generate obvious differences which are similar to the characteristics of the difference of maximum amplitude 5 concluding remarks in this article the dynamic okada model implemented in coupled with the nonlinear shallow water equations to study the effect of kinematic source rupture process on tsunami propagation the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and the 2011 japan tohoku tsunami are simulated to validate the numerical model through comparing with measurements the dynamic source model could match better with tsunami observations the numerical results suggest that the longer rupture duration could generate strong kinematic effect of the rupture process of a fault then the kinematic source effects on tsunami waves propagating in the open ocean of uniform depth and from deep sea to continental shelf are studied numerically a long fault with the total length of 1000 km is adopted as the virtual earthquake source the effects of kinematic earthquake rupture process on tsunami amplitude and arrival time is obvious the tsunami amplitude is more significantly affected in deep sea than in continental slope according to the slow rupture velocity of the 2004 indian ocean earthquake we also studied the effects of rupture process tsunami source along manila trench which has a similar rupture length as the 2004 sumatra earthquake numerical results show that the kinematic rupture process not only significantly delays the tsunami arrival time but also affects the amplitude the maximum difference of arrival time can reach 18 min and the relative difference of the maximum amplitude can be up to 55 5 the source rupture effects could generate much more complex difference on actual bathymetry it is demonstrated that the uncertain kinematic process of a long rupture fault on tsunami hazard assessment for the extreme tsunamis significant the mechanism of tsunami wave evolution in the continental slopes and the quantitative description of the uncertain of the kinematic process of fault source of the subduction zone in manila trench and the tide level for tsunami hazard assessment in the south china sea regions will be studied in further work acknowledgements this

22829,this study presents the results of an experimental investigation on the turbulence characteristics of flow over a submerged structure at three different submergence ratio the experiments were performed in a water channel and time series of velocity data were collected by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv the recorded velocity data were analysed in the framework of time averaging and profiles and contours of time averaged velocity components turbulent intensity components and reynolds stresses are presented and discussed at different vertical and horizontal planes this study also addressed the flow separation and reattachment region and the turbulent events associated with burst sweep cycles with decreasing submergence ratio marked variation in diving and lifting nature of the flow is observed at the wake region of the cube that has important implications for local sediment mobility keywords turbulence submerged structure submergence ratio wake 1 introduction study of turbulent flow characteristics over a submerged wall mounted bluff body has been a subject of considerable interest from both biological and engineering perspectives to the researchers the flow around a submerged obstacle is marked by complex three dimensional vortical flow structures large velocity gradients flow separation and recirculation sharma et al 2018 nikora et al 2002 pointed out that the structure and function of biological communities in streams estuaries lakes and seas are largely controlled by the interplay of biological and physical processes such as flow turbulence the turbulence characteristics in the zone influenced by the submerged obstacle are necessary to the understanding of biophysio chemical processes associated with the benthic species in terms of their nutrient uptake migration etc from the engineering perspective understanding of turbulence characteristics around a submerged obstacle will aid in understanding pressure drop across a bluff body frequency of vortex shedding a critical parameter for the design support for the submerged pipelines the sediment transport processes such as grain size sorting particle dispersion and deposition in front of or behind an obstacle among many others regardless of their geometric simplicity a single wall mounted bluff body cube in channel flow creates an extremely complex highly three dimensional and unsteady flow field such type of flow structure is characterized by a flow separation zone followed by turbulent eddies in the recirculation zone in order to understand the flow characteristics over wall mounted cube schofield and logan 1990 studied the flow structure of wall mounted cubes and identified the vortices in the recirculation zone which mobile downstream and then attached with the bed further away from the cube the visualization study by martinuzzi and tropea 1993 over the submerged prismatic obstacles placed in a channel flow shows that arc vortices are generated in the recirculation zone hussein and martinuzzi 1996 performed extensive experimental studies on wall mounted cubic obstacles placed in a fully developed turbulent channel flow at high reynolds number 80 000 their flow patterns show the very complex flow nature in spite of its simple geometry flow structures over a wall mounted hemispherical shape obstacle under varying relative depths h d where h flow depth and d obstacle height ranging from 0 62 to 4 27 was examined by shamloo et al 2001 they observe four different regimes of flow based on the relative submergence ratio of the submerged structure and suggested that h d is the most important variable affecting flow structure in the recirculation zone mirauda et al 2007 investigated the flow structure interaction between a tethered sphere and a free surface flow they observed that with an increase of the water depth corresponds to the increase of the main vortex size sadeque et al 2008 performed an experiment under similar flow condition shamloo et al 2001 over a wall mounted cylinder of equal diameter but different height resulting in different submergence ratio they observed stronger three dimensional flows in the downstream wake of the cylinder due to its submergence wall wake analysis over bed mounted cylinders of different levels of submergence investigated by sadeque et al 2009 revealed that the flows in the region away from the bed are similar and well described by the plane wake equation for a different level of submergence an experimental investigation of flow structures downstream of a circular cylinder and sphere immersed in a free stream flow is performed by ozgoren et al 2011 2013a using qualitative and quantitative flow visualization techniques they observed symmetry flow patterns about the centreline of the cylinder and sphere lacey and rennie 2012 performed extensive experimental studies over a bed mounted cube at three different flow depths the authors presented results mainly focused on the wake region of the submerged cube they observed that relative depths have a potential effect on the wake flow characteristics however the result presented by lacey and rennie 2012 is restricted to three different horizontal planes mirauda et al 2013 investigated experimentally the boundaries influence on the flow field around an oscillating sphere the experiments were performed in an open water channel where the sphere had three different boundary conditions with respect to the flow they observed the formation and evolution of two counter rotating large scale vortices near the body in a similar way to the stationary sphere case flow characteristics around a sphere located over a smooth flat plate were experimentally investigated by ozgoren et al 2013b using particle image velocimetry piv and dye visualization techniques the results of the flow visualization reveal a significant change of the wake structure at different gap ratios for the sphere in addition the time averaged flow patterns yield asymmetric structures downstream of the sphere due to the effect of the boundary layer flow distribution similarly piv and dye visualization techniques were performed around the sphere by doğan et al 2018 to study the flow patterns such as instantaneous and time averaged velocity field streamline topology vortices velocity contours the instantaneous vorticity fields and dye visualization results reveal an unsteady wavy structure of the sphere wake a few of the cited investigations above based on the submergence effect are summarized in table 1 with the most important parameters and compared with the present work in the aforementioned studies the obstacles were either submerged or extended above the free surface notably the recirculating flows are often the prototypical situations such as fish habitat structures wall mounted structures pebble cluster etc rather than beyond recirculating flows also the flow structure in the recirculating zone is more complex than the far wake zone due to the existence of stronger vorticity however limited studies have so far been carried out shamloo et al 2001 sadeque et al 2008 lacey and rennie 2012 to investigate the effect of flow depth on turbulent characteristics over wall mounted bluff body for example shamloo et al 2001 did not give adequate detail to completely comprehend the effect of flow depth on the turbulent structure sadeque et al 2008 studied one flow within each of the four flow regimes based on submergence ratio of the submerged structure thus it was not possible to assess trends in the turbulent wake characteristics as flow depth varied within a given flow regime similarly lacey and rennie 2012 did not provide the mean flow and turbulent characteristic for the entire flow depth therefore a substantial study is needed to comprehend the fundamental hydrodynamic phenomena experimentally over a bed mounted submerged cube at different flow depths the present study is mainly focused on the variation of time averaged velocity intensity and shear stress as a function of flow depth further in this study large flux events have been proposed to explain the bursting phenomena responsible for resistance to motion transport processes turbulence production and hence mixing the analysis clearly indicates the impact of the chosen structures on the dominant reynolds shear stress 2 experimentation 2 1 test channel the experiments were conducted in the fluid mechanics and hydraulic laboratory of the indian institute of engineering science and technology iiest shibpur india a specially designed flat bed open channel flume of dimension 18 3 m long 0 90 m wide and 0 90 m deep was used for the experiments fig 1 water was re circulated into the flume using a vertical turbine pump located outside of its main body from a sump the water flow after discharge from the pump passed through a series of wire meshes placed at the upstream end of the flume to ensure a smooth vortex free uniform flow the discharge into the flume was controlled by a control valve the detailed description of laboratory flume was provided in singh et al 2018 at the measurement section 11 m from the last wire mesh the channel had transparent glass to observe the clear view of the flow a point gauge with an accuracy of 0 1 mm was used to observe the needed flow depths during the experiment during the flow measurements the tailgate was kept open maintaining same bed slope and approach flow depth resulting in exactly the same background flow conditions an artificial wooden cube of sides 0 05 m was fabricated and placed on the channel bottom surface in such a way that centre of the cube location c fig 1 at a distance of 11 m from the last wire mesh all the experiments were performed under uniform flow condition 11 m from the last wire mesh which was confirmed by measured the flow profile within the reach from 9 to 11 m from the last wire mesh cube is considered in the present experiment with the advantage of having just one length scale the cube was machine cut and manually deburred in order to obtain sharp edges 2 2 experimental method three different tests were performed where h flow depth was decreased in 0 05 m for every successive run i e h 0 25 0 20 and 0 15 m these experimental runs correspond to relative depths of h d 5 4 and 3 where d is the cube height eight different measuring locations a b h along the centre line of the flume from upstream to downstream of the cube were selected for the measurements the respective dimensionless distances of the locations were x d 2 1 0 1 1 5 2 3 and 5 where x is the longitudinal distance of the measurement from the centre of the cube and d is the cube height fig 2 it is to be noted here that the experiment data collection was performed from 5d to 15d but for clear representations of the figures only selected eight verticals were used in the present experiments the submergence ratio h d froude number f r u g h and reynolds number re u h ν based on depth averaged velocity u and flow depth h for all the experiment run lies in the range of 3 5 0 22 0 28 and 52 500 87 500 respectively here ν is the kinematic viscosity of water and g is the acceleration due to gravity further the blockage factor based on cross sectional area varied from 0 012 to 0 019 a summary of experimental flow conditions is given in table 2 a three dimensional velocity of the flow at the different stream wise location was measured by a 16 mhz micro acoustic doppler velocimeter adv mounted on the flume the adv is a high precision instrument that measures all three components of the instantaneous velocity the sampling volume is located approximately 5 cm below the transmitter probe the entire probe head must be immersed in water the precise distance depends on the individual probe geometry adv operates using a doppler back scattering technique known as the pulse to pulse coherent doppler technique in this technique the instrument sends two pulses of sound separated by a time lag it then measures the phase of the return signal from each pulse the change in the phase divided by the time between pluses is directly proportional to the velocity of the particles in the water pulse coherent processing is used because it provides the best possible temporal and spatial resolution factory calibration of the adv is specified to be 1 0 of the measured velocity i e an accuracy of 1 cm s is on a measured velocity of 100 cm s the flow velocity was measured at the frequency of 40 hz for a period of 300s for all the selected locations the collected time series of velocity was cleaned by eliminating the signals which have less than 15 db signal to noise ratio and less than 70 low correlation samples this was performed by win adv software resulted in the removal of approximately 2 of all collected raw velocity time series such excluded signals were replaced by data using a cubic polynomial interpolation method raushan et al 2018 large noise effects were eliminated by reducing the probable aliasing effect close to the nyquist frequency 20 hz 3 experimental results and discussion an important condition of the present study was to make sure that the undisturbed upstream velocity and gradient should be approximately identical for each flow depth run fig 3 a shows the undisturbed upstream normalised velocity u ˆ u u in the linear scale against z h and fig 3b in the semi log scale against z k s where k s is the equivalent bed roughness in addition a variation of stream wise normalised turbulent intensity i u σ u u where σ u u 2 0 5 and u is the velocity fluctuations in stream wise direction at the developed zone for the undisturbed flow was also plotted in fig 3c it is observed from fig 3a the undisturbed upstream centreline averaged velocity profiles are approximately similar for each flow depths further it was revealed from fig 3c that the semi logarithmic plot of averaged velocity also good fits with the theoretical curve obtained from eq 1 schlichting 1979 singh et al 2016 1 u ˆ 1 κ ln z h ln 30 h k s 1 κ ln z h b 1 where b 1 1 κ ln 30 h k s κ 0 4 was assumed is the von karman constant and k s is the equivalent bed roughness here u is the shear velocity obtained by extrapolating the shear stress profile to zero bed level while k s value is obtained by fitting the data to eq 1 for each flow conditions similar to singh and debnath 2016 further the variation of normalised turbulent intensity plots for all three submergence ratios are approximately similar throughout the depth and it is also in good agreement with nezu and nakagawa 1993 3 1 time averaged velocities for each experiment run the collected instantaneous velocity data were used to derive mean and turbulence characteristics in the x and z directions at first instantaneous velocity data were time averaged and reynolds decomposition technique was applied the time averaged velocities u w at each measuring point along in x and z directions were computed as follows 2 u 1 n i 1 n u i 3 w 1 n i 1 n w i the profile of mean velocity components u w normalised by shear velocity u and are discussed in this section fig 4 a c represent the normalised stream wise mean velocity u ˆ u u profiles over submerged cube at different selected locations a to g against z d for h d 3 4 and 5 respectively it is observed from fig 4a c that the normalised stream wise mean velocity profiles at all locations demonstrate almost the same pattern similar to standard log law apart from the instant downstream and upstream of the cube at the location b the averaged velocity reduces near the bed compared to undisturbed flow up to z d 0 6 0 4 and 0 3 for h d 3 4 and 5 respectively particularly at z d 1 fig 4c reduction in average velocity of 20 30 is observed in contrast to undisturbed flow at location a the average velocity shows nearly similar to undisturbed flow for all the submergence cases the decrease in flow velocity is significantly higher for lower submergence ratio this result agrees with the result of shamloo et al 2001 over wall mounted hemispheres under varying relative depths sarkar and ratha 2014 also reported a decrease in stream wise mean velocity by 30 for the submergence ratio more than one at location c the stream wise mean velocity is negative for higher submergence ratio the negative velocity disappears with a decrease in relative flow depth further at the top of the cube the average velocity increases with increases in z d due to local constriction imposed by the cube at location d a radical drop in average velocity with considerable recirculation and reversal of flow is evident fig 4 due to the flow parting at the edge of the cube for all the submergence cases further the downstream coverage of the recirculation extent based on negative velocity showed a slight tendency of rising length with decreasing flow depth this inverse relationship between the extent of recirculation length and relative submergence was also confirmed by others sadeque et al 2009 lacey and rennie 2012 in addition the point of inflection at the downstream of the cube is observed approximately at z d 0 75 for all the cases for clear visualization contour plots of normalised stream wise velocity are also presented in fig 5 for all the submergence cases it is clearly observed that the value of the extent of negative velocity is approximately larger for the case of h d 3 compared to h d 4 and 5 the values of the extent of recirculation length observed in the present study are presented in table 3 along with other previous studies maximum negative values of mean velocity u 12 cm s were recorded in the recirculation zone which is approximately similar for all flow depths lacey and rennie 2012 also reported the similar magnitude of u for all the flow depths in the recirculation zone at locations f and g fig 4a c the deviation in the velocity profile show that the effect of the submerged cube is still present however the regions are outside the recirculation zone the normalised time averaged velocity profile gradually becomes fully developed at location h and collapses to the profile of location a the normalised time averaged vertical mean velocities w ˆ w u for the submergence cases 5 4 and 3 are plotted against z d in fig 6 a c at different stream wise locations at location a the vertical velocity profile is zero as usual however at location b the bottom normal mean velocities are observed to increase with vertical height near the boundary and then begin to decrease toward the free surface non zero positive bottom normal velocity profile for all the relative depths is observed at location b and it increases with a decrease in flow depth at locations d to g a negative vertical mean velocity is observed along the downstream direction within the zone x d 3 indicating upward movement of fluid with reducing submergence ratio the upwelling region of bottom normal velocity extends to beyond x d 5 and increases in magnitude this observation is consistent with the result of lacey and rennie 2012 over a submerged cube for clear visualization of the region of negative and positive values of vertical mean velocity at upstream and downstream of the cube contour plots of w ˆ are also presented in fig 7 for all the submergence cases fig 7 reveals that at the upstream of the cube higher value of w ˆ is observed indicating downwelling region of the fluid which is extended with decreasing in flow depth similarly the negative value of w ˆ is dominated in the downstream of the cube for all the submergence cases suggesting upwelling region of the fluid extends with decreasing flow depth 3 2 turbulence intensities in the turbulent flow the root mean square rms velocity components σ u and σ w are defined as follow 4 σ u 1 n i 1 n u i u 2 5 σ w 1 n i 1 n w i w 2 where n is the total number of observations at each measuring point the normalised turbulent intensity in the stream wise and vertical direction is thus defined as i u σ u u and i w σ w u respectively the contour plots of normalised time averaged stream wise turbulent intensity i u for the submergence ratio 5 4 and 3 are plotted against z d in fig 8 it perceived that the nature of stream wise turbulence intensity is nearly indistinguishable throughout the depth except near the bed for all the flow depths in fact as proceed towards the downstream successive increments of stream wise turbulence intensity close to the bed are observed compared to undisturbed flow for all the cases further the values of i u are greatest at z d 0 75 at immediate downstream of the cube with values reaching 8 2 times that of flat surface values which is agree well with the previous studies by ren and wu 2011 lacey and rennie 2012 mazumder and sarkar 2014 the stream wise turbulent intensity reduces near the bed with a reduction in submergence ratio as observed by sadeque et al 2009 however the trend proposed by sadeque et al 2009 is not perceived in the present experiment probably due to geometric variance among the studies as suggested by lacey and rennie 2012 a notable observation from fig 8 is that the i u value does not vary distinctly under the three submergence cases yet delicate change can be detected most remarkably the position of larger i u moves downstream with reducing submergence ratio and simultaneously the significances of i u seem to drop in magnitude the contour plots of normalised time averaged vertical turbulence intensity i w for the submergence ratio 5 4 and 3 are plotted in fig 9 it is to be noted that i w has a similar behaviour as i u yet smaller in magnitude as clearly observed from the contour plots of both the turbulent intensities the vertical turbulence intensity is more significant at wake compared to upstream of the cube and this effect perseveres for a larger distance than that of i u which agrees well with the previous study mazumder and sarkar 2014 the maximum value of i w occurs at the immediate downstream of the cube due to the formation of a shear layer it is also observed from fig 9 that the value of i w is about one half of i u indicating a high degree of anisotropy parthasarathy and muste 1994 further it is to be noted here that the vertical intensity i w value does not differ markedly under the three submergence cases 3 3 reynolds shear stress the time averaged reynolds shear stress components τ u w τ u v and τ v w at each measuring point are obtained as follows 6 τ u w ρ u w ρ 1 n i 1 n u i u w i w 7 τ u v ρ u v ρ 1 n i 1 n u i u v i v 8 τ v w ρ v w ρ 1 n i 1 n v i v w i w where n is the total number of observations at each measuring point and ρ is the density of the fluid the normalised shear stress components are thus defined as follow 9 τ ˆ u w τ u w u 2 τ ˆ u v τ u v u 2 and τ ˆ v w τ v w u 2 the contour of normalised reynolds shear stress τ ˆ u w is plotted against z d in fig 10 for all the relative submergence cases it is observed from fig 10 that the τ ˆ u w is nearly alike throughout the flow compared to the unobstructed profile at upstream and far downstream of the cube for all the relative submergence cases further at the downstream of the cube a clear peak with maximum value reaching τ ˆ u w 12 for h d 3 at z d 0 85 is clearly evident from the contour plot of τ ˆ u w it is to be noted that the maximum τ ˆ u w falls at a distance where reattachment point exists for all the respective submergence cases near the wall of the channel the τ ˆ u w profiles are significantly disturbed and the growth of a shear layer is endorsed by the occurrence of peaks in the transitional region of the separated shear layer and close to the bed approximately at the reattachment point the similar magnitude of high reynolds stress occurs this observation is also confirmed by hajimirzaie et al 2013 for a wall mounted sphere further it is observed that with a decrease in submergence ratio the principle shear stress increases by approximately 40 this increase in principle stress with a decrease in submergence ratio is in line with the observation of lacey and rennie 2012 the contour of other normalised shear stress components i e τ ˆ u v τ u v u 2 and τ ˆ v w τ v w u 2 against z d are plotted in figs 11 and 12 respectively it observed that for all the relative submergence cases the principal stress τ ˆ u w controls the momentum interchange at the downstream of the cube mainly in the wake region compared to τ ˆ u v and τ ˆ v w further close to the cube the value of τ ˆ u v is approximately identical in magnitude as compared to τ ˆ u w suggesting transverse momentum exchange is identical to vertical momentum exchange at recirculation region further downstream of the cube principle shear stress τ ˆ u w remains dominated compared to other shear stresses as expected the τ ˆ v w charges are commonly low at all the selected measurement locations and the magnitude of τ ˆ v w is insignificant in comparison to τ ˆ u v and τ ˆ u w 3 4 quadrant analysis of reynolds shear stress the quadrant analysis of the reynolds shear stress as reported in lu and willmarth 1973 is frequently used to identify the presence of coherent structures in the flow and to quantify their contributions to the reynolds shear stress this method decomposes the reynolds shear stress into four distinct turbulent events based on the signs of the stream wise and bottom normal velocity fluctuations u and w thus the turbulent events are defined by 1 outward interactions q1 i 1 u 0 w 0 occurring when high speed fluid appears far from the wall 2 ejection q2 i 2 u 0 w 0 occurring when low speed fluid moves far from the wall 3 inward interaction q3 i 3 u 0 w 0 occurring when low speed fluid moves toward the wall and 4 sweep q4 i 4 u 0 w 0 events occurring when high speed fluid moves toward the wall are considered at any position in a steady flow the influence of turbulent events on shear stress from quadrant i excluding a hyperbolic hole region h is given by lu and willmarth 1973 singh et al 2015 10 u w i h lim t 1 t 0 t u t w t i i h u t w t d t where t denotes the total number of samples and i i h denotes indicator function given by i i h u t w t 1 if u w is in the ith quadrant and if u w h u w otherwise i i h u t w t 0 if h 0 all the events are considered in the decompositions therefore by definition s 1 0 s 2 0 s 3 0 s 4 0 1 for h 0 where s i 0 where i 1 to 4 indicates the stress fraction given by s i 0 u w i 0 u w in the present study for simplicity the modulus of the stress fraction s i 0 for h 0 is plotted in fig 13 it is observed from fig 13 that at the upstream of the cube events of ejection and sweep contribute more close to the bed towards the production of shear stress compared to outward and inward interaction events further with a decrease in submergence ratio the contribution of ejection and sweep also increases and reaches its maximum value close to the cube z d 0 75 in between ejection and sweep the ejection events q2 dominate over sweep events q4 throughout the water depth thus the tendency of low speed fluid moves away from the boundary is more than the larger speed fluid moving towards the wall directing the prevailing role of ejection to generate turbulent energy at that location the coherent structures are more complex at the recirculation zone due to the large scale stress fluctuations as shown in the contour plot of principle stress at the downstream of the cube all the events have larger amplification near the bed especially for h d 5 and 4 up to the cube height further with increasing height from the bed the amplification in all the events reduces significantly and become similar to those observed for upstream of the cube in the wake region q4 events are the dominating event as a result of the arrival of high speed fluid streaks as an inrush further with decreasing in submergence ratio h d 3 all the four events contribute equally at the top of the cube contour plots fig 13 also display that contributions from q2 and q4 to the shear stress are nearly identical beyond the recirculation region of the cube on the other hand sweep events contribute more to the production of shear stress in the recirculation region compared to other events fig 14 a b shows the ratio of stress fraction i e ejection and sweep plot s 2 0 s 4 0 that contributes more towards the production of reynolds shear stress as observed from quadrant analysis the ratio of ejection to sweep for different submergence ratio is plotted here to verify the locations of the larger contribution of sweeps and ejection towards the production of reynolds shear stress here ratio s 2 0 s 4 0 1 and 1 denotes prominence in sweep and ejection events at particular locations respectively it is clearly observed that at locations d downstream of the cube the ratio of s 2 0 s 4 0 1 for z d 1 h d 5 indicating sweep is more prominent than ejection particularly at location d whereas with decrease in submergence ratio zone of larger sweep events decreases and ejection overshoots the sweep events further at location b and g i e upstream and far downstream of the cube respectively the ejection events dominate by the factor 1 2 near the bed compared to sweep and remains dominating for h d 5 and 4 whereas for h d 3 the changeover from ejection to sweep is observed as the recorded velocity data from adv contain a time series one can easily relate time of the turbulent events at given hole size in this study the average time intervals of all the decompositions are calculated at particular locations for hole size h 0 and plotted in fig 15 for all three submergence cases the data in fig 15a d shows that at location b the mean time intervals for the occurrence of q1 and q3 events more near the bed compared to that of the q2 and q4 events for the entire submergence ratio however towards the surface the occurrence of ejection and sweep events merge with q1 and q3 for h d 3 at location d the occurrence of q1 and q3 events increases at z d 0 6 for h d 5 and thereafter starts decreasing within the region 0 6 z d 1 5 finally merges with the mean time interval of q2 and q4 events similar to location b the decrease in mean time interval of q1 and q3 events within the region 0 6 z d 1 5 is compensated by an increase in q1 and q3 events at corresponding region similar behaviour at the corresponding location for submergence ratio h d 4 is observed with a further decrease in submergence ratio the mean time interval of occurrence of q1 and q3 event is larger throughout the depth compared to q2 and q4 events indicating the frequency of occurrence of ejection and sweep is more throughout the flow depth compared to q1 and q3 events it is also revealed from fig 15 that mean time interval of occurrence of q1 and q3 events are larger compared to q2 and q4 events indicating that the effect of water depth is minimal on the time interval of events 3 5 spectral analysis in the interest to measure the vortex shedding frequency of large scale eddies and maximum energy caring for a particular frequency by the stream wise velocity component the spectral analysis on the velocity time series is presented here to understand the nature of large scale eddies at the interface between the streaming flow near the obstacle and recirculating fluid in the separation zone ozgoren et al 2011 therefore the power spectra of instantaneous velocity components have been calculated at z d 0 5 for all three submergence ratio the calculations have been made using butterworth infinite impulse response with cut off frequency 2 hz to eliminate noise and possible random effects to keep down the noise level each of the time series data was divided into three ensembles with each of the ensemble having 2048 instantaneous velocity data similar to singh and debnath 2017 for a better representation all the ensembles were detrained about their mean individually the power spectra have been evaluated at 0 0195 hz intervals from 0 to 20 hz with a 95 confidence limit in order to estimate the spectral power p f cm2 s 2 as a function of frequency semi log plots has been made against frequency the power spectra of velocity components along the centerline of the cube at different stream wise locations for all three cases are plotted in fig 16 against frequency in semi log scale the area under the spectral curve represents the total variance and the peaks correspond to energetic eddies the maximum spectral power indicates higher degrees of turbulent eddy generation singh et al 2015 further at the location f the peak value of spectral power is less compared to the location d and e of the cube for all three submergence ratio this is probably due to the occurrence of dominant eddies which is large in shapes and size at closer to the cube further it observed that the spectral energy increases with decreasing flow depth which is consistent with the observation of lacey and rennie 2012 a non dimensional frequency parameter known as the strouhal number it has been obtained from the frequency of velocity spectra and is defined as follow 11 s f s h u where h and u is the flow depth and stream wise mean velocity respectively f s is the dominant vortex shedding frequency the dominant vortex shedding frequency f is determined from power spectra of the recorded data in the near wake regions of the cube at z d 0 5 using the mean peak frequencies of vortex shedding f s 0 625 for z d 5 4 and 3 cases the corresponding strouhal numbers are 0 44 0 35 and 0 26 respectively for laboratory studies s is generally found to be in the range of 0 3 0 60 using the water depth as the length scale parameter ikeda and asaeda 1983 the characteristic wavelength of shedding vortices λ d s 11 36 14 28 and 19 23 cm and the speed of shedding vortices c λ f s 7 1 8 9 and 12 01 cm s for z d 5 4 and 3 respectively 4 conclusions in this study adv measurements were executed over a wall mounted submerged cube at three different flow depths this study shows that the change in the relative flow depth has a potential effect on the mean and turbulent bulk statistics at the upstream and downstream of a submerged cube the measured velocity data were analysed within the framework of a time averaging technique and analysis of the results lead to the following findings the stream wise mean velocity is negative for higher submergence ratio at location b and it disappears as the submergence ratio decreases the recirculation zone based on u 0 illustrated a slight inclination of increasing length with decreasing flow depth with decreasing submergence ratio the positive vertical velocity upwelling nature of flow region extends and increases markedly in magnitude close to the cube the location of high turbulent intensity shifted downstream with decreasing flow depth further with decreasing flow depth the principle shear stress increases by approximately 40 which is due to the result of eddy compression as suggested by lacey and rennie 2012 the coherent structures are more complex in the recirculation zone due to the large scale stress fluctuations at the downstream of the cube all the events have larger amplification near the bed especially for h d 5 and 4 up to the cube height with a further decrease in submergence ratio h d 3 all the four events contribute equally at z d 1 downstream of the cube location d the ratio of s 2 0 s 4 0 1 for z d 1 h d 5 indicates that sweep is more prominent than ejection whereas with decrease in submergence ratio zone of larger sweep events decreases and ejection overshoots the sweep events this study could provide a better understanding of turbulence at multiple flow stages if there would be more realistic geometries rather than a cube the experimental results presented herein are beneficial to validate computational models used to simulate such kinds of flow situations acknowledgments the author would like to

22829,this study presents the results of an experimental investigation on the turbulence characteristics of flow over a submerged structure at three different submergence ratio the experiments were performed in a water channel and time series of velocity data were collected by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv the recorded velocity data were analysed in the framework of time averaging and profiles and contours of time averaged velocity components turbulent intensity components and reynolds stresses are presented and discussed at different vertical and horizontal planes this study also addressed the flow separation and reattachment region and the turbulent events associated with burst sweep cycles with decreasing submergence ratio marked variation in diving and lifting nature of the flow is observed at the wake region of the cube that has important implications for local sediment mobility keywords turbulence submerged structure submergence ratio wake 1 introduction study of turbulent flow characteristics over a submerged wall mounted bluff body has been a subject of considerable interest from both biological and engineering perspectives to the researchers the flow around a submerged obstacle is marked by complex three dimensional vortical flow structures large velocity gradients flow separation and recirculation sharma et al 2018 nikora et al 2002 pointed out that the structure and function of biological communities in streams estuaries lakes and seas are largely controlled by the interplay of biological and physical processes such as flow turbulence the turbulence characteristics in the zone influenced by the submerged obstacle are necessary to the understanding of biophysio chemical processes associated with the benthic species in terms of their nutrient uptake migration etc from the engineering perspective understanding of turbulence characteristics around a submerged obstacle will aid in understanding pressure drop across a bluff body frequency of vortex shedding a critical parameter for the design support for the submerged pipelines the sediment transport processes such as grain size sorting particle dispersion and deposition in front of or behind an obstacle among many others regardless of their geometric simplicity a single wall mounted bluff body cube in channel flow creates an extremely complex highly three dimensional and unsteady flow field such type of flow structure is characterized by a flow separation zone followed by turbulent eddies in the recirculation zone in order to understand the flow characteristics over wall mounted cube schofield and logan 1990 studied the flow structure of wall mounted cubes and identified the vortices in the recirculation zone which mobile downstream and then attached with the bed further away from the cube the visualization study by martinuzzi and tropea 1993 over the submerged prismatic obstacles placed in a channel flow shows that arc vortices are generated in the recirculation zone hussein and martinuzzi 1996 performed extensive experimental studies on wall mounted cubic obstacles placed in a fully developed turbulent channel flow at high reynolds number 80 000 their flow patterns show the very complex flow nature in spite of its simple geometry flow structures over a wall mounted hemispherical shape obstacle under varying relative depths h d where h flow depth and d obstacle height ranging from 0 62 to 4 27 was examined by shamloo et al 2001 they observe four different regimes of flow based on the relative submergence ratio of the submerged structure and suggested that h d is the most important variable affecting flow structure in the recirculation zone mirauda et al 2007 investigated the flow structure interaction between a tethered sphere and a free surface flow they observed that with an increase of the water depth corresponds to the increase of the main vortex size sadeque et al 2008 performed an experiment under similar flow condition shamloo et al 2001 over a wall mounted cylinder of equal diameter but different height resulting in different submergence ratio they observed stronger three dimensional flows in the downstream wake of the cylinder due to its submergence wall wake analysis over bed mounted cylinders of different levels of submergence investigated by sadeque et al 2009 revealed that the flows in the region away from the bed are similar and well described by the plane wake equation for a different level of submergence an experimental investigation of flow structures downstream of a circular cylinder and sphere immersed in a free stream flow is performed by ozgoren et al 2011 2013a using qualitative and quantitative flow visualization techniques they observed symmetry flow patterns about the centreline of the cylinder and sphere lacey and rennie 2012 performed extensive experimental studies over a bed mounted cube at three different flow depths the authors presented results mainly focused on the wake region of the submerged cube they observed that relative depths have a potential effect on the wake flow characteristics however the result presented by lacey and rennie 2012 is restricted to three different horizontal planes mirauda et al 2013 investigated experimentally the boundaries influence on the flow field around an oscillating sphere the experiments were performed in an open water channel where the sphere had three different boundary conditions with respect to the flow they observed the formation and evolution of two counter rotating large scale vortices near the body in a similar way to the stationary sphere case flow characteristics around a sphere located over a smooth flat plate were experimentally investigated by ozgoren et al 2013b using particle image velocimetry piv and dye visualization techniques the results of the flow visualization reveal a significant change of the wake structure at different gap ratios for the sphere in addition the time averaged flow patterns yield asymmetric structures downstream of the sphere due to the effect of the boundary layer flow distribution similarly piv and dye visualization techniques were performed around the sphere by doğan et al 2018 to study the flow patterns such as instantaneous and time averaged velocity field streamline topology vortices velocity contours the instantaneous vorticity fields and dye visualization results reveal an unsteady wavy structure of the sphere wake a few of the cited investigations above based on the submergence effect are summarized in table 1 with the most important parameters and compared with the present work in the aforementioned studies the obstacles were either submerged or extended above the free surface notably the recirculating flows are often the prototypical situations such as fish habitat structures wall mounted structures pebble cluster etc rather than beyond recirculating flows also the flow structure in the recirculating zone is more complex than the far wake zone due to the existence of stronger vorticity however limited studies have so far been carried out shamloo et al 2001 sadeque et al 2008 lacey and rennie 2012 to investigate the effect of flow depth on turbulent characteristics over wall mounted bluff body for example shamloo et al 2001 did not give adequate detail to completely comprehend the effect of flow depth on the turbulent structure sadeque et al 2008 studied one flow within each of the four flow regimes based on submergence ratio of the submerged structure thus it was not possible to assess trends in the turbulent wake characteristics as flow depth varied within a given flow regime similarly lacey and rennie 2012 did not provide the mean flow and turbulent characteristic for the entire flow depth therefore a substantial study is needed to comprehend the fundamental hydrodynamic phenomena experimentally over a bed mounted submerged cube at different flow depths the present study is mainly focused on the variation of time averaged velocity intensity and shear stress as a function of flow depth further in this study large flux events have been proposed to explain the bursting phenomena responsible for resistance to motion transport processes turbulence production and hence mixing the analysis clearly indicates the impact of the chosen structures on the dominant reynolds shear stress 2 experimentation 2 1 test channel the experiments were conducted in the fluid mechanics and hydraulic laboratory of the indian institute of engineering science and technology iiest shibpur india a specially designed flat bed open channel flume of dimension 18 3 m long 0 90 m wide and 0 90 m deep was used for the experiments fig 1 water was re circulated into the flume using a vertical turbine pump located outside of its main body from a sump the water flow after discharge from the pump passed through a series of wire meshes placed at the upstream end of the flume to ensure a smooth vortex free uniform flow the discharge into the flume was controlled by a control valve the detailed description of laboratory flume was provided in singh et al 2018 at the measurement section 11 m from the last wire mesh the channel had transparent glass to observe the clear view of the flow a point gauge with an accuracy of 0 1 mm was used to observe the needed flow depths during the experiment during the flow measurements the tailgate was kept open maintaining same bed slope and approach flow depth resulting in exactly the same background flow conditions an artificial wooden cube of sides 0 05 m was fabricated and placed on the channel bottom surface in such a way that centre of the cube location c fig 1 at a distance of 11 m from the last wire mesh all the experiments were performed under uniform flow condition 11 m from the last wire mesh which was confirmed by measured the flow profile within the reach from 9 to 11 m from the last wire mesh cube is considered in the present experiment with the advantage of having just one length scale the cube was machine cut and manually deburred in order to obtain sharp edges 2 2 experimental method three different tests were performed where h flow depth was decreased in 0 05 m for every successive run i e h 0 25 0 20 and 0 15 m these experimental runs correspond to relative depths of h d 5 4 and 3 where d is the cube height eight different measuring locations a b h along the centre line of the flume from upstream to downstream of the cube were selected for the measurements the respective dimensionless distances of the locations were x d 2 1 0 1 1 5 2 3 and 5 where x is the longitudinal distance of the measurement from the centre of the cube and d is the cube height fig 2 it is to be noted here that the experiment data collection was performed from 5d to 15d but for clear representations of the figures only selected eight verticals were used in the present experiments the submergence ratio h d froude number f r u g h and reynolds number re u h ν based on depth averaged velocity u and flow depth h for all the experiment run lies in the range of 3 5 0 22 0 28 and 52 500 87 500 respectively here ν is the kinematic viscosity of water and g is the acceleration due to gravity further the blockage factor based on cross sectional area varied from 0 012 to 0 019 a summary of experimental flow conditions is given in table 2 a three dimensional velocity of the flow at the different stream wise location was measured by a 16 mhz micro acoustic doppler velocimeter adv mounted on the flume the adv is a high precision instrument that measures all three components of the instantaneous velocity the sampling volume is located approximately 5 cm below the transmitter probe the entire probe head must be immersed in water the precise distance depends on the individual probe geometry adv operates using a doppler back scattering technique known as the pulse to pulse coherent doppler technique in this technique the instrument sends two pulses of sound separated by a time lag it then measures the phase of the return signal from each pulse the change in the phase divided by the time between pluses is directly proportional to the velocity of the particles in the water pulse coherent processing is used because it provides the best possible temporal and spatial resolution factory calibration of the adv is specified to be 1 0 of the measured velocity i e an accuracy of 1 cm s is on a measured velocity of 100 cm s the flow velocity was measured at the frequency of 40 hz for a period of 300s for all the selected locations the collected time series of velocity was cleaned by eliminating the signals which have less than 15 db signal to noise ratio and less than 70 low correlation samples this was performed by win adv software resulted in the removal of approximately 2 of all collected raw velocity time series such excluded signals were replaced by data using a cubic polynomial interpolation method raushan et al 2018 large noise effects were eliminated by reducing the probable aliasing effect close to the nyquist frequency 20 hz 3 experimental results and discussion an important condition of the present study was to make sure that the undisturbed upstream velocity and gradient should be approximately identical for each flow depth run fig 3 a shows the undisturbed upstream normalised velocity u ˆ u u in the linear scale against z h and fig 3b in the semi log scale against z k s where k s is the equivalent bed roughness in addition a variation of stream wise normalised turbulent intensity i u σ u u where σ u u 2 0 5 and u is the velocity fluctuations in stream wise direction at the developed zone for the undisturbed flow was also plotted in fig 3c it is observed from fig 3a the undisturbed upstream centreline averaged velocity profiles are approximately similar for each flow depths further it was revealed from fig 3c that the semi logarithmic plot of averaged velocity also good fits with the theoretical curve obtained from eq 1 schlichting 1979 singh et al 2016 1 u ˆ 1 κ ln z h ln 30 h k s 1 κ ln z h b 1 where b 1 1 κ ln 30 h k s κ 0 4 was assumed is the von karman constant and k s is the equivalent bed roughness here u is the shear velocity obtained by extrapolating the shear stress profile to zero bed level while k s value is obtained by fitting the data to eq 1 for each flow conditions similar to singh and debnath 2016 further the variation of normalised turbulent intensity plots for all three submergence ratios are approximately similar throughout the depth and it is also in good agreement with nezu and nakagawa 1993 3 1 time averaged velocities for each experiment run the collected instantaneous velocity data were used to derive mean and turbulence characteristics in the x and z directions at first instantaneous velocity data were time averaged and reynolds decomposition technique was applied the time averaged velocities u w at each measuring point along in x and z directions were computed as follows 2 u 1 n i 1 n u i 3 w 1 n i 1 n w i the profile of mean velocity components u w normalised by shear velocity u and are discussed in this section fig 4 a c represent the normalised stream wise mean velocity u ˆ u u profiles over submerged cube at different selected locations a to g against z d for h d 3 4 and 5 respectively it is observed from fig 4a c that the normalised stream wise mean velocity profiles at all locations demonstrate almost the same pattern similar to standard log law apart from the instant downstream and upstream of the cube at the location b the averaged velocity reduces near the bed compared to undisturbed flow up to z d 0 6 0 4 and 0 3 for h d 3 4 and 5 respectively particularly at z d 1 fig 4c reduction in average velocity of 20 30 is observed in contrast to undisturbed flow at location a the average velocity shows nearly similar to undisturbed flow for all the submergence cases the decrease in flow velocity is significantly higher for lower submergence ratio this result agrees with the result of shamloo et al 2001 over wall mounted hemispheres under varying relative depths sarkar and ratha 2014 also reported a decrease in stream wise mean velocity by 30 for the submergence ratio more than one at location c the stream wise mean velocity is negative for higher submergence ratio the negative velocity disappears with a decrease in relative flow depth further at the top of the cube the average velocity increases with increases in z d due to local constriction imposed by the cube at location d a radical drop in average velocity with considerable recirculation and reversal of flow is evident fig 4 due to the flow parting at the edge of the cube for all the submergence cases further the downstream coverage of the recirculation extent based on negative velocity showed a slight tendency of rising length with decreasing flow depth this inverse relationship between the extent of recirculation length and relative submergence was also confirmed by others sadeque et al 2009 lacey and rennie 2012 in addition the point of inflection at the downstream of the cube is observed approximately at z d 0 75 for all the cases for clear visualization contour plots of normalised stream wise velocity are also presented in fig 5 for all the submergence cases it is clearly observed that the value of the extent of negative velocity is approximately larger for the case of h d 3 compared to h d 4 and 5 the values of the extent of recirculation length observed in the present study are presented in table 3 along with other previous studies maximum negative values of mean velocity u 12 cm s were recorded in the recirculation zone which is approximately similar for all flow depths lacey and rennie 2012 also reported the similar magnitude of u for all the flow depths in the recirculation zone at locations f and g fig 4a c the deviation in the velocity profile show that the effect of the submerged cube is still present however the regions are outside the recirculation zone the normalised time averaged velocity profile gradually becomes fully developed at location h and collapses to the profile of location a the normalised time averaged vertical mean velocities w ˆ w u for the submergence cases 5 4 and 3 are plotted against z d in fig 6 a c at different stream wise locations at location a the vertical velocity profile is zero as usual however at location b the bottom normal mean velocities are observed to increase with vertical height near the boundary and then begin to decrease toward the free surface non zero positive bottom normal velocity profile for all the relative depths is observed at location b and it increases with a decrease in flow depth at locations d to g a negative vertical mean velocity is observed along the downstream direction within the zone x d 3 indicating upward movement of fluid with reducing submergence ratio the upwelling region of bottom normal velocity extends to beyond x d 5 and increases in magnitude this observation is consistent with the result of lacey and rennie 2012 over a submerged cube for clear visualization of the region of negative and positive values of vertical mean velocity at upstream and downstream of the cube contour plots of w ˆ are also presented in fig 7 for all the submergence cases fig 7 reveals that at the upstream of the cube higher value of w ˆ is observed indicating downwelling region of the fluid which is extended with decreasing in flow depth similarly the negative value of w ˆ is dominated in the downstream of the cube for all the submergence cases suggesting upwelling region of the fluid extends with decreasing flow depth 3 2 turbulence intensities in the turbulent flow the root mean square rms velocity components σ u and σ w are defined as follow 4 σ u 1 n i 1 n u i u 2 5 σ w 1 n i 1 n w i w 2 where n is the total number of observations at each measuring point the normalised turbulent intensity in the stream wise and vertical direction is thus defined as i u σ u u and i w σ w u respectively the contour plots of normalised time averaged stream wise turbulent intensity i u for the submergence ratio 5 4 and 3 are plotted against z d in fig 8 it perceived that the nature of stream wise turbulence intensity is nearly indistinguishable throughout the depth except near the bed for all the flow depths in fact as proceed towards the downstream successive increments of stream wise turbulence intensity close to the bed are observed compared to undisturbed flow for all the cases further the values of i u are greatest at z d 0 75 at immediate downstream of the cube with values reaching 8 2 times that of flat surface values which is agree well with the previous studies by ren and wu 2011 lacey and rennie 2012 mazumder and sarkar 2014 the stream wise turbulent intensity reduces near the bed with a reduction in submergence ratio as observed by sadeque et al 2009 however the trend proposed by sadeque et al 2009 is not perceived in the present experiment probably due to geometric variance among the studies as suggested by lacey and rennie 2012 a notable observation from fig 8 is that the i u value does not vary distinctly under the three submergence cases yet delicate change can be detected most remarkably the position of larger i u moves downstream with reducing submergence ratio and simultaneously the significances of i u seem to drop in magnitude the contour plots of normalised time averaged vertical turbulence intensity i w for the submergence ratio 5 4 and 3 are plotted in fig 9 it is to be noted that i w has a similar behaviour as i u yet smaller in magnitude as clearly observed from the contour plots of both the turbulent intensities the vertical turbulence intensity is more significant at wake compared to upstream of the cube and this effect perseveres for a larger distance than that of i u which agrees well with the previous study mazumder and sarkar 2014 the maximum value of i w occurs at the immediate downstream of the cube due to the formation of a shear layer it is also observed from fig 9 that the value of i w is about one half of i u indicating a high degree of anisotropy parthasarathy and muste 1994 further it is to be noted here that the vertical intensity i w value does not differ markedly under the three submergence cases 3 3 reynolds shear stress the time averaged reynolds shear stress components τ u w τ u v and τ v w at each measuring point are obtained as follows 6 τ u w ρ u w ρ 1 n i 1 n u i u w i w 7 τ u v ρ u v ρ 1 n i 1 n u i u v i v 8 τ v w ρ v w ρ 1 n i 1 n v i v w i w where n is the total number of observations at each measuring point and ρ is the density of the fluid the normalised shear stress components are thus defined as follow 9 τ ˆ u w τ u w u 2 τ ˆ u v τ u v u 2 and τ ˆ v w τ v w u 2 the contour of normalised reynolds shear stress τ ˆ u w is plotted against z d in fig 10 for all the relative submergence cases it is observed from fig 10 that the τ ˆ u w is nearly alike throughout the flow compared to the unobstructed profile at upstream and far downstream of the cube for all the relative submergence cases further at the downstream of the cube a clear peak with maximum value reaching τ ˆ u w 12 for h d 3 at z d 0 85 is clearly evident from the contour plot of τ ˆ u w it is to be noted that the maximum τ ˆ u w falls at a distance where reattachment point exists for all the respective submergence cases near the wall of the channel the τ ˆ u w profiles are significantly disturbed and the growth of a shear layer is endorsed by the occurrence of peaks in the transitional region of the separated shear layer and close to the bed approximately at the reattachment point the similar magnitude of high reynolds stress occurs this observation is also confirmed by hajimirzaie et al 2013 for a wall mounted sphere further it is observed that with a decrease in submergence ratio the principle shear stress increases by approximately 40 this increase in principle stress with a decrease in submergence ratio is in line with the observation of lacey and rennie 2012 the contour of other normalised shear stress components i e τ ˆ u v τ u v u 2 and τ ˆ v w τ v w u 2 against z d are plotted in figs 11 and 12 respectively it observed that for all the relative submergence cases the principal stress τ ˆ u w controls the momentum interchange at the downstream of the cube mainly in the wake region compared to τ ˆ u v and τ ˆ v w further close to the cube the value of τ ˆ u v is approximately identical in magnitude as compared to τ ˆ u w suggesting transverse momentum exchange is identical to vertical momentum exchange at recirculation region further downstream of the cube principle shear stress τ ˆ u w remains dominated compared to other shear stresses as expected the τ ˆ v w charges are commonly low at all the selected measurement locations and the magnitude of τ ˆ v w is insignificant in comparison to τ ˆ u v and τ ˆ u w 3 4 quadrant analysis of reynolds shear stress the quadrant analysis of the reynolds shear stress as reported in lu and willmarth 1973 is frequently used to identify the presence of coherent structures in the flow and to quantify their contributions to the reynolds shear stress this method decomposes the reynolds shear stress into four distinct turbulent events based on the signs of the stream wise and bottom normal velocity fluctuations u and w thus the turbulent events are defined by 1 outward interactions q1 i 1 u 0 w 0 occurring when high speed fluid appears far from the wall 2 ejection q2 i 2 u 0 w 0 occurring when low speed fluid moves far from the wall 3 inward interaction q3 i 3 u 0 w 0 occurring when low speed fluid moves toward the wall and 4 sweep q4 i 4 u 0 w 0 events occurring when high speed fluid moves toward the wall are considered at any position in a steady flow the influence of turbulent events on shear stress from quadrant i excluding a hyperbolic hole region h is given by lu and willmarth 1973 singh et al 2015 10 u w i h lim t 1 t 0 t u t w t i i h u t w t d t where t denotes the total number of samples and i i h denotes indicator function given by i i h u t w t 1 if u w is in the ith quadrant and if u w h u w otherwise i i h u t w t 0 if h 0 all the events are considered in the decompositions therefore by definition s 1 0 s 2 0 s 3 0 s 4 0 1 for h 0 where s i 0 where i 1 to 4 indicates the stress fraction given by s i 0 u w i 0 u w in the present study for simplicity the modulus of the stress fraction s i 0 for h 0 is plotted in fig 13 it is observed from fig 13 that at the upstream of the cube events of ejection and sweep contribute more close to the bed towards the production of shear stress compared to outward and inward interaction events further with a decrease in submergence ratio the contribution of ejection and sweep also increases and reaches its maximum value close to the cube z d 0 75 in between ejection and sweep the ejection events q2 dominate over sweep events q4 throughout the water depth thus the tendency of low speed fluid moves away from the boundary is more than the larger speed fluid moving towards the wall directing the prevailing role of ejection to generate turbulent energy at that location the coherent structures are more complex at the recirculation zone due to the large scale stress fluctuations as shown in the contour plot of principle stress at the downstream of the cube all the events have larger amplification near the bed especially for h d 5 and 4 up to the cube height further with increasing height from the bed the amplification in all the events reduces significantly and become similar to those observed for upstream of the cube in the wake region q4 events are the dominating event as a result of the arrival of high speed fluid streaks as an inrush further with decreasing in submergence ratio h d 3 all the four events contribute equally at the top of the cube contour plots fig 13 also display that contributions from q2 and q4 to the shear stress are nearly identical beyond the recirculation region of the cube on the other hand sweep events contribute more to the production of shear stress in the recirculation region compared to other events fig 14 a b shows the ratio of stress fraction i e ejection and sweep plot s 2 0 s 4 0 that contributes more towards the production of reynolds shear stress as observed from quadrant analysis the ratio of ejection to sweep for different submergence ratio is plotted here to verify the locations of the larger contribution of sweeps and ejection towards the production of reynolds shear stress here ratio s 2 0 s 4 0 1 and 1 denotes prominence in sweep and ejection events at particular locations respectively it is clearly observed that at locations d downstream of the cube the ratio of s 2 0 s 4 0 1 for z d 1 h d 5 indicating sweep is more prominent than ejection particularly at location d whereas with decrease in submergence ratio zone of larger sweep events decreases and ejection overshoots the sweep events further at location b and g i e upstream and far downstream of the cube respectively the ejection events dominate by the factor 1 2 near the bed compared to sweep and remains dominating for h d 5 and 4 whereas for h d 3 the changeover from ejection to sweep is observed as the recorded velocity data from adv contain a time series one can easily relate time of the turbulent events at given hole size in this study the average time intervals of all the decompositions are calculated at particular locations for hole size h 0 and plotted in fig 15 for all three submergence cases the data in fig 15a d shows that at location b the mean time intervals for the occurrence of q1 and q3 events more near the bed compared to that of the q2 and q4 events for the entire submergence ratio however towards the surface the occurrence of ejection and sweep events merge with q1 and q3 for h d 3 at location d the occurrence of q1 and q3 events increases at z d 0 6 for h d 5 and thereafter starts decreasing within the region 0 6 z d 1 5 finally merges with the mean time interval of q2 and q4 events similar to location b the decrease in mean time interval of q1 and q3 events within the region 0 6 z d 1 5 is compensated by an increase in q1 and q3 events at corresponding region similar behaviour at the corresponding location for submergence ratio h d 4 is observed with a further decrease in submergence ratio the mean time interval of occurrence of q1 and q3 event is larger throughout the depth compared to q2 and q4 events indicating the frequency of occurrence of ejection and sweep is more throughout the flow depth compared to q1 and q3 events it is also revealed from fig 15 that mean time interval of occurrence of q1 and q3 events are larger compared to q2 and q4 events indicating that the effect of water depth is minimal on the time interval of events 3 5 spectral analysis in the interest to measure the vortex shedding frequency of large scale eddies and maximum energy caring for a particular frequency by the stream wise velocity component the spectral analysis on the velocity time series is presented here to understand the nature of large scale eddies at the interface between the streaming flow near the obstacle and recirculating fluid in the separation zone ozgoren et al 2011 therefore the power spectra of instantaneous velocity components have been calculated at z d 0 5 for all three submergence ratio the calculations have been made using butterworth infinite impulse response with cut off frequency 2 hz to eliminate noise and possible random effects to keep down the noise level each of the time series data was divided into three ensembles with each of the ensemble having 2048 instantaneous velocity data similar to singh and debnath 2017 for a better representation all the ensembles were detrained about their mean individually the power spectra have been evaluated at 0 0195 hz intervals from 0 to 20 hz with a 95 confidence limit in order to estimate the spectral power p f cm2 s 2 as a function of frequency semi log plots has been made against frequency the power spectra of velocity components along the centerline of the cube at different stream wise locations for all three cases are plotted in fig 16 against frequency in semi log scale the area under the spectral curve represents the total variance and the peaks correspond to energetic eddies the maximum spectral power indicates higher degrees of turbulent eddy generation singh et al 2015 further at the location f the peak value of spectral power is less compared to the location d and e of the cube for all three submergence ratio this is probably due to the occurrence of dominant eddies which is large in shapes and size at closer to the cube further it observed that the spectral energy increases with decreasing flow depth which is consistent with the observation of lacey and rennie 2012 a non dimensional frequency parameter known as the strouhal number it has been obtained from the frequency of velocity spectra and is defined as follow 11 s f s h u where h and u is the flow depth and stream wise mean velocity respectively f s is the dominant vortex shedding frequency the dominant vortex shedding frequency f is determined from power spectra of the recorded data in the near wake regions of the cube at z d 0 5 using the mean peak frequencies of vortex shedding f s 0 625 for z d 5 4 and 3 cases the corresponding strouhal numbers are 0 44 0 35 and 0 26 respectively for laboratory studies s is generally found to be in the range of 0 3 0 60 using the water depth as the length scale parameter ikeda and asaeda 1983 the characteristic wavelength of shedding vortices λ d s 11 36 14 28 and 19 23 cm and the speed of shedding vortices c λ f s 7 1 8 9 and 12 01 cm s for z d 5 4 and 3 respectively 4 conclusions in this study adv measurements were executed over a wall mounted submerged cube at three different flow depths this study shows that the change in the relative flow depth has a potential effect on the mean and turbulent bulk statistics at the upstream and downstream of a submerged cube the measured velocity data were analysed within the framework of a time averaging technique and analysis of the results lead to the following findings the stream wise mean velocity is negative for higher submergence ratio at location b and it disappears as the submergence ratio decreases the recirculation zone based on u 0 illustrated a slight inclination of increasing length with decreasing flow depth with decreasing submergence ratio the positive vertical velocity upwelling nature of flow region extends and increases markedly in magnitude close to the cube the location of high turbulent intensity shifted downstream with decreasing flow depth further with decreasing flow depth the principle shear stress increases by approximately 40 which is due to the result of eddy compression as suggested by lacey and rennie 2012 the coherent structures are more complex in the recirculation zone due to the large scale stress fluctuations at the downstream of the cube all the events have larger amplification near the bed especially for h d 5 and 4 up to the cube height with a further decrease in submergence ratio h d 3 all the four events contribute equally at z d 1 downstream of the cube location d the ratio of s 2 0 s 4 0 1 for z d 1 h d 5 indicates that sweep is more prominent than ejection whereas with decrease in submergence ratio zone of larger sweep events decreases and ejection overshoots the sweep events this study could provide a better understanding of turbulence at multiple flow stages if there would be more realistic geometries rather than a cube the experimental results presented herein are beneficial to validate computational models used to simulate such kinds of flow situations acknowledgments the author would like to
