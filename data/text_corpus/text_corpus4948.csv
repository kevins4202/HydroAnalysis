24740,marine organisms are currently experiencing an unprecedented rate of climatic warming which affects their biogeography and threatens marine ecosystem integrity to understand how benthic species will respond to ongoing seawater warming we assessed the relative importance of processes acting at different scales using an individual based modelling approach our model integrates 1 at the individual scale interactions between the environment metabolism and ontogenic transitions 2 at the habitat scale competition for space at settlement and mortality and 3 at the regional scale larval dispersal and connectivity between habitats we focused on a coastal area in the north east atlantic that has experienced a significant seawater warming trend over recent decades we built and ran a population dynamics model for the blue mussel mytilus edulis in this area which is a known biogeographic boundary zone we then compared the response for a reference scenario and a rcp8 5 temperature projection for 2100 we found that 1 increase in seawater temperature would result in a decrease in average biomass associated with a change in recruitment phenology 2 response to seawater warming is not spatially homogeneous showing the importance of processes at the habitat scale 3 connectivity clearly limits the consequences of warming compared with other regulation processes and 4 larval supply does not seem to be a limiting factor regulating population biomass the use of such generic models would therefore be very valuable for guiding and optimizing research efforts and supporting the implementation of management and conservation measures keywords individual based modelling climate scenario connectivity dynamic energy budget mussel habitat biogeography odd 1 introduction in the domain of macroecology process based models are used to predict species invasion rate the effect of environmental changes on species distribution and impact of management measures on species persistence dormann et al 2012 in contrast to the more popular correlative models also known as species distribution models or ecological niche models process based models are built based on explicitly stated mechanisms a priori mathematical formulation and parameters with ecological meaning dormann et al 2012 kearney 2006 even judges that only models considering the mechanistic interactions between organisms and their environments can allow us to assess consequences in terms of fitness and should thus be considered as niche models with this aim in mind kearney et al 2010 highlighted the rationale of several theoretical mechanistic frameworks including dynamic energy budget deb theory deb theory explains how organisms use energy and matter throughout their life cycles it has been widely used to simulate the life cycles of benthic organisms and some recent studies have used it to assess the consequences of climate change for bivalves montalto et al 2016 thomas et al 2016b thomas and bacher 2018 steeve et al 2018 in most studies modelling the response to environmental and climatic conditions consequences are first analysed at the individual level however more properties would more likely emerge by upscaling from individual to population levels thomas and bacher 2018 modelling three bivalve species with temperature scenarios using deb approach we have already shown that these different benthic species would experience significant and contrasting change in population growth potential under the seawater warming conditions expected in the ne atlantic if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase thomas and bacher 2018 we also acknowledged that more realistic models should integrate processes regulating population density spatial interactions e g larval dispersal and competition for space and mortality at all stages of the life cycle e g ageing starvation predation such a modelling framework exists and usually combines individual growth and reproduction larval dispersal through the hydrodynamic forces mortality and competition for space but the coupling amongst all these processes has received only a little attention guizien et al 2014 2012 le goff et al 2017 ménesguen et al 2018 north et al 2010 opaluch et al 2009 puckett and eggleston 2016 most often the dispersion capacity of populations has been studied as a distinct process coscia et al 2013 davies et al 2014 gilg et al 2014 haase et al 2012 hubbard and reidenbach 2015 kim et al 2013 lal et al 2016 laugen et al 2015 nicolle et al 2013 thomas et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 for instance lett et al 2010 stressed the impact of climate on the dispersal and connectivity of marine populations through changes in water circulation earlier spawning of adults shorter durations or the pelagic larval stage reduced exposure of larvae to lethal temperatures shorter larval life and increased larval swimming speed they called for integrated biophysical models including transport growth behaviour mortality and larval settlement in an environment for which both biotic and abiotic aspects are considered since individual traits and interactions between individuals drive the dynamics of populations individual based models ibm are useful tools making it possible to study how system level properties emerge from the behaviour of individuals and how the system affects individuals grimm et al 2006 ibm represent individual organisms as entities that differ from each other and change over their life cycles martin et al 2012a they are characterized by a set of state variables and attributes that change over time and interact with their abiotic environment e g habitat structure or environmental drivers such as temperature and with each other martin et al 2012a the recent work by malishev et al 2018 illustrates how combining deb and ibm modelling frameworks allows individual behavioural strategies to be compared amongst different habitat types in the present study we used an individual based population model of a marine benthic species to explore how interaction processes operating at different spatial scales would likely modulate the response to heat stress associated with global warming at the individual scale the environment i e temperature food inorganic material individual metabolism i e development growth reproduction efficiency and ontogenic transition i e reproductive phenology interactions are formulated within dynamic energy budget theory at the local scale individuals of benthic species compete for space during their settlement phase larval dispersal and the subsequent connectivity between habitats control the expansion of the population at the regional scale of the study area our study focuses on the blue mussel mytilus edulis in a coastal area if the north east atlantic bordering the western english channel iroise sea and bay of biscay to the south this area is known as a biogeographic boundary zone with both boreal cold temperate and warm temperate marine faunal assemblages jolly et al 2004 southward et al 2004 like most marine ecosystems this area has experienced a significant seawater warming trend over recent decades dye et al 2013 l hévéder et al 2017 saulquin and gohin 2010 this warming is expected to continue in coming decades with an annual mean sea surface temperature sst increase of 0 5 c to 2 5 c by the year 2100 depending on the representative concentration pathway rcp scenario l hévéder et al 2017 some consequences of warming have already been identified including warm water species becoming more common hawkins et al 2008 southward et al 2004 projections indicate that the distribution ranges of species are likely to change significantly particularly for benthic species which are unable to escape unfavourable conditions fly et al 2015 hawkins et al 2009 hilbish et al 2012 thomas and bacher 2018 to predict the effect of temperature change with our integrated population model we compared a reference scenario with the rcp8 5 climate scenario and simulated the response of populations at the regional scale of the study area we made a detailed examination of the effect of warming on model endpoints e g biomass size structure phenology we also examined whether local density regulation i e mortality recruitment potential competition for space and connectivity would affect the response to warming 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description the following sections are based on the framework of the overview design concepts and details odd protocol which is a standard way to describe an individual based model ibm that makes writing and reading model descriptions more efficient complete and easier to replicate grimm et al 2010 2 2 1 purpose of the model the purpose of the present model was to evaluate how processes associated with multi scale interactions from sub individual to geographical scales can modify the response of a bivalve species to a climate warming scenario in rocky shore habitats along 700 km of coastline in the ne atlantic the model takes into account metabolic processes at the individual scale through dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 it includes a population dynamics module accounting for the spatial connectivity process between habitats at the regional scale of the study area and a submodel of biotic interactions intraspecific competition for space during the settlement phase at the local scale of habitat patches fig 1 details given in the following sections the model was implemented with an agent based modelling platform netlogo 6 1 0 https ccl northwestern edu netlogo 2 2 2 state variables and scales we applied the model to the population dynamics of a single species the blue mussel mytilus edulis linnaeus 1758 the model simulates two entities habitat patches and cohorts which group individuals fig 2 a regional patch network defines the geographical distribution of potential habitats in the study area each patch is a square space defined by its latitude longitude total area proportion of suitable habitat for the species studied and environmental variables which represent the living conditions of the organisms the model comprises a set of patches along the coasts of brittany france fig 3 a b we used the euseamap broad scale seabed habitat map to locate habitats and define the proportion of suitable habitat within each model patch http www emodnet eu seabed habitats euseamap aims to map benthic habitats of european waters and provides access to detailed mapping of the habitats 250 m spatial resolution habitats are classified on the basis of seabed substrate biological zone and hydrodynamic energy the choice of potential habitats for mussels was based on sectors belonging to the categories infralittoral and rock and other hard substrata for our study patches with potential mussel habitats were considered from the south to the north of brittany fig 3 b all the patches are connected allowing the transport of larvae amongst patches at every spawning event fig s1 b the number of larvae transported will depend on the number of cohorts reproducing their reproductive efficiency and the connectivity level between the emitting and the receiving patches a cohort represents a set of individuals recruited at the same time and consequently with the same life history traits simulated by the deb model see section 3 1 4 submodels a cohort can be thought of as a super individual scheffer et al 1995 living in a patch each patch can contain several cohorts and for a given cohort three state variables are simulated the number of individuals the physical length of these individuals and their reproductive state i e gonado somatic index fecundity secondary variables i e biomass density spatial coverage recruitment etc are computed from these state variables at the scale of the cohort the patch is the spatial unit of the model a 4 4 km2 square corresponding to the spatial element of the hydrodynamic model mars3d lazure and dumas 2008 used to compute connectivity in the present study see section 3 2 the results i e biomass density are considered homogeneous at the scale of the model s patches and expressed in a reference unit of 1 m2 the model proceeds in discrete daily time steps 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling a conceptual scheme of the model s processes is given in figure s2 at each daily time step the individual life history traits growth maturation reproduction of each cohort in a given patch are simulated by the deb model and depend on environmental forcing if the individuals are not mature they remain in the juvenile phase and therefore continue to grow and develop but cannot reproduce a daily mortality rate is applied to integrate all the losses occurring during juvenile and adult phases reproductive phenology depends on environmental conditions and may vary greatly at the regional scale of the study area thus during the adult stage spawning events are triggered when two thresholds are concurrently reached a seawater temperature and a gameto somatic index gsi threshold of 35 gsi is defined as the mass ratio between the gametes and total dry flesh mass since low and high temperatures may inhibit reproduction fearman and moltschaniwskyj 2010 lubet 1959 shpigel et al 1992 lower and higher temperature thresholds inhibiting spawning were also defined tlspw 10 c and thspw 17 c outside of this range individuals continue to grow and to acquire energy for the development of gametes when spawning occurs within a habitat patch the total number of larvae produced is calculated based on the individual fecundity and the number of individuals releasing gametes a mortality rate is then applied to integrate all the losses occurring during the larval phase the connectivity matrix then makes it possible to evaluate the proportion of the larvae produced that will be exported to other patches and the proportion that will remain in the starting patch self recruitment the larval phase is not explicitly simulated spawning and recruitment can occur at the same time step and new recruits all have the same initial properties however for the purposes of modelling individuals recruited within a given temporal window are grouped into a single new cohort see section 3 1 4 2 within each patch receiving larvae if enough space is available we enter into the recruitment process a given number of recruits will settle according to the available space recruitment results in the creation of a new cohort with an initial number of individuals equal to the number of recruits that can settle at each time step the age and the number of individuals in each cohort total number of individuals in a habitat patch and total space occupied in each patch are simultaneously updated and recorded 2 2 4 submodels 2 2 4 1 dynamic energy budget deb dynamic energy budget deb theory offers a quantitative framework i e mass and energy to model metabolic fluxes at the individual scale these fluxes modulate substrate uptake and use and sustain life history trait dynamics growth rate life stage transitions reproductive output and mortality kooijman 2010 the deb model follows the complete life cycle of one individual from the embryo to juvenile and adult stages an individual is defined by four state variables reserves e unit j structure v unit cm3

adult occurs when allocation to reproduction occurs coupled with the cessation of maturation when e h e h p somatic maintenance has priority over growth and maturity maintenance has priority over maturation or reproduction details on deb model equations and parameter values are given in the supplementary materials table s1 and table s2 the individual life history traits extracted from the deb model were the individual physical length l cm total mass w g and fecundity f number of eggs produced we assumed the same parameter values for males and females deb parameters for mussel were derived from the literature saraiva et al 2012 thomas and bacher 2018 table s2 two forcing variables temperature and food density modulate metabolic rates and drive individual growth and reproduction in the deb model when exposed to high concentrations of suspended particulate inorganic matter pim bivalves maximize organic ingestion through pseudo faeces production we therefore introduced pim concentration as a third forcing variable related to the ingestion functional response f 0 1 following kooijman s 2006 conceptualization f x x k 1 y k y where x is the food density y the pim concentration k the half saturation coefficient related to food density and ky the half saturation related to inorganic matter concentration for bivalve species ingestion rate the half saturation coefficient of the functional response is known to change as a function of the food quantity and or quality and species physiological flexibility i e particle selection capacity alunno bruscia et al 2011 in the present study a linear relationship between the mean chl a concentration and the half saturation parameter k was calibrated for mussel in order to take into account feeding adaptation to local conditions see thomas and bacher 2018 for calibration and validation steps performed on several datasets extracted over a wide latitudinal gradient in the deb model seawater temperature acts on metabolic rates following the arrhenius function extended over the species tolerance range based on the idea that metabolic rates are controlled by enzymes that are inactive beyond the optimal

optimal tolerance range and tal and tah the arrhenius temperatures beyond the lower and higher boundaries respectively 2 2 5 recruitment submodel at the local scale of a patch the settlement submodel makes it possible to integrate interactions between new individuals at the time of attachment to the substrate settlement of new recruits is only possible if there is sufficient space if the space is limited only a limited number of individuals settle and recruit while the others die if there is no space there is no settlement and all individuals die the settlement submodel integrates the spatial connectivity which allows the inclusion of spatial interactions between patches the recruitment submodel is based on the work of roughgarden et al 1985 it also incorporates the connectivity process that allows a spatially explicit approach and integration of spatial interactions between habitat patches recruitment therefore involves 1 evaluating the number of larvae produced 2 integrating the connectivity process and 3 integrating small scale spatial interactions intra specific competition for space these processes are defined in the following sections below 2 3 larval production when a spawning event occurs at time t the number of eggs produced in a patch i oi t number of eggs is the cumulative number of eggs produced by the n cohorts o i t c 1 n s r f c i n c i t where sr corresponds to the population sex ratio fci the number of eggs produced by an individual of the cohort c in patch i and nci t the number of individuals within the cohort c in patch i at time t we considered an sr of 50 which corresponds to the mean proportion in natural populations yasuoka and yusa 2016 yusa et al 2013 the produced egg number is then adjusted by a mortality rate m including the overall mortality during the larval phase i e fertilization success fs and daily mortality rate mlarvae associated with the pelagic larval duration pld this rate is assumed to be constant and spatially uniform the total number of potential recruits produced in a patch i at time t li t larvae is l i t o i t m with m f s e m l a r v a e p l d 2 4 spatial connectivity the connectivity process allows the number of larvae coming from a given habitat patch to be quantified these will then be distributed within the connected habitat patches through the larval dispersal process the connectivity matrix synthesizes the rate of connection between every emitting habitat patch and all the others including itself self recruitment the total number of larvae received by a given patch j at time t lj t larvae corresponds to the sum of the larvae produced in the k patches connected with j multiplied by the connectivity rate between j and each of the k patches cij l j t i 1 k l i t c i j where cij is the connectivity rate between patches i and j 2 5 competition for space occupancy of the substrata by sessile organisms can be represented by a 2 d physical area of each individual competition for space occurs at the time of recruitment new recruits will only be able to settle if enough space is available to accommodate them this available area is a function of the occupancy rate by all the individuals already recruited it evolves over time depending on individuals growth and mortality and the arrival of new recruits the physical surface area occupied by an individual b m2 is a function of individual height h cm and width l cm the allometric equation for calculating the individual basal area is written b t h t l t where h t l t α and l t l t β with allometric parameters α and β linking individual height and width to the physical length l alunno bruscia et al 2001 this relation is needed because the deb model only gives the physical length the cumulative surface area occupied by all individuals within a patch i bi m2 is the sum of the space inhabited by all individuals of the n cohorts b i t c 1 n b c i t n c i t where bci t is the individual surface coverage for cohort c in patch i at time t and nci t is the total number of individuals within the cohort c in patch i at time t the available area for recruitment in patch i fi t is then obtained from f i t a i b i t where ai is the habitat area in patch i scaled at 1 m2 finally the number of recruits will depend on the area of habitat needed by a single recruit b0 m2 which then makes it possible to calculate the number of recruits per available surface unit s ind m 2 and to calculate the number q of recruits that can be fixed at time t 1 per unit of space s 1 b 0 q i t 1 s f i t within a habitat patch spawning events occurring at the same time step are considered together to generate a single new cohort per patch thus individuals recruited within a 22 day interval which is the mean pelagic larval duration for mussel sprung 1984 are grouped into a single new cohort changes in population abundance and biomass 2 6 mortality after settlement the number of individuals in a given cohort c and patch i at time t nci t is defined as follow n c i t n c i 0 e m a c i t q c i e m t t c i 0 where qci is the initial number of recruits for a given cohort c in patch i m the daily mortality rate after settlement aci t the age of the cohort c in patch i at time t and tci 0 the time step when the cohort was created in patch i a cohort disappears when its age ac t days reaches the lifespan of the species ad days table s2 in the model lifespan is assumed to be both constant and spatially homogeneous 2 7 mussel biomass cumulative biomass in every patch i at time t biomi t is computed as follows b i o m i t c 1 n n c i t w c i t where wci t is the individual mass for individuals in cohort c of patch i at time t 2 8 input data the deb model is computed using daily time series of water surface temperature sst chlorophyll a concentration chl a and particulate inorganic matter pim concentration daily chl a and pim concentration time series from 2000 to 2014 were obtained from ocean colour remote sensing using merged seawifs modis and meris data processed using a regional algorithm specifically designed for the coastal waters of the bay of biscay gohin et al 2002 saulquin et al 2011 the daily sea surface temperature sst was obtained from remote sensing products from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr over 2000 2008 and from the group for high resolution sea surface temperature ghrsst initiative over 2009 2014 martin et al 2012a 2012b input datasets are imported in netlogo as tables each row corresponding to one time step and each column to a patch time series of the individual functional response and temperatures in every patch for the reference and projection scenarios are given in figure s3a b following the work by thomas and bacher 2018 two temperature scenarios were considered and compared in this study 1 a reference r scenario consisting of current temperature conditions based on the 2000 2015 period following the above description from satellite information and 2 a projection p scenario consisting of predicted thermal conditions at the end of the 21st century based on the 2085 2100 period for the latter we chose the well documented and most severe scenario known as the business as usual representative concentration pathway scenario rcp8 5 i e the rising radiative forcing pathway leading to 8 5 w m 2 by 2100 which assumes that greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise throughout the remainder of the 21st century van vuuren et al 2011 for every location time series of sea surface temperature sst were extracted from the cnrm cm5 climate model outputs from the french national centre for meteorological research s coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 archive https esgf node llnl gov following the nearest neighbour strategy this model demonstrated its ability to correctly simulate the mean present day sst seasonal cycle in the considered area with a higher ocean resolution 1 x 1 and more realistic topography and coastline geometry than other climate models l hévéder et al 2017 sst from the climate model was available with daily frequency there is significant uncertainty in the projections of phytoplankton production by climate models furthermore thomas and bacher 2018 showed that these projections would have a limited effect on population growth performance our projection simulations therefore used the same chl a time series as the reference scenario response of mussel populations along the latitudinal gradient was then studied by comparing the mean biomass per unit area between the two temperature scenarios the connectivity matrix is an array with as many rows as columns corresponding to the number of patches in the model fig 3 c each cell in the table contains a connection rate between a emitting patch column and a receiving patch line the connectivity matrix was derived from simulations performed by a hydrodynamic model mars3d that simulates the evolution of the concentrations of a tracer emitted in each potential habitat mesh square and dispersed over a period of 22 days the emitted particles were considered to be passive with no vertical migration behaviour considered the mesh size of the hydrodynamic model is 4 4 km computing the connectivity matrix for several decades was not possible connectivity simulations were thus performed monthly for a given year to represent the mean conditions encountered over a long period and maintain realistic forcing the year 2005 was chosen after an analysis of wind conditions over 10 years which showed that this year was the closest to the climatology of this area 2 9 initialization at the initial time step one single cohort with 50 ind m 2 is created in every patch all individuals are similar and considered to be at the post metamorphosis stage time series of simulated biomass in every patch are given in figure s3c for the reference and projection scenarios with identification of the spin up and analysed periods a spin up time of three years is long enough for the emergence of a stable pattern of abundance and biomass at the scale of the study area and was applied before analysing the model results over a period of 15 years 2 10 model calibration and performance evaluation a set of data was extracted from the literature table s3 for the calibration of two parameters the post settlement mortality rate m and the number of recruits per available surface unit s fig 4 the median was chosen because of the asymmetrical dispersion of the data model performances were then evaluated with these values with regard to the simulated mussel density space coverage number of recruits 10 months post settlement and mussel size distribution due to the uncertainty associated with these density control parameters we performed a sensitivity analysis on them see next section 2 11 sensitivity analysis a first step in order to evaluate stability and potential edge effects was to assess the effect of the spatial model fit on the results three zoom levels were compared corresponding to three spatial coverages with differences between biomass variations related to temperature scenario computed between each pair of zooms a description of these preliminary results is given in the supplementary material fig s4 fig s5 and associated text and led us to choose one zoom level as the study area for the subsequent analyses a set of sensitivity analyses was then conducted to assess the effect of interaction processes occurring at different spatial scales on the response to the temperature scenarios we tested the effect of the connectivity which represents interactions occurring at the regional scale of the study area and the effect of larval and adult mortality and recruitment potential which are related to processes occurring at the local scale of habitat patches for the connectivity scenarios the results obtained with a reference connectivity scenario i e monthly connectivity pld 22 days were compared with a scenario without connectivity under which there was only self recruitment considered to be average and uniform over the whole area corresponding to the average value of the connectivity matrix diagonal since temperature has the effect of shortening the duration of the pelagic larval phase we tested a connectivity scenario with a pld of 19 days which reduced the dispersal potential and larval mortality finally in order to assess the impact of seasonal variability in connectivity patterns associated with the reproductive phenology i e seasonality of the spawning events we compared the baseline scenario with year averaged connectivity scenarios in each habitat for each pld i e 19 and 22 days for the sensitivity analysis of mortality and recruitment potential we applied factors of 10 and 50 to the mean values of larval mortality m adult daily mortality rate m and number of recruits per unit area s we ran simulations for both temperature scenarios and compared the responses to temperature changes obtained with the modified parameter values with the results obtained with the mean values in every patch and at each time step simulated values were output and stored in the form of csv files for 1 individual life history traits size weight gonado somatic index spawning efficiency for each cohort 2 population structure density per cohort recruitment and 3 habitat cover rates in all patches all these outputs were used to perform post treatment with r software r development core team 2012 3 results 3 1 model performance evaluation our simulated mean densities coverage rates and recruitment observed 10 months after fixation fig 5 a b c are not significantly different from the observations t test p 0 05 the simulated mean size distribution at the patch scale matches the mean size distribution produced by a set of observations fig 5 d the variance measured in the observations is well reproduced by the simulated monthly profiles which show the evolution of mussel sizes distribution over the year as a result of recruitment growth and mortality processes simulated maximum lengths around 8 cm are consistent with observed data although the 4 cm class appears underestimated and the 6 cm class overestimated by the model 3 2 effects of seawater warming conditions under reference temperature conditions simulated biomasses differ along the latitudinal gradient fig 6 a lower biomasses are simulated in southern areas and range from 2425 g m 2 to more than 5150 g m 2 close to patch 110 in the projection scenario the geographical pattern of simulated biomass remains identical to that of the reference scenario with a decrease in absolute values south of patch 125 min max 1805 5070 g m 2 biomasses plotted in temperature food space can be viewed as the realized population niche fig 6 b large differences were simulated along the food gradient with a positive and significant relationship linear regression r2 0 73 p 0 001 accounting for over 110 of variation response across the thermal range appears lower with variations related to warming reaching 27 the mussel size distribution is modified by the seawater warming projection scenario fig 7 abundance of small individuals is significantly lower throughout the study area this difference results in a mean individual length of 3 37 cm in the projection scenario compared with 3 29 cm in the reference scenario this change in size structure is accompanied by a clear change in reproductive phenology fig 8 a total halt in recruitment is simulated during the summer period throughout the study area this phenomenon is associated with the upper temperature threshold applied for reproduction conversely the effect of the lower threshold seems to be noticeable in the northern part of the study area patch 125 with an activation of recruitment during winter which is not observed in the reference scenario the overall average recruitment rate is thus significantly reduced from 9 3 to 8 2 recruits m 2 month 1 between the reference and projection scenarios respectively the patches in the south of the study area appear to be the most heavily penalized by decreased recruitment 3 3 sensitivity analysis 3 3 1 connectivity effect as previously described simulated biomasses with the reference scenario i e current temperature monthly connectivity pld 22 days average mortality and recruitment potential show geographical heterogeneity with lower biomasses in the south of the study area fig 9 biomasses stabilize in the centre of the study area patch id 40 before decreasing again in the north of the area patch id 150 when connectivity between patches is removed and only self recruitment is considered this general pattern of biomass variation is maintained but biomasses are significantly lower average biomass decreases from 4480 620 to 1401 510 g m 2 corresponding to a mean decline of 69 habitats in the south of the area can show biomasses very close to 0 g m 2 min 5 g m 2 beyond the direct effect on biomass the simulations highlight that connectivity also mitigates the effect of the seawater warming scenario if connectivity is removed and there is only self recruitment the decrease in biomass in the projection scenario is enhanced on average there is 22 lower biomass compared with the baseline simulation with monthly connectivity fig 10 b c the other connectivity scenarios show that there is a limited effect of pld and seasonal variation on biomass patterns the three scenarios associated with pld equal to 19 days and year averaged connectivity tend to slightly limit the effect of warming by limiting biomass decline simulations show that the response has a spatial structure with higher sensitivity in the south patches 20 to 60 fig 10 b a possible edge effect appears at the extreme southern end of the study area with results converging between the scenarios with and without connectivity 3 3 2 mortality and recruitment effects whatever the scenario regarding mortality or recruitment potential the response to the projection scenario shows the same pattern with a decrease in simulated biomass in most of the habitats studied fig 11 a d g in a similar way to the reference model monthly connectivity pld 22 days mean mortality and recruitment potential the decrease in biomass is greater in the south of the study area the effect of the mortality and recruitment potential scenarios on response to warming is relatively limited and differences with the reference model do not exceed 6 on average however this modulation is spatially heterogeneous southern habitats are systematically more sensitive and show larger differences from the reference model the modulation is also non symmetrical depending on whether the factor under consideration is increased or decreased increases in larval or post larval mortality and decreases in recruitment potential have a greater effect on response to warming than decreases in these parameters 4 discussion 4 1 results highlights our results confirm the poleward latitudinal shift of a species distribution range resulting from global warming jones and cheung 2015 jones et al 2010 with the rcp8 5 scenario our simulation showed a decrease in biomass ranging from 27 in the south to 0 in the north of the study area under the most realistic modelling conditions we found that this decrease is related to a change in recruitment success and shift in reproduction phenology this confirms previous results on the importance of reproductive phenology in the response of bivalve species to seawater warming thomas et al 2016 thomas and bacher 2018 the consequences of such an evolution are numerous for fishery and aquaculture activities e g reduction in individual growth standing stock biomass and recruitment success but also for the balance of ecosystems e g bentho pelagic coupling biodiversity associated with reef building food web equilibrium our modelling approach is generic and is therefore applicable to many species with a bentho pelagic life cycle this would make it possible to evaluate consequences at the ecosystem scale particularly by assessing the effects on material flows biomasses filtration rates biodeposition etc and food webs impact on biodiversity at the local scale previous studies did not account for the process of connectivity between populations or density regulation processes at the local scale of mussel patches i e competition for space which allow a realistic representation of biomass dynamics in the present work we modelled these processes of regulation and spatialization allowing a relevant representation of population densities and size structures comparable to data available in the literature our results highlight four major findings 1 the temperatures projected by the rcp8 5 climate scenario to 2100 imply a decrease in average biomass and a shift in reproductive phenology 2 the modulation response to temperature change is not spatially homogeneous showing the importance of the processes implemented at the local scale 3 the connectivity process clearly limits the consequences of seawater warming compared to other regulation processes and 4 the larval supply does not seem to be a limiting element and only slightly modulates the response to temperature change we will next examine the assumptions and implications of our results 4 2 importance of local scale processes habitat definition the ecological niche concept locates species in the optimal zone of the environmental space that regulates their biomass by considering temperature and food here modulated by the density of inorganic particles we have shown that the heterogeneity of trophic conditions is a key element that explains a large part of the simulated biomass variability nearly 110 biomass variation was simulated between the most contrasting habitats in our baseline scenario along the trophic gradient compared with a maximum of 27 along the thermal gradient however our approach does not consider the complexity of the thermal conditions that may exist at a small scale this has already been well demonstrated in rocky intertidal habitats notably through the concept of a mosaic of thermal environments helmuth et al 2002 since our study area was not located at the extreme limit of the species range we considered that the temperatures used should reflect average conditions and that the physiological extremes were not reached however this assumption highlights the importance of considering the processes prevailing at a small scale that modulate both physiological performances and biotic interactions here we defined the potential habitat as rocky intertidal areas which were derived from the products of the european emodnet seabed habitats project thomas and bacher 2018 in our model we hypothesized that colonization of this habitat by mussels would take place depending on two conditions i local food concentration must support mussel individual growth and reproduction and ii connectivity between habitats and self recruitment within a given habitat would maintain the recruitment of individuals high enough to compensate for the mortality of new recruits juveniles and adult mussels all our modelled patches match these conditions we also accounted for the competition for space using a simple rule linking space availability to the size and density of mussels already present in a patch simulations showed that all the space was eventually occupied and we found that differences between patches and temporal variability of mussel density merely resulted from growth differences due to local food concentration therefore the predicted mussel density and biomass can be seen as proxies of the actual values and the results interpreted in terms of the relative differences between scenarios more realistic predictions of mussel biomass would require i a better estimation of the area of potential habitat within each patch and ii to determine the local factors that limit the occupation of potential habitat i e realized habitat the spatial resolution of the emodnet layers we used to identify the different type of habitats may be not sufficient to represent coastal intertidal habitats though we do not know of any work addressing this issue spatial resolution is an issue addressed in species distribution modelling and some authors have shown that it has an effect on model performance lowen et al 2016 gomes et al 2018 recently presented the advantages of aerial photography for investigating large scale patterns of mussel distribution in intertidal mud and sand flats they pointed out the lack of studies quantifying mussel distribution on rocky shores and demonstrated how the use of aerial photography with a drone helps us to understand mussel distribution in such habitats through the combination of image analysis and habitat suitability model at a high spatial resolution they mapped the density mean size and reproductive effort of mytilus galloprovincialis along the portuguese rocky intertidal coastline density ranged from 0 to 6500 ind m 2 which compares well with the values we found with our model mussel coverage ratio mussels rocky substrate varied between 0 4 up to 60 depending on location they also found a significant relationship between wave exposure and the density and distribution of mussel populations and argued that wave action forces intertidal organisms to adapt and withstand the dynamics of water motion physical drivers would explain at least partly the distribution of mussel populations and gomes et al 2018 concluded that location specific predictions can be used in metapopulation models considering the effect of physical drivers in addition to the bioenergetics of organisms and the connectivity between patches would therefore improve the quantitative predictions of our models the development of habitat observation tools e g high resolution photogrammetry combined with tools for modelling e g microclimate conditions kearney et al 2020 offer promising prospects in this context choi et al 2019 4 3 the two sides to larval supply larval production and connectivity supply side ecology recognizes that variable larval input is a key factor determining the size of local adult populations hughes et al 2000 however as hughes et al 2000 point out the spatial scale at which adult stocks and recruitment are coupled is unknown for most marine organisms by decoupling these two processes our results highlight the lower effect of larval supply relative to the connectivity potential a variation of 50 in larval mortality which could be associated with a significant decrease in reproductive efficiency modulates the response to the projection scenario by less than 5 compared with the 22 simulated by our self recruitment scenario the comparison between the self recruitment and reference with connectivity scenarios also showed that the response of mussel biomass to temperature change was more sensitive to connectivity than to any other factor we tested fig s6 mussel biomass would also be reduced by 70 if self recruitment was the only process of population renewal our simulations also give an idea of the dispersal capacity and dispersion range of mussel populations additional simulations fig s7 indicate that the southernmost mussel population in this study would need 13 years to reach the most northern set of patches and that mussels never propagate from north to south reflecting the asymmetry in the connectivity matrix and breakpoints associated with environmental conditions limiting sufficient reproductive capacity ayata et al 2010 simulated connectivity in the same region and also showed that the ushant sea which lies between the western english channel and northeast bay of biscay likely acts as a partly permeable one way barrier however there is very little quantitative information on spatial dispersion of mussel propagules and most observations calculations or hypotheses give values between a few kilometres up to 100 km in their modelling of mussel dispersion along the french atlantic coast wethey et al 2011 assumed that the spatial scale of dispersal was 25 km and argued that this value is typical of the dispersal ranges of intertidal species with planktonic larvae in south africa mcquaid and phillips 2000 found that the dispersal radius would maintain 90 of the intertidal mussel mytilus galloprovincialis population within an area of 5 km while the maximum effective dispersal of mussel larvae in this area would be less than 100 km gilg et al 2007 found exchanges of m edulis and m galloprovincialis larvae possible over distances 100 km though barriers to dispersal could occur at some locations for another mussel species model projections made by gilg et al 2014 suggested that dispersal distance could exceed 100 km carsons et al 2010 identified larval source populations of mussels species and found dispersal distances around 35 km these examples show that for intertidal species like mussels hydrodynamics control the spread of populations and should be investigated in more detail following the work of nicolle et al 2017 and ménesguen et al 2018 on other benthic species it would be interesting to extend our calculation to a larger set of patches extending to the north of the english channel and to assess the kernel and barriers to dispersion at a larger spatial scale 4 4 larval behaviour and phase duration we assumed that the pelagic phase duration was spatially homogeneous and constant in a given scenario and that the larvae were transported passively with no swimming behaviour testing the effect of pelagic larval phase duration showed that changes of biomass in response to temperature change were not very sensitive to this parameter we have not found any similar studies addressing the effect of larval swimming on mussel larvae dispersion and metapopulation connectivity other authors made different assumptions depending on the species of interest modelling scope or available information and conclusions on the need for incorporating behaviour do not converge mcquaid and philipps 2000 estimated that passive transport was sufficient to explain the abundances of larvae in their region of interest kim et al 2013 found that physical forcing showed a greater influence on the loss of c virginica larvae than did behaviour but north et al 2008 found that behaviour had significant consequences for dispersal distances transport success and the degree of connectivity between subpopulations hubbard and reidenbach 2015 follow the same line concluding that changes in swimming behaviour due to turbulence influence the probability of settling of c virginica on suitable substrate this apparent contradiction regarding the need or lack thereof to account for larval behaviour can be explained by sources of variability considered and the hypotheses tested in our model we emphasized multiple spawnings within mussel populations due to local differences in individual growth and reproduction emissions of larvae at different times of the year would generate new cohorts of individuals with different life histories and spawning events this cascade effect yields a large variability of life history traits within each population and contributes to the variability of larval transport 5 conclusion the effect of a climate warming scenario currently considered to be the most severe of the projections appears to be strongly modulated by processes occurring at multiple scales at the local scale food availability remains a major factor structuring biomass and neither ontogenic mortality nor recruitment potential seem to strongly modulate the response at the study area scale the connectivity between populations mitigates the consequences of warming by limiting the loss of biomass locally these results are made in a restricted biogeographic transition zone the same approach would merit being established over the entire range of the species to assess whether this observation remains homogeneous the generic nature of the approach developed will also make it possible to compare the response of other species our model is constructed of solid elements based on well established theories and processes it produces results that have demonstrated their realism and robustness to sensitivity analysis we need however to know more about the realized habitat in order to have a more quantitative approach of realized niche connectivity appears to be a determining factor and patterns of population connectivity could be strongly modified by local processes limiting the occupation of potential habitats the next step in the implementation of such a population dynamics modelling approach would be to have a more realistic representation of the realized habitat in order to get as close as possible to the true connectivity sensu watson et al 2010 identifying and prioritizing the processes likely to modulate the multi scale response of species to climate change is a key element in predicting the dynamics of marine ecosystems in a context of increasing pressures such as seawater warming hypoxia events acidification overexploitation pollution etc as biological responses socio economic and administrative aspects are not spatially homogeneous barillé et al 2020 the integration of spatial processes into a spatially explicit modelling sem strategy appears to be the decisive difference from spatially implicit models sims which are more orientated towards theoretical issues deangelis and yurek 2017 the use of such models with a generic approach would make it possible to provide scientific

24740,marine organisms are currently experiencing an unprecedented rate of climatic warming which affects their biogeography and threatens marine ecosystem integrity to understand how benthic species will respond to ongoing seawater warming we assessed the relative importance of processes acting at different scales using an individual based modelling approach our model integrates 1 at the individual scale interactions between the environment metabolism and ontogenic transitions 2 at the habitat scale competition for space at settlement and mortality and 3 at the regional scale larval dispersal and connectivity between habitats we focused on a coastal area in the north east atlantic that has experienced a significant seawater warming trend over recent decades we built and ran a population dynamics model for the blue mussel mytilus edulis in this area which is a known biogeographic boundary zone we then compared the response for a reference scenario and a rcp8 5 temperature projection for 2100 we found that 1 increase in seawater temperature would result in a decrease in average biomass associated with a change in recruitment phenology 2 response to seawater warming is not spatially homogeneous showing the importance of processes at the habitat scale 3 connectivity clearly limits the consequences of warming compared with other regulation processes and 4 larval supply does not seem to be a limiting factor regulating population biomass the use of such generic models would therefore be very valuable for guiding and optimizing research efforts and supporting the implementation of management and conservation measures keywords individual based modelling climate scenario connectivity dynamic energy budget mussel habitat biogeography odd 1 introduction in the domain of macroecology process based models are used to predict species invasion rate the effect of environmental changes on species distribution and impact of management measures on species persistence dormann et al 2012 in contrast to the more popular correlative models also known as species distribution models or ecological niche models process based models are built based on explicitly stated mechanisms a priori mathematical formulation and parameters with ecological meaning dormann et al 2012 kearney 2006 even judges that only models considering the mechanistic interactions between organisms and their environments can allow us to assess consequences in terms of fitness and should thus be considered as niche models with this aim in mind kearney et al 2010 highlighted the rationale of several theoretical mechanistic frameworks including dynamic energy budget deb theory deb theory explains how organisms use energy and matter throughout their life cycles it has been widely used to simulate the life cycles of benthic organisms and some recent studies have used it to assess the consequences of climate change for bivalves montalto et al 2016 thomas et al 2016b thomas and bacher 2018 steeve et al 2018 in most studies modelling the response to environmental and climatic conditions consequences are first analysed at the individual level however more properties would more likely emerge by upscaling from individual to population levels thomas and bacher 2018 modelling three bivalve species with temperature scenarios using deb approach we have already shown that these different benthic species would experience significant and contrasting change in population growth potential under the seawater warming conditions expected in the ne atlantic if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase thomas and bacher 2018 we also acknowledged that more realistic models should integrate processes regulating population density spatial interactions e g larval dispersal and competition for space and mortality at all stages of the life cycle e g ageing starvation predation such a modelling framework exists and usually combines individual growth and reproduction larval dispersal through the hydrodynamic forces mortality and competition for space but the coupling amongst all these processes has received only a little attention guizien et al 2014 2012 le goff et al 2017 ménesguen et al 2018 north et al 2010 opaluch et al 2009 puckett and eggleston 2016 most often the dispersion capacity of populations has been studied as a distinct process coscia et al 2013 davies et al 2014 gilg et al 2014 haase et al 2012 hubbard and reidenbach 2015 kim et al 2013 lal et al 2016 laugen et al 2015 nicolle et al 2013 thomas et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 for instance lett et al 2010 stressed the impact of climate on the dispersal and connectivity of marine populations through changes in water circulation earlier spawning of adults shorter durations or the pelagic larval stage reduced exposure of larvae to lethal temperatures shorter larval life and increased larval swimming speed they called for integrated biophysical models including transport growth behaviour mortality and larval settlement in an environment for which both biotic and abiotic aspects are considered since individual traits and interactions between individuals drive the dynamics of populations individual based models ibm are useful tools making it possible to study how system level properties emerge from the behaviour of individuals and how the system affects

variables and attributes that change over time and interact with their abiotic environment e g habitat structure or environmental drivers such as temperature and with each other martin et al 2012a the recent work by malishev et al 2018 illustrates how combining deb and ibm modelling frameworks allows individual behavioural strategies to be compared amongst different habitat types in the present study we used an individual based population model of a marine benthic species to explore how interaction processes operating at different spatial scales would likely modulate the response to heat stress associated with global warming at the individual scale the environment i e temperature food inorganic material individual metabolism i e development growth reproduction efficiency and ontogenic transition i e reproductive phenology interactions are formulated within dynamic energy budget theory at the local scale individuals of benthic species compete for space during their settlement phase larval dispersal and the subsequent connectivity between habitats control the expansion of the population at the regional scale of the study area our study focuses on the blue mussel mytilus edulis in a coastal area if the north east atlantic bordering the western english channel iroise sea and bay of biscay to the south this area is known as a biogeographic boundary zone with both boreal cold temperate and warm temperate marine faunal assemblages jolly et al 2004 southward et al 2004 like most marine ecosystems this area has experienced a significant seawater warming trend over recent decades dye et al 2013 l hévéder et al 2017 saulquin and gohin 2010 this warming is expected to continue in coming decades with an annual mean sea surface temperature sst increase of 0 5 c to 2 5 c by the year 2100 depending on the representative concentration pathway rcp scenario l hévéder et al 2017 some consequences of warming have already been identified including warm water species becoming more common hawkins et al 2008 southward et al 2004 projections indicate that the distribution ranges of species are likely to change significantly particularly for benthic species which are unable to escape unfavourable conditions fly et al 2015 hawkins et al 2009 hilbish et al 2012 thomas and bacher 2018 to predict the effect of temperature change with our integrated population model we compared a reference scenario with the rcp8 5 climate scenario and simulated the response of populations at the regional scale of the study area we made a detailed examination of the effect of warming on model

individual based model ibm that makes writing and reading model descriptions more efficient complete and easier to replicate grimm et al 2010 2 2 1 purpose of the model the purpose of the present model was to evaluate how processes associated with multi scale interactions from sub individual to geographical scales can modify the response of a bivalve species to a climate warming scenario in rocky shore habitats along 700 km of coastline in the ne atlantic the model takes into account metabolic processes at the individual scale through dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 it includes a population dynamics module accounting for the spatial connectivity process between habitats at the regional scale of the study area and a submodel of biotic interactions intraspecific competition for space during the settlement phase at the local scale of habitat patches fig 1 details given in the following sections the model was implemented with an agent based modelling platform netlogo 6 1 0 https ccl northwestern edu netlogo 2 2 2 state variables and scales we applied the model to the population dynamics of a single species the blue mussel mytilus edulis linnaeus 1758 the model simulates two entities habitat patches and cohorts which group individuals fig 2 a regional patch network defines the geographical distribution of potential habitats in the study area each patch is a square space defined by its latitude longitude total area proportion of suitable habitat for the species studied and environmental variables which represent the living conditions of the organisms the model comprises a set of patches along the coasts of brittany france fig 3 a b we used the euseamap broad scale seabed habitat map to locate habitats and define the proportion of suitable habitat within each model patch http www emodnet eu seabed habitats euseamap aims to map benthic habitats of european waters and provides access to detailed mapping of the habitats 250 m spatial resolution habitats are classified on the basis of seabed substrate biological zone and hydrodynamic energy the choice of potential habitats for mussels was based on sectors belonging to the categories infralittoral and rock and other hard substrata for our study patches with potential mussel habitats were considered from the south to the north of brittany fig 3 b all the patches are connected allowing the transport of larvae amongst patches at every spawning event fig s1 b the number of larvae transported will depend on the number of cohorts reproducing their reproductive efficiency and the connectivity level between the emitting and the receiving patches a cohort represents a set of individuals recruited at the same time and consequently with the same life history traits simulated by the deb model see section 3 1 4 submodels a cohort can be thought of as a super individual scheffer et al 1995 living in a patch each patch can contain several cohorts and for a given cohort three state variables are simulated the number of individuals the physical length of these individuals and their reproductive state i e gonado somatic index fecundity secondary variables i e biomass density spatial coverage recruitment etc are computed from these state variables at the scale of the cohort the patch is the spatial unit of the model a 4 4 km2 square corresponding to the spatial element of the hydrodynamic model mars3d lazure and dumas 2008 used to compute connectivity in the present study see section 3 2 the results i e biomass density are considered homogeneous at the scale of the model s patches and expressed in a reference unit of 1 m2 the model proceeds in discrete daily time steps 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling a conceptual scheme of the model s processes is given in figure s2 at each daily time step the individual life history traits growth maturation reproduction of each cohort in a given patch are simulated by the deb model and depend on environmental forcing if the individuals are not mature they remain in the juvenile phase and therefore continue to grow and develop but cannot reproduce a daily mortality rate is applied to integrate all the losses occurring during juvenile and adult phases reproductive phenology depends on environmental conditions and may vary greatly at the regional scale of the study area thus during the adult stage spawning events are triggered when two thresholds are concurrently reached a seawater temperature and a gameto somatic index gsi threshold of 35 gsi is defined as the mass ratio between the gametes and total dry flesh mass since low and high temperatures may inhibit reproduction fearman and moltschaniwskyj 2010 lubet 1959 shpigel et al 1992 lower and higher temperature thresholds inhibiting spawning were also defined tlspw 10 c and thspw 17 c outside of this range individuals continue to grow and to acquire energy for the development of gametes when spawning occurs within a habitat patch the total number of larvae produced is calculated based on the individual fecundity and the number of individuals releasing gametes a mortality rate is then applied to integrate all the losses occurring during the larval phase the connectivity matrix then makes it possible to evaluate the proportion of the larvae produced that will be exported to other patches and the proportion that will remain in the starting patch self recruitment the larval phase is not explicitly simulated spawning and recruitment can occur at the same time step and new recruits all have the same initial properties however for the purposes of modelling individuals recruited within a given temporal window are grouped into a single new cohort see section 3 1 4 2 within each patch receiving larvae if enough space is available we enter into the recruitment process a given number of recruits will settle according to the available space recruitment results in the creation of a new cohort with an initial number of individuals equal to the number of recruits that can settle at each time step the age and the number of individuals in each cohort total number of individuals in a habitat patch and total space occupied in each patch are simultaneously updated and recorded 2 2 4 submodels 2 2 4 1 dynamic energy budget deb dynamic energy budget deb theory offers a quantitative framework i e mass and energy to model metabolic fluxes at the individual scale these fluxes modulate substrate uptake and use and sustain life history trait dynamics growth rate life stage transitions reproductive output and mortality kooijman 2010

maturation or reproduction details on deb model equations and parameter values are given in the supplementary materials table s1 and table s2 the individual life history traits extracted from the deb

coefficient of the functional response is known to change as a function of the food quantity and or quality and species physiological flexibility i e particle selection capacity alunno bruscia et al 2011 in the present study a linear relationship between the mean chl a concentration and the half saturation parameter k was calibrated for mussel in order to take into account feeding adaptation to local conditions see thomas and bacher 2018 for calibration and validation steps performed on several datasets extracted over a wide latitudinal gradient in the deb model seawater temperature acts on

optimal tolerance range and tal and tah the arrhenius temperatures beyond the lower and higher boundaries respectively 2 2 5 recruitment submodel at the local scale of a patch the settlement submodel makes it possible to integrate interactions between new individuals at the time of attachment to the substrate settlement of new recruits is only possible if there is sufficient space if the space is limited only a limited number of individuals settle and recruit while the others die if there is no space there is no settlement and all individuals die the settlement submodel integrates the spatial connectivity which allows the inclusion of spatial interactions between patches the recruitment submodel is based on the work of roughgarden et al 1985 it also incorporates the connectivity process that allows a spatially explicit approach and integration of spatial interactions between habitat patches recruitment therefore involves 1 evaluating the number of larvae produced 2 integrating the connectivity process and 3 integrating small scale spatial interactions intra specific competition for space these processes are defined in the following sections below 2 3 larval production when a spawning event occurs at time t the number of eggs produced in a patch i oi t number of eggs is the cumulative number of eggs produced by the n cohorts o i t c 1 n s r f c i n c i t where sr corresponds to the population sex ratio fci the number of eggs produced by an individual of the cohort c in patch i and nci t the number of individuals within the cohort c in patch i at time t we considered an sr of 50 which corresponds to the mean proportion in natural populations yasuoka and yusa 2016 yusa et al 2013 the produced egg number is then adjusted by a mortality rate m including the overall mortality during the larval phase i e fertilization success fs and daily mortality rate mlarvae associated with the pelagic larval duration pld this rate is assumed to be constant and spatially uniform the total number of potential recruits produced in a patch i at time t li t larvae is l i t o i t m with m f s e m l a r v a e p l d 2 4 spatial connectivity the connectivity process allows the number of larvae coming from a given habitat patch to be quantified these will then be distributed within the connected habitat patches through the larval dispersal process the connectivity matrix synthesizes the rate of connection between every emitting habitat patch and all the others including itself self recruitment the total number of larvae received by a given patch j at time t lj t larvae corresponds to the sum of the larvae produced in the k patches connected with j multiplied by the connectivity rate between j and each of the k patches cij l j t i 1 k l i t c i j where cij is the connectivity rate between patches i and j 2 5 competition for space occupancy of the substrata by sessile organisms can be represented by a 2 d physical area of each individual competition for space occurs at the time of recruitment new recruits will only be able to settle if enough space is available to accommodate them this available area is a function of the occupancy rate by all the individuals already recruited it evolves over time depending on individuals growth and mortality and the arrival of new recruits the physical surface area occupied by an individual b m2 is a function of individual height h cm and width l cm the allometric equation for calculating the individual basal area is written b t h t l t where h t l t α and l t l t β with allometric parameters α and β linking individual height and width to the physical length l alunno bruscia et al 2001 this relation is needed because the deb model only gives the physical length the cumulative surface area occupied by all individuals within a patch i bi m2 is the sum of the space inhabited by all individuals of the n cohorts b i t c 1 n b c i t n c i t where bci t is the individual surface coverage for cohort c in patch i at time t and nci t is the total number of individuals within the cohort c in patch i at time t the available area for recruitment in patch i fi t is then obtained from f i t a i b i t where ai is the habitat area in patch i scaled at 1 m2 finally the number of recruits will depend on the area of habitat needed by a single recruit b0 m2 which then makes it possible to calculate the number of recruits per available surface unit s ind m 2 and to calculate the number q of recruits that can be fixed at time t 1 per unit of space s 1 b 0 q i t 1 s f i t within a habitat patch spawning events occurring at the same time step are considered together to generate a single new cohort per patch thus individuals recruited within a 22 day interval which is the mean pelagic larval duration for mussel sprung 1984 are grouped into a single new cohort changes in population abundance and biomass 2 6 mortality after settlement the number of individuals in a given cohort c and patch i at time t nci t is defined as follow n c i t n c i 0 e m a c i t q c i e m t t c i 0 where qci is the initial number of recruits for a given cohort c in patch i m the daily mortality rate after

remote sensing using merged seawifs modis and meris data processed using a regional algorithm specifically designed for the coastal waters of the bay of biscay gohin et al 2002 saulquin et al 2011 the daily sea surface temperature sst was obtained from remote sensing products from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr over 2000 2008 and from the group for high resolution sea surface temperature ghrsst initiative over 2009 2014 martin et al 2012a 2012b input datasets are imported in netlogo as tables each row corresponding to one time step and each column to a patch time series of the individual functional response and temperatures in every patch for the reference and projection scenarios are given in figure s3a b following the work by thomas and bacher 2018 two temperature scenarios were considered and compared in this study 1 a reference r scenario consisting of current temperature conditions based on the 2000 2015 period following the above description from satellite information and 2 a projection p scenario consisting of predicted thermal conditions at the end of the 21st century based on the 2085 2100 period for the latter we chose the well documented and most severe scenario known as the business as usual representative concentration pathway scenario rcp8 5 i e the rising radiative forcing pathway leading to 8 5 w m 2 by 2100 which assumes that greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise throughout the remainder of the 21st century van vuuren et al 2011 for every location time series of sea surface temperature sst were extracted from the cnrm cm5 climate model outputs from the french national centre for meteorological research s coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 archive https esgf node llnl gov following the nearest neighbour strategy this model demonstrated its ability to correctly simulate the mean present day sst seasonal cycle in the considered area with a higher ocean resolution 1 x 1 and more realistic topography and coastline geometry than other climate models l hévéder et al 2017 sst from the climate model was available with daily frequency there is significant uncertainty in the projections of phytoplankton production by climate models furthermore thomas and bacher 2018 showed that these projections would have a limited effect on population growth performance our projection simulations therefore used the same chl a time series as the reference scenario response of mussel populations along the latitudinal gradient was then studied by comparing the mean biomass per unit area between the two temperature scenarios the connectivity matrix is an array with as many rows as columns corresponding to the number of patches in the model fig 3 c each cell in the table contains a connection rate between a emitting patch column and a receiving patch line the connectivity matrix was derived from simulations performed by a hydrodynamic model mars3d that simulates the evolution of the concentrations of a tracer emitted in each potential habitat mesh square and dispersed over a period of 22 days the emitted particles were considered to be passive with no vertical migration behaviour considered the mesh size of the hydrodynamic model is 4 4 km computing the connectivity matrix for several decades was not possible connectivity simulations were thus performed monthly for a given year to represent the mean conditions encountered over a long period and maintain realistic forcing the year 2005 was chosen after an analysis of wind conditions over 10 years which showed that this year was the closest to the climatology of this area 2 9 initialization at the initial time step one single cohort with 50 ind m 2 is created in every patch all individuals are similar and considered to be at the post metamorphosis stage time series of simulated biomass in every patch are given in figure s3c for the reference and projection scenarios with identification of the spin up and analysed periods a spin up time of three years is long enough for the emergence of a stable pattern of abundance and biomass at the scale of the study area and was applied before analysing the model results over a period of 15 years 2 10 model calibration and performance evaluation a set of data was extracted from the literature table s3 for the calibration of two parameters the post settlement mortality rate m and the number of recruits per available surface unit s fig 4 the median was chosen because of the asymmetrical dispersion of the data model performances were then evaluated with these values with regard to the simulated mussel density space coverage number of recruits 10 months post settlement and mussel size distribution due to the uncertainty associated with these density control parameters we performed a sensitivity analysis on them see next section 2 11 sensitivity analysis a first step in order to evaluate stability and potential edge effects was to assess the effect of the spatial model fit on the results three zoom levels were compared corresponding to three spatial coverages with differences between biomass variations related to temperature scenario computed between each pair of zooms a description of these preliminary results is given in the supplementary material fig s4 fig s5 and associated text and led us to choose one zoom level as the study area for the subsequent analyses a set of sensitivity analyses was then conducted to assess the effect of interaction processes occurring at different spatial scales on the response to the temperature scenarios we tested the effect of the connectivity which represents interactions occurring at the regional scale of the study area and the effect of larval and adult mortality and recruitment potential which are related to processes occurring at the local scale of habitat patches for the connectivity scenarios the results obtained with a reference connectivity scenario i e monthly connectivity pld 22 days were compared with a scenario without connectivity under which there was only self recruitment considered to be average and uniform over the whole area corresponding to the average value of the connectivity matrix diagonal since temperature has the effect of shortening the duration of the pelagic larval phase we tested a connectivity scenario with a pld of 19 days which reduced the dispersal potential and larval mortality finally in order to assess the impact of seasonal variability in connectivity patterns associated with the reproductive phenology i e seasonality of the spawning events we compared the baseline scenario with year averaged connectivity scenarios in each habitat for each pld i e 19 and 22 days for the sensitivity analysis of mortality and recruitment potential we applied factors of 10 and 50 to the mean values of larval mortality m adult daily mortality rate m and number of recruits per unit area s we ran simulations for both temperature scenarios and compared the responses to temperature changes obtained with the modified parameter values with the results obtained with the mean values in every patch and at each time step simulated values were output and stored in the form of csv files for 1 individual life history traits size weight gonado somatic index spawning efficiency for each cohort 2 population structure density per cohort recruitment and 3 habitat cover rates in all patches all these outputs were used to perform post treatment with r software r development core team 2012 3 results 3 1 model performance evaluation our simulated mean densities coverage rates and recruitment observed 10 months after fixation fig 5 a b c are not significantly different from the observations t test p 0 05 the simulated mean size distribution at the patch scale matches the mean size distribution produced by a set of observations fig 5 d the variance measured in the observations is well reproduced by the simulated monthly profiles which show the evolution of mussel sizes distribution over the year as a result of recruitment growth and mortality processes simulated maximum lengths around 8 cm are consistent with observed data although the 4 cm class appears underestimated and the 6 cm class overestimated by the model 3 2 effects of seawater warming conditions under reference temperature conditions simulated biomasses differ along the latitudinal gradient fig 6 a lower biomasses are simulated in southern areas and range from 2425 g m 2 to more than 5150 g m 2 close to patch 110 in the projection scenario the geographical pattern of simulated biomass remains identical to that of the reference scenario with a decrease in absolute values south of patch 125 min max 1805 5070 g m 2 biomasses plotted in temperature food space can be viewed as the realized population niche fig 6 b large differences were simulated along the food gradient with a positive and significant relationship linear regression r2 0 73 p 0 001 accounting for over 110 of variation response across the thermal range appears lower with variations related to warming reaching 27 the mussel size distribution is modified by the seawater warming projection scenario fig 7 abundance of small individuals is significantly lower throughout the study area this difference results in a mean individual length of 3 37 cm in the projection scenario compared with 3 29 cm in the reference scenario this change in size structure is accompanied by a clear change in reproductive phenology fig 8 a total halt in recruitment is simulated during the summer period throughout the study area this phenomenon is associated with the upper temperature threshold applied for reproduction conversely the effect of the lower threshold seems to be noticeable in the northern part of the study area patch 125 with an activation of recruitment during winter which is not observed in the reference scenario the overall average recruitment rate is thus significantly reduced from 9 3 to 8 2 recruits m 2 month 1 between the reference and projection scenarios respectively the patches in the south of the study area appear to be the most heavily penalized by decreased recruitment 3 3 sensitivity analysis 3 3 1 connectivity effect as previously described simulated biomasses with the reference scenario i e current temperature monthly connectivity pld 22 days average mortality and recruitment potential show geographical heterogeneity with lower biomasses in the south of the study area fig 9 biomasses stabilize in the centre of the study area patch id 40 before decreasing again in the north of the area patch id 150 when connectivity between patches is removed and only self recruitment is considered this general pattern of biomass variation is maintained but biomasses are significantly lower average biomass decreases from 4480 620 to 1401 510 g m 2 corresponding to a mean decline of 69 habitats in the south of the area can show biomasses very close to 0 g m 2 min 5 g m 2 beyond the direct effect on biomass the simulations highlight that connectivity also mitigates the effect of the seawater warming scenario if connectivity is removed and there is only self recruitment the decrease in biomass in the projection scenario is enhanced on average there is 22 lower biomass compared with the baseline simulation with monthly connectivity fig 10 b c the other connectivity scenarios show that there is a limited effect of pld and seasonal variation on biomass patterns the three scenarios associated with pld equal to 19 days and year averaged connectivity tend to slightly limit the effect of warming by limiting biomass decline simulations show that the response has a spatial structure with higher sensitivity in the south patches 20 to 60 fig 10 b a possible edge effect appears at the extreme southern end of the study area with results converging between the scenarios with and without connectivity 3 3 2 mortality and recruitment effects whatever the scenario regarding mortality or recruitment potential the response to the projection scenario shows the same pattern with a decrease in simulated biomass in most of the habitats studied fig 11 a d g in a similar way to the reference model monthly connectivity pld 22 days mean mortality and recruitment potential the decrease in biomass is greater in the south of the study area the effect of the mortality and recruitment potential scenarios on response to warming is relatively limited and differences with the reference model do not exceed 6 on average however this modulation is spatially heterogeneous southern habitats are systematically more sensitive and show larger differences from the reference model the modulation is also non symmetrical depending on whether the factor under consideration is increased or decreased increases in larval or post larval mortality and decreases in recruitment potential have a greater effect on response to warming than decreases in these parameters 4 discussion 4 1 results highlights our results confirm the poleward latitudinal shift of a species distribution range resulting from global warming jones and cheung 2015 jones et al 2010 with the rcp8 5 scenario our simulation showed a decrease in biomass ranging from 27 in the south to 0 in the north of the study area under the most realistic modelling conditions we found that this decrease is related to a change in recruitment success and shift in reproduction phenology this confirms previous results on the importance of reproductive phenology in the response of bivalve species to seawater warming thomas et al 2016 thomas and bacher 2018 the consequences of such an evolution are numerous for fishery and aquaculture activities e g reduction in individual growth standing stock biomass and recruitment success but also for the balance of ecosystems e g bentho pelagic coupling biodiversity associated with reef building food web equilibrium our modelling approach is generic and is therefore applicable to many species with a bentho pelagic life cycle this would make it possible to evaluate consequences at the ecosystem scale particularly by assessing the effects on material flows biomasses filtration rates biodeposition etc and food webs impact on biodiversity at the local scale previous studies did not account for the process of connectivity between populations or density regulation processes at the local scale of mussel patches i e competition for space which allow a realistic representation of biomass dynamics in the present work we modelled these processes of regulation and spatialization allowing a relevant representation of population densities and size structures comparable to data available in the literature our results highlight four major findings 1 the temperatures projected by the rcp8 5 climate scenario to 2100 imply a decrease in average biomass and a shift in reproductive phenology 2 the modulation response to temperature change is not spatially homogeneous showing the importance of the processes implemented at the local scale 3 the connectivity process clearly limits the consequences of seawater warming compared to other regulation processes and 4 the larval supply does not seem to be a limiting element and only slightly modulates the response to temperature change we will next examine the assumptions and implications of our results 4 2 importance of local scale processes habitat definition the ecological niche concept locates species in the optimal zone of the environmental space that regulates their biomass by considering temperature and food here modulated by the density of inorganic particles we have shown that the heterogeneity of trophic conditions is a key element that explains a large part of the simulated biomass variability nearly 110 biomass variation was simulated between the most contrasting habitats in our baseline scenario along the trophic gradient compared with a maximum of 27 along the thermal gradient however our approach does not consider the complexity of the thermal conditions that may exist at a small scale this has already been well demonstrated in rocky intertidal habitats notably through the concept of a mosaic of thermal environments helmuth et al 2002 since our study area was not located at the extreme limit of the species range we considered that the temperatures used should reflect average conditions and that the physiological extremes were not reached however this assumption highlights the importance of considering the processes prevailing at a small scale that modulate both physiological performances and biotic interactions here we defined the potential habitat as rocky intertidal areas which were derived from the products of the european emodnet seabed habitats project thomas and bacher 2018 in our model we hypothesized that colonization of this habitat by mussels would take place depending on two conditions i local food concentration must support mussel individual growth and reproduction and ii connectivity between habitats and self recruitment within a given habitat would maintain the recruitment of individuals high enough to compensate for the mortality of new recruits juveniles and adult mussels all our modelled patches match these conditions we also accounted for the competition for space using a simple rule linking space availability to the size and density of mussels already present in a patch simulations showed that all the space was eventually occupied and we found that differences between patches and temporal variability of mussel density merely resulted from growth differences due to local food concentration therefore the predicted mussel density and biomass can be seen as proxies of the actual values and the results interpreted in terms of the relative differences between scenarios more realistic predictions of mussel biomass would require i a better estimation of the area of potential habitat within each patch and ii to determine the local factors that limit the occupation of potential habitat i e realized habitat the spatial resolution of the emodnet layers we used to identify the different type of habitats may be not sufficient to represent coastal intertidal habitats though we do not know of any work addressing this issue spatial resolution is an issue addressed in species distribution modelling and some authors have shown that it has an effect on model performance lowen et al 2016 gomes et al 2018 recently presented the advantages of aerial photography for investigating large scale patterns of mussel distribution in intertidal mud and sand flats they pointed out the lack of studies quantifying mussel distribution on rocky shores and demonstrated how the use of aerial photography with a drone helps us to understand mussel distribution in such habitats through the combination of image analysis and habitat suitability model at a high spatial resolution they mapped the density mean size and reproductive effort of mytilus galloprovincialis along the portuguese rocky intertidal coastline density ranged from 0 to 6500 ind m 2 which compares well with the values we found with our model mussel coverage ratio mussels rocky substrate varied between 0 4 up to 60 depending on location they also found a significant relationship between wave exposure and the density and distribution of mussel populations and argued that wave action forces intertidal organisms to adapt and withstand the dynamics of water motion physical drivers would explain at least partly the distribution of mussel populations and gomes et al 2018 concluded that location specific predictions can be used in metapopulation models considering the effect of physical drivers in addition to the bioenergetics of organisms and the connectivity between patches would therefore improve the quantitative predictions of our models the development of habitat observation tools e g high resolution photogrammetry combined with tools for modelling e g microclimate conditions kearney et al 2020 offer promising prospects in this context choi et al 2019 4 3 the two sides to larval supply larval production and connectivity supply side ecology recognizes that variable larval input is a key factor determining the size of local adult populations hughes et al 2000 however as hughes et al 2000 point out the spatial scale at which adult stocks and recruitment are coupled is unknown for most marine organisms by decoupling these two processes our results highlight the lower effect of larval supply relative to the connectivity potential a variation of 50 in larval mortality which could be associated with a significant decrease in reproductive efficiency modulates the response to the projection scenario by less than 5 compared with the 22 simulated by our self recruitment scenario the comparison between the self recruitment and reference with connectivity scenarios also showed that the response of mussel biomass to temperature change was more sensitive to connectivity than to any other factor we tested fig s6 mussel biomass would also be reduced by 70 if self recruitment was the only process of population renewal our simulations also give an idea of the dispersal capacity and dispersion range of mussel populations additional simulations fig s7 indicate that the southernmost mussel population in this study would need 13 years to reach the most northern set of patches and that mussels never propagate from north to south reflecting the asymmetry in the connectivity matrix and breakpoints associated with environmental conditions limiting sufficient reproductive capacity ayata et al 2010 simulated connectivity in the same region and also showed that the ushant sea which lies between the western english channel and northeast bay of biscay likely acts as a partly permeable one way barrier however there is very little quantitative information on spatial dispersion of mussel propagules and most observations calculations or hypotheses give values between a few kilometres up to 100 km in their modelling of mussel dispersion along the french atlantic coast wethey et al 2011 assumed that the spatial scale of dispersal was 25 km and argued that this value is typical of the dispersal ranges of intertidal species with planktonic larvae in south africa mcquaid and phillips 2000 found that the dispersal radius would maintain 90 of the intertidal mussel mytilus galloprovincialis population within an area of 5 km while the maximum effective dispersal of mussel larvae in this area would be less than 100 km gilg et al 2007 found exchanges of m edulis and m galloprovincialis larvae possible over distances 100 km though barriers to dispersal could occur at some locations for another mussel species model projections made by gilg et al 2014 suggested that dispersal distance could exceed 100 km carsons et al 2010 identified larval source populations of mussels species and found dispersal distances around 35 km these examples show that for intertidal species like mussels hydrodynamics control the spread of populations and should be investigated in more detail following the work of nicolle et al 2017 and ménesguen et al 2018 on other benthic species it would be interesting to extend our calculation to a larger set of patches extending to the north of the english channel and to assess the kernel and barriers to dispersion at a larger spatial scale 4 4 larval behaviour and phase duration we assumed that the pelagic phase duration was spatially homogeneous and constant in a given scenario and that the larvae were transported passively with no swimming behaviour testing the effect of pelagic larval phase duration showed that changes of biomass in response to temperature change were not very sensitive to this parameter we have not found any similar studies addressing the effect of larval swimming on mussel larvae dispersion and metapopulation connectivity other authors made different assumptions depending on the species of interest modelling scope or available information and conclusions on the need for incorporating behaviour do not converge mcquaid and philipps 2000 estimated that passive transport was sufficient to explain the abundances of larvae in their region of interest kim et al 2013 found that physical forcing showed a greater influence on the loss of c virginica larvae than did behaviour but north et al 2008 found that behaviour had significant consequences for dispersal distances transport success and the degree of connectivity between subpopulations hubbard and reidenbach 2015 follow the same line concluding that changes in swimming behaviour due to turbulence influence the probability of settling of c virginica on suitable substrate this apparent contradiction regarding the need or lack thereof to account for larval behaviour can be explained by sources of variability considered and the hypotheses tested in our model we emphasized multiple spawnings within mussel populations due to local differences in individual growth and reproduction emissions of larvae at different times of the year would generate new cohorts of individuals with different life histories and spawning events this cascade effect yields a large variability of life history traits within each population and contributes to the variability of larval transport 5 conclusion the effect of a climate warming scenario currently considered to be the most severe of the projections appears to be strongly modulated by processes occurring at multiple scales at the local scale food availability remains a major factor structuring biomass and neither ontogenic mortality nor recruitment potential seem to strongly modulate the response at the study area scale the connectivity between populations mitigates the consequences of warming by limiting the loss of biomass locally these results are made in a restricted biogeographic transition zone the same approach would merit being established over the entire range of the species to assess whether this observation remains homogeneous the generic nature of the approach developed will also make it possible to compare the response of other species our model is constructed of solid elements based on well established theories and processes it produces results that have demonstrated their realism and robustness to sensitivity analysis we need however to know more about the realized habitat in order to have a more quantitative approach of realized niche connectivity appears to be a determining factor and patterns of population connectivity could be strongly modified by local processes limiting the occupation of potential habitats the next step in the implementation of such a population dynamics modelling approach would be to have a more realistic representation of the realized habitat in order to get as close as possible to the true connectivity sensu watson et al 2010 identifying and prioritizing the processes likely to modulate the multi scale response of species to climate change is a key element in predicting the dynamics of marine ecosystems in a context of increasing pressures such as seawater warming hypoxia events acidification overexploitation pollution etc as biological responses socio economic and administrative aspects are not spatially homogeneous barillé et al 2020 the integration of spatial processes into a spatially explicit modelling sem strategy appears to be the decisive difference from spatially implicit models sims which are more orientated towards theoretical issues deangelis and yurek 2017 the use of such models with a generic approach would make it possible to provide scientific

24741,hydrology is a critical driver controlling mangrove wetlands structural and functional attributes at different spatial and temporal scales yet human activities have negatively affected hydrology causing mangrove diebacks and coverage loss worldwide in fact the assessment of mangrove water budgets impacted by natural and human disturbances is limited due to a lack of long term data and information that hinders our understanding of how changes in hydroperiod and salinity control mangrove productivity and spatial distribution in this study we implemented a mass balance based hydrological model rhyman that explicitly considers groundwater discharge in the shark river estuary sre southwestern everglades located in a karstic geomorphic setting and influenced by regional hydrological restoration we used long term hydroperiod and porewater salinity pws datasets obtained from 2004 to 2016 for model calibration and validation and to determine spatiotemporal variability in water levels and pws at three riverine mangrove sites downstream srs 6 midstream srs 5 upstream srs 4 along sre model results agree with a distinct pws pattern along the estuarine salinity gradient where the highest pws occurs at srs 6 mean 25 range 22 30 ppt followed by srs 5 17 14 25 ppt and srs 4 5 3 13 ppt a commensurate increase in pws over a thirteen year period indicates a long term reduction in freshwater inflow coupled with sea level rise slr increasing freshwater scenario simulation results show a significant reduction 17 27 in pws along the estuary in contrast with a high slr scenario when salinity increases up to 1 1 to 2 5 times that of control values model results show that freshwater inflow and slr are key drivers controlling mangrove wetlands pws in this karstic

krauss et al 2008 lugo and medina 2014 in coastal wetlands this typical brackish saline condition controls pws as a result of the dynamic water and material exchanges with seawater through tidal cycles among other hydrological processes that define the hydroperiod gradient hence pws is considered as a major driver not only regulating species composition tree height and npp along well defined

of pws on mangrove ecological attributes there is a lack of long term continuous field data to determine pws seasonal and interannual variability particularly in subtropical and arid coastal mangrove wetlands kristensen et al 2017 time and labor consuming field sampling due to the forest structure complexity e g dense prop roots under flooding conditions and hard access to the remote sites along the coastal zone are some of the reasons for this data gap because pws is regulated by the net exchange of salt between mangrove forests and adjacent coastal waters hydrological models are useful analytical tools to examine water budgets that determine seasonal and interannual pws variability in mangroves although existing hydrodynamic models are capable of reproducing water flows in mangrove forests alongi 2009 mazda et al 2005 these models are not able to explicitly predict changes in pws this limitation is associated with the complex interplay among mangrove hydrological conditions groundwater and sea level rise slr dessu et al 2018 nuttle et al 2000 price et al 2006 saha et al 2011 2012 increasing freshwater inflows for example controlled by river and groundwater discharge due

karstic vs deltaic rovai et al 2016 2018 woodroffe 2002 and the relative dominance of groundwater discharge and slr this complex interaction among environmental settings causes uncertainties in the assessment of pws especially when site specific parameterization is constrained by data with limited sampling spatial coverage and frequency although modeling studies have been conducted to evaluate

and salt budgets are calculated on a unit area basis in this study the mangrove adjacent estuarine water column is defined as channel water that is influenced by upstream freshwater inflow tidal exchange and slr the inflow outflow between the mangrove wetland and the channel combines the relative spatiotemporal dominance of tides and freshwater discharge we also assume that surface flow is equivalent to surface sheet flow or runoff four forcing functions are daily channel water level and salinity et and precipitation registered at or close to each study site fig 1 c e table 1 precipitation is considered as the main source of upland water surface flow daily seepage is a site specific constant and represents major outflow along with et rhyman explicitly incorporates two groundwater parameters to evaluate daily groundwater inputs fig 2 fgd the upstream fresh groundwater discharge a term that considers seasonal freshwater inflow variations including controlled upstream restoration freshwater diversions and cgd the coastal groundwater discharge directly affecting pws as seawater volume changes due to slr because the impact of both fgd and cgd in the water budget occurs over the long term these terms are maintained constant during annual simulations in this study the fgd and cgd values were compiled from published studies or estimated via sensitivity analysis table 2 parameter selection for these components included different values depending on the site location and freshwater inflow volume during the study period given the changes in estuarine hydrology during the year all model simulations for srs 6 downstream and srs 5 midstream sites include cgd seasonal values in the case of srs 4 the upstream ecotone site the fgd was explicitly included to reflect different hydrological conditions in different years i e when freshwater inflow influence was high and sea level was low sea level anomaly sla range 2 6 to 1 9 cm 2004 2005 2006 2008 2011

the mean sea level msl in 2011 3 3 cm from the msl values recorded for the rest of the years among the study years when freshwater discharge was recorded msl value in 2011 is minimum table s1 additionally nine parameters are site specific and obtained from most recent field surveys or adapted from hyman twilley and chen 1998 these parameters were classified into two groups topography and hydrology table 2 three topographic parameters i e ground relative surface level bankfull stage edge threshold see definition in table 2 characterize site features given relative elevation settings hydrological parameters controlling water and salt exchange are site specific or adapted from hyman including specific yield for aboveground and underground water salt content exported by channel

main sub routines given the study sites stage differences associated with channel and in situ water level and local topography fig s2 in each sub routine water level salt content and pws were calculated sequentially as influenced by each hydrological component during each specific day as included in eqs 1 and 2 fig s2 the key model results are daily water level and pws during the

compiled data collected at the sh2 station nearby srs 4 fig 1 c from january 2002 to september 2012 south florida information access sofia https sofia usgs gov sea level data for the period of 2002 2016 15 years were obtained from the noaa key west station fig 1 a https www noaa gov to assess pws seasonal and spatial variability as a result of local topography we collected data along a 100 meter transect from the shoreline to the interior of the forest at each site in june wet season and november early dry season 2018 one topography survey was conducted in december 2017 in all study sites to assess the topographic variation from shoreline towards the interior forest 2 4 model calibration and validation we used the average pws and daily mean water level registered in the same day from year 2004 2006 to calibrate rhyman at each site pws was collected in four sampling stations within two 20 20 m plots and located near the water level recorder at each site see study sites section calibration parameters include topographic ground surface level bankfull stage and hydrological parameters table 2 rhyman was validated using pws and water level measured from 2007 to 2016 since channel water level data have large data gaps in some cases the model was validated using data collected in selected years without or with minor missing data 10 the years used for model validations at each site are as follows srs 6 2011 2012 2013 2015 2016 srs 5 2008 2009 2011 2014 2015 2016 and srs 4 2008 2011 2012 2013 and 2015 the water level data collected during tropical storms hurricanes e g hurricane charley in august 2004 and hurricane wilma in october 2005 were excluded and not used for model calibration or validation all site specific parameter values for each year are listed in table s2 2 5 sensitivity analysis we conducted a sensitivity analysis to evaluate model performance we followed the protocol proposed by jørgensen and fath 2011 to calculate sensitivity s of pws and water level to the parameter i where pi is the best estimated value and δpi represents a 25 change from the best estimate model parameters are summarized in table 2 and the equation used for this analysis is listed in appendix c 2 6 simulation scenarios the channel water level and salinity at each station are simultaneously influenced by upstream freshwater discharge and coastal slr given their hydrological importance in regulating pws we firstly assessed two potential scenarios using rhyman high freshwater inflow s1 and high sea level s2 table 3 average freshwater inflow volume along srs table s1 under cerp 2001 2016 is approximately 855 million cubic meters mm3 dessu et al 2018 in 2011 this inflow was below the average volume 466 mm3 meanwhile sl in the same year was also relatively low 3 3 cm sla 0 thus we selected the channel water level and salinity recorded in 2011 as forcing function values for the control scenario s0 simulation channel wl and sal in table 2 in comparison channel water level and salinity recorded in 2005 were selected as the high freshwater inflow scenario s1 1562 mm3 with an average normal mean sea level 3 4 cm sla 0 1 cm data in the year 2015 were considered as the highest sea level scenario s2 12 0 cm sla 8 7 cm with a normal freshwater inflow 440 mm3 to investigate pws response to higher sea level to further explore pws variation under the combined influence of high freshwater discharge and high sea level simultaneously we defined a combination scenario s3 using relatively high freshwater inflow i e 1412 mm3 and high sea level 11 3 cm sla 8 0 cm recorded in 2016 table 3 the combination scenario was only conducted for srs 6 and srs 5 because field channel water level data had a significant data gap for site srs 4 hindering the implementation of this scenario we used precipitation and et recorded in 2011 i e control scenario s0 to perform scenarios s1 s2 and s3 2 7 statistical analysis to evaluate model performance we calculated common statistical measures including model bias coefficient of deternination r2 the root mean squared error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse thomson and emery 2014 wang et al 2012 nse values were estimated for each simulation during calibration 2004 2006 validation 2007 2016 procedures and the full simulation period 2004 2016 information about these statistical values is included in appendix d we conducted two way analyses of variance anova to determine 1 the differences in field water levels among sites downstream midstream and upstream and seasons dry vs wet 2 the interaction between pws values across sites and seasons repeated measures anova and 3 the interaction between methods field observations vs modeling simulation and sites we also conducted a one way anova for scenario s0 s1 s2 s3 simulation results to explore pws differences impacted by changes in freshwater discharge volume and slr at each site the tukey hsd post hoc comparison p 0 05 was performed for all anovas all statistical analyses were performed in jmp pro 15 sas institute cary nc usa 3 results 3 1 field measurements hydroperiod and porewater salinity hydroperiod analysis using long term data 2002 2016 showed distinct seasonal and spatial differences along the sre table s3 duration of inundation was higher during the wet season at srs 6 and srs 4 compared to the dry season while slightly higher during the dry season at srs 5 the difference in seasonal duration was only significant at srs 4 the frequency of inundation in the dry season was higher than in the wet season across all sites table s3 overall annual flooding duration decreased from downstream to upstream locations along the estuary srs 6 223 6 days yr 1 srs 5 206 6 days yr 1 srs 4 185 8 days yr 1 while the annual average frequency of inundation was higher at srs 6 380 16 events yr 1 that in srs 4 214 16 events yr 1 and srs 5 176 30 events yr 1 mangrove pws showed significant spatial interannual and seasonal differences corresponding to seasonal channel water salinity fig s3 table s3 pws decreased from the downstream srs 6 towards the mid srs 5 and upstream srs 4 sites and was higher during dry season table s3 on annual average pws was highest at srs 6 26 84 1 15 ppt followed by srs 5 20 44 1 51 ppt and srs 4 5 64 0 75 ppt fig 3 3 2 modeling porewater salinity and water level simulated annual average pws was higher at srs 6 25 03 0 93 ppt than in srs 5 17 18 1 24 ppt and srs 4 5 27 1 09 ppt and not significantly different when compared to observed values regardless of sites mse 10

he et al 2020 the average pws varied among different simulated years for each site fig s4 showing distinct interannual and seasonal variation at srs 6 the lowest annual average pws observed in 2005 22 20 0 40 ppt was 8 units lower than the highest pws values in 2015 30 22 0 18 ppt the lowest pws at srs 5 occurred in 2008 14 08 0 46 ppt and the highest in 2015 24 55 0 31 ppt in the case of the upstream srs 4 site pws ranged from 2 57 0 16 ppt 2008 to 12 52 0 32 ppt 2015 during the study period overall simulated pws values throughout the period 2004 2016 showed an increasing trend and peaked in 2015 across all sites while slightly declining by 2016 fig s4 annual average daily mean water level estimated using rhyman decreased from downstream srs 6 1 36 0 45 cm to midstream srs 5 6 2 1 38 cm and upstream srs 4 7 93 1 95 cm table 4 reflecting the observed spatial trend in water level along the sre although the simulated water level was a daily value and insufficient to estimate actual inundation duration and frequency inside mangroves the model replicated seasonal variation inside the forest indicating the general lower water level in the dry season compared to the wet season fig s5 3 3 model calibration and validation rhyman model simulations during both calibration and validation periods showed good agreement with observed pws values demonstrating that rhyman is capable of simulating pws dynamics in mangrove forests fig 4 table 5 for model calibration simulated pws values closely matched observed data with a low bias range 1 41 to 0 30 ppt and both high coefficient of deternination r2 0 93 to 0 98 and nse values 0 80 to 0 98 table 5 specifically the bias was lower at srs 6 0 30 ppt followed by srs 4 0 50 ppt and srs 5 1 41 ppt coefficients of determination were highest 0 98 at srs 6 and srs 5 while the coefficient was relatively lower 0 93 at srs 4 nse values estimated for srs 5 and srs 6 were the same 0 98 and higher than that of srs 4 0 80 comparatively the statistical parameters between calibration and validation were different table 5 for model validation the coefficients were higher at srs 5 0 88 and srs 6 0 74 than in srs 4 0 51 whereas nse values were 0 65 srs 6 0 82 srs 5 0 41 srs 4 table 5 just as in the case during the validation calibration procedures simulations for the entire study period 2004 2016 showed good model performance in predicting pws fig 5 table 5 simulated pws showed low bias range 1 96 to 0 86 ppt and both high coefficients of determination 0 64 0 92 and nse values 0 56 0 88 indicating that rhyman is a robust model to simulate pws in riverine mangrove forests along the sre table 5 the linear regression between observed and simulated pws values showed a good agreement at all sites fig 5 a high coefficient of determination was obtained when all paired observed simulated values were used r2 0 94 rmse 2 66 ppt f1 47 749 23 fig 5 rhyman is relatively more efficient and powerful when pws values are estimated for the sites srs 6 and srs 5 where seawater and cgd are dominant over upstream freshwater inflow this was in contrast to the upstream srs 4 site where the significant composite influence of freshwater inflow and cgd resulted in more complex hydrological patterns although statistical analysis of the simulated water level showed high variability regardless of study periods simulated patterns captured the spatial trends and seasonal variations in observed daily mean water level inside the forest which can be attributed to seasonal changes in the adjacent channel water level et and precipitation fig 6 fig s6 table 6 overall in the case of full period 2004 2016 the simulated water level inside the mangrove forests indicated a slight bias range 3 86 to 0 95 cm and negative low nse 0 28 to 0 02 across all sites the coefficient of determination at srs 4 0 57 was fair while the coefficients were poor at srs 5 0 25 and srs 6 0 12 table 6 3 4 sensitivity analysis high absolute sensitivity values indicate that water level is sensitive to topographic parameters i e ground surface and bankfull stage table 7 given the integrative role that local topography plays in controlling hydroperiod inside the mangrove wetlands in contrast pws was not sensitive to any parameter with a 25 change which indicates that changes in pws were less than 25 in these cases pws sensitivity values were generally smaller s 0 10 across all sites the cgd procedure showed that the sensitivity to the parameter i e cgd differences between dry vs wet seasons cgd dry to wet table 2 is relatively higher at srs 5 s 0 13 the sensitivity value of dispersion in the fgd procedure dispersion fgd was 0 2 underscoring its larger influence on model performance than other model parameters table 2 3 5 simulation scenarios the pws values were significantly different among the four simulation scenarios across sites fig 7 table s4 the control scenario s0 showed a similar gradient of annual average pws values across sites compared to field measurements where the higher salinity was registered at the downstream and midstream estuary srs 6 27 18 0 32 ppt srs 5 21 04 0 41 ppt and the lowest values at the upstream site srs 4 4 96 0 27 ppt in the case of the high freshwater discharge scenario s1 when compared to s0 results pws was significantly reduced by 4 50 and 5 64 ppt units at srs 6 and srs 5 respectively while at srs 4 remained approximately the same in both scenarios s0 and s1 4 61 0 25 ppt pws values were high in the high sea level scenario s2 with a significant increase in pws values regardless of site locations the maximum pws increase was at srs 4 7 61 ppt followed by srs 5 3 54 ppt and srs 6 3 02 ppt the mean pws simulated at srs 6 under this combined scenario was significantly lower than the values obtained in the control scenario i e 24 01 0 19 ppt in the case of srs 5 the average simulated pws was 15 39 0 21 ppt under s3 which is approximately same as s1 15 39 0 46 ppt but significantly lower compared to s0 21 04 0 41 and s2 24 57 0 33 scenarios fig 7 table s4 4 discussion 4 1 model performance simulated pws values along the sre using rhyman showed close agreement with historical field measurements fig 5 indicating that this mass balance based modeling approach has strong utility in forecasting pws in riverine mangrove forests under different hydrological scenarios model performance in this study was improved when compared to a previous pws modeling estimation along the sre over the period of 2003 2005 using hyman without explicitly considering groundwater inputs fgd and cgd i e tsai 2008 for instance tsai 2008 showed that simulated pws values at srs 4 during the wet season were 5 7 ppt greater than the observed pws range this result was attributed to salt accumulation in the soil due to low precipitation and high et in late spring and then flushed out in the summer season however when we included the term fgd the simulated pws matched the field observations in the period of 2004 2005 one mechanism explaining this temporal agreement is that increasing upstream freshwater inflow causes a reduction in salinity concentration in both the adjacent channel water and groundwater at srs 4 lagomasino et al 2015 thus the combination of fresher channel water and groundwater inputs decreases pws inside the mangrove forest simultaneously excess freshwater inputs into the soil matrix might also help export or disperse more salt to adjacent estuarine waters through surface flow and seepage the relatively high absolute sensitivity value of dispersion 0 2 indicates the considerable influence of salt dispersion on pws similar to the functional role of the term fgd at upstream estuary locations the inclusion of the parameters defining cgd also improved pws projections in both srs 5 and srs 6 sites when compared to previous estimates i e years 2004 and 2005 tsai 2008 the region close to the estuary mouth e g downstream srs 6 is characterized by a thick peat layer 3 6 m whelan 2005 yao and liu 2015 2017 consequently the local aquifers are relatively deep in downstream srs 6 the relative contributions of groundwater stored in the deep aquifers has a limited effect on net water volume and salinity in the subsurface instead cgd is associated with seawater brackish water intrusion into the mangrove soil as shown by isotope markers in the sre and can potentially alter pws price et al 2003 2006 smith et al 2016 in rhyman cgd represents the subsurface shallow water flow 1 m discharge into the mangrove soil therefore the relatively high agreement between observed and simulated pws values at srs 6 and srs 5 indicates that the cgd would increase pws values as saline water slowly enters the subsurface soil as a result of seawater intrusion driven by sea level rise over the long term fig 5 in contrast as the peat soil layer 1 5 m depth becomes shallower upstream srs 4 groundwater input i e freshwater fgd from the deep aquifer becomes significant smith et al 2016 especially in the context of freshwater diversions as part of the hydrological restoration program upstream the enp national academies of sciences 2016 sklar et al 2005 troxler et al 2013 however even after including the fgd parameters the interaction between fresh and brackish groundwater sources is still complex at srs 4 leading to relatively poor pws simulation compared to the srs 6 and srs 5 sites fig 5 table 5 simulated pws in riverine mangrove forests along sre captured the spatial variation in field measurements with high values in srs 6 and srs 5 and low values in srs 4 during both wet and dry seasons fig s3 table s3 the apparent pws decreasing trend from downstream srs 6 towards mid and upstream srs 5 and srs 4 reflects hydrological processes and their interactions at the regional scale particularly at the two endmember sites downstream srs 6 and upstream srs 4 fig s5 table s3 the emer is delimited by the gulf of mexico coastline and comprises an extensive hydrological network with multiple interconnected estuaries tidal channels castañeda moya et al 2020 rivera monroy et al 2011 for example the site srs 4 is located upstream in tarpon bay at the junction between the shark and harney rivers fig 1 c longer inundation duration in wet season based on field measurements at srs 4 compared to midstream srs 5 shows that water level upstream is influenced by the shark and harney rivers table s3 although the hydrological interaction between these two rivers remains uncertain the compounded hydrological synergy does modulate water budgets and materials exchange in this area as observed by distinct sedimentation patterns during natural disturbances and associated storm surges castañeda moya et al 2020 further this complex hydrological coupling is also evident by the opposite trend in flooding duration at srs 5 longer in the dry season in comparison with srs 6 and srs 4 longer in the wet season in the wet season the relatively high river discharge upstream can potentially offset the downstream tidal flooding regime hence this offset across sites along with seasonal et and precipitation fig s6 may explain the lower duration of inundation at the midstream site srs 5 during the wet season this long term offset captured by rhyman simulations highlights the dynamic hydrological interaction between river discharge and tides at the srs 5 location which is part of a complex network of channels and tidal creeks fig 1 a larsen et al 2012 nuttle et al 2000 in contrast to srs 5 and srs 4 srs 6 hydrological conditions are dominated by strong tidal dynamics due to its proximity to the gulf of mexico fig 1 e that results in higher inundation frequency and water level inside the forest although rhyman does not explicitly include functions representing tidal asymmetries and material exchange water and salt through water movements between the forest and the water column at the mouth of the estuary e g mazda et al 1995 van maanen et al 2015 wu et al 2001 our mass balance approach implicitly capture their effect on pws seasonal variability seasonal variations in simulated pws values were consistent with observations and previous studies fig s4 table s3 castañeda moya et al 2013 chen and twilley 1999 and highlights the critical role of hydroperiod in regulating pws in mangrove forests krauss et al 2006 lara and cohen 2006 for instance although the frequency of inundation is higher during the dry season in srs 4 the average low water depth and shorter inundation duration reduce the interaction between subsurface porewater and surface water during flooding this limited interaction reduces salt exchange between the forest and adjacent estuarine water the high frequency of inundation during the dry season was a composite result of relatively low water depth and shorter flooding duration which underscores the complex attributes of hydroperiod fig s5 friess and watson 2016 rivera monroy et al 2017 additionally seepage is low due to the low crab burrow density in this site smith et al 2016 thus accumulating a greater proportion of salt this composite interaction among variables results in the seasonal salinity or salt legacy which largely influences simulated pws values as rhyman simulations showed in srs 4 during the dry season e g castañeda moya et al 2006 krauss et al 2006 this inclusion of salt legacy considers its influence from the previous time step i e day when calculating the pws in a current simulation day thus improving the agreement between simulated pws and field measurements tsai 2008 this improvement underscores the relative importance of salt legacy in regulating salt balance in the long term especially in cases where mangrove soil is influenced by varying flooding regimes and hydroperiod gradients as in the case of areas with low level topography i e taylor river slough everglades and semi arid coastal regions characterized by micro tides 30 cm sánchez carrillo et al 2009 conversely in areas where crab burrow density is high the soil is less saturated as a result of greater flushing of materials including salt during the dry season this is the case of site srs 6 where burrows are efficiently flushed up to 100 efficiency due to tidal pumping during the dry season smith et al 2016 this mechanism partially explains why our simulated pws values are close to field measurements since the influence of salt legacy at srs 6 in the long term is low compared to srs 4 thus the water exchange interacting with soil properties e g bulk density crab burrows presence at different temporal scales i e tidal and seasonal forcing is critical in regulating not only salt exchange but also nutrient availability i e soil tp and soluble reactive phosphorus po 4 3 and carbon storage in the long term santos et al 2019 tait et al 2016 2017 further studies are needed to quantify this net water exchange in mangrove ecosystems under different geomorphic settings and hydroperiod regimes especially in wetlands influenced by microtidal regimes kristensen et al 2017 smith et al 2016 4 2 considerations concerning rhyman model settings and boundaries as a spatially implicit model rhyman was designed and calibrated using the water level relative to the forest soil surface as a criterion to assess flooding events during tidal exchange to reflect the local topography influence the bankfull stage was explicitly included in the model fig 2 the high sensitivity values of the topographic parameters highlight the importance of capturing the forest elevation gradient when simulating water level in our mangrove sites where topographic relief is significantly different along the estuary table 2 the inclusion for instance of the bankfull stage is critical to adjust the local water level affected by local topographic gradients indeed the observed pws values sampled along a 100 meter transect at each site fig s1 slightly decreased from the channel bank i e the water edge where the channel water level recorder was installed to the forest interior these spatial differences in pws values along the topographical gradient is the outcome of a highly dynamic vertical exchange of water and salt between the soil and the overlying water during flooding conditions at different temporal scales tidal vs seasonal in this case the simulated pws is assumed as the averaged value due to water flows across soil layers with different soil properties e g porosity in our mass balance approach this is one of the reasons why our water level simulation results are different from direct measurements overall the sensitivity analysis showed a robust model performance regarding topography as a controlling variable where pws values were not very sensitive i e 25 to the ground surface level and bankfull stage parameters table 7 nevertheless it is important to carefully select these parameters during the calibration and validation stage in other environmental settings and mangrove ecotypes e g scrub basin especially when using rhyman to evaluate pws at larger spatial scales this step is critical given that the edge threshold is a site specific parameter obtained using regression analysis tsai 2008 specifically the topography inside forests and channel bathymetry are dynamic over a long term due to sediment transport deposition and accumulation associated with tidal exchange or hurricane events castañeda moya et al 2020 feher et al 2019 rhyman defines a boundary condition by using a constant ground surface level twilley and chen 1998 this selection is based on the initial assumption that when the adjacent channel water flows into the forest there is surface water flow that then recharges and maintains a subsurface water level which becomes the boundary condition given the long term field pws data availability at 30 cm depth in our study sites it was adequate to use the ground surface level boundary at 35 cm our model does not explicitly include the channel water column lateral pressure this lateral pressure as related to darcy s law mazda and ikeda 2006 still can influence groundwater level through subsurface flow especially in cases where soil porosity is high due to crab burrows as is the case in our study sites larsen et al 2011 smith et al 2016 although we considered seepage outflow which contains the partial influence of lateral pressure the performance of rhyman model was limited when simulating water level inside the forest the observed lowest water level was approximately 20 40 cm belowground indicating that the boundary water level is maintained probably belowground within this range fig 6 to improve water level simulations inside the forest further field surveys are needed to evaluate this key boundary value currently included in rhyman we also attribute the difference between observed and simulated water level values as indicated by the negative nse value to the fact that rhyman simulates a daily water budget using forcing variables on a daily basis as a simplified approach does not consider the dynamic processes regulating water and salt exchange within a semi diurnal tidal cycle table 2 eqs 1 and 2 this daily step limits the evaluation of water and salt budgets through each tidal cycle 12 hour period as implicitly considered in the mass balance calculations at each location affected by semi diurnal tides further by omitting explicit hydrodynamic processes our model is not able to examine water flow inside the forests and its interactions with the soil surface and trees roots i e shear stress or drag force mazda et al 2005 hence the model cannot estimate how the energy dissipates as water flows in out of the forest and its concomitant impact on water and salt budgets larsen and harvey 2010 mazda et al 2005 especially considering the high drag force caused by highly dense prop roots alongi 2009 castañeda moya et al 2011 lugo and snedaker 1974 mckee et al 1988 tomlinson 2016 troxler et al 2015 as a result pws can be over underestimated range 1 10 depending on the season and the relative effect of fdg and cdg procedures in the overall salt and water budget simulations fig 5 despite this limitation rhyman s pws values are robust estimates when using a mass balance methodology as is the case for other studies in coastal ecosystems including salt marshes and tidal freshwater forested wetlands morris 1995 wang et al 2007 wang et al 2020 furthermore our results show the model potential to be expanded into a spatially explicit setting to evaluate the contribution of pws as a stressor in modulating forest structure aboveground biomass and npp trends thus rhyman offers an experimental opportunity to evaluate future changes in mangrove wetland spatial distribution and npp in the long term annual decadal as climate changes in coastal everglades flower et al 2019 saha et al 2012 2011 similarly given the computational expense it is an inefficient strategy to simulate hourly pws fluctuations as expected in a more complex hydrodynamic model overall this type of models requires further parameterization that limit their utilization especially given the lack of field data in most mangrove forests at tropical latitudes e g rivera monroy et al 2004 4 3 porewater salinity dynamics under increasing freshwater restoration and rising sea level the shark river slough is one of the main drainages delivering groundwater and surface freshwater from upstream everglades into the sre and directly impacting our study sites fig 1 in our scenario simulations table 3 the high freshwater inflow scenario s1 1562 mm3 has 3 5 times freshwater discharge than the control scenario s0 446 mm3 and causes a decrease in pws values at srs 6 17 and srs 5 27 while maintaining pws values at srs 4 4 5 ppt as expected this decreasing spatial trend in pws values indicates a reverse relationship between freshwater inflow and pws values a similar response to freshwater increase has been reported in other south florida regions for example modeling results march 2007 october 2009 showed a reduction from 18 to 10 ppt in groundwater subsurface salinity in the brackish saline marsh mangrove ecotone at the ten thousand island national wildlife refuge michot et al 2017 this reduction was related to a potential increase in 20 freshwater inflow under cerp management decisions yet a recent field study in the same region found that an actual reduction in freshwater discharge compounded by increasing slr has caused salt intrusion and an increase in overlying water in flooded freshwater marshes romañach et al 2019 together these results show the relative rapid everglades regional ecosystem response to both freshwater diversions and slr this response is most probably due to the karstic porous geomorphic setting with low topographic relief high hydraulic conductivity and close coupling between surface water and groundwater processes dessu et al 2018 price et al 2006 saha et al 2012 smith et al 2016 in contrast when saltwater enters the sre due to increasing sl salinity increases commensurably with saltwater inputs from the gulf of mexico this is the case under a high sea level scenario s2 with pws increasing about 11 at srs 6 17 at srs 5 and by 1 5 times upstream at srs 4 when compared with the control scenario s0 fig 7 table s4 indeed this scenario s2 will become the new normal due to the rapid increasing slr in this region over the last decade 9 4 mm yr 1 three times of average pre 2006 rate 3 2 mm yr 1 wdowinski et al 2016 and similar to other coastal regions in the united states where slr is accelerating table s1 dahl et al 2017 an increase in pws up to 40 ppt will not impact mangrove functioning and extent overall since these coastal wetlands are adapted to withstand pws up to 70 ppt depending on hydroperiod lugo and medina 2014 especially flooding duration and frequency e g castañeda moya et al 2006 however as pws increases we expect a significant expansion in mangrove area with the species r mangle l racemosa and c erectus readily occupying marsh habitats close to the upstream boundary srs 4 this is because the pws along the boundary is more sensitive to increasing sea level as the s2 simulation showed the expansion pattern has been observed in the ten thousand islands region of southwestern florida howard et al 2017 2020 and taylor river slough where there is a distinct boundary defined by a mix of mangrove marsh vegetation white zone ross et al 2000 that has moved inland since the 1940s this area has a net area gain as dry conditions are triggered by a reduction in freshwater delivery as a result of past cerp management national academies of sciences 2016 interacting with dry low precipitation years triggered by the enso davey et al 2014 further a current long term landscape level assessment 1985 2017 shows a cumulative increase 10 2 in mangrove coverage in the fce han et al 2018 this transgression encroachment has been common in this coastal region since the early mid holocene epoch when mangrove wetlands colonized downstream areas of sre around 3800 cal yr bp by encroaching into the freshwater marsh as sea level rose yao and liu 2015 2017 for instance similar vegetation habitat shifts from coastal marsh i e freshwater brackish and saline to scrub mangroves e g a germinans have been associated with increasing slr and air temperature along the louisiana and texas coastal regions in the northern gulf of mexico guo et al 2017 mckee and vervaeke 2018 osland et al 2013 saintilan et al 2014 although there is mangrove expansion in the emer han et al 2018 roads channels and other infrastructure features will eventually cause a coastal squeeze enwright et al 2016 where limited space will stop this vegetation expansion a comprehensive pws spatiotemporal assessment along the sre requires consideration of the combined effects of freshwater inflow sea level and climatic factors in particular long term 2001 2016 water column salinity changes were more evident as a result of changes in freshwater inflow and sea level rise than from interannual variation in et and precipitation despite their covariation with elevated global temperature dessu et al 2018 this outcome was observed in the rhyman combination scenario s3 fig 7 table s4 at srs 6 site where despite an increase of 6 in pws compared to s1 pws did decrease 20 in contrast with the value under s2 certainly this result suggests that high freshwater inflow can offset the relative impact of high sl on pws values in fact dessu et al 2018 pointed out that freshwater inflow and water level above the srs 4 site were critical variables in maintaining a fresh to marine head difference which they considered the critical factor affecting marine to fresh water connectivity and transport of salinity and nutrients along the sre overall if reducing mangrove expansion into freshwater brackish marshes is one of the cerp management priorities then increasing freshwater inflow is needed as suggested by rhyman scenario simulation s2 vs s3 on the contrary freshwater reduction and slr resulting in pws increase can facilitate mangrove survival and expansion landward thus increasing mangrove area s2 han et al 2018 specifically our modeling results show that during a tropical storm e g hurricane wilma october 2005 fig 5 pws can rapidly increase at upstream srs 4 despite high precipitation induced by the storm suggesting the dominant role of seawater intrusion associated with major storm surges castañeda moya et al 2020 lagomasino et al 2020 mckee et al 2016 this instantaneous increase also reiterates that the pws at the boundary site srs 4 is sensitive to the seawater intrusion thus the rhyman s3 simulation results highlight complex interactions among the hydrological components and the major impact of slr on water and salt exchange especially along the mangrove marsh ecotone boundary srs 4 4 4 mangrove forest structure and salinity gradients pws and hydroperiod in the sre along with well documented differences in soil total phosphorus tp concentrations regulated by hurricanes castañeda moya et al 2020 danielson et al 2017 are key factors controlling mangrove species composition tree height and npp patterns castañeda moya et al 2013 chen and twilley 1999 danielson et al 2017 lagomasino et al 2020 rivera monroy et al 2019 smith et al 2009 but the lower pws values at srs 4 1 14 ppt table s3 for instance allows the presence of freshwater brackish vegetation and the exclusion of the mangrove species a germinans danielson et al 2017 this species present at srs 5 and srs 6 is physiologically more tolerant to higher salinities where tree growth rate and density increase even in seasonally hypersaline conditions e g arid zones in the caribbean and pacific regions castañeda moya et al 2006 ochoa gómez et al 2018 that are currently absent in the sre indeed during the last 6 years freshwater brackish vegetation has expanded at srs 4 as pws remained low during this period 10 ppt this vegetation is now competing with mangrove species for space and other resources e g nutrients and light resulting in the replacement of dominant mangrove species i e r mangle 61 by other brackish tree species like chrysobalanus icaco coco plum which is also found in tree islands upstream in the everglades van der valk et al 2008 thus if freshwater flow increases as part of the cerp restoration plans it is expected that as the salinity regime changes along the sre the relative dominance and extension of mangrove forests might also change at the boundary between freshwater brackish and saline gradients danielson et al 2017 dessu et al 2018 michot et al 2017 past and current hydrological assessments have proposed that the emer might be already in a transient state probably far from the pre development hydrological conditions of the 1950s dessu et al 2018 rivera monroy et al 2019 thus there is a need for a comprehensive assessment of the initial criteria to decide on the quantity quality timing and distribution of freshwater sklar et al 2005 along the shark river slough and other locations throughout the southern everglades including the sre flower et al 2017 if one of the cerp goals is to re establish freshwater vegetation then any increase towards pre development hydrologic conditions will result in slowing mangrove expansion into freshwater marshes due to salt intrusion s3 but it may also alter species diversity at the upstream boundary management decisions are especially needed given the potential economic impacts in the case of mangrove wetlands spatial distribution further studies are needed to evaluate these potential vegetation spatiotemporal distribution outcomes based on a contemporary evaluation of desirable ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration e g blue carbon in mangroves jerath et al 2016 and habitat biodiversity associated to low pws e g cladium jamaicense dominated seagrass in the everglades landscape 5 conclusion a mass balance based hydrological mangrove model rhyman was developed and implemented for riverine mangrove forests in the sre that explicitly considers groundwater discharge associated with upstream freshwater input fgd and coastal groundwater discharge cgd rhyman simulated water and salt budgets at three sites along the estuary and matched observed daily and seasonal soil porewater salinity pws associated with spatial differences although rhyman s daily water level simulations were constrained and variable the model was able to evaluate the relative regulatory role and effect of freshwater inflow and slr on pws modeling results show that lower freshwater inflow volume and higher slr lead to higher pws values in mangrove forests along the sre our model can serve as a tool to forecast pws under future climate and sea level scenarios while planning hydrological restoration measures site specific hydrological and climatic scenarios indicate that freshwater inflow and slr are dominant drivers controlling pws increasing freshwater scenario 1 can reduce pws causing the expansion of freshwater and brackish vegetation and reducing mangrove area at the ecotone boundary seawater intrusion associated with slr scenario 2 increases coastal groundwater discharge and salt concentration significantly increasing pws in all sites therefore rhyman can help explore the hydrological and ecological outcomes e g vegetation dominance depending on the relative balance between net freshwater inflow and variable sea level rise although rhyman simulations have provided evidence of the close balance between freshwater input and slr a landscape level assessment is needed to understand if the mangrove marsh ecotone region will be resilient to proposed hydrological management decisions danielson et al 2017 lugo 1980 rivera monroy et al 2019 or if it is currently beyond a tipping point as cerp undergoes full implementation national academies of sciences 2016 because hydrological restoration implies restoring freshwater flows to promote freshwater vegetation expansion and avoid for example peat collapse chambers et al 2019 ellison and stoddart 1991 servais et al 2020 snedaker 1995 as a result of saltwater intrusion key restoration decisions are needed to continue the adaptative implementation and management of cerp national academies of sciences 2016 this includes the

upland water surface flow into the study area throughfall represents the actual precipitation volume reaching the forest floor 95 of total precipitation twilley and chen 1998 thus surface water flow was equal to daily average throughfall multiplied by a runoff coefficient 90 daily seepage was also a site specific constant for each simulation and determined by water level records obtained at each site when the water level was below soil surface and no precipitation occurred in one day then seepage was considered as the difference between et and the change in water level on that particular day twilley and chen 1998 specific magnitudes are listed in table 2 a 2 topographic and hydrological parameters three topographic parameters table 2 including ground relative surface level bankfull stage and edge threshold characterize the local relative elevation settings at each study site ground surface level and bankfull stage were determined via sensitivity analysis while edge threshold was site specific this parameter should be directly measured or determined by linear regression between water levels in the channel and inland forest when channel water floods the mangrove floor e g tsai 2008 particularly given the relatively long study period 2004 2016 the ground surface level changed over years due to the sediment deposition transportation associated with tidal exchange and storms especially at the local micro scale additionally the zero marker of the channel water level data was changed in some years due to hurricane damage re installation to adjust these year specific modifications the ground surface level varied over the study period table 2 hydrological parameters controlling water and salt exchange are site specific or adapted from hyman and include specific yield for aboveground and underground water salt content exported by channel water tidal cycle or surface flow and precipitation canopy interception table 2 appendix b model initialization rhyman includes the implementation of four main sub routines given site differences in stages associated with channel and in situ water level and local topography fig s1 fig s2 before each simulation one year initial water level and pws values were defined using december values from the previous year thus rhyman first evaluates if the initial water level in the mangrove wetland is aboveground high water or belowground low water fig s2 the model then compares the channel water level to the edge threshold to determine the actual water level in the channel relative to the forest ground based on the actual water level in the channel the model then determines if the soil is flooded tide or not notide each day therefore rhyman executes one sub routine in one day to calculate water level salt content and pws sequentially as influenced by each hydrological component as stated in the model description appendix c sensitivity analysis sensitivity s was defined by the following equation c1 s δ x j x j δ p i p where pi is the best estimate of a given parameter i δpi is the change in parameter i xj is the state variable j i e pws and water level δxj is the change in the j state variable caused by a change in the parameter i values the higher the s absolute value of a given parameter the more sensitive the model is to such parameter negative s represents the negative relationship between parameter change and the change in the state variable because the specific yield aboveground and precipitation interception value range from 0 to 1 table 2 we only calculated the s value with 25 change of the best estimate 0 95 appendix d statistical measures d 1 bias the bias indicates the over or under estimate by comparing the simulated value to observations it is the difference between the mean of simulated values and mean of observations d1 b i a s i 1 n s i o i n where si and oi are the simulated and observed values of state variables i e water level and pws at each time n is the total number of observations d 2 coefficient of determination r2 the coefficient of determination r2 represents the proportion of the variance in the observed variables that can be predicted from the simulated variable it measures the linear regression between the simulated and observed values as defined by the following equation d2 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 d 3 root mean square error rmse the root mean square error rmse measures how much error is between simulated and observed values the smaller the rmse value is the closer the simulated value is to the observation the rmse is calculated using the following equation d3 r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n d 4 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is defined as d4 n s e 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 the nse determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the observed value variance this efficiency ranges from to 1 and measure how well the regression between simulated and observed values is compared to 1 1 line the negative value indicates that the mean of the observed values is a better predictor than the simulated value wang et al 2012 
24741,hydrology is a critical driver controlling mangrove wetlands structural and functional attributes at different spatial and temporal scales yet human activities have negatively affected hydrology causing mangrove diebacks and coverage loss worldwide in fact the assessment of mangrove water budgets impacted by natural and human disturbances is limited due to a lack of long term data and information that hinders our understanding of how changes in hydroperiod and salinity control mangrove productivity and spatial distribution in this study we implemented a mass balance based hydrological model rhyman that explicitly considers groundwater discharge in the shark river estuary sre southwestern everglades located in a karstic geomorphic setting and influenced by regional hydrological restoration we used long term hydroperiod and porewater salinity pws datasets obtained from 2004 to 2016 for model calibration and validation and to determine spatiotemporal variability in water levels and pws at three riverine mangrove sites downstream srs 6 midstream srs 5 upstream srs 4 along sre model results agree with a distinct pws pattern along the estuarine salinity gradient where the highest pws occurs at srs 6 mean 25 range 22 30 ppt followed by srs 5 17 14 25 ppt and srs 4 5 3 13 ppt a commensurate increase in pws over a thirteen year period indicates a long term reduction in freshwater inflow coupled with sea level rise slr increasing freshwater scenario simulation results show a significant reduction 17 27 in pws along the estuary in contrast with a high slr scenario when salinity increases up to 1 1 to 2 5 times that of control values model results show that freshwater inflow and slr are key drivers controlling mangrove wetlands pws in this karstic coastal region given its relatively simple structure this mass balance based hydrological model could be used in other environmental settings to evaluate potential habitat and regime shifts due to changes in hydrology and pws under regional hydrological restoration management keywords florida everglades mangrove wetlands porewater salinity mass balance water and salt budgets hydrological restoration climate change 1 introduction mangrove wetlands are distributed along low latitude intertidal zones although mangrove wetlands account for only 0 7 of the tropical forest area they are recognized as the most productive ecosystems per unit area in the world donato et al 2011 giri et al 2011 mangrove forests structure and productivity are regulated by the interaction among a range of

biogeochemical processes in wetlands mitsch and gosselink 2007 in mangrove dominated coastal wetlands hydrological processes including tide surface sheet flow precipitation evapotranspiration and

krauss et al 2008 lugo and medina 2014 in coastal wetlands this typical brackish saline condition controls pws as a result of the dynamic water and material exchanges with seawater through tidal cycles among other hydrological processes that define the hydroperiod gradient hence pws is considered as a major driver not only regulating species composition tree height and npp along well defined mangrove zones as a result of inter and intra species competition given species specific salinity tolerance ball and pidsley 1995 castañeda moya et al 2006 crase et al 2013 day et al 1996 kauffman and

of pws on mangrove ecological attributes there is a lack of long term continuous field data to determine pws seasonal and interannual variability particularly in subtropical and arid coastal mangrove wetlands kristensen et al 2017 time and labor consuming field sampling due to the forest structure complexity e g dense prop roots under flooding conditions and hard access to the remote sites along the coastal zone are some of the reasons for this data gap because pws is regulated by the net exchange of salt between mangrove forests and adjacent coastal waters hydrological models are useful analytical tools to examine water budgets that determine seasonal and interannual pws variability in mangroves although existing hydrodynamic models are capable of reproducing water flows in mangrove forests alongi 2009 mazda et al 2005 these models are not able to explicitly predict changes in pws this limitation is associated with the complex interplay among mangrove hydrological conditions groundwater and sea level rise slr dessu et al 2018 nuttle et al 2000 price et al 2006 saha et al 2011 2012 increasing freshwater inflows for example controlled by river and groundwater discharge due to restoration diversions can lead to fresher groundwater while slr causes saltwater intrusion habib et al 2007 2008 michot et al 2017 saha et al 2011 therefore depending on the geomorphic setting e g karstic vs deltaic rovai et al 2016 2018 woodroffe 2002 and the relative dominance of groundwater discharge and slr this complex interaction among environmental settings causes uncertainties in the assessment of pws especially when site specific parameterization is constrained by data with limited sampling spatial coverage and frequency although modeling studies have been conducted to evaluate hydrological processes and salinity in estuaries or tidal creeks adjacent to mangrove wetlands langevin et al 2005 michot et al 2017 wang et al 2012 few studies have explicitly partitioned the

evapotranspiration are the main drivers controlling the hydrological processes in mangrove wetlands mitsch and gosselink 2007 twilley and chen 1998 the spatiotemporal interactions among those drivers control the exchange of water and salt between mangroves and adjacent estuarine waters and upland ecosystems fig 2 we adapted the water and salt budgets equations implemented in hyman twilley and chen 1998 thus changes in water level and salt content in mangrove wetlands can be described using the following water budget equation 1 δ wl δ t t i t o p n s i g i et s p where wl is water level cm relative to local mangrove soil ground elevation at the end of one unit simulation time δwl δt is water level change per unit time t cm day 1 ti is water flow into the mangrove forest during flood

the porewater salinity at the end of one unit simulation time g kg 1 δ s wl δt is the salt content change per unit time t g kg 1 st is salinity value of the estuarine water during flood tide g kg 1 ss

imported and exported during tidal flooding and ebb tide respectively gi sg is the salt imported through groundwater discharge while sp spw is the salt lost via seepage in this context the water level and salt budgets are calculated on a unit area basis in this study the mangrove adjacent estuarine water column is defined as channel water that is influenced by upstream freshwater inflow tidal exchange and slr the inflow outflow between the mangrove wetland and the channel combines the relative spatiotemporal dominance of tides and freshwater discharge we also assume that surface flow is equivalent to surface sheet flow or runoff four forcing functions are daily channel water level and salinity et and precipitation registered at or close to each study site fig 1 c e table 1 precipitation is considered as the main source of upland water surface flow daily seepage is a site specific constant and represents major outflow along with et rhyman explicitly incorporates two

restoration freshwater diversions and cgd the coastal groundwater discharge directly affecting pws as seawater volume changes due to slr because the impact of both fgd and cgd in the water budget occurs over the long term these terms are maintained constant during annual simulations in this study the fgd and cgd values were compiled from published studies or estimated via sensitivity analysis table 2 parameter selection for these components included different values depending on the site location and freshwater inflow volume during the study period given the changes in estuarine hydrology

compiled data collected at the sh2 station nearby srs 4 fig 1 c from january 2002 to september 2012 south florida information access sofia https sofia usgs gov sea level data for the period of 2002 2016 15 years were obtained from the noaa key west station fig 1 a https www noaa gov to assess pws seasonal and spatial variability as a result of local topography we collected data along a 100 meter transect from the shoreline to the interior of the forest at each site in june wet season and november early dry season 2018 one topography survey was conducted in december 2017 in all study sites to assess the topographic variation from shoreline towards the interior forest 2 4 model calibration and validation we used the average pws and daily mean water level registered in the same day from year 2004 2006 to calibrate rhyman at each site pws was collected in four sampling stations within two 20 20 m plots and located near the water level recorder at each site see study sites section calibration parameters include topographic ground surface level bankfull stage and hydrological parameters table 2 rhyman was validated using pws and water level measured from 2007 to 2016 since channel water level data have large data gaps in some cases the model was validated using data collected in selected years without or with minor missing data 10 the years used for model validations at each site are as follows srs 6 2011 2012 2013 2015 2016 srs 5 2008 2009 2011 2014 2015 2016 and srs 4 2008 2011 2012 2013 and 2015 the water level data collected during tropical storms hurricanes e g hurricane charley in august 2004 and hurricane wilma in october 2005 were excluded and not used for model calibration or validation all site specific parameter values for each year are listed in table s2 2 5 sensitivity analysis we conducted a sensitivity analysis to evaluate model performance we followed the protocol proposed by jørgensen and fath 2011 to calculate sensitivity s of pws and water level to the parameter i where pi is the best estimated value and δpi represents a 25 change from the best estimate model parameters are summarized in table 2 and the equation used for this analysis is listed in appendix c 2 6 simulation scenarios the channel water level and salinity at each station are simultaneously influenced by upstream freshwater discharge and coastal slr given their hydrological importance in regulating pws we firstly assessed two potential scenarios using rhyman high freshwater inflow s1 and high sea level s2 table 3 average freshwater inflow volume along srs table s1 under cerp 2001 2016 is approximately 855 million cubic meters mm3 dessu et al 2018 in 2011 this inflow was below the average volume 466 mm3 meanwhile sl in the same year was also relatively low 3 3 cm sla 0 thus we selected the channel water level and salinity recorded in 2011 as forcing function values for the control scenario s0 simulation channel wl and sal in table 2 in comparison channel water level and salinity recorded in 2005 were selected as the high freshwater inflow scenario s1 1562 mm3 with an average normal mean sea level 3 4 cm sla 0 1 cm data in the year 2015 were considered as the highest sea level scenario s2 12 0 cm sla 8 7 cm with a normal freshwater inflow 440 mm3 to investigate pws response to higher sea level to further explore pws variation under the combined influence of high freshwater discharge and high sea level simultaneously we defined a combination scenario s3 using relatively high freshwater inflow i e 1412 mm3 and high sea level 11 3 cm sla 8 0 cm recorded in 2016 table 3 the combination scenario was only conducted for srs 6 and srs 5 because field channel water level data had a significant data gap for site srs 4 hindering the implementation of this scenario we used precipitation and et recorded in 2011 i e control scenario s0 to perform scenarios s1 s2 and s3 2 7 statistical analysis to evaluate model performance we calculated common statistical measures including model bias coefficient of deternination r2 the root mean squared error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse thomson and emery 2014 wang et al 2012 nse values were estimated for each simulation during calibration 2004 2006 validation 2007 2016 procedures and the full simulation period 2004 2016 information about these statistical values is included in appendix d we conducted two way analyses of variance anova to determine 1 the differences in field water levels among sites downstream midstream and upstream and seasons dry vs wet 2 the interaction between pws values across sites and seasons repeated measures anova and 3 the interaction between methods field observations vs modeling simulation and sites we also conducted a one way anova for scenario s0 s1 s2 s3 simulation results to explore pws differences impacted by changes in freshwater discharge volume and slr at each site the tukey hsd post hoc comparison p 0 05 was performed for all anovas all statistical analyses were performed in jmp pro 15 sas institute cary nc usa 3 results 3 1 field measurements hydroperiod and porewater salinity hydroperiod analysis using long term data 2002 2016 showed distinct seasonal and spatial differences along the sre table s3 duration of inundation was higher during the wet season at srs 6 and srs 4 compared to the dry season while slightly higher during the dry season at srs 5 the difference in seasonal duration was only significant at srs 4 the frequency of inundation in the dry season was higher than in the wet season across all sites table s3 overall annual flooding duration decreased from downstream to upstream locations along the estuary srs 6 223 6 days yr 1 srs 5 206 6 days yr 1 srs 4 185 8 days yr 1 while the annual average frequency of inundation was higher at srs 6 380 16 events yr 1 that in srs 4 214 16 events yr 1 and srs 5 176 30 events yr 1 mangrove pws showed significant spatial interannual and seasonal differences corresponding to seasonal channel water salinity fig s3 table s3 pws decreased from the downstream srs 6 towards the mid srs 5 and upstream srs 4 sites and was higher during dry season table s3 on annual average pws was highest at srs 6 26 84 1 15 ppt followed by srs 5 20 44 1 51 ppt and srs 4 5 64 0 75 ppt fig 3 3 2 modeling porewater salinity and water level simulated annual average pws was higher at srs 6 25 03 0 93 ppt than in srs 5 17 18 1 24 ppt and srs 4 5 27 1 09 ppt and not significantly different when compared to observed values regardless of sites mse 10

he et al 2020 the average pws varied among different simulated years for each site fig s4 showing distinct interannual and seasonal variation at srs 6 the lowest annual average pws observed in 2005 22 20 0 40 ppt was 8 units lower than the highest pws values in 2015 30 22 0 18 ppt the lowest pws at srs 5 occurred in 2008 14 08 0 46 ppt and the highest in 2015 24 55 0 31 ppt in the case of the upstream srs 4 site pws ranged from 2 57 0 16 ppt 2008 to 12 52 0 32 ppt 2015 during the study period overall simulated pws values throughout the period 2004 2016 showed an increasing trend and peaked in 2015 across all sites while slightly declining by 2016 fig s4 annual average daily mean water level estimated using rhyman decreased from downstream srs 6 1 36 0 45 cm to midstream srs 5 6 2 1 38 cm and upstream srs 4 7 93 1 95 cm table 4 reflecting the observed spatial trend in water level along the sre although the simulated water level was a daily value and insufficient to estimate actual inundation duration and frequency inside mangroves the model replicated seasonal variation inside the forest indicating the general lower water level in the dry season compared to the wet season fig s5 3 3 model calibration and validation rhyman model simulations during both calibration and validation periods showed good agreement with observed pws values demonstrating that rhyman is capable of simulating pws dynamics in mangrove forests fig 4 table 5 for model calibration simulated pws values closely matched observed data with a low bias range 1 41 to 0 30 ppt and both high coefficient of deternination r2 0 93 to 0 98 and nse values 0 80 to 0 98 table 5 specifically the bias was lower at srs 6 0 30 ppt followed by srs 4 0 50 ppt and srs 5 1 41 ppt coefficients of determination were highest 0 98 at srs 6 and srs 5 while the coefficient was relatively lower 0 93 at srs 4 nse values estimated for srs 5 and srs 6 were the same 0 98 and higher than that of srs 4 0 80 comparatively the statistical parameters between calibration and validation were different table 5 for model validation the coefficients were higher at srs 5 0 88 and srs 6 0 74 than in srs 4 0 51 whereas nse values were 0 65 srs 6 0 82 srs 5 0 41 srs 4 table 5 just as in the case during the validation calibration procedures simulations for the entire study period 2004 2016 showed good model performance in predicting pws fig 5 table 5 simulated pws showed low bias range 1 96 to 0 86 ppt and both high coefficients of determination 0 64 0 92 and nse values 0 56 0 88 indicating that rhyman is a robust model to simulate pws in riverine mangrove forests along the sre table 5 the linear regression between observed and simulated pws values showed a good agreement at all sites fig 5 a high coefficient of determination was obtained when all paired observed simulated values were used r2 0 94 rmse 2 66 ppt f1 47 749 23 fig 5 rhyman is relatively more efficient and powerful when pws values are estimated for the sites srs 6 and srs 5 where seawater and cgd are dominant over upstream freshwater inflow this was in contrast to the upstream srs 4 site where the significant composite influence of freshwater inflow and cgd resulted in more complex hydrological patterns although statistical analysis of the simulated water level showed high variability regardless of study periods simulated patterns captured the spatial trends and seasonal variations in observed daily mean water level inside the forest which can be attributed to seasonal changes in the adjacent channel water level et and precipitation fig 6 fig s6 table 6 overall in the case of full period 2004 2016 the simulated water level inside the mangrove forests indicated a slight bias range 3 86 to 0 95 cm and negative low nse 0 28 to 0 02 across all sites the coefficient of determination at srs 4 0 57 was fair while the coefficients were poor at srs 5 0 25 and srs 6 0 12 table 6 3 4 sensitivity analysis high absolute sensitivity values indicate that water level is sensitive to topographic parameters i e ground surface and bankfull stage table 7 given the integrative role that local topography plays in controlling hydroperiod inside the mangrove wetlands in contrast pws was not sensitive to any parameter with a 25 change which indicates that changes in pws were less than 25 in these cases pws sensitivity values were generally smaller s 0 10 across all sites the cgd procedure showed that the sensitivity to the parameter i e cgd differences between dry vs wet seasons cgd dry to wet table 2 is relatively higher at srs 5 s 0 13 the sensitivity value of dispersion in the fgd procedure dispersion fgd was 0 2 underscoring its larger influence on model performance than other model parameters table 2 3 5 simulation scenarios the pws values were significantly different among the four simulation scenarios across sites fig 7 table s4 the control scenario s0 showed a similar gradient of annual average pws values across sites compared to field measurements where the higher salinity was registered at the downstream and midstream estuary srs 6 27 18 0 32 ppt srs 5 21 04 0 41 ppt and the lowest values at the upstream site srs 4 4 96 0 27 ppt in the case of the high freshwater discharge scenario s1 when compared to s0 results pws was significantly reduced by 4 50 and 5 64 ppt units at srs 6 and srs 5 respectively while at srs 4 remained approximately the same in both scenarios s0 and s1 4 61 0 25 ppt pws values were high in the high sea level scenario s2 with a significant increase in pws values regardless of site locations the maximum pws increase was at srs 4 7 61 ppt followed by srs 5 3 54 ppt and srs 6 3 02 ppt the mean pws simulated at srs 6 under this combined scenario was significantly lower than the values obtained in the control scenario i e 24 01 0 19 ppt in the case of srs 5 the average simulated pws was 15 39 0 21 ppt under s3 which is approximately same as s1 15 39 0 46 ppt but significantly lower compared to s0 21 04 0 41 and s2 24 57 0 33 scenarios fig 7 table s4 4 discussion 4 1 model performance simulated pws values along the sre using rhyman showed close agreement with historical field measurements fig 5 indicating that this mass balance based modeling approach has strong utility in forecasting pws in riverine mangrove forests under different hydrological scenarios model performance in this study was improved when compared to a previous pws modeling estimation along the sre over the period of 2003 2005 using hyman without explicitly considering groundwater inputs fgd and cgd i e tsai 2008 for instance tsai 2008 showed that simulated pws values at srs 4 during the wet season were 5 7 ppt greater than the observed pws range this result was attributed to salt accumulation in the soil due to low precipitation and high et in late spring and then flushed out in the summer season however when we included the term fgd the simulated pws matched the field observations in the period of 2004 2005 one mechanism explaining this temporal agreement is that increasing upstream freshwater inflow causes a reduction in salinity concentration in both the adjacent channel water and groundwater at srs 4 lagomasino et al 2015 thus the combination of fresher channel water and groundwater inputs decreases pws inside the mangrove forest simultaneously excess freshwater inputs into the soil matrix might also help export or disperse more salt to adjacent estuarine waters through surface flow and seepage the relatively high absolute sensitivity value of dispersion 0 2 indicates the considerable influence of salt dispersion on pws similar to the functional role of the term fgd at upstream estuary locations the inclusion of the parameters defining cgd also improved pws projections in both srs 5 and srs 6 sites when compared to previous estimates i e years 2004 and 2005 tsai 2008 the region close to the estuary mouth e g downstream srs 6 is characterized by a thick peat layer 3 6 m whelan 2005 yao and liu 2015 2017 consequently the local aquifers are relatively deep in downstream srs 6 the relative contributions of groundwater stored in the deep aquifers has a limited effect on net water volume and salinity in the subsurface instead cgd is associated with seawater brackish water intrusion into the mangrove soil as shown by isotope markers in the sre and can potentially alter pws price et al 2003 2006 smith et al 2016 in rhyman cgd represents the subsurface shallow water flow 1 m discharge into the mangrove soil therefore the relatively high agreement between observed and simulated pws values at srs 6 and srs 5 indicates that the cgd would increase pws values as saline water slowly enters the subsurface soil as a result of seawater intrusion driven by sea level rise over the long term fig 5 in contrast as the peat soil layer 1 5 m depth becomes shallower upstream srs 4 groundwater input i e freshwater fgd from the deep aquifer becomes significant smith et al 2016 especially in the context of freshwater diversions as part of the hydrological restoration program upstream the enp national academies of sciences 2016 sklar et al 2005 troxler et al 2013 however even after including the fgd parameters the interaction between fresh and brackish groundwater sources is still complex at srs 4 leading to relatively poor pws simulation compared to the srs 6 and srs 5 sites fig 5 table 5 simulated pws in riverine mangrove forests along sre captured the spatial variation in field measurements with high values in srs 6 and srs 5 and low values in srs 4 during both wet and dry seasons fig s3 table s3 the apparent pws decreasing trend from downstream srs 6 towards mid and upstream srs 5 and srs 4 reflects hydrological processes and their interactions at the regional scale particularly at the two endmember sites downstream srs 6 and upstream srs 4 fig s5 table s3 the emer is delimited by the gulf of mexico coastline and comprises an extensive hydrological network with multiple interconnected estuaries tidal channels castañeda moya et al 2020 rivera monroy et al 2011 for example the site srs 4 is located upstream in tarpon bay at the junction between the shark and harney rivers fig 1 c longer inundation duration in wet season based on field measurements at srs 4 compared to midstream srs 5 shows that water level upstream is influenced by the shark and harney rivers table s3 although the hydrological interaction between these two rivers remains uncertain the compounded hydrological synergy does modulate water budgets and materials exchange in this area as observed by distinct sedimentation patterns during natural disturbances and associated storm surges castañeda moya et al 2020 further this complex hydrological coupling is also evident by the opposite trend in flooding duration at srs 5 longer in the dry season in comparison with srs 6 and srs 4 longer in the wet season in the wet season the relatively high river discharge upstream can potentially offset the downstream tidal flooding regime hence this offset across sites along with seasonal et and precipitation fig s6 may explain the lower duration of inundation at the midstream site srs 5 during the wet season this long term offset captured by rhyman simulations highlights the dynamic hydrological interaction between river discharge and tides at the srs 5 location which is part of a complex network of channels and tidal creeks fig 1 a larsen et al 2012 nuttle et al 2000 in contrast to srs 5 and srs 4 srs 6 hydrological conditions are dominated by strong tidal dynamics due to its proximity to the gulf of mexico fig 1 e that results in higher inundation frequency and water level inside the forest although rhyman does not explicitly include functions representing tidal asymmetries and material exchange water and salt through water movements between the forest and the water column at the mouth of the estuary e g mazda et al 1995 van maanen et al 2015 wu et al 2001 our mass balance approach implicitly capture their effect on pws seasonal variability seasonal variations in simulated pws values were consistent with observations and previous studies fig s4 table s3 castañeda moya et al 2013 chen and twilley 1999 and highlights the critical role of hydroperiod in regulating pws in mangrove forests krauss et al 2006 lara and cohen 2006 for instance although the frequency of inundation is higher during the dry season in srs 4 the average low water depth and shorter inundation duration reduce the interaction between subsurface porewater and surface water during flooding this limited interaction reduces salt exchange between the forest and adjacent estuarine water the high frequency of inundation during the dry season was a composite result of relatively low water depth and shorter flooding duration which underscores the complex attributes of hydroperiod fig s5 friess and watson 2016 rivera monroy et al 2017 additionally seepage is low due to the low crab burrow density in this site smith et al 2016 thus accumulating a greater proportion of salt this composite interaction among variables results in the seasonal salinity or salt legacy which largely influences simulated pws values as rhyman simulations showed in srs 4 during the dry season e g castañeda moya et al 2006 krauss et al 2006 this inclusion of salt legacy considers its influence from the previous time step i e day when calculating the pws in a current simulation day thus improving the agreement between simulated pws and field measurements tsai 2008 this improvement underscores the relative importance of salt legacy in regulating salt balance in the long term especially in cases where mangrove soil is influenced by varying flooding regimes and hydroperiod gradients as in the case of areas with low level topography i e taylor river slough everglades and semi arid coastal regions characterized by micro tides 30 cm sánchez carrillo et al 2009 conversely in areas where crab burrow density is high the soil is less saturated as a result of greater flushing of materials including salt during the dry season this is the case of site srs 6 where burrows are efficiently flushed up to 100 efficiency due to tidal pumping during the dry season smith et al 2016 this mechanism partially explains why our simulated pws values are close to field measurements since the influence of salt legacy at srs 6 in the long term is low compared to srs 4 thus the water exchange interacting with soil properties e g bulk density crab burrows presence at different temporal scales i e tidal and seasonal forcing is critical in regulating not only salt exchange but also nutrient availability i e soil tp and soluble reactive phosphorus po 4 3 and carbon storage in the long term santos et al 2019 tait et al 2016 2017 further studies are needed to quantify this net water exchange in mangrove ecosystems under different geomorphic settings and hydroperiod regimes especially in wetlands influenced by microtidal regimes kristensen et al 2017 smith et al 2016 4 2 considerations concerning rhyman model settings and boundaries as a spatially implicit model rhyman was designed and calibrated using the water level relative to the forest soil surface as a criterion to assess flooding events during tidal exchange to reflect the local topography influence the bankfull stage was explicitly included in the model fig 2 the high sensitivity values of the topographic parameters highlight the importance of capturing the forest elevation gradient when simulating water level in our mangrove sites where topographic relief is significantly different along the estuary table 2 the inclusion for instance of the bankfull stage is critical to adjust the local water level affected by local topographic gradients indeed the observed pws values sampled along a 100 meter transect at each site fig s1 slightly decreased from the channel bank i e the water edge where the channel water level recorder was installed to the forest interior these spatial differences in pws values along the topographical gradient is the outcome of a highly dynamic vertical exchange of water and salt between the soil and the overlying water during flooding conditions at different temporal scales tidal vs seasonal in this case the simulated pws is assumed as the averaged value due to water flows across soil layers with different soil properties e g porosity in our mass balance approach this is one of the reasons why our water level simulation results are different from direct measurements overall the sensitivity analysis showed a robust model performance regarding topography as a controlling variable where pws values were not very sensitive i e 25 to the ground surface level and bankfull stage parameters table 7 nevertheless it is important to carefully select these parameters during the calibration and validation stage in other environmental settings and mangrove ecotypes e g scrub basin especially when using rhyman to evaluate pws at larger spatial scales this step is critical given that the edge threshold is a site specific parameter obtained using regression analysis tsai 2008 specifically the topography inside forests and channel bathymetry are dynamic over a long term due to sediment transport deposition and accumulation associated with tidal exchange or hurricane events castañeda moya et al 2020 feher et al 2019 rhyman defines a boundary condition by using a constant ground surface level twilley and chen 1998 this selection is based on the initial assumption that when the adjacent channel water flows into the forest there is surface water flow that then recharges and maintains a subsurface water level which becomes the boundary condition given the long term field pws data availability at 30 cm depth in our study sites it was adequate to use the ground surface level boundary at 35 cm our model does not explicitly include the channel water column lateral pressure this lateral pressure as related to darcy s law mazda and ikeda 2006 still can influence groundwater level through subsurface flow especially in cases where soil porosity is high due to crab burrows as is the case in our study sites larsen et al 2011 smith et al 2016 although we considered seepage outflow which contains the partial influence of lateral pressure the performance of rhyman model was limited when simulating water level inside the forest the observed lowest water level was approximately 20 40 cm belowground indicating that the boundary water level is maintained probably belowground within this range fig 6 to improve water level simulations inside the forest further field surveys are needed to evaluate this key boundary value currently included in rhyman we also attribute the difference between observed and simulated water level values as indicated by the negative nse value to the fact that rhyman simulates a daily water budget using forcing variables on a daily basis as a simplified approach does not consider the dynamic processes regulating water and salt exchange within a semi diurnal tidal cycle table 2 eqs 1 and 2 this daily step limits the evaluation of water and salt budgets through each tidal cycle 12 hour period as implicitly considered in the mass balance calculations at each location affected by semi diurnal tides further by omitting explicit hydrodynamic processes our model is not able to examine water flow inside the forests and its interactions with the soil surface and trees roots i e shear stress or drag force mazda et al 2005 hence the model cannot estimate how the energy dissipates as water flows in out of the forest and its concomitant impact on water and salt budgets larsen and harvey 2010 mazda et al 2005 especially considering the high drag force caused by highly dense prop roots alongi 2009 castañeda moya et al 2011 lugo and snedaker 1974 mckee et al 1988 tomlinson 2016 troxler et al 2015 as a result pws can be over underestimated range 1 10 depending on the season and the relative effect of fdg and cdg procedures in the overall salt and water budget simulations fig 5 despite this limitation rhyman s pws values are robust estimates when using a mass balance methodology as is the case for other studies in coastal ecosystems including salt marshes and tidal freshwater forested wetlands morris 1995 wang et al 2007 wang et al 2020 furthermore our results show the model potential to be expanded into a spatially explicit setting to evaluate the contribution of pws as a stressor in modulating forest structure aboveground biomass and npp trends thus rhyman offers an experimental opportunity to evaluate future changes in mangrove wetland spatial distribution and npp in the long term annual decadal as climate changes in coastal everglades flower et al 2019 saha et al 2012 2011 similarly given the computational expense it is an inefficient strategy to simulate hourly pws fluctuations as expected in a more complex hydrodynamic model overall this type of models requires further parameterization that limit their utilization especially given the lack of field data in most mangrove forests at tropical latitudes e g rivera monroy et al 2004 4 3 porewater salinity dynamics under increasing freshwater restoration and rising sea level the shark river slough is one of the main drainages delivering groundwater and surface freshwater from upstream everglades into the sre and directly impacting our study sites fig 1 in our scenario simulations table 3 the high freshwater inflow scenario s1 1562 mm3 has 3 5 times freshwater discharge than the control scenario s0 446 mm3 and causes a decrease in pws values at srs 6 17 and srs 5 27 while maintaining pws values at srs 4 4 5 ppt as expected this decreasing spatial trend in pws values indicates a reverse relationship between freshwater inflow and pws values a similar response to freshwater increase has been reported in other south florida regions for example modeling results march 2007 october 2009 showed a reduction from 18 to 10 ppt in groundwater subsurface salinity in the brackish saline marsh mangrove ecotone at the ten thousand island national wildlife refuge michot et al 2017 this reduction was related to a potential increase in 20 freshwater inflow under cerp management decisions yet a recent field study in the same region found that an actual reduction in freshwater discharge compounded by increasing slr has caused salt intrusion and an increase in overlying water in flooded freshwater marshes romañach et al 2019 together these results show the relative rapid everglades regional ecosystem response to both freshwater diversions and slr this response is most probably due to the karstic porous geomorphic setting with low topographic relief high hydraulic conductivity and close coupling between surface water and groundwater processes dessu et al 2018 price et al 2006 saha et al 2012 smith et al 2016 in contrast when saltwater enters the sre due to increasing sl salinity increases commensurably with saltwater inputs from the gulf of mexico this is the case under a high sea level scenario s2 with pws increasing about 11 at srs 6 17 at srs 5 and by 1 5 times upstream at srs 4 when compared with the control scenario s0 fig 7 table s4 indeed this scenario s2 will become the new normal due to the rapid increasing slr in this region over the last decade 9 4 mm yr 1 three times of average pre 2006 rate 3 2 mm yr 1 wdowinski et al 2016 and similar to other coastal regions in the united states where slr is accelerating table s1 dahl et al 2017 an increase in pws up to 40 ppt will not impact mangrove functioning and extent overall since these coastal wetlands are adapted to withstand pws up to 70 ppt depending on hydroperiod lugo and medina 2014 especially flooding duration and frequency e g castañeda moya et al 2006 however as pws increases we expect a significant expansion in mangrove area with the species r mangle l racemosa and c erectus readily occupying marsh habitats close to the upstream boundary srs 4 this is because the pws along the boundary is more sensitive to increasing sea level as the s2 simulation showed the expansion pattern has been observed in the ten thousand islands region of southwestern florida howard et al 2017 2020 and taylor river slough where there is a distinct boundary defined by a mix of mangrove marsh vegetation white zone ross et al 2000 that has moved inland since the 1940s this area has a net area gain as dry conditions are triggered by a reduction in freshwater delivery as a result of past cerp management national academies of sciences 2016 interacting with dry low precipitation years triggered by the enso davey et al 2014 further a current long term landscape level assessment 1985 2017 shows a cumulative increase 10 2 in mangrove coverage in the fce han et al 2018 this transgression encroachment has been common in this coastal region since the early mid holocene epoch when mangrove wetlands colonized downstream areas of sre around 3800 cal yr bp by encroaching into the freshwater marsh as sea level rose yao and liu 2015 2017 for instance similar vegetation habitat shifts from coastal marsh i e freshwater brackish and saline to scrub mangroves e g a germinans have been associated with increasing slr and air temperature along the louisiana and texas coastal regions in the northern gulf of mexico guo et al 2017 mckee and vervaeke 2018 osland et al 2013 saintilan et al 2014 although there is mangrove expansion in the emer han et al 2018 roads channels and other infrastructure features will eventually cause a coastal squeeze enwright et al 2016 where limited space will stop this vegetation expansion a comprehensive pws spatiotemporal assessment along the sre requires consideration of the combined effects of freshwater inflow sea level and climatic factors in particular long term 2001 2016 water column salinity changes were more evident as a result of changes in freshwater inflow and sea level rise than from interannual variation in et and precipitation despite their covariation with elevated global temperature dessu et al 2018 this outcome was observed in the rhyman combination scenario s3 fig 7 table s4 at srs 6 site where despite an increase of 6 in pws compared to s1 pws did decrease 20 in contrast with the value under s2 certainly this result suggests that high freshwater inflow can offset the relative impact of high sl on pws values in fact dessu et al 2018 pointed out that freshwater inflow and water level above the srs 4 site were critical variables in maintaining a fresh to marine head difference which they considered the critical factor affecting marine to fresh water connectivity and transport of salinity and nutrients along the sre overall if reducing mangrove expansion into freshwater brackish marshes is one of the cerp management priorities then increasing freshwater inflow is needed as suggested by rhyman scenario simulation s2 vs s3 on the contrary freshwater reduction and slr resulting in pws increase can facilitate mangrove survival and expansion landward thus increasing mangrove area s2 han et al 2018 specifically our modeling results show that during a tropical storm e g hurricane wilma october 2005 fig 5 pws can rapidly increase at upstream srs 4 despite high precipitation induced by the storm suggesting the dominant role of seawater intrusion associated with major storm surges castañeda moya et al 2020 lagomasino et al 2020 mckee et al 2016 this instantaneous increase also reiterates that the pws at the boundary site srs 4 is sensitive to the seawater intrusion thus the rhyman s3 simulation results highlight complex interactions among the hydrological components and the major impact of slr on water and salt exchange especially along the mangrove marsh ecotone boundary srs 4 4 4 mangrove forest structure and salinity gradients pws and hydroperiod in the sre along with well documented differences in soil total phosphorus tp concentrations regulated by hurricanes castañeda moya et al 2020 danielson et al 2017 are key factors controlling mangrove species composition tree height and npp patterns castañeda moya et al 2013 chen and twilley 1999 danielson et al 2017 lagomasino et al 2020 rivera monroy et al 2019 smith et al 2009 but the lower pws values at srs 4 1 14 ppt table s3 for instance allows the presence of freshwater brackish vegetation and the exclusion of the mangrove species a germinans danielson et al 2017 this species present at srs 5 and srs 6 is physiologically more tolerant to higher salinities where tree growth rate and density increase even in seasonally hypersaline conditions e g arid zones in the caribbean and pacific regions castañeda moya et al 2006 ochoa gómez et al 2018 that are currently absent in the sre indeed during the last 6 years freshwater brackish vegetation has expanded at srs 4 as pws remained low during this period 10 ppt this vegetation is now competing with mangrove species for space and other resources e g nutrients and light resulting in the replacement of dominant mangrove species i e r mangle 61 by other brackish tree species like chrysobalanus icaco coco plum which is also found in tree islands upstream in the everglades van der valk et al 2008 thus if freshwater flow increases as part of the cerp restoration plans it is expected that as the salinity regime changes along the sre the relative dominance and extension of mangrove forests might also change at the boundary between freshwater brackish and saline gradients danielson et al 2017 dessu et al 2018 michot et al 2017 past and current hydrological assessments have proposed that the emer might be already in a transient state probably far from the pre development hydrological conditions of the 1950s dessu et al 2018 rivera monroy et al 2019 thus there is a need for a comprehensive assessment of the initial criteria to decide on the quantity quality timing and distribution of freshwater sklar et al 2005 along the shark river slough and other locations throughout the southern everglades including the sre flower et al 2017 if one of the cerp goals is to re establish freshwater vegetation then any increase towards pre development hydrologic conditions will result in slowing mangrove expansion into freshwater marshes due to salt intrusion s3 but it may also alter species diversity at the upstream boundary management decisions are especially needed given the potential economic impacts in the case of mangrove wetlands spatial distribution further studies are needed to evaluate these potential vegetation spatiotemporal distribution outcomes based on a contemporary evaluation of desirable ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration e g blue carbon in mangroves jerath et al 2016 and habitat biodiversity associated to low pws e g cladium jamaicense dominated seagrass in the everglades landscape 5 conclusion a mass balance based hydrological mangrove model rhyman was developed and implemented for riverine mangrove forests in the sre that explicitly considers groundwater discharge associated with upstream freshwater input fgd and coastal groundwater discharge cgd rhyman simulated water and salt budgets at three sites along the estuary and matched observed daily and seasonal soil porewater salinity pws associated with spatial differences although rhyman s daily water level simulations were constrained and variable the model was able to evaluate the relative regulatory role and effect of freshwater inflow and slr on pws modeling results show that lower freshwater inflow volume and higher slr lead to higher pws values in mangrove forests along the sre our model can serve as a tool to forecast pws under future climate and sea level scenarios while planning hydrological restoration measures site specific hydrological and climatic scenarios indicate that freshwater inflow and slr are dominant drivers controlling pws increasing freshwater scenario 1 can reduce pws causing the expansion of freshwater and brackish vegetation and reducing mangrove area at the ecotone boundary seawater intrusion associated with slr scenario 2 increases coastal groundwater discharge and salt concentration significantly increasing pws in all sites therefore rhyman can help explore the hydrological and ecological outcomes e g vegetation dominance depending on the relative balance between net freshwater inflow and variable sea level rise although rhyman simulations have provided evidence of the close balance between freshwater input and slr a landscape level assessment is needed to understand if the mangrove marsh ecotone region will be resilient to proposed hydrological management decisions danielson et al 2017 lugo 1980 rivera monroy et al 2019 or if it is currently beyond a tipping point as cerp undergoes full implementation national academies of sciences 2016 because hydrological restoration implies restoring freshwater flows to promote freshwater vegetation expansion and avoid for example peat collapse chambers et al 2019 ellison and stoddart 1991 servais et al 2020 snedaker 1995 as a result of saltwater intrusion key restoration decisions are needed to continue the adaptative implementation and management of cerp national academies of sciences 2016 this includes the

upland water surface flow into the study area throughfall represents the actual precipitation volume reaching the forest floor 95 of total precipitation twilley and chen 1998 thus surface water flow was equal to daily average throughfall multiplied by a runoff coefficient 90 daily seepage was also a site specific constant for each simulation and determined by water level records obtained at each site when the water level was below soil surface and no precipitation occurred in one day then seepage was considered as the difference between et and the change in water level on that particular day twilley and chen 1998 specific magnitudes are listed in table 2 a 2 topographic and hydrological parameters three topographic parameters table 2 including ground relative surface level bankfull stage and edge threshold characterize the local relative elevation settings at each study site ground surface level and bankfull stage were determined via sensitivity analysis while edge threshold was site specific this parameter should be directly measured or determined by linear regression between water levels in the channel and inland forest when channel water floods the mangrove floor e g tsai 2008 particularly given the relatively long study period 2004 2016 the ground surface level changed over years due to the sediment deposition transportation associated with tidal exchange and storms especially at the local micro scale additionally the zero marker of the channel water level data was changed in some years due to hurricane damage re installation to adjust these year specific modifications the ground surface level varied over the study period table 2 hydrological parameters controlling water and salt exchange are site specific or adapted from hyman and include specific yield for aboveground and underground water salt content exported by channel water tidal cycle or surface flow and precipitation canopy interception table 2 appendix b model initialization rhyman includes the implementation of four main sub routines given site differences in stages associated with channel and in situ water level and local topography fig s1 fig s2 before each simulation one year initial water level and pws values were defined using december values from the previous year thus rhyman first evaluates if the initial water level in the mangrove wetland is aboveground high water or belowground low water fig s2 the model then compares the channel water level to the edge threshold to determine the actual water level in the channel relative to the forest ground based on the actual water level in the channel the model then determines if the soil is flooded tide or not notide each day therefore rhyman executes one sub routine in one day to calculate water level salt content and pws sequentially as influenced by each hydrological component as stated in the model description appendix c sensitivity analysis sensitivity s was defined by the following equation c1 s δ x j x j δ p i p where pi is the best estimate of a given parameter i δpi is the change in parameter i xj is the state variable j i e pws and water level δxj is the change in the j state variable caused by a change in the parameter i values the higher the s absolute value of a given parameter the more sensitive the model is to such parameter negative s represents the negative relationship between parameter change and the change in the state variable because the specific yield aboveground and precipitation interception value range from 0 to 1 table 2 we only calculated the s value with 25 change of the best estimate 0 95 appendix d statistical measures d 1 bias the bias indicates the over or under estimate by comparing the simulated value to observations it is the difference between the mean of simulated values and mean of observations d1 b i a s i 1 n s i o i n where si and oi are the simulated and observed values of state variables i e water level and pws at each time n is the total number of observations d 2 coefficient of determination r2 the coefficient of determination r2 represents the proportion of the variance in the observed variables that can be predicted from the simulated variable it measures the linear regression between the simulated and observed values as defined by the following equation d2 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 d 3 root mean square error rmse the root mean square error rmse measures how much error is between simulated and observed values the smaller the rmse value is the closer the simulated value is to the observation the rmse is calculated using the following equation d3 r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n d 4 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is defined as d4 n s e 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 the nse determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the observed value variance this efficiency ranges from to 1 and measure how well the regression between simulated and observed values is compared to 1 1 line the negative value indicates that the mean of the observed values is a better predictor than the simulated value wang et al 2012 
24742,in this letter we present comments on the article a global scale ecological niche model to predict sars cov 2 coronavirus by coro published in 2020 keywords covid 19 pandemic data validation open science interdisciplinary research 1 introduction the recent outbreak of sars cov 2 infections which causes covid 19 in humans has accelerated the development of global health policies to manage and mitigate the risks of infectious diseases wilder smith et al 2020 concurrently the medical scientific community has been mobilized to provide clinical support during the pandemic kupferschmidt and cohen 2020 this pandemic has also attracted the interest of non medical researchers hoping to understand potential environmental drivers of sars cov 2 prevalence and to predict future outbreaks via correlative methods such as species distribution models sdms coro 2020 presented an implementation of a sdm to predict global areas of high sars cov 2 infection rate from geophysical and social related spatial covariates that he found to be correlated with high infection rates while contributing to a broader understanding of the potential geographic scope of the pandemic is a commendable effort the application of a correlative model to estimate sars cov 2 s ecological niche given the epidemiology of transmission as well as technical aspects of model implementation highlights the drawbacks of using this approach to predict future outbreaks of sars cov 2 we contend that such sdm implementations are prone to spurious results meaning that they have a high potential for finding correlations between mechanistically unrelated variables especially when model assumptions are violated and spatial scaling between covariates and mechanistic processes are mismatched therefore extreme care should be taken when disseminating and overinterpreting correlative research without strong a priori mechanistic hypotheses particularly in the midst of a pandemic as incorrect conclusions about drivers of viral spread may have negative consequences if used as guidance by policy makers indeed coro s model did identify correlations between putative explanatory variables and high infection rates however below we argue that such correlations are unlikely to be biologically relevant both because the variables considered lack mechanistic plausibility in this setting as well as other flaws in model implementation herein we present our concerns with the foundational premise of coro 2020 to model the ecological niche of sars cov 2 as well as the implementation and interpretation of modeling results we suggest that coro s 2020 claim that generally the model indicates a high infection rate in areas characterized by an annual moderate high level of co2 moderate low temperatures and moderate precipitation is problematic for two primary reasons 1 sdms do not accurately predict the dynamic geography of sars cov 2 transmission because the underlying drivers of viral spread are dominated by human behavior carlson et al 2020 and 2 the paper overlooks substantial predictive misclassifications model assumptions and validations 2 sdms are not suitable for modeling emerging sars cov 2 spread sdms typically use the locations where a species is recorded as being present and if possible where the species is recorded as being absent to build a statistical model of the occurrence of the species with environmental covariates in order to predict its distribution the correct application of an sdm requires that the species has a clear environmental niche even if that niche is unknown to the researcher and that its distributional data are reflective of that niche václavík and meentemeyer 2012 gallien et al 2012 the use of an sdm to predict viral spread does not meet these requirements because sars cov 2 presumably originated from a single spillover event andersen et al 2020 and further transmission has resulted from human to human contact and not through a vector with an identifiable ecological niche carlson et al 2020 moreover the virus is continuing to spread across the globe into new environments driven primarily by human social contact patterns liu et al 2020 such that the distribution of occurrence at any one point in time likely does not accurately reflect any sort of theoretical ecological niche chipperfield et al 2020 although coro s 2020 model includes human related parameters of population density and co2 levels in addition to climatic variables they inadequately describe other social related factors that drive transmission beyond human abundance such as but not limited to social contact dynamics behavior changes from perceived threat of infection governmental policy and its timing of implementation socioeconomic factors across different regions of a country and across countries and the timing of infection peaks 2 1 the pandemic is a dynamic process coro 2020 derived an occurrence of high infection rate response variable that is constructed by selecting the provinces in italy that have a higher number of confirmed cases per capita than the national average up until march 2020 representing the peak of the pandemic in italy however this process does not improve the suitability of the application of an sdm firstly the pandemic is a dynamic process markov processes operating within human contact networks alone are sufficient to expect that areas of italy which don t currently have high infection rates may later become the high infection areas as epidemics potentially take hold in those places whilst declining in the areas affected earlier given the north south gradient of environmental conditions in italy then we might expect the entire correlation between occurrence and climate to change depending on when during the outbreak we perform the analysis the proposed climate occurrence signal may in fact be noise because the provinces identified as high infection rate can and do change if case data from one day preceding or following the period analyzed by coro are omitted or included therefore the model is not robust to making accurate predictions outside of that time period it is widely appreciated that sdms and similar correlative spatial models are susceptible to spurious findings through random covariance of spatially structured variables alone with no causal link currie et al 2019 bahn and mcgill 2007 fourcade et al 2018 therefore a priori care in selecting covariates and accounting for spatial autocorrelation is paramount to avoiding spurious inferences in sdms currie et al 2019 austin 2007 merow et al 2013 in this case transmission of sars cov 2 is largely by droplets generated from human to human interaction so there is unlikely to be a strong effect of climate especially as most transmission occurs indoors allen and marr 2020 3 flaws in model implementation and validation coro 2020 dichotomized continuous values of infection rate using as threshold the average number of confirmed cases per capita at the peak of the pandemic in italy to derive a response variable with the categories occurrence and absence of high infection rate the dichotomization of continuous data has well known negative consequences such as overestimation of effect sizes and loss of measurement reliability maccallum et al 2002 overestimation of the differences between groups altman and royston 2006 and distortion of the relationship between predictive and response variables selving 1987 furthermore howard et al 2014 demonstrate that using a proxy of abundance such as per capita infection rate as input for a sdm lead to distribution estimates significantly better than those derived from presence absence data because the signal abundance suitability is lost when all presences are treated as equals for example treating above average per capita infection rates as equals in the presence category may lead to a high bias if very high infection rates are scarce within the dataset and just above average infection rates are environmentally clustered by chance due to the north to south climatic and infection gradients in italy in such a case high suitability values yielded by maxent will be centered around the presences with lower infection rates within the presence category such a problem may only worsen if there is not much difference between infection rates at both sides of the threshold using such knowledge coro 2020 could have made a sound choice by using per capita infection rates as a continuous response variable in a regression model rather than obscuring potential relationships between the response variable and the predictors through a convenient maxent can only use a dichotomous variable as response albeit arbitrary dichotomization as a result biases in coro s analysis cannot be assessed and remain masked behind the apparent reliability of a colorful map moreover coro s paper does not acknowledge or address violations of model assumptions beyond the existence of a viral niche that significantly affect results and their interpretation such as scaling mismatch between species data modeled here as locations with high viral incidence rate and predictor variables and equilibrium of the species with its environment guisan and zimmerman 2000 additionally the poor model validation described in the manuscript undermines the paper s primary conclusions to wit the conclusions that climatic parameters such as air temperature and precipitation or air humidity play a critical role at defining locations that may be subject to a high infection rate is unsupported based on the model diagnostics presented in the paper we elaborate these details in the next three sections 3 1 scale mismatch and prediction outside model domain coro 2020 used a maxent model which is known to be highly prone to bias resulting from non random training samples elith et al 2011 merow et al 2013 gurutzeta et al 2015 coro s model was initially trained on data restricted to point locations of capital cities of italian provinces with a high incidence of infections which is a non representative sample for predictive extrapolation to the whole planet jarnevich et al 2015 to test whether the geographic scope of the training data influenced model performance the author retrained the model first by adding areas that were initially well predicted by the base model and re assessing model fit unsurprisingly the inclusion of these areas did not substantially affect model performance however when the training area was expanded to include areas with poor predictive validation model performance dropped the author states that this result indicates that the used input parameters are insufficient to understand the infection rate increase in these areas thus the fitted model is not suitable for predicting areas of high infection rate on a global scale we find the poor predictive performance of the model unsurprising because the restricted geographic extent of the training data limits the explanatory power of relatively coarse resolution 0 5 covariate data used by coro mertes and jetz 2018 particularly for the co2 flux data that was reprojected to a 0 5 resolution from the original copernicus co2 data product coro and trumpy 2020 which has an even coarser resolution of 3 75 in longitude by 1 87 in latitude cams copernicus atmosphere monitoring service 2019 model results suggest co2 flux as the variable with the highest predictive power however even after resampling from the original coarser resolution correlative associations between co2 and high incident rates of covid 19 are drawn from only 26 unique values that are unrepresentative of variation of values globally thus global extrapolation is outside of the original model domain and based on a limited amount of information furthermore the 0 5 resolution of covariate data is mismatched in scale with high infection rates because it is derived from case data summarized by province and geo referenced by the location of the province capital city this leads to substantial model bias because any grid cells within the province that do not overlap the point location of the capital city are falsely ignored by the model as true presence locations leading to missed covariate associations particularly for co2 flux and population density which may have substantially different values in grid cells not overlapping with the capital city given the bias introduced by an unrepresentative sample and scaling mismatch rather than implying the modeled viral niche does validate across the range of sars cov 2 due to an undiscovered separate set of environmental correlates for viral spread in these poorly predicted areas we suggest that incomplete predictive accuracy implies estimated correlations that might be spurious i e not causally related 3 2 sars cov 2 is spreading through human social interactions a system not in equilibrium another key assumption of sdms including maxent models is that the modeled species distribution is a stationary function of some environmental variable s austin 2002 guisan and zimmerman 2000 elith et al 2011 however this assumption does not hold true for invasive species at the onset of immigration into a new area since the geography of occurrence is still shifting and likely expanding theoharides and dukes 2007 phillips et al 2008 thus the assumption of an equilibrium distribution is unmet by the emerging pandemic whose emerging spatial distribution is dynamic and primarily influenced by human social contact networks rather than abiotic environmental factors liu et al 2020 see also section 2 1 3 3 predictive misclassification coro s 2020 model misclassifies 22 75 of known high infection rate areas where areas are defined by a mix of geopolitical units based on world health organization data who 2020 at the time the revised paper was submitted to the journal june 11 2020 the missed areas from a visual inspection of fig 3 in coro 2020 cover over a quarter of the cumulative global case load today those areas cover nearly 30 of the cumulative global case load we suggest that such substantial underprediction of extant outbreaks indicates poor model performance rendering inferences drawn from the model not informative 4 conclusion we found little convincing evidence that this global scale ecological niche model predicts sars cov 2infection rate due to the drawbacks that we identified in the model implementation validation and interpretation as well as in the premise of an identifiable ecological niche for the spread of this particular virus all modelling exercises require careful consideration of modeling assumptions in relation to study design and data collection for making interpretations that are meaningful and repeatable given the limitations of sdms in particular we recommend that future efforts to forecast sars cov 2 outbreaks and or to predict the spatial occurrence of other viruses with a similar ecology to sars cov 2 be avoided carlson et al 2020 fundamentally these outbreaks represent a non equilibrium process with an environmental niche constrained almost entirely by that of its host organism in this case humans and with range dynamics that sdms have a poor track record of predicting well there may be cases for limited application of well considered sdms for directly transmitted diseases in appropriate scenarios such as the modelling of the occurrence of reservoir hosts of infectious disease transmissible from animals to humans zhu and peterson 2014 carlson et al 2016 and or to make assessments of wildlife ecology and conservation strategies higgins et al 2012 however the direct application of an sdm for the occurrence of a directly transmitted disease with a host species that has affected an estimated 95 of the earth s land surface is never likely to be informative declaration of competing

extrapolation is outside of the original model domain and based on a limited amount of information furthermore the 0 5 resolution of covariate data is mismatched in scale with high infection rates because it is derived from case data summarized by province and geo referenced by the location of the province capital city this leads to substantial model bias because any grid cells within the province that do not overlap the point location of the capital city are falsely ignored by the model as true presence locations leading to missed covariate associations particularly for co2 flux and population density which may have substantially different values in grid cells not overlapping with the capital city given the bias introduced by an unrepresentative sample and scaling mismatch rather than implying the modeled viral niche does validate across the range of sars cov 2 due to an undiscovered separate set of environmental correlates for viral spread in these poorly predicted areas we suggest that incomplete predictive accuracy implies estimated correlations that might be spurious i e not causally related 3 2 sars cov 2 is spreading through human social interactions a system not in equilibrium another key assumption of sdms including maxent models is that the modeled species distribution is a stationary function of some environmental variable s austin 2002 guisan and zimmerman 2000 elith et al 2011 however this assumption does not hold true for invasive species at the onset of immigration into a new area since the geography of occurrence is still shifting and likely expanding theoharides and dukes 2007 phillips et al 2008 thus the assumption of an equilibrium distribution is unmet by the emerging pandemic whose emerging spatial distribution is dynamic and primarily influenced by human social contact networks rather than abiotic environmental factors liu et al 2020 see also section 2 1 3 3 predictive misclassification coro s 2020 model misclassifies 22 75 of known high infection rate areas where areas are defined by a mix of geopolitical units based on world health organization data who 2020 at the time the revised paper was submitted to the journal june 11 2020 the missed areas from a visual inspection of fig 3 in coro 2020 cover over a quarter of the cumulative global case load today those areas cover nearly 30 of the cumulative global case load we suggest that such substantial underprediction of extant outbreaks indicates poor model performance rendering inferences drawn from the model not informative 4 conclusion we found little convincing evidence that this global scale ecological niche model predicts sars cov 2infection rate due to the drawbacks that we identified in the model implementation validation and interpretation as well as in the premise of an identifiable ecological niche for the spread of this particular virus all modelling exercises require careful consideration of modeling assumptions in relation to study design and data collection for making interpretations that are meaningful and repeatable given the limitations of sdms in particular we recommend that future efforts to forecast sars cov 2 outbreaks and or to predict the spatial occurrence of other viruses with a similar ecology to sars cov 2 be avoided carlson et al 2020 fundamentally these outbreaks represent a non equilibrium process with an environmental niche constrained almost entirely by that of its host organism in this case humans and with range dynamics that sdms have a poor track record of predicting well there may be cases for limited application of well considered sdms for directly transmitted diseases in appropriate scenarios such as the modelling of the occurrence of reservoir hosts of infectious disease transmissible from animals to humans zhu and peterson 2014 carlson et al 2016 and or to make assessments of wildlife ecology and conservation strategies higgins et al 2012 however the direct application of an sdm for the occurrence of a directly transmitted disease with a host species that has affected an estimated 95 of the earth s land surface is never likely to be informative declaration of competing

24743,parental management of early offspring development is a complex but essential contribution to reproductive success for oviparous species mothers faced with incubating eggs in a variable environment maximize reproductive success by adaptively adjusting offspring number in a clutch and incubation schedules to facilitate egg development while meeting their own energetic demands however the optimal resolution of these trade offs varies with physiological and ecological factors and is thus hard to determine using empirical data from natural systems to untangle the complex factors driving optimal maternal decisions we developed an ecophysiological model that identifies optimal maternal strategies and their implications for offspring comparing results for example altricial and precocial species we showed how plastic maternal strategies can ameliorate effects of food scarcity offspring mortality risk variable levels of biparental care and constraints on producing multiple clutches within a season in the altricial case in particular we identified important downstream fitness effects from decisions made in the incubation stage additionally we showed that seasonal decreases in clutch size may result from cumulative fecundity costs for the altricial case and from a seasonal decline in female quality for precocial species many of the novel results in this study are testable in future empirical work keywords ecophysiology energetics life history dynamics parental care seasonal trends temperature dynamics 1 introduction previous studies have posited generalized hypotheses for predicting patterns of parental investment across species however empirical work on different species even within the same taxon yields both strong support and rejection of these hypotheses this conflict necessitates an investigation into how species specific ecophysiology and life history influence optimal parental investment for oviparous species in particular key decisions about parental investment begin early with establishing clutch size and for species that incubate continue during embryonic development with establishing incubation schedules altering the embryonic thermal environment via incubation has important downstream effects on offspring phenotype and ultimately on fitness o donnell and arnold 2005 van damme et al 1992 durant et al 2010 durant et al 2013a incubation behavior is highly variable among organisms but similar basic constraints and trade offs arise across this diversity incubating parents must utilize their own energetic resupply williams 1995 may sacrifice mating opportunities sargent 1985 incur costs to immune function and or reduce future reproduction capabilities hanssen et al 2005 thus incubation effort is a key determinant of parental fitness but current theory of optimal incubation remains imprecise klug and bonsall 2014 further parental investment encompasses both the production and subsequent care of offspring and parental fitness is a function of offpsring survival to recruitment thus in order to accurately predict optimal parental behavior we need to consider how parental decisions cascade through all stages of offpsring development it is clear that optimal parental decisions such as clutch size and incubation effort can vary with both abiotic and biotic factors such as climate species physiology food availability help from conspecifics mortality risk and female state nord et al 2010 nord and nilsson 2012 thomson et al 1998 hałupka 1994 gorman and nager 2003 since these factors often covary and they may vary at the species population individual and within individual levels it is challenging to determine which factors drive optimal parental decisions and in what direction using empirical data for example food level influences the energetic state of females and has been shown to positively impact both clutch size and incubation effort thomson et al 1998 korpimaki and wiehn 1998 nord and nilsson 2012 chalfoun and martin 2007 however supplemental feeding of blue tits cyanistes caerulus resulted in reduced brood sizes harrison et al 2010 additionally the presence of a male partner that also incubates the eggs generally reduces female incubation effort by reducing incubation needs and by facilitating nest defense matysioková and remeš 2014 fontaine and martin 2006 but again evidence is equivocal female new zealand robins petroica longipes do not adjust their nest attentiveness with male help boulton et al 2010 offspring mortality risk that cannot be mitigated is predicted to reduce parental investment low 1978 but the opportunity to test this effect empirically without conflating it with parental mortality risk is rare finally for species that breed iteratively within a season parental investment into successive broods may vary rowe et al 1994 but whether this variation is driven by a physiological constraint or a shifting optimum is often unclear making sense of these ambiguities in the empirical literature necessitates a way to simultaneously consider the complex variable ecological circumstances that incubating parents face this challenge can be addressed by creating a physiologically and behaviorally based ecologically relevant model of parental incubation we focus our study on the key trade off between incubation and foraging by a female parent assuming that she cannot sustain a daily energy deficit to do this we build and implement an ecophysiological model that optimizes maternal clutch size egg number and incubation behavior the length and frequency of daily foraging trips with respect to maternal fitness maternal fitness is a function of the number of offpsring produced in a breeding season that survive to recruitment the model allows variable input for species physiology ambient temperature food availability male help level mortality risk to offpsring and successive clutch effects with a season we parameterized the model based on birds for which most of the energetic and behavioral parameters can be estimated distinguishing between precocial species specifically the wood duck a sponsa and altricial species the house sparrow p domesticus we summarize this framework in fig 1 in this analysis we evaluate the implications of optimal adjustments to clutch size and incubation for two species by assessing 4 key questions and hypotheses about optimal parental investment 1 how does food availability influence incubation and clutch size hypothesis 1 food availability should have a threshold effect making little difference unless it falls low enough to threaten the female s ability to achieve a daily energy balance 2 how does male help with incubation influence female incubation and clutch size in the altricial case hypothesis 2 the male contribution should accelerate egg development allowing the female to reduce incubation effort and increase clutch size e g fessl et al 1996 3 how does baseline mortality in the three primary developmental stages egg chick juvenile influence optimal incubation and clutch size hypothesis 3 cascading sequential effects of the developmental stages will create non linearities in effects of early stage mortality on fitness 4 what mechanism best explains the observed seasonal decline of clutch sizes and how do these mechanisms affect optimal incubation hypothesis 4a a cumulative fecundity cost reduces female s ability to invest in offpsring number and care with each offspring produced jones and ward 1976 4b food availability declines over the season driving a declining clutch size consistent with hypothesis 3 above 4c lower quality females are expected to have their smaller clutches with reduced incubation effort accounting for a large proportion of the late season clutches hochachka 1990 and 4d a cost to the survival of offspring that fledge later in the season due to reduced resources before winter decreasing the value of investing in these late offspring winkler and allen 1996 we proceed by first providing an overview of the model and then working through the mathematical details presenting the derivation of the development rates and nest attentiveness effects in appendices with the model parameterized for house sparrows and wood ducks we address the four questions and associated hypotheses considering the implications of the results in the context of the literature and some potential future directions for advancing this exercise in the discussion in an appendix we also provide supporting analysis of responses to environmental temperature in which flexible clutch size and foraging schedule and the availability of male help are particularly important 2 materials and methods 2 1 model overview we envision a sequence of clutches produced and fledged during a single reproductive season each clutch may be incubated by a female alone or by both parents when a male is present his role is assumed to be supplementary he arrives at the nest randomly and if the female is gone he incubates until she returns nest attentiveness involves incubation to increase development rate which is positively tied to egg temperature fig 2 and can also provide some protection from predators and intrusive conspecifics parameters linked to these phenomena and others addressed in this analysis are listed in table 1 we assume that given her energetic constraints the female chooses to lay an optimal number of eggs of a fixed volume and selects an optimal incubation pattern in our model these strategies are determined to be optimal relative to her state given the environmental constraints that she experiences and may not represent her optima without those specific physiological constraints we assume she leaves to forage at sunrise and returns to re warm and incubate the eggs repeating this sequence an optimal number of times over the day before returning at dusk to initiate consistent nocturnal incubation fig 2 ambient conditions and day length in our model was parameterized for populations of wood duck and house sparrow in the northeastern usa and variation in day length and ambient conditions may impact the ability to extrapolate these results for avian populations located elsewhere she maximizes her fitness by optimally trading off energy gain during these foraging bouts against her need to incubate the clutch to maximize its development rate subject to the constraint of her own energetic demands she is able to balance her foraging energy gains against losses incurred through tending the eggs so that her short term energy reserves are maintained from day to day this simplifying assumption of daily energy balance must be at least approximately true to avoid rapid accumulation of a debilitating maternal energy deficit we assume that any net costs of maternal reproductive effort are incurred in production of any subsequent within season clutches the male in species with male care in this model only the house sparrow case can increase clutch development rate and protection only while the female forages though generally with less efficient heat transfer than the female due to the lack of a brood patch to determine the fitness associated with a particular number of eggs per clutch and the nest tending by the parents we track the clutch through the chick stage and after fledging until the offspring are ready to reproduce themselves hereafter the juvenile stage overall mortality rates including predation may differ among egg chick and juvenile stages the stage specific survival also reflects the time spent in each stage as a function of incubation level life history patterns associated with altricial or precocial offspring until fledging generally differ strongly in the chick stage the need for parents to feed altricial offspring can produce density dependent growth and mortality based on the number of chick mouths to feed with the available total parental effort whereas the more independent precocial offspring are less influenced by the number of siblings regardless predation can also be density dependent in both offspring types particularly in the chick stage the number of clutches within a season depends on the total development time to fledging the interval duration between clutches and the reproductive season length the model explicitly addresses four different effects that may lead to seasonal sequences of clutch sizes the cumulative fecundity cost in which the cumulative number of offpsring produced by a female inhibits her capacity to produce as many eggs in later clutches the food availability effect in which a seasonal decline in food level drives changes in clutch size the female quality effect in which females that nest late in the season tend primarily to be those of lower quality and the late fledging cost in which later fledging implies diminished ability of offspring to overwinter successfully 2 2 embryonic development rate embryonic development rate d is a function of clutch temperature t fig 2 and clutch temperature is a function of time t fig 3 thus d d t t to obtain the daily clutch development rate d t t must be integrated across the nested functions and their daily variation let d be the mean development rate over the relevant interval and tj is the duration of each interval identified by the subscript j then with only females tending the nest and foraging for f daily cycles we have 1 d f t t 1 t d t n f t c d c t t t r d r t t t i d i t t t n t i d n t t where td tn is the duration of a day as daytime plus nighttime and subscript c indicates the clutch cooling phase r is the female tended rewarming phase i is the female incubation phase at optimal developmental temperature and n is the nocturnal female incubation phase with a male present the details depend on when the male arrives and some additional terms are required 2 d m t t 1 t d t n f t c d c t t t r d r t t t i d i t t t r d r t t t i d i t t t n d n t t where subscript r is the male tended re warming phase and i is the male incubation phase a general solution for cyclical female foraging and incubation and random male supplementary incubation is provided in appendix a there we solve analytically for any particular male arrival time and describe how the exponential probability density function of male arrival times is simulated to produce our results the fraction of time that a nest is attended by a parent is specifically addressed in appendix b 2 3 energetics temperature and heat transfer we track the energy balance of the female as she gains energy reserves by foraging and expends them through energetic expenditure during foraging and tending the clutch her assimilation rate a is based on a type ii functional response holling 1959 to the available food level f with rate of successful search a handling time b and assimilation efficiency ε 3 a ε a f 1 a b f the net energy gain per foraging bout is 4 a t f k t t t f where tf is the duration of a foraging bout tt is the travel time to find a foraging site and k is the rate of energy expenditure

daytime and nighttime temperatures assumed constant during each interval and over the season for tractability kfa is the rate of heat loss from the female to the air and afa is the area of contact between the female and the air since we assume foraging to be restricted to daytime we can now express the energy expenditure rate during traveling and foraging k as 9 k k 0 b r d where k 0 b is the extra energy cost rate of foraging activities the energy cost of reheating n eggs from tr egg temperature when the female returns from foraging to tb is 10 e r t b t r s e m e n where se is the

times number of foraging cycles and clutch size we can now express the female s energy balance over a day as 13 f a t f k 0 b t t t f e r t d r d t n r n 0 since er contains an exponential

e n f 1 this is because there are f 1 intervals between foraging bouts during daytime except that with a single foraging episode incubation is from the cessation of foraging until nightfall we are now able to use the fitness equation below to choose the fitness maximizing optimal clutch size n and the number of foraging cycles f which determines tf and ti optimal clutch size however may be constrained by a physiological upper limit nx monaghan et al 1995 we suppose that the time to build a nest and lay the clutch regardless of clutch size is fixed at tb and that energy required to produce the clutch is acquired by the female with diminishing returns over time then the physiologically constrained optimal egg number is 15 n n x 1 e k b t b and 16 k b a k 0 b r d t d r n t n e e t d t n where ee is the energy content of an egg this makes the constrained optimal clutch size likely to be determined mainly by this physiological upper limit for precocial birds but more intense density dependence on clutch size may yield optimal clutch sizes well below the physiological limit for altricial birds 2 5 fitness equation we express female fitness ωi derived from individual clutch i as one half of the clutch size ni based on her relatedness to offspring multiplied by the survival li of these individuals to their own subsequent reproduction 17 ω i 0 5 n i l i 0 5 n i l h l f l p

imposes density dependent mortality when the exponent x 0 and 1 dm is embryonic development time see appendix a since nlh is the number of chicks we let 20 l f e μ f n l h z 1 τ where μf is the coefficient of mortality rate from hatching to fledging and the n l h z 1 term imposes density dependent mortality on chicks with z 1 as the relevant exponent and τ is the time from hatching to

mortality rate from fledging to parenthood and tg is the generation time 2 6 seasonal fitness and the sequence of clutch sizes we let the female s fitness over an entire reproductive season ω be 24 ω i 1 c ω i where c is the maximal number of clutches that can fit into a season given tf ti tt the time between clutches tb and the length of the reproductive season ts but clutches may differ in egg number and thus in contribution to fitness over the season in this analysis we address the cumulative fecundity cost of previous clutches diminishing offspring survival through the chick stage based on the cumulative number of eggs produced in previous clutches we then have 25 l f i e μ f n y τ j 1 i 1 n j v where the index j specifies the sequence of clutches before the current clutch i and v is the cumulative clutch cost exponent for the food availability effect we envision a linear decline in food abundance from f for the first clutch down to fnf for the last of c clutches this implies 26 f

reached at clutch c we conducted two types of sensitivity analyses to determine which parameters had the greatest effect on fitness elasticity analysis and to evaluate variation in response variables when the most influential parameters expressed plausible simultaneous variation in magnitudes hyperpyramid analysis those results are presented in appendix d but summarized below in the results section the computer programs in matlab 2018a used to generate the results throughout this analysis are available on request from the authors 2 7 model validation this model predicts patterns of incubation strategies of both a precocial and altricial species in response to multiple variable environmental parameters because of this complexity there is currently no all encompassing dataset that can be used to precisely validate our model output however we specifically sought out empirical results from our model species that tested our key results to make quantitative comparisons to our model output to the extent to which these data are available for the house sparrow case we compared results from an experimental test of house sparrow male help level on female incubation behavior schwagermeyer et al 2008 and an observational study parsing the variation in house sparrow clutch size across the season both within and among individuals for 4892 clutches westneat et al 2014 for wood ducks we compared results from a study that investigated the effects of food level via multiple proxies on wood duck incubation behavior folk and hepp 2003 and an observational study of how double brooding in wood ducks n 429 clutches relates to clutch size season and maternal quality kennamer and hepp 1987 finally in order to assess the generality of our results we expanded our search to studies from a variety of altricial and precocial species to validate whether our output is reflective of broader patterns in avian incubators we address matches and mismatches between our model output and empirical findings in the discussion 3 results first we provide a summary of the general relationships between clutch size incubation behavior and maternal fitness for both house sparrows and wood ducks hereafter sparrows and ducks respectively facing temperate ambient conditions for sparrows 5 eggs was the optimal clutch size which was primarily limited by increased provisioning load with more chicks fig 4 a for ducks who do not provision chicks optimal clutch size was as high as the number of eggs a female can produce 12 eggs in this case fig 4b for sparrows the optimal number of foraging bouts for sparrows was 30 per day of 3 5 min each with intervening diurnal incubation intervals of 16 0 min fig 4c the fitness above 30 daily bouts plateaus suggesting that the actual numbers of bouts per day both within and between individuals may vary considerably fewer than 30 bouts per day provided insufficient energy under the gut limitation constraint for sparrows in contrast optimal foraging frequency for ducks was twice per day at 13 0 min each with a long diurnal incubation interval of 684 1 min between fig 4d 3 1 food level concerning question 1 how does food availability influence incubation and clutch size food level influences optimal maternal decisions for both species but had a stronger effect on sparrows than on ducks for sparrows the default food level of 2 is adjacent to a fitness cliff fig 5 a below which eggs develop more slowly because the female must leave the nest more frequently and thereby reduce her overall attentiveness fig 5c due to this delayed development and increased egg mortality optimal clutch size increased at the lowest food level for sparrows fig 5a c the low food threshold came into play only well below default food levels for ducks fig 5b as with sparrows below the duck fitness cliff foraging frequency increased and led to decreased attentiveness fig 5d in contrast to sparrows optimal duck clutch size decreased at the lowest food level fig 5d 3 2 food level model validation folk and hepp measured wood duck incubation behavior relative to variation in female habitat quality and distance from the nest to the feeding area 2003 their female attentiveness averaged around 81 3 0 8 with a range of 70 8 93 8 with and average foraging bouts of 2 2 0 3 per day in comparison our attentiveness ranged from 76 to 97 8 with 2 foraging bouts per day except at an extremely low food level 1 at which she took 8 foraging bouts per day in the empirical study both proxies of food availability yielded conflicting results females significantly decreased their attentiveness in better habitats 0 077 0 028 but increased their attentiveness with distance to foraging site 0 025 0 008 we found an 22 drop in attentiveness at low food levels 0 5 but a negligible change above a food level of 5 using body condition data folk and hepp conclude that their wood ducks were not food limited which reflects our chosen standard food level indeed a positive effect of food level on attentiveness is supported by experimental and observational studies in both altricial lothery et al 2014 vafidis et al 2018 zimmerling and ankney 2005 koski et al 2020 londoño et al 2008 rauter and reyer 1997 and precocial species henson and cooper 1993 maccluskie and sedinger 1999 bentzen et al 2010 tombre et al 2012 we conclude that our food results generally match empirical results 3 3 male incubation help for question 2 how does male help with incubation influence female incubation and clutch size in the altricial case we examined the effects of male incubation help for sparrows only the species with biparental care surprisingly fitness remained nearly constant regardless of the time between male arrivals fig 6 a likely due to females reducing their own incubation effort but increasing their clutch size with reduced male help fig 6b female sparrow attentiveness dropped sharply with increasing male arrival times closely approaching her attentiveness level with no male help above about 30 min fig 6b however female foraging frequency barely increased with male help although it showed marked variation due to the random property of male arrivals fig 6b 3 4 male incubation help model validation by manipulating testosterone schwagermeyer bartlett and mock were able to directly assess the effect of male incubation variation on female incubation behavior in house sparrows 2008 overall control females left the nest on average 30 times per day which closely matches our standard female behavior 30 off bouts per day at the default male help level control males left the nest for an average of 14 2 min 5 31 leading to an average biparental attentiveness of 86 compared to our standard 10 min between male arrivals producing an overall biparental attentiveness of 88 manipulated males reduced their overall incubation contribution by an average of 42 and led to a 22 increase in average female contributions and a biparental attentiveness of 82 in our model a 42 reduction in standard male contribution led to a biparental attentiveness of 86 a 2 decrease in both the empirical work and our model output reductions in male care lead to partial female compensation however although partial compensation was also observed in response to natural variation in male incubation in black necked cranes grus nigricollis zhang et al 2017 experimental manipulations of male incubation level in different species have failed to produce an increase in female attentiveness that is statistically significant harrison et al 2009 ridder et al 2000 alonso alvarez 2001 we conclude that our effect of male help reflected the partial compensation found in real house sparrows but may be stronger than general among passerines 3 5 mortality risk to offspring concerning question 3 how does baseline mortality in the three primary developmental stages egg chick juvenile influence optimal incubation and clutch size offpsring mortality rates for each of the three developmental stages eggs chicks and juveniles resulted in contrasting predictions for sparrows and ducks for the egg stage of sparrows fitness maintained a plateau over low to moderate egg mortality rates before dropping at high mortality rates fig 7 a incubation levels also plateaued until high egg mortality levels where foraging frequency sharply increased resulting in reduced attentiveness fig 7c however optimal clutch size increased at low to moderate egg mortality risk until plateauing at the physiological limit 12 for high mortality levels fig 7c an opposite pattern resulted from varying chick mortality risk fitness sharply declined with increased mortality risk fig 7b with increased chick mortality risk foraging frequency declined attentiveness slightly increased and optimal clutch size dropped fig 7d this exemplifies the predicted cascading effect in which the fitness advantage of low egg mortality rate is offset by the disadvantage of increased numbers of surviving chicks that parents must provision in this case strong density dependence based on the limited amount of parental care available ultimately reduces chick survival limiting the fitness achieved from a larger clutch the effects of mortality risk during the stages of duck offspring development had much weaker effects on optimal maternal decisions during the egg stage fitness sharply dropped with increased egg mortality reflecting the lack of chick provisioning and thus reduced chick rearing costs in this species fig 8 a however optimal incubation behavior and optimal clutch size did not vary with egg mortality fig 8c chick mortality rate also produced a decrease in fitness similar to but weaker than the egg mortality effect fig 8b additionally chick mortality rate had no effect on optimal incubation or clutch size fig 8d 3 6 mortality risk to offspring model validation a meta analysis of north american passerines found that nest predation risk reduced off bout frequency but not attentiveness conway and martin 2000 whereas a study on great tits parus major found the opposite effect an increase in off bout frequency with no effect on attentiveness basso and richner 2015 alternatively sage grouse centrocercus urophasianus spent less time off the nest with greater nest predation coates and delehanty 2008 in our house sparrow model we saw minimal effects of offspring mortality on attentiveness but noticeable changes in off bout frequency the direction of which varied high egg mortality led to jump about 33 in off bout frequency similar to the great tit results whereas high chick mortality lead to a reduction in off bout frequency about 25 similar to the meta analysis results in our wood duck model we saw no changes to attentiveness or frequency and unfortunately there is a deficit of studies testing this specific effect in similar species with limited empirical evidence we conclude that our mortality effects partially reflect real effects in the altricial case but are not confirmed for the precocial case 3 7 successive clutches question 4 what mechanism best explains the observed seasonal decline of clutch sizes and how do these mechanisms affect optimal incubation incorporated multiple hypotheses to explain variation in successive clutch sizes and these again resulted in contrasting patterns for sparrows and ducks for sparrows the cumulative fecundity cost reduced clutch size between the first and second clutches based on our assumption of a consequent reduction in chick survival fig 9 a imposing this cost of parental investment also slowed development sufficiently to preclude a fourth clutch with seasonally declining food levels for sparrows there was an increase in foraging frequency with a consequent decrease in attentiveness along with an increase in clutch size fig 9b consistent with the food effects in fig 5c surprisingly the female quality effect did not affect house sparrow clutch size or incubation behavior between successive clutches fig 9c similarly the late fledging had no effect on successive clutch size or incubation fig 9d for ducks the cumulative fecundity cost had no effect on clutch size or optimal incubation behavior fig 10 a however seasonally declining food levels led to an increase in duck clutch size and a decrease in attentiveness reflecting the much lower food levels late in the season at the time of a second clutch fig 10b addtionally seasonally declining female quality strongly reduced clutch size in ducks but did not alter optimal incubation fig 10c as with sparrows the late fledging cost had no effect on duck clutch size or incubation fig 10d 3 8 successive clutches model validation in a wood duck population in south carolina 7 6 of females produced second broods with a significant reduction in clutch size within females of 13 to 10 eggs between successive broods p 0 01 kennamer and hepp 1987 kennamer and hepp 1987 found no significant effect of female age 2 6 v 2 4 p 0 49 or condition 610 vs 617 5 p 0 61 between single and double brooded females and further no difference in their clutch sizes 13 3 vs 13 5 p 0 94 however they did find that within double brooded females female condition reduced significantly from first to second brood 632 5 vs 572 5 we found that female quality was the only driver of reductions in seasonal clutch size our model clutch size averaged at 12 eggs with a reduction to 6 eggs in second brood this result is substantiated in later work by hepp and kennamer 2011 suggesting that poorer quality female wood ducks nest later to reduce reproductive costs westneat et al found that house sparrow clutch sizes averaged 4 6 eggs with a high level of variation 0 85 compared to our average of 5 eggs they found that the majority of the variation 0 64 0 02 in seasonal house sparrow clutch size was attributable to within individual effects vs among individual effects 0 11 0 01 in addition to year and population effects further clutch sizes declined with date both within individuals 0 009 0 0008 p 0 0001 and among individuals 0 007 0 001 p 0 0001 but increased with attempt number both within 0 12 0 03 p 0 0002 and among individuals 0 25 0 03 p 0 0001 we found a decrease in clutch size from 5 to 2 within females due to a cumulative fecundity cost along with a 2 egg increase from 5 to 7 in clutch size due to food level decline there was neither an effect of variation among females in quality nor an effect of fledgling survival on clutch size patterns and determinants of seasonal effects on clutch size are complex and variable among species for example some species show a simple linear reduction in clutch size with season gil delgado et al 2005 goodenough et al 2009 whereas some show a peak clutch size midseason dolenec et al 2011 suarez et al 2005 year can affect clutch patterns over the season suggesting that extrinsic factors like food level or condition limit clutch size westneat et al 2014 goodenough et al 2009 it has been posited that food level limits clutch size in wood ducks and mallards a platyrhynchos drobney and frederickson 1988 eldridge and krapu 1988 and condition limits clutch size in common eiders s mollissima and lesser scaup a affinis hanssen et al 2003 warren et al 2013 however food level was ruled out as a limitation on clutch size in wood ducks in a later analysis arnold and rohwer 1991 finally there is evidence that there is a cumulative reproductive cost in eastern bluebirds s sialis as larger first clutches resulted in smaller secondary clutches robinson et al 2010 we conclude that our successive clutch effects partially reflect real patterns in our model species but that our results are a simplification of complex interactions and are not generalizable across species 3 9 temperature effects to avoid extending the text beyond its present length the temperature effects summarized here are shown graphically in appendix c for sparrows temperature effects were minimal with flexible clutch size and foraging schedule and male help fig c 1 a and b but the absence of male help greatly slowed development at low temperatures fig c 1 c and d for ducks temperature effects were negligible at the high level of attentiveness provided by the female fig c 1 e and f comparisons in figs c 2 c 3 and c 4 show that flexibility in foraging schedule was especially important in supporting egg development at cooler temperatures 3 10 sensitivity analysis a full evaluation of parameter sensitivity is provided in appendix d table d 1 highlights the parameters that generate elasticities of 0 1 or above in absolute value the two focal species sometimes respond strongly to the same parameters generation time tg mortality rates of hatchlings and fledglings μf and μp the exponent linking assimilation to time to fledge w and the time to fledging coefficient τ 0 these are linked to growth and survival during development but house sparrows responded more strongly to feeding related parameters a 0 e a and f and wood ducks to development rate temperature and attentiveness parameters dx t 0 tm and μa food access is clearly an important issue for sparrows whereas ducks generally have good access to food but may be more at the mercy of environmental conditions for successful brood rearing the hyperpyramid results show strong differences in the five major responses between the two species fig d 1 using the criterion of statistical significance when the 95 confidence intervals both fail to overlap the mean of the other distribution we find significant differences for all responses except eggs per clutch in this case the consistent 12 eggs per clutch by wood ducks is occasionally matched by house sparrows though 5 7 eggs per clutch appears to be much more common in the model results as in nature d f westneat unpublished data wood ducks always had 2 foraging bouts per day while house sparrows were in the range of 25 40 bouts per day ducks were considerably more attentive even without male help allowed by their more efficient foraging development times were much longer for wood ducks than house sparrows in accord with the importance of development time effects on reproductive success noted above overall fitness per brood was much higher for ducks an important advantage since wood ducks do not often produce a second brood per year whereas house sparrows usually manage multiple broods annually these two ways of assessing sensitivity are complementary underscoring the major life history differences between the two species and perhaps more generally between altricial and precocial species 4 discussion 4 1 food level our results support the hypothesis of a threshold effect of food limitation on clutch size and foraging frequency in house sparrows but only to a limited extent in wood ducks our model validation confirms that this result reflects natural patterns of food limitation and incubation the same may follow for clutch size for example both eurasian kestrels falco tinnunculus and nazca boobies sula granti adjust clutch size with nutritional conditions korpimäki and wiehn 1998 clifford and anderson 2001 our results indicate that the strength of the influence of food availability on maternal investment is modified by species ecology as our precocial case was less prone to food limitation underscored by the sensitivity analysis however a meta analysis of diet type and foraging strategy do not alter general patterns of incubation among north american passerines conway and martin 2000 suggesting that food limitation effects may be more relevant at a within species level 4 2 male incubation help in our model adjustments by female house sparrows in response to male incubation assistance led to constant fitness levels independent of male arrival frequency we conclude that male incubation help does not necessarily increase reproductive success through nest attentiveness during incubation alone except when female fecundity and foraging behavior do not adjust to the attentiveness males can provide according to our model validation females tend to compensate only partially or not at all in response to male incubation level in our model supplementary male incubation becomes particularly important at stressful temperatures to avoid extending the text beyond the present length we incorporate these results and others on temperature effects in appendix c male contributions may also include incubation feeding and provisioning of offspring effects that were not included in our model however incubation feeding is similar to an extremely high food level in our model which produced increasingly minimal changes in female optima it is clear that male help can reduce the energetic burdens on females but the key question is the level to which females allocate that difference to current investment or future investment thus females may reduce care when males contribute reid et al 2002 diminishing or eliminating the benefit of male care to current offspring but increasing female lifetime reproductive success our model could be extended to allow for breeding over multiple seasons to further test how she optimizes her allocation of male contributions in contrast to the fixed strategy males in our model males may reduce help when extra pair paternity is common both because they may not have full paternity of the current brood and because they lose mating opportunities elsewhere by providing care matysioková and remeš 2014 though hypothesis 2 is supported only under special circumstances by the current model allowing males to optimize their help at both egg and chick stages in relation to extra pair paternity and female care may provide a more realistic test 4 3 mortality risk to offspring mortality risks to offspring and their effect on incubation optimization are hard to parse in natural systems as incubation behavior nest defense offspring risk and parental risk often intertwine indeed fewer studies parse out this effect specifically and effects seem to be expressed as changes in bout timing and not in overall attentiveness our model generates this effect only in the altricial case in which increased survival of eggs to hatching had negative effects on chick survival because of density dependent mortality and limited parental care consistent with our hypothesis 3 mock et al 2009 lack 1948 in the precocial case without strong density dependence we saw no effect however in both cases we saw mortality effects on optimal clutch size emphasizing that optimal clutch size must reflect the downstream effects on offspring mortality between the developmental stages that could drive hidden costs of larger broods previous attempts to account for optimal clutch size emphasize nestling growth and survival but do not account for juvenile mortality a review of experimental brood enlargements in 21 precocial seabird species demonstrated that parents could successfully rear extra offspring indicating that clutch size is not limited by rearing capacity in these cases ydenberg and bertram 1989 this was confirmed by a meta analysis of experimental brood enlargement studies vanderwerf 1992 however experimental brood enlargements in other passerines have resulted in reduced offspring weight but without a significant reduction offspring survival burness et al 2000 musgrove and wiebe 2014 sanz 1997 if parents are successful in rearing offspring but they produce poorer quality offspring then these costs may yield lower offspring survival to recruitment whereas many brood enlargement studies only follow offspring to fledging even so the parental response to increased offspring demand may vary for example house sparrows both increased and decreased their care level in response to brood enlargements suggesting that complex factors determine individual parental optima westneat and mutzel 2019 an important extension of our model would be to assess the effects of early developmental conditions on offspring survival to recruitment as evidence suggest that early growth rate can significantly affect adult phenotype lee et al 2012 another key extension would account for the impact of spatial and temporal variation in reproductive success e g see mcnamara et al 2011 4 4 successive clutches generally avian clutch sizes often vary with lay date within the breeding season potentially due to differences both between and among females rowe et al 1994 whether this behavior is driven by within or among female differences and whether environmental or physiological constraints on egg production or by adaptive reductions in clutch size remains unclear we were better able to parse out these effects in the altricial case as the house sparrow produces multiple clutches within the season however our precocial case was parameterized for wood ducks in which a smaller proportion are multi brooded limiting our ability to extrapolate from these results in the altricial case we did find that the physiological toll of producing and raising offspring could produce a constraint on clutch size later in the season but in the precocial case differences among females in quality produces seasonal reductions surprisingly we found that food availability could produce a seasonal increase in clutch size in the altricial case and an increase in foraging frequency in both cases indeed our model validation results suggest that the patterns and various drivers of clutch size vary by species and that many of the drivers may interact in complex ways precocial females but not altricial females of lower quality that bred later drove a reduction in clutch size over the season confirming hypothesis 4c for the precocial case but not the altricial case for neither the altricial nor the precocial species did we find that females adaptively reduced clutch sizes when juvenile survival potential declined throughout the season hypothesis 4d despite evidence for this effect in marsh tits smith 1993 in fact our results for altricial species suggest potential for higher juvenile mortality rate to increase clutch size and foraging frequency in both the egg stage and the juvenile stage results not shown the altricial and precocial cases with strikingly different offspring requirements during the chick or juvenile stage produced differing patterns of optimal clutch size and parental care which supported alternative hypotheses for the drivers of clutch size in wild populations 4 5 contributions to ecological modeling this study introduces a novel ecophysiological model capable of balancing the costs and benefits of episodic maternal foraging and incubation with or without supplementary male assistance the model implements a method for integrating temperature dependent development over these cycles of warming and cooling the foraging incubation trade off is then optimized in the context of the offspring s chances of surviving to become reproductive to obtain a realistic measure of the parent s reproductive success moreover the model addresses the issue of clutch size trends over a season which has received very little modeling attention to date to our knowledge these key components have never been put together before in a model capable of testable qualitative and to a more limited extent quantitative predictions empirical tests thus stimulated can suggest ways to improve and extend the model we believe our approach will encourage follow up work using agent based models to capture the implications of random variations in behavior physiology and environment railsback and grimm 2011 a complementary approach to understanding seasonal trends can be developed using dynamic programming thus the potential for future work using and extending the model presented here is high 4 6 future perspectives in light of our key results in context of previous empirical work we outline some key hypotheses to guide future empirical work our food level results were generally consistent with expectations except for underscoring much greater sensitivity to food availability in house sparrows than in wood ducks and thus perhaps in altricial than in precocial species our manipulation of male incubation help produced only marginal effects on female optimization which highlights the plasticity of female allocation to reproductive efforts we predict that increases in female residual reproductive value will favor allocation to future reproduction reducing female plasticity to variation in male contributions in optimizing lifetime reproductive success our most dramatic results involved variation in offspring mortality risk density dependent offspring survival drives contrasting optima in response to mortality risk in early and late development therefore in species with strong density dependent offspring survival we predict that parents should increase clutch investment when mortality risk is high in early development e g eggs whereas they should decrease investment when mortality risk is high in later development e g chicks finally we found that different factors may drive optimal clutch sizes in different species complexity well reflected in the literature we are therefore unable to make specific predictions about variation in optimal clutch sizes as these effects are likely altered by the complex ecological differences amongst species overall we found that our integration of downstream consequences offspring survival to recruitment to early decisions clutch size incubation behavior changes our understanding of optimal parental care because of this seemingly subtle early parental effects could have disproportionate impacts on later offspring phenotype altering the evolution of optimal parental effects 4 7 conclusions altricial and precocial species differ substantially in clutch size and incubation schedules in the ways these are maintained and in the adaptive value of plasticity of parental investment for altricial species the density dependent survival in the chick stage largely determines the optimal number of eggs incubated whereas precocial species are more likely limited by the ability to produce offspring at benign temperatures females may maintain reproductive success in the absence of male help by increasing foraging frequency and especially by increasing clutch size but male help was particularly effective in colder temperatures seasonal decreases in clutch size can be attributed to cumulative fecundity costs in altricial species and to a decrease in female quality in precocial species overall our finding that different hypotheses were supported in the altricial and precocial cases highlights the importance of accounting for breeding ecology when hypothesizing about optimal behavior this context dependent effect on optimal clutch size could explain the lack of an agreement in the literature on the factors responsible for the clutch sizes we observe in nature it is clear that our goal of understanding incubation and its trade off with foraging in the context of the entire life cycle and life history is inseparably linked to these questions about clutch size and incubation we hope to motivate future empirical and theoretical work that can

section model details here we explain the logic in more detail and provide the equations used for the calculations that generated the results the matlab programs used are available from the authors on request to obtain the daily development rate d t t must be integrated across the nested functions and their daily variation see fig a 1 with only females tending the nest and foraging we have a 1 d f

fig a 1 and defined in the figure legend and other parameters are in table 1 in rectangular brackets are the increments of development over a day dividing this by time per day td tn yields the daily development rate the first integrated increment is based on the number of daily foraging cycles f that the clutch is cooling in the absence of the female each cooling interval lasts for time t 0 if temperature falls to the developmental minimum temperature t 0 and otherwise lasts until the female returns at time tt tf next there are f reheating intervals lasting t 6 t 5 where t 5 is the rewarming time if any required to reach t 0 and t 6 is the total rewarming time to reach tb then there are f time increments at maximum development rate until the end of the incubation interval after rewarming is completed finally there is the long nocturnal incubation still at the maximum development rate which is decremented for the last rewarming interval when males help tend the nest the development rate determination is more complex we let dm t t be the development rate for any fixed male arrival time tm for simplicity and without loss of generality in the simulation based determination we imagine that a male arrives at the same time for every foraging cycle in a given day for a particular day we obtain the development rate by integrating and dividing by day length as above under the assumption that males arrive randomly at the nest through time we can now average this over male arrival times by integrating the resulting exponential frequency density of arrival times each weighted by the corresponding average development rate this is a 2 d t t 0 γ e γ t m 1 t d t n 0 t d t n d t t d t d t m where γ is the arrival rate parameter dm t t is the function in

integrate these functions over the male probability distribution we simulate the exponentially distributed male arrivals with large enough numbers of males to produce adequate resolution of the

in the present analysis appendix c responses to temperature temperature has complex effects on the key responses of the altricial house sparrow which focus our attention in this section figs c 1 a d c 2 and c 3 whereas temperature effects on the precocial wood duck are much weaker fig c 1 e f and parallel results not shown to those in c 2 and c 3 and are therefore not considered further here there is an interaction among environmental temperature optimization of foraging schedule and especially of clutch size and the extent of supplemental incubation that may be provided by males if the female can optimize both clutch size and foraging schedule and males arrive to provide help at the default expected interval fitness is essentially unaffected by temperature fig c 1 a and the frequency of foraging bouts goes down steadily with increasing temperature fig c 1 b in this case the female can forage more efficiently and spend more time incubating at higher temperatures but in the absence of male help low temperatures lead to large increases in incubation time and a sharp decline in fitness fig c 1 c despite maximal female foraging frequency and a reduction in clutch size fig c 1 d despite the absence of male help in the precocial case the female remains able to stabilize her energy balance while having to spend very little total time away from the nest fig c 1 e and f if the female is unable to adjust clutch size the results are basically similar and only slightly more pronounced fig c 2 than in the case with clutch size optimized fig c 1 but with clutch size optimized and the female unable to adjust foraging schedule repercussions below 20 are severe optimal clutch size falls rapidly to zero for lower temperatures regardless of whether males provided supplementary incubation fig c 3 and when neither clutch size nor foraging schedule could be optimally adjusted we observed a total fitness crash just below the default temperature independent of male help fig c 3 a and b vs c and d we conclude that increasing the foraging frequency at lower temperatures can be essential for incubation to yield hatchlings appendix d sensitivity analyses we conducted two types of sensitivity analyses elasticity determination based on holding all but the focal parameter constant and increasing its magnitude by 5 to assess the relative shift in response here fitness and hyperpyramid analysis crowley et al submitted where magnitudes of the most relevant parameters are repeatedly sampled simultaneously from triangular frequency distributions and used to determine magnitudes of the key response variables hyperpyramid analysis is based on the hypercube approach sobol 2001 but assumes that the frequency distributions are triangular rather than rectangular providing a better approximation to typical unimodal shapes the range mean ratios in table d 1 indicate the length of the base of the triangular frequency distribution relative to its mean for the 10 parameters of each species having elasticities greater than 0 1 in absolute value for simplicity here we used isosceles triangles to construct the frequency distributions the means and 95 confidence intervals were generated from 4000 random draws of the 10 parameter magnitudes for each species implying that 100 of these fell in each tail of the confidence interval to ensure valid estimates table d 1 shows the elasticity results based on fitness responses parameters varied considerably in their relative effects on fitness and we summarize these patterns in the text also included in the table are the range mean ratios for triangular frequency distributions of each parameter yielding a strong individual response used in the hyperpyramid analysis fig d 1 shows mean magnitudes and 95 confidence intervals for five key response variables from this analysis these intervals indicate whether differences in responses between species can be considered statistically meaningful as

24743,parental management of early offspring development is a complex but essential contribution to reproductive success for oviparous species mothers faced with incubating eggs in a variable environment maximize reproductive success by adaptively adjusting offspring number in a clutch and incubation schedules to facilitate egg development while meeting their own energetic demands however the optimal resolution of these trade offs varies with physiological and ecological factors and is thus hard to determine using empirical data from natural systems to untangle the complex factors driving optimal maternal decisions we developed an ecophysiological model that identifies optimal maternal strategies and their implications for offspring comparing results for example altricial and precocial species we showed how plastic maternal strategies can ameliorate effects of food scarcity offspring mortality risk variable levels of biparental care and constraints on producing multiple clutches within a season in the altricial case in particular we identified important downstream fitness effects from decisions made in the incubation stage additionally we showed that seasonal decreases in clutch size may result from cumulative fecundity costs for the altricial case and from a seasonal decline in female quality for precocial species many of the novel results in this study are testable in future empirical work keywords ecophysiology energetics life history dynamics parental care seasonal trends temperature dynamics 1 introduction previous studies have posited generalized hypotheses for predicting patterns of parental investment across species however empirical work on different species even within the same taxon yields both strong support and rejection of these hypotheses this conflict necessitates an investigation into how species specific ecophysiology and life history influence optimal parental investment for oviparous species in particular key decisions about parental investment begin early with establishing clutch size and for species that incubate continue during embryonic development with establishing incubation schedules altering the embryonic thermal environment via incubation has important downstream effects on offspring phenotype and ultimately on fitness o donnell and arnold 2005 van damme et al 1992 durant et al 2010 durant et al 2013a incubation behavior is highly variable among organisms but similar basic constraints and trade offs arise across this diversity incubating parents must utilize their own energetic resupply williams 1995 may sacrifice mating opportunities sargent 1985 incur costs to immune function and or reduce future reproduction capabilities hanssen et al 2005 thus incubation effort is a key determinant of parental fitness but current theory of optimal incubation remains imprecise klug and bonsall 2014 further parental investment encompasses both the production and subsequent care of offspring and parental fitness is a function of offpsring survival to recruitment thus in order to accurately predict optimal parental behavior we need to consider how parental decisions cascade through all stages of offpsring development it is clear that optimal parental decisions such as clutch size and incubation effort can vary with both abiotic and biotic factors such as climate species physiology food availability help from conspecifics mortality risk and female state nord et al 2010 nord and nilsson 2012 thomson et al 1998 hałupka 1994 gorman and nager 2003 since these factors often covary and they may vary at the species population individual and within individual levels it is challenging to determine which factors drive optimal parental decisions and in what direction using empirical data for example food level influences the energetic state of females and has been shown to positively impact both clutch size and incubation effort thomson et al 1998 korpimaki and wiehn 1998 nord and nilsson 2012 chalfoun and martin 2007 however supplemental feeding of blue tits cyanistes caerulus resulted in reduced brood sizes harrison et al 2010 additionally the presence of a male partner that also incubates the eggs generally reduces female incubation effort by reducing incubation needs and by facilitating nest defense matysioková and remeš 2014 fontaine and martin 2006 but again evidence is equivocal female new zealand robins petroica longipes do not adjust their nest attentiveness with male help boulton et al 2010 offspring mortality risk that cannot be mitigated is predicted to reduce parental investment low 1978 but the opportunity to test this effect empirically without conflating it with parental mortality risk is rare finally for species that breed iteratively within a season parental investment into successive broods may vary rowe et al 1994 but whether this variation is driven by a physiological constraint or a shifting optimum is often unclear making sense of these ambiguities in the empirical literature necessitates a way to simultaneously consider the complex variable ecological circumstances that incubating parents face this challenge can be addressed by creating a physiologically and behaviorally based ecologically relevant model of parental incubation we focus our study on the key trade off between incubation and foraging by a female parent assuming that she cannot sustain a daily energy deficit to do this we build and implement an ecophysiological model that optimizes maternal clutch size egg number and incubation behavior the length and frequency of daily foraging trips with respect to maternal fitness maternal fitness is a function of the number of offpsring produced in a breeding season that survive to recruitment the model allows variable input for species physiology ambient temperature food availability male help level mortality risk to offpsring and successive clutch effects with a season we parameterized the model based on birds for which most of the energetic and behavioral parameters can be estimated distinguishing between precocial species specifically the wood duck a sponsa and altricial species the house sparrow p domesticus we summarize this framework in fig 1 in this analysis we evaluate the implications of optimal adjustments to clutch size and incubation for two species by assessing 4 key questions and hypotheses about optimal parental investment 1 how does food availability influence incubation and clutch size hypothesis 1 food availability should have a threshold effect making little difference unless it falls low enough to threaten the female s ability to achieve a daily energy balance 2 how does male help with incubation influence female incubation and clutch size in the altricial case hypothesis 2 the male contribution should accelerate egg development allowing the female to reduce incubation effort and increase clutch size e g fessl et al 1996 3 how does baseline mortality in the three primary developmental stages egg chick juvenile influence optimal incubation and clutch size hypothesis 3 cascading sequential effects of the developmental stages will create non linearities in effects of early stage mortality on fitness 4 what mechanism best explains the observed seasonal decline of clutch sizes and how do these mechanisms affect optimal incubation hypothesis 4a a cumulative fecundity cost reduces female s ability to invest in offpsring number and care with each offspring produced jones and ward 1976 4b food availability declines over the season driving a declining clutch size consistent with hypothesis 3 above 4c lower quality females are expected to have their smaller clutches with reduced incubation effort accounting for a large proportion of the late season clutches hochachka 1990 and 4d a cost to the survival of offspring that fledge later in the season due to reduced resources before winter decreasing the value of investing in these late offspring winkler and allen 1996 we proceed by first providing an overview of the model and then working through the mathematical details presenting the derivation of the development rates and nest attentiveness effects in appendices with the model parameterized for house sparrows and wood ducks we address the four questions and associated hypotheses considering the implications of the results in the context of the literature and some potential future directions for advancing this exercise in the discussion in an appendix we also provide supporting analysis of responses to environmental temperature in which flexible clutch size and foraging schedule and the availability of male help are particularly important 2 materials and methods 2 1 model overview we envision a sequence of clutches produced and fledged during a single reproductive season each clutch may be incubated by a female alone or by both parents when a male is present his role is assumed to be supplementary he arrives at the nest randomly and if the female is gone he incubates until she returns nest attentiveness involves incubation to increase development rate which is positively tied to egg temperature fig 2 and can also provide some protection from predators and intrusive conspecifics parameters linked to these phenomena and others addressed in this analysis are listed in table 1 we assume that given her energetic constraints the female chooses to lay an optimal number of eggs of a fixed volume and selects an optimal incubation pattern in our model these strategies are determined to be optimal relative to her state given the environmental constraints that she experiences and may not represent her optima without those specific physiological constraints we assume she leaves to forage at sunrise and returns to re warm and incubate the eggs repeating this sequence an optimal number of times over the day before returning at dusk to initiate consistent nocturnal incubation fig 2 ambient conditions and day length in our model was parameterized for populations of wood duck and house sparrow in the northeastern usa and variation in day length and ambient conditions may impact the ability to extrapolate these results for avian populations located elsewhere she maximizes her fitness by optimally trading off energy gain during these foraging bouts against her need to incubate the clutch to maximize its development rate subject to the constraint of her own energetic demands she is able to balance her foraging energy gains against losses incurred through tending the eggs so that her short term energy reserves are maintained from day to day this simplifying assumption of daily energy balance must be at least approximately true to avoid rapid accumulation of a debilitating maternal energy deficit we assume that any net costs of maternal reproductive effort are incurred in production of any subsequent within season clutches the male in species with male care in this model only the house sparrow case can increase clutch development rate and protection only while the female forages though generally with less efficient heat transfer than the female due to the lack of a brood patch to determine the fitness associated with a particular number of eggs per clutch and the nest tending by the parents we track the clutch through the chick stage and after fledging until the offspring are ready to reproduce themselves hereafter the juvenile stage overall mortality rates including predation may differ among egg chick and juvenile stages the stage specific survival also reflects the time spent in each stage as a function of incubation level life history patterns associated with altricial or precocial offspring until fledging generally differ strongly in the chick stage the need for parents to feed altricial offspring can produce density dependent growth and mortality based on the number of chick mouths to feed with the available total parental effort whereas the more independent precocial offspring are less influenced by the number of siblings regardless predation can also be density dependent in both offspring types particularly in the chick stage the number of clutches within a season depends on the total development time to fledging the interval duration between clutches and the reproductive season length the model explicitly addresses four different effects that may lead to seasonal sequences of clutch sizes the cumulative fecundity cost in which the cumulative number of offpsring produced by a female inhibits her capacity to produce as many eggs in later clutches the food availability effect in which a seasonal decline in food level drives changes in clutch size the female quality effect in which females that nest late in the season tend primarily to be those of lower quality and the late fledging cost in which later fledging implies diminished ability of offspring to overwinter successfully 2 2 embryonic development rate embryonic development rate d is a function of clutch temperature t fig 2 and clutch temperature is a function of time t fig 3 thus d d t t to obtain the daily clutch development rate d t t must be integrated across the nested functions and their daily variation let d be the mean development rate over the relevant interval and tj is the duration of each interval identified by the subscript j then with only females tending the nest and foraging for f daily cycles we have 1 d f t t 1 t d t n f t c d c t t t r d r t t t i d i t t t n t i d n t t where td tn is the duration of a day as daytime plus nighttime and subscript c indicates the clutch cooling phase r is the female tended rewarming phase i is the female incubation phase at optimal developmental temperature and n is the nocturnal female incubation phase with a male present the details depend on when the male arrives and some additional terms are required 2 d m t t 1 t d t n f t c d c t t t r d r t t t i d i t t t r d r t t t i d i t t t n d n t t where subscript r is the male tended re warming phase and i is the male incubation phase a general solution for cyclical female foraging and incubation and random male supplementary incubation is provided in appendix a there we solve analytically for any particular male arrival time and describe how the exponential probability density function of male arrival times is simulated to produce our results the fraction of time that a nest is attended by a parent is specifically addressed in appendix b 2 3 energetics temperature and heat transfer we track the energy balance of the female as she gains energy reserves by foraging and expends them through energetic expenditure during foraging and tending the clutch her assimilation rate a is based on a type ii functional response holling 1959 to the available food level f with rate of successful search a handling time b and assimilation efficiency ε 3 a ε a f 1

daytime and nighttime temperatures assumed constant during each interval and over the season for tractability kfa is the rate of heat loss from the female to the air and afa is the area of contact between the female and the air since we assume foraging to be restricted to daytime we can now express the energy expenditure rate during traveling and foraging k as 9 k k 0 b r d where k 0 b is the extra energy cost rate of foraging activities the energy cost of reheating n eggs from tr egg temperature when the female returns from foraging to tb is 10 e r t b t r s e m e n where se is the

times number of foraging cycles and clutch size we can now express the female s energy balance over a day as 13 f a t f k 0 b t t t f e r t d r d t n r n 0 since er contains an exponential

e n f 1 this is because there are f 1 intervals between foraging bouts during daytime except that with a single foraging episode incubation is from the cessation of foraging until nightfall we are now able to use the fitness equation below to choose the fitness maximizing optimal clutch size n and the number of foraging cycles f which determines tf and ti optimal clutch size however may be constrained by a physiological upper limit nx monaghan et al 1995 we suppose that the time to build a nest and lay the clutch regardless of clutch size is fixed at tb and that energy required to produce the clutch is acquired by the female with diminishing returns over time then the physiologically constrained optimal egg number is 15 n n x 1 e k b t b and 16 k b a k 0 b r d t d r n t n e e t d t n where ee is the energy content of an egg this makes the constrained optimal clutch size likely to be determined mainly by this physiological upper limit for precocial birds but more intense density dependence on clutch size may yield optimal clutch sizes well below the physiological limit for altricial birds 2 5 fitness equation we express female fitness ωi derived from individual clutch i as one half of the clutch size ni based on her relatedness to offspring multiplied by the survival li of these individuals to their own subsequent reproduction 17 ω i 0 5 n i l i 0 5 n i l h l f l p

imposes density dependent mortality when the exponent x 0 and 1 dm is embryonic development time see appendix a since nlh is the number of chicks we let 20 l f e μ f n l h z 1 τ where μf is the

i 1 c ω i where c is the maximal number of clutches that can fit into a season given tf ti tt the time between clutches tb and the length of the reproductive season ts but clutches may differ in egg number and thus in contribution to fitness over the season in this analysis we address the cumulative fecundity cost of previous clutches diminishing offspring survival through the chick stage based on the cumulative number of eggs produced in previous clutches we then have 25 l f i e μ f n y τ j 1 i 1 n j v where the index j specifies the sequence of clutches before the current clutch i and v is the cumulative clutch cost exponent for the food availability effect we envision a linear decline in food abundance from f for the first clutch down to fnf for the last of c clutches this implies 26 f

reached at clutch c we conducted two types of sensitivity analyses to determine which parameters had the greatest effect on fitness elasticity analysis and to evaluate variation in response variables when the most influential parameters expressed plausible simultaneous variation in magnitudes hyperpyramid analysis those results are presented in appendix d but summarized below in the results section the computer programs in matlab 2018a used to generate the results throughout this analysis are available on request from the authors 2 7 model validation this model predicts patterns of incubation strategies of both a precocial and altricial species in response to multiple variable environmental parameters because of this complexity there is currently no all encompassing dataset that can be used to precisely validate our model output however we specifically sought out empirical results from our model species that tested our key results to make quantitative comparisons to our model output to the extent to which these data are available for the house sparrow case we compared results from an experimental test of house sparrow male help level on female incubation behavior schwagermeyer et al 2008 and an observational study parsing the variation in house sparrow clutch size across the season both within and among individuals for 4892 clutches westneat et al 2014 for wood ducks we compared results from a study that investigated the effects of food level via multiple proxies on wood duck incubation behavior folk and hepp 2003 and an observational study of how double brooding in wood ducks n 429 clutches relates to clutch size season and maternal quality kennamer and hepp 1987 finally in order to assess the generality of our results we expanded our search to studies from a variety of altricial and precocial species to validate whether our output is reflective of broader patterns in avian incubators we address matches and mismatches between our model output and empirical findings in the discussion 3 results first we provide a summary of the general relationships between clutch size incubation behavior and maternal fitness for both house sparrows and wood ducks hereafter sparrows and ducks respectively facing temperate ambient conditions for sparrows 5 eggs was the optimal clutch size which was primarily limited by increased provisioning load with more chicks fig 4 a for ducks who do not provision chicks optimal clutch size was as high as the number of eggs a female can produce 12 eggs in this case fig 4b for sparrows the optimal number of foraging bouts for sparrows was 30 per day of 3 5 min each with intervening diurnal incubation intervals of 16 0 min fig 4c the fitness above 30 daily bouts plateaus suggesting that the actual numbers of bouts per day both within and between individuals may vary considerably fewer than 30 bouts per day provided insufficient energy under the gut limitation constraint for sparrows in contrast optimal foraging frequency for ducks was twice per day at 13 0 min each with a long diurnal incubation interval of 684 1 min between fig 4d 3 1 food level concerning question 1 how does food availability influence incubation and clutch size food level influences optimal maternal decisions for both species but had a stronger effect on sparrows than on ducks for sparrows the default food level of 2 is adjacent to a fitness cliff fig 5 a below which eggs develop more slowly because the female must leave the nest more frequently and thereby reduce her overall attentiveness fig 5c due to this delayed development and increased egg mortality optimal clutch size increased at the lowest food level for sparrows fig 5a c the low food threshold came into play only well below default food levels for ducks fig 5b as with sparrows below the duck fitness cliff foraging frequency increased and led to decreased attentiveness fig 5d in contrast to sparrows optimal duck clutch size decreased at the lowest food level fig 5d 3 2 food level model validation folk and hepp measured wood duck incubation behavior relative to variation in female habitat quality and distance from the nest to the feeding area 2003 their female attentiveness averaged around 81 3 0 8 with a range of 70 8 93 8 with and average foraging bouts of 2 2 0 3 per day in comparison our attentiveness ranged from 76 to 97 8 with 2 foraging bouts per day except at an extremely low food level 1 at which she took 8 foraging bouts per day in the empirical study both proxies of food availability yielded conflicting results females significantly decreased their attentiveness in better habitats 0 077 0 028 but increased their attentiveness with distance to foraging site 0 025 0 008 we found an 22 drop in attentiveness at low food levels 0 5 but a negligible change above a food level of 5 using body condition data folk and hepp conclude that their wood ducks were not food limited which reflects our chosen standard food level indeed a positive effect of food level on attentiveness is supported by experimental and observational studies in both altricial lothery et al 2014 vafidis et al 2018 zimmerling and ankney 2005 koski et al 2020 londoño et al 2008 rauter and reyer 1997 and precocial species henson and cooper 1993 maccluskie and sedinger 1999 bentzen et al 2010 tombre et al 2012 we conclude that our food results generally match empirical results 3 3 male incubation help for question 2 how does male help with incubation influence female incubation and clutch size in the altricial case we examined the effects of male incubation help for sparrows only the species with biparental care surprisingly fitness remained nearly constant regardless of the time between male arrivals fig 6 a likely due to females reducing their own incubation effort but increasing their clutch size with reduced male help fig 6b female sparrow attentiveness dropped sharply with increasing male arrival times closely approaching her attentiveness level with no male help above about 30 min fig 6b however female foraging frequency barely increased with male help although it showed marked variation due to the random property of male arrivals fig 6b 3 4 male incubation help model validation by manipulating testosterone schwagermeyer bartlett and mock were able to directly assess the effect of male incubation variation on female incubation behavior in house sparrows 2008 overall control females left the nest on average 30 times per day which closely matches our standard female behavior 30 off bouts per day at the default male help level control males left the nest for an average of 14 2 min 5 31 leading to an average biparental attentiveness of 86 compared to our standard 10 min between male arrivals producing an overall biparental attentiveness of 88 manipulated males reduced their overall incubation contribution by an average of 42 and led to a 22 increase in average female contributions and a biparental attentiveness of 82 in our model a 42 reduction in standard male contribution led to a biparental attentiveness of 86 a 2 decrease in both the empirical work and our model output reductions in male care lead to partial female compensation however although partial compensation was also observed in response to natural variation in male incubation in black necked cranes grus nigricollis zhang et al 2017 experimental manipulations of male incubation level in different species have failed to produce an increase in female attentiveness that is statistically significant harrison et al 2009 ridder et al 2000 alonso alvarez 2001 we conclude that our effect of male help reflected the partial compensation found in real house sparrows but may be stronger than general among passerines 3 5 mortality risk to offspring concerning question 3 how does baseline mortality in the three primary developmental stages egg chick juvenile influence optimal incubation and clutch size offpsring mortality rates for each of the three developmental stages eggs chicks and juveniles resulted in contrasting predictions for sparrows and ducks for the egg stage of sparrows fitness maintained a plateau over low to moderate egg mortality rates before dropping at high mortality rates fig 7 a incubation levels also plateaued until high egg mortality levels where foraging frequency sharply increased resulting in reduced attentiveness fig 7c however optimal clutch size increased at low to moderate egg mortality risk until plateauing at the physiological limit 12 for high mortality levels fig 7c an opposite pattern resulted from varying chick mortality risk fitness sharply declined with increased mortality risk fig 7b with increased chick mortality risk foraging frequency declined attentiveness slightly increased and optimal clutch size dropped fig 7d this exemplifies the predicted cascading effect in which the fitness advantage of low egg mortality rate is offset by the disadvantage of increased numbers of surviving chicks that parents must provision in this case strong density dependence based on the limited amount of parental care available ultimately reduces chick survival limiting the fitness achieved from a larger clutch the effects of mortality risk during the stages of duck offspring development had much weaker effects on optimal maternal decisions during the egg stage fitness sharply dropped with increased egg mortality reflecting the lack of chick provisioning and thus reduced chick rearing costs in this species fig 8 a however optimal incubation behavior and optimal clutch size did not vary with egg mortality fig 8c chick mortality rate also produced a decrease in fitness similar to but weaker than the egg mortality effect fig 8b additionally chick mortality rate had no effect on optimal incubation or clutch size fig 8d 3 6 mortality risk to offspring model validation a meta analysis of north american passerines found that nest predation risk reduced off bout frequency but not attentiveness conway and martin 2000 whereas a study on great tits parus major found the opposite effect an increase in off bout frequency with no effect on attentiveness basso and richner 2015 alternatively sage grouse centrocercus urophasianus spent less time off the nest with greater nest predation coates and delehanty 2008 in our house sparrow model we saw minimal effects of offspring mortality on attentiveness but noticeable changes in off bout frequency the direction of which varied high egg mortality led to jump about 33 in off bout frequency similar to the great tit results whereas high chick mortality lead to a reduction in off bout frequency about 25 similar to the meta analysis results in our wood duck model we saw no changes to attentiveness or frequency and unfortunately there is a deficit of studies testing this specific effect in similar species with limited empirical evidence we conclude that our mortality effects partially reflect real effects in the altricial case but are not confirmed for the precocial case 3 7 successive clutches question 4 what mechanism best explains the observed seasonal decline of clutch sizes and how do these mechanisms affect optimal incubation incorporated multiple hypotheses to explain variation in successive clutch sizes and these again resulted in contrasting patterns for sparrows and ducks for sparrows the cumulative fecundity cost reduced clutch size between the first and second clutches based on our assumption of a consequent reduction in chick survival fig 9 a imposing this cost of parental investment also slowed development sufficiently to preclude a fourth clutch with seasonally declining food levels for sparrows there was an increase in foraging frequency with a consequent decrease in attentiveness along with an increase in clutch size fig 9b consistent with the food effects in fig 5c surprisingly the female quality effect did not affect house sparrow clutch size or incubation behavior between successive clutches fig 9c similarly the late fledging had no effect on successive clutch size or incubation fig 9d for ducks the cumulative fecundity cost had no effect on clutch size or optimal incubation behavior fig 10 a however seasonally declining food levels led to an increase in duck clutch size and a decrease in attentiveness reflecting the much lower food levels late in the season at the time of a second clutch fig 10b addtionally seasonally declining female quality strongly reduced clutch size in ducks but did not alter optimal incubation fig 10c as with sparrows the late fledging cost had no effect on duck clutch size or incubation fig 10d 3 8 successive clutches model validation in a wood duck population in south carolina 7 6 of females produced second broods with a significant reduction in clutch size within females of 13 to 10 eggs between successive broods p 0 01 kennamer and hepp 1987 kennamer and hepp 1987 found no significant effect of female age 2 6 v 2 4 p 0 49 or condition 610 vs 617 5 p 0 61 between single and double brooded females and further no difference in their clutch sizes 13 3 vs 13 5 p 0 94 however they did find that within double brooded females female condition reduced significantly from first to second brood 632 5 vs 572 5 we found that female quality was the only driver of reductions in seasonal clutch size our model clutch size averaged at 12 eggs with a reduction to 6 eggs in second brood this result is substantiated in later work by hepp and kennamer 2011 suggesting that poorer quality female wood ducks nest later to reduce reproductive costs westneat et al found that house sparrow clutch sizes averaged 4 6 eggs with a high level of variation 0 85 compared to our average of 5 eggs they found that the majority of the variation 0 64 0 02 in seasonal house sparrow clutch size was attributable to within individual effects vs among individual effects 0 11 0 01 in addition to year and population effects further clutch sizes declined with date both within individuals 0 009 0 0008 p 0 0001 and among individuals 0 007 0 001 p 0 0001 but increased with attempt number both within 0 12 0 03 p 0 0002 and among individuals 0 25 0 03 p 0 0001 we found a decrease in clutch size from 5 to 2 within females due to a cumulative fecundity cost along with a 2 egg increase from 5 to 7 in clutch size due to food level decline there was neither an effect of variation among females in quality nor an effect of fledgling survival on clutch size patterns and determinants of seasonal effects on clutch size are complex and variable among species for example some species show a simple linear reduction in clutch size with season gil delgado et al 2005 goodenough et al 2009 whereas some show a peak clutch size midseason dolenec et al 2011 suarez et al 2005 year can affect clutch patterns over the season suggesting that extrinsic factors like food level or condition limit clutch size westneat et al 2014 goodenough et al 2009 it has been posited that food level limits clutch size in wood ducks and mallards a platyrhynchos drobney and frederickson 1988 eldridge and krapu 1988 and condition limits clutch size in common eiders s mollissima and lesser scaup a affinis hanssen et al 2003 warren et al 2013 however food level was ruled out as a limitation on clutch size in wood ducks in a later analysis arnold and rohwer 1991 finally there is evidence that there is a cumulative reproductive cost in eastern bluebirds s sialis as larger first clutches resulted in smaller secondary clutches robinson et al 2010 we conclude that our successive clutch effects partially reflect real patterns in our model species but that our results are a simplification of complex interactions and are not generalizable across species 3 9 temperature effects to avoid extending the text beyond its present length the temperature effects summarized here are shown graphically in appendix c for sparrows temperature effects were minimal with flexible clutch size and foraging schedule and male help fig c 1 a and b but the absence of male help greatly slowed development at low temperatures fig c 1 c and d for ducks temperature effects were negligible at the high level of attentiveness provided by the female fig c 1 e and f comparisons in figs c 2 c 3 and c 4 show that flexibility in foraging schedule was especially important in supporting egg development at cooler temperatures 3 10 sensitivity analysis a full evaluation of parameter sensitivity is provided in appendix d table d 1 highlights the

responded more strongly to feeding related parameters a 0 e a and f and wood ducks to development rate temperature and attentiveness parameters dx t 0 tm and μa food access is clearly an important issue for sparrows whereas ducks generally have good access to food but may be more at the mercy of environmental conditions for successful brood rearing the hyperpyramid results show strong differences in the five major responses between the two species fig d 1 using the criterion of statistical significance when the 95 confidence intervals both fail to overlap the mean of the other distribution we find significant differences for all responses except eggs per clutch in this case the consistent 12 eggs per clutch by wood ducks is occasionally matched by house sparrows though 5 7 eggs per clutch appears to be much more common in the model results as in nature d f westneat unpublished data wood ducks always had 2 foraging bouts per day while house sparrows were in the range of 25 40 bouts per day ducks were considerably more attentive even without male help allowed by their more efficient foraging development times were much longer for wood ducks than house sparrows in accord with the importance of development time effects on reproductive success noted above overall fitness per brood was much higher for ducks an important advantage since wood ducks do not often produce a second brood per year whereas house sparrows usually manage multiple broods annually these two ways of assessing sensitivity are complementary underscoring the major life history differences between the two species and perhaps more generally between altricial and precocial species 4 discussion 4 1 food level our results support the hypothesis of a threshold effect of food limitation on clutch size and foraging frequency in house sparrows but only to a limited extent in wood ducks our model validation confirms that this result reflects natural patterns of food limitation and incubation the same may follow for clutch size for example both eurasian kestrels falco tinnunculus and nazca boobies sula granti adjust clutch size with nutritional conditions korpimäki and wiehn 1998 clifford and anderson 2001 our results indicate that the strength of the influence of food availability on maternal investment is modified by species ecology as our precocial case was less prone to food limitation underscored by the sensitivity analysis however a meta analysis of diet type and foraging strategy do not alter general patterns of incubation among north american passerines conway and martin 2000 suggesting that food limitation effects may be more relevant at a within species level 4 2 male incubation help in our model adjustments by female house sparrows in response to male incubation assistance led to constant fitness levels independent of male arrival frequency we conclude that male incubation help does not necessarily increase reproductive success through nest attentiveness during incubation alone except when female fecundity and foraging behavior do not adjust to the attentiveness males can provide according to our model validation females tend to compensate only partially or not at all in response to male incubation level in our model supplementary male incubation becomes particularly important at stressful temperatures to avoid extending the text beyond the present length we incorporate these results and others on temperature effects in appendix c male contributions may also include incubation feeding and provisioning of offspring effects that were not included in our model however incubation feeding is similar to an extremely high food level in our model which produced increasingly minimal changes in female optima it is clear that male help can reduce the energetic burdens on females but the key question is the level to which females allocate that difference to current investment or future investment thus females may reduce care when males contribute reid et al 2002 diminishing or eliminating the benefit of male care to current offspring but increasing female lifetime reproductive success our model could be extended to allow for breeding over multiple seasons to further test how she optimizes her allocation of male contributions in contrast to the fixed strategy males in our model males may reduce help when extra pair paternity is common both because they may not have full paternity of the current brood and because they lose mating opportunities elsewhere by providing care matysioková and remeš 2014 though hypothesis 2 is supported only under special circumstances by the current model allowing males to optimize their help at both egg and chick stages in relation to extra pair paternity and female care may provide a more realistic test 4 3 mortality risk to offspring mortality risks to offspring and their effect on incubation optimization are hard to parse in natural systems as incubation behavior nest defense offspring risk and parental risk often intertwine indeed fewer studies parse out this effect specifically and effects seem to be expressed as changes in bout timing and not in overall attentiveness our model generates this effect only in the altricial case in which increased survival of eggs to hatching had negative effects on chick survival because of density dependent mortality and limited parental care consistent with our hypothesis 3 mock et al 2009 lack 1948 in the precocial case without strong density dependence we saw no effect however in both cases we saw mortality effects on optimal clutch size emphasizing that optimal clutch size must reflect the downstream effects on offspring mortality between the developmental stages that could drive hidden costs of larger broods previous attempts to account for optimal clutch size emphasize nestling growth and survival but do not account for juvenile mortality a review of experimental brood enlargements in 21 precocial seabird species demonstrated that parents could successfully rear extra offspring indicating that clutch size is not limited by rearing capacity in these cases ydenberg and bertram 1989 this was confirmed by a meta analysis of experimental brood enlargement studies vanderwerf 1992 however experimental brood enlargements in other passerines have resulted in reduced offspring weight but without a significant reduction offspring survival burness et al 2000 musgrove and wiebe 2014 sanz 1997 if parents are successful in rearing offspring but they produce poorer quality offspring then these costs may yield lower offspring survival to recruitment whereas many brood enlargement studies only follow offspring to fledging even so the parental response to increased offspring demand may vary for example house sparrows both increased and decreased their care level in response to brood enlargements suggesting that complex factors determine individual parental optima westneat and mutzel 2019 an important extension of our model would be to assess the effects of early developmental conditions on offspring survival to recruitment as evidence suggest that early growth rate can significantly affect adult phenotype lee et al 2012 another key extension would account for the impact of spatial and temporal variation in reproductive success e g see mcnamara et al 2011 4 4 successive clutches generally avian clutch sizes often vary with lay date within the breeding season potentially due to differences both between and among females rowe et al 1994 whether this behavior is driven by within or among female differences and whether environmental or physiological constraints on egg production or by adaptive reductions in clutch size remains unclear we were better able to parse out these effects in the altricial case as the house sparrow produces multiple clutches within the season however our precocial case was parameterized for wood ducks in which a smaller proportion are multi brooded limiting our ability to extrapolate from these results in the altricial case we did find that the physiological toll of producing and raising offspring could produce a constraint on clutch size later in the season but in the precocial case differences among females in quality produces seasonal reductions surprisingly we found that food availability could produce a seasonal increase in clutch size in the altricial case and an increase in foraging frequency in both cases indeed our model validation results suggest that the patterns and various drivers of clutch size vary by species and that many of the drivers may interact in complex ways precocial females but not altricial females of lower quality that bred later drove a reduction in clutch size over the season confirming hypothesis 4c for the precocial case but not the altricial case for neither the altricial nor the precocial species did we find that females adaptively reduced clutch sizes when juvenile survival potential declined throughout the season hypothesis 4d despite evidence for this effect in marsh tits smith 1993 in fact our results for altricial species suggest potential for higher juvenile mortality rate to increase clutch size and foraging frequency in both the egg stage and the juvenile stage results not shown the altricial and precocial cases with strikingly different offspring requirements during the chick or juvenile stage produced differing patterns of optimal clutch size and parental care which supported alternative hypotheses for the drivers of clutch size in wild populations 4 5 contributions to ecological modeling this study introduces a novel ecophysiological model capable of balancing the costs and benefits of episodic maternal foraging and incubation with or without supplementary male assistance the model implements a method for integrating temperature dependent development over these cycles of warming and cooling the foraging incubation trade off is then optimized in the context of the offspring s chances of surviving to become reproductive to obtain a realistic measure of the parent s reproductive success moreover the model addresses the issue of clutch size trends over a season which has received very little modeling attention to date to our knowledge these key components have never been put together before in a model capable of testable qualitative and to a more limited extent quantitative predictions empirical tests thus stimulated can suggest ways to improve and extend the model we believe our approach will encourage follow up work using agent based models to capture the implications of random variations in behavior physiology and environment railsback and grimm 2011 a complementary approach to understanding seasonal trends can be developed using dynamic programming thus the potential for future work using and extending the model presented here is high 4 6 future perspectives in light of our key results in context of previous empirical work we outline some key hypotheses to guide future empirical work our food level results were generally consistent with expectations except for underscoring much greater sensitivity to food availability in house sparrows than in wood ducks and thus perhaps in altricial than in precocial species our manipulation of male incubation help produced only marginal effects on female optimization which highlights the plasticity of female allocation to reproductive efforts we predict that increases in female residual reproductive value will favor allocation to future reproduction reducing female plasticity to variation in male contributions in optimizing lifetime reproductive success our most dramatic results involved variation in offspring mortality risk density dependent offspring survival drives contrasting optima in response to mortality risk in early and late development therefore in species with strong density dependent offspring survival we predict that parents should increase clutch investment when mortality risk is high in early development e g eggs whereas they should decrease investment when mortality risk is high in later development e g chicks finally we found that different factors may drive optimal clutch sizes in different species complexity well reflected in the literature we are therefore unable to make specific predictions about variation in optimal clutch sizes as these effects are likely altered by the complex ecological differences amongst species overall we found that our integration of downstream consequences offspring survival to recruitment to early decisions clutch size incubation behavior changes our understanding of optimal parental care because of this seemingly subtle early parental effects could have disproportionate impacts on later offspring phenotype altering the evolution of optimal parental effects 4 7 conclusions altricial and precocial species differ substantially in clutch size and incubation schedules in the ways these are maintained and in the adaptive value of plasticity of parental investment for altricial species the density dependent survival in the chick stage largely determines the optimal number of eggs incubated whereas precocial species are more likely limited by the ability to produce offspring at benign temperatures females may maintain reproductive success in the absence of male help by increasing foraging frequency and especially by increasing clutch size but male help was particularly effective in colder temperatures seasonal decreases in clutch size can be attributed to cumulative fecundity costs in altricial species and to a decrease in female quality in precocial species overall our finding that different hypotheses were supported in the altricial and precocial cases highlights the importance of accounting for breeding ecology when hypothesizing about optimal behavior this context dependent effect on optimal clutch size could explain the lack of an agreement in the literature on the factors responsible for the clutch sizes we observe in nature it is clear that our goal of understanding incubation and its trade off with foraging in the context of the entire life cycle and life history is inseparably linked to these questions about clutch size and incubation we hope to motivate future empirical and theoretical work that can

fig a 1 and defined in the figure legend and other parameters are in table 1 in rectangular brackets are the increments of development over a day dividing this by time per day td tn yields the daily development rate the first integrated increment is based on the number of daily foraging cycles f that the clutch is cooling in the absence of the female each cooling interval lasts for time t 0 if temperature falls to the developmental minimum temperature t 0 and otherwise lasts until the female returns at time tt tf next there are f reheating intervals lasting t 6 t 5 where t 5 is the rewarming time if any required to reach t 0 and t 6 is the total rewarming time to reach tb then there are f time increments at maximum development rate until the end of the incubation interval after rewarming is completed finally there is the long nocturnal incubation still at the maximum development rate which is decremented for the last rewarming interval when males help tend the nest the development rate determination is more complex we let dm t t be the development rate for any fixed male arrival time tm for simplicity and without loss of generality in the simulation based determination we imagine that a male arrives at the same time for every foraging cycle in a given day for a particular day we obtain the development rate by integrating and dividing by day length as above under the assumption that males arrive randomly at the nest through time we can now average this over male arrival times by integrating the resulting exponential frequency density of arrival times each weighted by the corresponding average development rate this is a 2 d t t 0 γ e γ t m 1 t d t n 0 t d t n d t t d t d t m where γ is the arrival rate parameter dm t t is the function in

integrate these functions over the male probability distribution we simulate the exponentially distributed male arrivals with large enough numbers of males to produce adequate resolution of the

in the present analysis appendix c responses to temperature temperature has complex effects on the key responses of the altricial house sparrow which focus our attention in this section figs c 1 a d c 2 and c 3 whereas temperature effects on the precocial wood duck are much weaker fig c 1 e f and parallel results not shown to those in c 2 and c 3 and are therefore not considered further here there is an interaction among environmental temperature optimization of foraging schedule and especially of clutch size and the extent of supplemental incubation that may be provided by males if the female can optimize both clutch size and foraging schedule and males arrive to provide help at the default expected interval fitness is essentially unaffected by temperature fig c 1 a and the frequency of foraging bouts goes down steadily with increasing temperature fig c 1 b in this case the female can forage more efficiently and spend more time incubating at higher temperatures but in the absence of male help low temperatures lead to large increases in incubation time and a sharp decline in fitness fig c 1 c despite maximal female foraging frequency and a reduction in clutch size fig c 1 d despite the absence of male help in the precocial case the female remains able to stabilize her energy balance while having to spend very little total time away from the nest fig c 1 e and f if the female is unable to adjust clutch size the results are basically similar and only slightly more pronounced fig c 2 than in the case with clutch size optimized fig c 1 but with clutch size optimized and the female unable to adjust foraging schedule repercussions below 20 are severe optimal clutch size falls rapidly to zero for lower temperatures regardless of whether males provided supplementary incubation fig c 3 and when neither clutch size nor foraging schedule could be optimally adjusted we observed a total fitness crash just below the default temperature independent of male help fig c 3 a and b vs c and d we conclude that increasing the foraging frequency at lower temperatures can be essential for incubation to yield hatchlings appendix d sensitivity analyses we conducted two types of sensitivity analyses elasticity determination based on holding all but the focal parameter constant and increasing its magnitude by 5 to assess the relative shift in response here fitness and hyperpyramid analysis crowley et al submitted where magnitudes of the most relevant parameters are repeatedly sampled simultaneously from triangular frequency distributions and used to determine magnitudes of the key response variables hyperpyramid analysis is based on the hypercube approach sobol 2001 but assumes that the frequency distributions are triangular rather than rectangular providing a better approximation to typical unimodal shapes the range mean ratios in table d 1 indicate the length of the base of the triangular frequency distribution relative to its mean for the 10 parameters of each species having elasticities greater than 0 1 in absolute value for simplicity here we used isosceles triangles to construct the frequency distributions the means and 95 confidence intervals were generated from 4000 random draws of the 10 parameter magnitudes for each species implying that 100 of these fell in each tail of the confidence interval to ensure valid estimates table d 1 shows the elasticity results based on fitness responses parameters varied considerably in their relative effects on fitness and we summarize these patterns in the text also included in the table are the range mean ratios for triangular frequency distributions of each parameter yielding a strong individual response used in the hyperpyramid analysis fig d 1 shows mean magnitudes and 95 confidence intervals for five key response variables from this analysis these intervals indicate whether differences in responses between species can be considered statistically meaningful as addressed in the text 
24744,the need to follow structured populations as opposed to unstructured ones is well recognized the most detailed category of population models are the individual based population models ibms also called agent based population models abms their analysis is generally by simulation in time followed by statistical analysis of the numerical results a less detailed method is the physiologically structured population model approach pspms leading originally to continuous time partial differential equations pdes for the p opulation states such as number density with respect to time and i ndividual state such as age and or size and later to a delay equation formulation their mathematical analysis and computational methods are generally complex discrete time matrix population models mpms are much simpler to analyse in all respects but the applicability is limited due to stringent modelling assumptions made we discuss here a class of models we call the cohort projection models cpms which were formerly introduced as a special case of pspms with pulsed reproduction cpms follow cohorts of identical individuals in a lagrangian way of which the changes of their i states such as size energy reserves and maturity are described by age dependent ordinary differential equations ode s from deb theory simultaneously the p states such as number of individuals are described by time dependent odes obeying conservation laws the population is subdivided in generations on the assumption that seasonal cycles synchronize reproduction events among cohorts and all eggs that are produced by different generations are the same feedback from the environment can be included via specification of food dynamics that accommodates competition temperature follows a specified periodic trajectory in time this allows for the definition of a projection map of i states and p states from one reproduction event to the next the projection interval is typically one year for seasonal variability the properties of the map can be studied using nonlinear dynamical system theory such as existence and stability of fixed points and thereby the long term dynamics of the food population system we demonstrate this using deb parameter values from the add my pet amp collection for over 2000 animal species which were estimated from empirical data cpms are meant to match the relative simplicity of the analysis of mpms with the realism of the deb models for the dynamics of the population individuals keywords dynamic energy budget theory individual deb model physiological structured population dynamics amp tool projection map 1 introduction dynamic population models rely heavily on the modelling of the behaviour of the individuals that make up the population the physiological properties of the individuals play a crucial role in the formulation of the population model the states of the population are considered as emergent properties such as the number of individuals or total population structural volume or biomass the long term behaviour of these states such as steady state or periodic distributions and their stability can be studied under certain restrictions as long as the environment including food concentration stays constant a number of useful population traits can be assessed by solving the euler lotka equation kooijman et al 2020 if however individuals interact with their environment such as by depleting food matters rapidly become more complex we focus here on what to do in these situations many strategies have been formulated to step from individuals to populations we use here what we call cohort projection models cpms of which the formulation is presented in the context of discrete time models this approach was first introduced in persson et al 1998 for the analysis of pulsed reproduction models within the context of physiologically structured population models pspm s cohort projection models cpms are applicable only for populations where reproduction is periodical synchronous and iteroparous many temperate species such as most fish or birds have a rather short time interval in which they produce eggs we further stylize this by assuming a single reproduction event for the whole population with a typically one year period we first discuss existing methods for stepping from individuals to population to motivate the use of cpms then we summarize the standard deb model for individuals and derive the population equations for cpms step by step we illustrate application with the analysis of the dynamics of a population of marbled electric ray torpedo marmorata in the amp collection of over 2000 animal species anonymous 2019a 1 1 stepping from individuals to populations when individuals of a population are all considered to be equal we talk about an unstructured population model where the properties are lift up to the population level often just by taking the summation over all individuals however it is well recognized that there is a need to formulate structured populations where differences between individuals such as age size energy maturity as well as their stage such as embryo juvenile or adult are taken into account in these population models it is possible to distinguish between growth of individuals and growth of populations by reproduction of eggs in this type of populations it is important to distinguish the states of the individual i states for instance age size from that of the population p states such as number of individuals total population mass size distribution and so on population models can be formulated in discrete time or continuous time discrete time matrix models are described and analysed in caswell 2001 klanjscek et al 2006 formulate the elements of the projection matrix for two stages immature and mature based on deb structured populations in age structured populations webb 1985 the individuals differ in age and in size structured populations sinko and streifer 1971 in size and possibly in age as well this leads directly to partial differential equations pde models where the population number density p state is the dependent variable and the independent variables besides time also the i states age and or size for instance to include even more realistic feed backs from the environment we need pspms while individuals might differ in more than one trait dynamic energy budget deb theory was specifically designed for this purpose de roos 1997 kooijman 1993 2010c kooijman and metz 1984 metz and diekmann 1986 and can be applied to all species there is a large variety of approaches to formulate pspms cushing 1998 de roos 1997 diekmann et al 2001 2010 1998 metz and diekmann 1986 but they are typically formulated as a continuous time pdes volterra functional equations in breda et al 2013 or the delay equation formulation in diekmann and metz 2010 in the pde formulation the independent variables are besides time the age and possible other individual state variables for instance size and one dependent variable the population being a density with respect to the age variable when besides age there are more individual i state variables it is possible to formulate a set of pdes then in these pdes time and age are the independent variables in one of these the dependent variable is again the p state variable and further those where an i state variable is the dependent variable this is called the murphy trick in metz and diekmann 1986 page 111 in constant environments the analysis leads for a single population to the characteristic equation having characteristic values related to an exponential growth rate and associated age distributions metz and diekmann 1986 pages 24 25 the discrete time cohort projection model cpm described here was introduced first in persson et al 1998 for the analysis of populations with pulsed reproduction within the context of physiologically structured models implemented in the escalator boxcar train ebt software de roos 2016 as an instantaneous dynamics phenomenon the ebt method solves pdes of the mckendrick von foerster type kendrick 2014 von foerster 1959 using a lagrange method metz and diekmann 1986 p 111 to follow cohorts so integrating in time with continuous reproduction the ebt method integrates the pde in a numerically versatile way dealing with densities with respect to the age variable the murphy trick approach where cohorts are followed in time results here with the cpm approach in a finite set of odes for the i state variables and also the p state variable concentrated in one age point instead of a density the cpm is described by a finite dimensional projection map that can be analysed using nonlinear dynamical system theory analysis methods in the similar but more involved way as the analysis in caswell 2001 of the discrete time projection matrix in the mpms the idea is that seasonal cycles synchronize reproduction among individuals in the population stylized as a single event at the end of a projection interval typically one year this seasonal forcing is rather rule than exception among animals especially away from the tropics but treating the actual reproduction as an event is obviously a stylisation this however links up nicely the deb models since allocation to reproduction is treated as a continuous process which fills a reproduction buffer while the conversion of the buffer to offspring is taken to be an event we follow continuously cohorts of similar individuals over time at each moment within the projection period all individuals in a cohort have equal i states starting with a single cohort the number of new generations increases each period till the maximum age is reached thereafter the number of generations that form the population remains constant but the number of individuals in each generation can continue to change this leads to an ode for the p state here the number of equal individuals in each generation matrix projection models mpms caswell 2001 klanjscek et al 2006 and integral projection models ipms easterling et al 2000 have been based on deb structured populations klanjscek et al 2006 klok et al 2007 and liao et al 2019 smallegange et al 2017 respectively in these models within the projection period static distributions in age or size dependent are assumed and deviations can be expected in dynamic environments by working with dynamic projection maps in cpms adaptions to changing environments are possible and therefore they can be used to study transient as well as long term dynamics we here use the standard deb model to specify the performance of individuals jusup et al 2017 kooijman 2001 2012 sara et al 2014 sousa et al 2006 van der meer 2006 it delineates embryos which do not feed juveniles which do not allocate to reproduction and adults while the environment is characterized by food concentration and temperature the model amounts to a set of odes that needs to be integrated from fertilisation to death the parameter values of deb models have been estimated from empirical data of animal species anonymous 2019a the population model specifies interactions between individuals such as competition for food and predation temperature is typically treated as a forcing variable where all metabolic rate parameters of all population individuals described all by the deb model depend on temperature in the same way by the arrhenius equation kooijman 2010c page 17 with going from the individual level to the population level we will emphasise how specific deb model properties are dealt with for instance in the deb model the embryo stage is an essential life stage and this causes a delay effect since during this stage there is no interaction with the environment except temperature some of these issues are discussed in diekmann and metz 2010 the matlab code for the individual model is obtained from debtool anonymous 2019c and the amptool anonymous 2019a 2019b debtool is a software package written in matlab to facilitate applications of deb theory kooijman et al 2020 marques et al 2018 and amptool anonymous 2019b is an extension to support analysis of the amp collection of parameter values and traits for all its animal species the aim of this paper is to describe how this package can be used to analyze the dynamic behaviour of deb structured population models also for the analysis of the dynamics populations that do not comply with the restrictions periodical synchronous and iteroparous 2 the deb model for the individual the standard deb model is the simplest deb model in the family of models implied by deb theory a canonical form with one type of food one reserve one structure maturation and a reproduction buffer and where growth is isomorphic the transitions to next life stages occur when maturity thresholds are exceeded when aging is included it also needs the state variables damage inducing compounds and damage compounds animals are special among organisms by feeding on other organisms so complex substrates from a chemical perspective with the implication that a single reserve suffices in most cases three life stages are delineated embryo juvenile and adult the i state variables are structure volume v reserve density e maturity eh reproduction buffer er aging acceleration q and aging hazard h a although maturity is quantified by the cumulative energy investment it neither has mass or energy and is treated as information other deb models for animals are extensions of the standard one allowing for reproduction via fetuses rather than eggs larval stages metabolic acceleration kooijman 2014 multiple types of food etc deb models of other organisms rather than animals are further extensions to include multiple reserves and structures e g for plants we need roots and shoots using the lagrange description at the population level we will follow changes in these i state variables as functions of age a in a coupled set of odes in an embryo that starts developing maturity is almost zero and it will increase because part of the energy extracted from reserve is allocated to maturation if maturity exceeds level e h b at birth the transition from embryo to juvenile is made which initiates feeding if it exceeds level e h p at puberty the transition from juvenile to adult is made further maturation is ceased and investment in maturity is re directed to the reproduction buffer where it accumulates till a reproduction event at this event the buffer content is converted to eggs with efficiency κr which are typically removed from the body and deposited into the environment embryos start as pure reserve maturity and structure being almost zero explicit expressions will be derived in the appendix a the ages ab and ap and the other i states values except the two values for e h b and e h p at the stage transitions generally depend on the feeding history the next subsections specify the processes quantitatively in a time length energy frame but they can readily be reformulated in a time length dry mass frame see kooijman 2010c table 8 1 2 1 energy fluxes fig 1 shows the diagram of the energy fluxes in the standard deb model using the standard deb notation kooijman 2010b these powers are 1a p x p a κ x 1b p a f p a m v 2 3 if e h e h b else p a 0 1c p c e e g p a m e m v 2 3 p s κ e e g v

assumption reserve density e settles to a constant value during growth after birth in constant environments energy conductance v controls the mobilization flux p c their ratio p a m v e m represents the maximum reserve density after birth a fraction κ of the reserves is allocated to somatic processes the rest to maturation and reproduction the thresholds where the individuals change stage are expressed in the i state maturity at birth e h b and at puberty e h p in appendix b we discuss a special situation where these energy thresholds can equally be expressed in volume namely vb and vp and where size is the main i state and maturity is not calculated explicitly 2 2 structure reserve density maturity reproduction buffer the changes in structure v growth reserve density e maturity eh

efficiency κr meaning that fraction 1 κ r becomes lost the buffer handling rules are species specific reproduction is often taken as a continuous function of time as in kooijman et al 2020 which is an approximation for the rule that the buffer is emptied as soon as it is enough to produce one egg we assume that reproduction is only at the end of the projection interval so typically once per year during prolonged starvation shrinking and rejuvenation can occur with consequences for survival we refer to the comments kooijman 2010a section shrinking during starvation and rejuvenation during starvation for a detailed discussion we assume that shrinking does not occur in our case study and this was checked for all results presented 2 3 aging acceleration and hazard generally aging is neglected in population dynamic studies because the loss rate due to trophic interaction is taken to be dominant except for top predators the significance of aging is however to set a ceiling for the memory of the population and be sure that no individual survives older than some maximum age a max the aging module of deb theory kooijman 2010c van leeuwen et al 2002 is based on the idea that respiration generates ros reactive oxygen species that induces damage inducing compounds think e g of affected mitochondrial dna which generate damage compounds think e g of modified proteins the damage compounds accumulate and the hazard rate that is linked to aging is taken proportional to the density of damage compounds damage inducing compounds can produce more damage inducing compounds the latter rate is typically low in ectotherms but can be higher in endotherms birds mammals with the effect that the survival probability due to aging remains high for a long period relative to the life span but then suddenly collapses this module has 2 parameters and it turns out that two popular empirical models by weibull 1951 and gompertz 1825 are special cases of the deb aging module they also have 2 parameters each but lack a coupling to assimilation the reason is they where mostly applied to endoterms which are on the demand end of the supply demand spectrum lika et al 2014 and therefore sport a very limited range in mean food intake the deb aging model kooijman 2010c eq 6 2 states that given the specific growth rate r d d a ln v in eq 4a scaled reserve density e e e m and maximum structural volume v m κ p a m p m 3 the aging acceleration q a and aging hazard rate h a a change as 7 d q d a q v v m s g h a e v v 1 3 r r q d h a d a q r h a aging acceleration h a and gompertz stress coefficient sg are constant parameters apart from effects of temperature both q and h a should be seen as state variables that need to be integrated together with the other state variables since they depend on them the expression for the aging hazard rate h a is used in defining the survival probability s a by 8 d s d a h a s where s 0 1 in a population setting with interactions with the environment aging is just one possible cause of death and probably not the most important one but these causes are taken into account in for the change of the number n of individuals for each generation i see eq 9 below are taken to be independent so the corresponding hazards can be added 2 4 initial conditions in deb kooijman 2010c the initial conditions for the freshly laid fertilised eggs are q 0 0 h a 0 0 v 0 0 e 0 e 0 and e h 0 0 is such that e e v at birth equals that of the mother at egg formation maturation at birth equals h a b e h b which is a parameter the maternal effect starving mothers allocate less to reproduction but lay somewhat smaller eggs which partly compensates the effect of starving on reproduction this is however very inconvenient for our present cpms where we want to collect all eggs produced by all generations in a single new cohort we therefore assume that e 0 is always the value at abundant food explicit expressions for the initial conditions of the other i states are derived in appendix a where it is avoided that v 0 0 because the reserve density e is not well defined at age zero when v 0 0 generally all time dependent parameters depend on temperature so if temperature is a function of time they too become time dependent ratios of rates do not depend on time and are taken to be independent of temperature in the basic formulation this completes the formulation of the individual model the next section considers the population level where we follow cohorts in time 3 population model we assume homogeneous space and that growth and behaviour of all individuals are described by the same model and have the same parameter values but possibly different i states the implication for the deterministic model is that if two individuals have the same i state at fertilisation they remain identical lifelong we follow thereby cohorts of identical individual produced at the same time the population consists of a zero generation of the cohort generated last the cohort generated second last and so on backward in time hence a finite number of coexisting generations of adjacent cohorts denoted by n that equals the maximum age as multiple of the projection interval t 0 a max n t 0 we will distinguish age a and time t and we introduce the auxiliary time variable within the projection interval denoted by τ 0 t 0 for the sake of simplicity we assume time t 0 at the reproduction event for the population where a new cohort is created the age a of the individuals in that cohort equals zero a 0 hence at time τ t the age of these individuals is a τ in general at time t there will be n coexisting generations of adjacent cohorts indexed by i with ages τ τ i t 0 τ n t 0 the cohort of the n the generation dies at maximum age nt 0 directly after the last reproduction we follow the female sub population only meaning that all individuals produce eggs and we assume a 1 1 sex ratio on the assumption that male and female eggs are equally costly we require for equilibrium that κr is halved the temperature t t and sometimes also food concentration x t are treated as given but assumed to have the same periodicity as the reproduction process in the food population case food x t is described by the solution of an ode we use the lagrangian description in which individuals are tracked metz and diekmann 1986 p 111 it gives a direct connection with the i state survival probability s this allows us to follow a cohort as the group of individuals that start at the same time with the same i states v e h q h s of which the dynamics is described in eqs 4a 4b 5 7 8 at the population level we will describe its dynamics by introduction of the number of individuals that form the cohorts although the number of individuals in a cohort for every generation jumps at reproduction events their numbers of individuals change within the projection interval for each generation in a continuous way on time and for ni t we have 9 d n i d t h n i i 0 n where the loss rate h is the sum of all cause specific loss rates including the i state aging hazard rate h a 8 using the relationship between age and time but also p state losses due to interaction with the environment such as by thinning see kooijman et al 2020 back ground mortality predation or emigration to have a notation to describe the dynamics of the population in discrete time with projection interval of t 0 days we introduce a super index j mod t t 0 j 0 called the projection index that is the time at fertilisation hence at time just after a population reproduction event we write for the number of individuals n i j where the sub index i 1 n indicates the ith generation at that event a new cohort zero generation i 0 is created that consists of the freshly produced eggs of all reproducing generations whereby generation i n dies and is removed from the population in order to reformulate the problem in terms of the classical non linear dynamical system theory for maps we define the vector of state variables as follows 10 y v 0 e 0 h 0 s 0 v i e i h i s i v n e n h n s n n 0 n i n n x t where h e h e r the energy allocated to maturity and reproduction and environmental variables food consentration x t is appended to the list note that the generation i 0 will start at a small but positive age a 0 so v 0 v a 0 e 0 e 0 v a 0 and h 0 h a 0 discussed in appendix a the projection map φ is denoted by 11 y j 1 φ y j where j n is the index of the map indicating the discrete times where fertilisation occurs 12 the integrand terms are the right hand sides of the deb equations eqs 4a 4b 5 7 8 the tilde means evaluate just before reproduction events that is at the end of the projection interval to calculate the solution for the whole projection interval we solve this set of coupled odes eqs 4a 4b 5 7 8 for all the generations i 0 n in the deb model formulation the number of variables is 9 n 1 that is n 40 times the number of the variables vi e i hi ni s i q i and h a i and finally one environmental variable x in the calculation of the total hazard rate those of the i state si and the p state ni are added for stability analysis reasons it is important to distinguish between si and ni for the initial condition s 0 j 1 is fixed while n 0 j is a free variable it is also needed to distinguish between loss of dead individuals with detritus production in the environment and loss of living individuals terms in mass balances of the population and the environment for instance chemostat since all adult individuals reproduce at the end of the projection interval it is advantageous to introduce generations were members of a cohort move to the next one at the reproduction event a new cohort is formed at fertilisation events in generation i 0 when they have reached their maximum age at i n each cohort dies after their last reproduction event at age a max n t 0 we have furthermore the following relationships for the reproduction terms at the moment of fertilisation at the end of the projection interval 13 a population equilibrium is then given by the fixed point of the projection map and is given when the following cyclic boundary condition y j 1 y j holds we continue with a discussion of the well known euler lotka equation for the discrete time projection map φ eq 11 given in eq 12 and 13 for one time interval t 0 j j 1 14 1 κ r e 0 k 0 n n k j max 0 h k j e h p were we assume constant food x and h h a that is there is only an aging hazard rate eq 8 the expression on the right hand side of eq 14 is the number of eggs produced by the population all generations i 0 n at an reproduction event n 0 j 1 which is equal to 1 because there is equilibrium we have also n 0 j 1 there is also another interpretation of this relationship where the individual level point of view is stressed for the time interval j 0 n namely that each mother n 0 j 1 see also eq 8 should in equilibrium produce a single female offspring during her life nt 0 j j n where n 0 j 1 1 this gives 15 1 κ r e 0 l 0 n n l j l max 0 h l j l e h p equal to the expression in the right hand side of eq 14 in the result section these two interpretations are compared by numerical simulation 3 1 food dynamics the dynamics of the population is studied under constant food conditions and in a semi chemostat environment constant food is studied by taking a constant functional response value denoted as f f 0 where we assume that the food concentration allows the existence of the population in equilibrium then we study the population in equilibrium for one lifetime t 0 n t 0 the equilibrium x is given by x f k x 1 0 f 0 we assume only loss of individuals due to againg part of the deb theory the loss rate in eq 9 is given by h h a and for each generation i we have d n i d t t τ i t 0 d s d a a τ i t 0 i 1 n in a semi chemostat environment the in flowing food concentration xin is either constant or periodical annual 16 d x d t d x i n t x p x m f x t i 1 n v i 2 3 n i the second term is the feeding rate of the female population we recall that we only follow the female sub population so this is only food consumed by the females and not by the male which consume the same amount the function f x t is the scaled holling type ii functional response eq 2 generally in a chemostat reactor the individuals of the population leave the chemostat similar to the out flow of the food this can be included by a constant additional loss term d in 9 however here in a semi chemostat the individuals of the populations do not leave the reactor in the deb theory there is still a loss due to aging in this case in eq 9 the loss rate is given by h h a similar to the constant food case above 4 a case study torpedo marmorata in this section we discuss the calculated results for the marbled electric ray torpedo marmorata the amp entry for this species uses experimental data from consalvo et al 2007 fig 3b where samples were obtained from catches of bottom trawler at the trawl fishing grounds of fiumicino landing harbour italy in 2000 2001 the bi monthly evolution of maturation stages in adult females shows that early pregnant specimens were found the greatest amount in january consalvo et al 2007 fig 6 this justifies more or less our assumption that reproduction occurs in a small time window at the end of a projection interval the parameters from the amp collection anonymous 2019a are given in table 1 in the first step we calculate the life cycle dynamics of an individual during its three life stages embryo juvenile and adults in a constant food environment where f 0 8 this is the value used in amptool anonymous 2019a in the second step the development in all generations are calculated sequentially for one cohort where n 0 0 1 see also the euler lotka equation eq 15 reproduction is at the end of the projection interval here a date of the year the number of produced eggs is evaluated cumulatively changing the scaled functional response f gives the neutral equilibrium of the population f f 0 where in its lifetime of n 40 years with t 0 365 d one female egg and on male egg is produced by the individual the corresponding state vector eq 10 is called y 0 in the third step one population cohort is followed during the lifetime again under constant food conditions where n 0 0 1 see also the euler lotka equation eq 14 the population is separated into generations consisting of equal individuals these generations are followed now simultaneously the number of generations equals the age at which the individual delivers its last eggs and thereafter dies hence the time interval considered is nt 0 the value for the scaled functional response is f 0 that fixes the constant food level x such that the population is in equilibrium where the state vector eq 10 is as in the previous step y 0 now calculated using eq 11 the final step gives the transient dynamics of the population feeding on unstructured food in a semi chemostat the initial conditions for the state of the population is the vector y 0 and it deserves special attention both i state and p state variables are needed for individuals of all n generations each belonging to the adjacent n cohorts formed in the past backward in time within the time interval of the maximum age at times it 0 where i 0 n for long term dynamics there are no additional problems however for transient dynamics experimental data have to be available for this whole individual life time interval a max n t 0 4 1 amptool results individual model the results from amptool anonymous 2019a for the weight length fit of torpedo marmorata are shown in fig 2 with f 0 8 the dots in the figure form the uni variate data points on which together with zero variate data from the literature the fit is based the parameter values taken from the amp collection anonymous 2019a are given in table 1 in fig 3 curves are calculated by integrating the set of individual state equations eqs 4a 4b 5 7 8 with initial conditions for the three individuals state v e and h at ab eq 23 e a 0 e 0 28 with q a 0 0 h a a 0 0 in the left panel we used f 0 8 as in fig 2 the results in both figures show that they are in the experimental length interval almost the same while the initial conditions after fertilization were take different see the appendix a in all figures presenting results for the i states the life stages are indicated by colors embryo red juvenile blue and adult black in the right panel the calculated growth curve for the life cycle stages are shown for f f 0 the calculated value of the scaled functional response f 0 0 2793 that fixes the food level in a constant environment where the population is in a neutral equilibrium state given by x f 0 k x 1 0 f 0 32 18 fig 4 shows the simulation results for the i state variables the structural volume v a energy reserve e a maturity eh a and the reproduction buffer er a the aging survival probability s a is plotted as function of the age a in fig 5 which is important at the population level the cumulative survival probability c s a a 0 t 0 s a d a is also shown the mean life span equals lim a cs a 4 2 results at population level with constant food at the individual level as discussed in the previous section the results for the one cohort dynamics shown in fig 4c d for eh a and er a can be calculated directly by solving the odes for these two variables eqs 4c 4d formulated at the individual level as part of system eq 4 at the population level we solve however first the system eqs 4a 4b 5 7 8 i 0 n with h a e h a e r a so for the elements of vector y thereafter the results for eh a and er a separately are obtained from eq 6 fig 6 shows the n generations with the dynamics of the i state variables volume v a energy reserves e a and energy allocated to maturity h a within n projection intervals the constant food level equals that in the previous section with scaled functional response f f 0 0 2793 in fig 7 we show the results for the two energy i state variables maturity e h a τ k t 0 and the reproduction buffer e r a τ k t 0 calculated from h a shown in fig 6c using eq 6 the results in this figure shows that the dynamics is non smooth at puberty where h e h e h p while in fig 6c the solution is smooth within the projection interval the discontinuity of the projection map φ y is exclusively located at the reproduction event as described in eq 13 and the euler lotka equation eq 14 compression of these results with those obtained in the previous section shows that the solutions for the individual level in fig 4 are precisely the concatenation of the n generation cohort solutions in figs 6 and 7 at the population level we can now make a connection between this cohort dynamics taken as a function of time t 0 not only in the time interval 0 t nt 0 and the age of the individuals that make up the cohorts the time within the projection cycle is denoted by τ 0 t 0 day the super index j n denotes the time in years and the sub index i 1 n indicates the ith generation which are in the time intervals t j t 0 j n t 0 the age a of an individual in the ith generation equals a τ i t 0 in the next section the population interacts with a time dependent food in a semi chemostat reactor being a two trophic food population system the initial values for the state vector y 0 will be those for τ 0 in fig 6 4 3 results for food population dynamics in a semi chemostat to follow all generations of individuals in time in a semi chemostat reactor we have to specify their initial conditions just after the fertilisation date we used the equilibrium state values in a constant food environment from the previous section we recall that in the projection map formulation only the values of the i state and p state variables at the discrete monitoring date are needed those in the vector y eq 10 from this initial situation y 0 the calculations are performed successively over the projection intervals which can be continued after the founder population died that is t t 0 n fig 8 gives the discrete dynamics of the i state variables within the projection period this is essentially the dynamics of the projection map the initial conditions are those for the steady state i states of the single population system shown in the previous section at j 0 the value just after fertilisation is plotted and for j 0 those just before fertilisation the results show rapid convergence to a stable fixed point the results for the food population system are now presented by showing the amount of food and structural volume of the population not only the discrete time projection values here at monitoring date of the year but also the continuous time changes within the projection interval can be calculated and are shown in fig 9 fig 10 shows the continuous time results for the population structural volume for the first 10 years 17 y τ k 0 n v k τ k t 0 n k τ k t 0 τ 0 t 0 5 discussion we developed a post processor for the amp collection anonymous 2019b marques et al 2018 with parameter values of over 2000 animal species which can now be used for the numerical analysis of a population in this paper the case study was for a species with the restriction of synchronisation of their seasonal reproduction the first step in this process is to reconstruct the full life cycle of an individual energetics from the anonymous 2019a parameter values the data on which the parameter estimates are based typically does not cover the full cycle but given the deb models this is also not required and the goodness of fit with empirical data is very good the standard deb model is the basic one of 10 related deb models that are used in the amp collection these models are simple extensions to include fetal development metabolic acceleration extra life stages and so on semelparous species such as the cephalopods represent just another variation for which the cpms would work out very simply most semelparous species accelerate and are annuals i e living just a year so don t follow the standard aging module programmed death they therefore deviate in more than one respect from the standard deb model a complete analysis of the food population system and other ecosystem models is beyond the scope of this paper in these analyses the advantage to be able to analyse the finite dimensional discrete time population model can be used to perform the calculation of the equilibria and their stability as well as bifurcation analysis where dependence on parameter values is studied in kooi and van der meer 2010 this was done to calculated transcritical bifurcation curves in the so called pairwise and mutual invasibility plots in the adaptive dynamics approach for evolutionary development of populations geritz et al 1998 the cpm approach is the same as the one proposed in persson et al 1998 de roos and persson 2001 which has been used in a number of papers see chaparro pedraza and de roos 2019 and references therein the individual models in the first two papers is size structured and in the last it is related to a deb model the numerical integration is carried out using the ebt escalator boxcar train de roos 1988 originally designed for the simulation of physiologically structured populations but adapted to analyse populations where reproduction is pulse wise here we use cpm that is introduced as an alternative for the discrete time mpm and ipm approaches to restrict the problem to finite dimensional systems we assume that the population has an iteroparous reproductive strategy the numerical implementation can be done using standard matrix operations and numerical ode solvers with event handling for the calculation of birth e h b and puberty e h p time points therefore it is important that the system is smooth at these transition points especially at puberty e h p and this was the motivation to introduce the single i state variable h e h e r for h a the transition is smooth see fig 6c while for eh a and er a the rate of change in time is discontinuous see fig 7 in klanjscek et al 2006 the elements of the discrete time two by two projection matrix of the mpm approach are formulated for the two stages consisting of immature and mature individuals a constant or seasonally variable environment and birth pulse population with births occurring at the end of the projection interval similar to conditions studied here when all vital rates are constant the asymptotic growth rate of the population is given by the dominant eigenvalue of the projection matrix which is obtained by an iterative process the stable stage distribution is the eigenvector of the discrete time matrix these properties can be used to obtain sensitivities of the growth rate a very similar approach was applied in klok et al 2007 were the formulation of the matrix elements was also based on the deb theory in the ipm approach a discrete time equation from t to t 1 is an integral where the integrand is a kernel times the number density with respect to the length over the possible domain of lengths this reflects the formalism of size structured pde equations the kernel is a combination of the survival growth and reproduction functions the kernel maps the length distribution from t to t 1 the original ipm is data driven where parts of the kernels are estimated using phenomenological regression models see merow et al 2014 and generally stochasticity is taken into account in smallegange et al 2017 the ipm is used where the individual life history trajectories are described by a simplified deb model from kooijman and metz 1984 in the cpm approach the integral is over the projection intervals for all generations of adjacent cohorts reflecting an age structured formalism where individuals are followed in time described by the i state odes and one for the number of individuals being the p state of all generations forming the population where kooijman et al 2020 deals with constant environments here we first allowed cyclically changing environments and still treat temperature and food concentration as forcing variables first in equilibrium with constant food and thereafter we included feed backs from the environment in a food population system this can also be a generalized reactor with food supply to and from the reactor and where individuals do compete for food subsequent steps allow for living food and predators sporting growth and reproduction although such steps into the direction of a food chain or even an ecosystem are highly relevant the problem is that this can be done in a very large number of ways and depends strongly on the natural site under investigation in diekmann and metz 2010 a dde formulation for size structured population as a pspm and an unstructured resource is described and the existence and stability boundaries are analysed furthermore extensions and applications to the deb model are considered and it is concluded that it fits the general dde framework they mentioned however specifics of the deb model that hampers direct application but that these specifics do not give fundamental problems it is interesting to note that the removal of the variable er was one of them this is done here by the introduction of the single variable h a e h a e r a the underlying motivation in this paper is to get a smooth individual dynamics within the projection interval to avoid numerical analysis difficulties and to be able to calculated an equilibrium rigorously in the case study no special event handling techniques were needed for the numerical ode solver at the stage transition points birth and puberty however this issue will be more important with a stability analysis of the equilibrium while the partial derivatives with respect to the state variables being the elements of the jacobian matrix have to be obtained numerically the restrictions to be able to apply the mpm approach are more restrictive that those required in cpm because further simplifying assumption have to be made for calculation of the matrix elements as a result the obtained results are less reliable especially related to the calculation of the matrix elements as weighted averages of the stable age distribution than those obtained with the cpm approach in conclusion the cpm approach is better suited in all aspects application of the ipm approach is less restrictive than cpm for instance asynchronous reproduction is allowed an advantage is the integrated parametrisation of the population level parameters e g control parameters of the reactor by application of regression analysis of population experiments data the ipm is an alternative for the pspm approach where system level experimental data are used for population and environmental parameter estimation with ibm abm

acknowledgements we thank one anonymous reviewer and andré the roos for valuable suggestions and comments on the manuscript appendix a conditions at fertilisation in this appendix we formulate and analyse the individual embryo initial conditions for the set of three odes for a short period after fertilisation where 0 a ab when the development of the embryo in the egg or foetes takes place we recall that deb explicitly accounts for the embryo stage causing a delay effect since during the embryo stage there is no interaction with the environment except temperature and further that the initial i state conditions at fertilisation not at birth are deb specific although this might be less important for population dynamics in some species in the ray that we use as illustration the embryo period lasts almost a full year we use the fixed energy amount of one egg e 0 as initial condition for the reserve energy e 0 however we avoid to use v 0 h 0 0 the amount of reserve energy e 0 is used for growth of the structure accumulation of maturity and paying maintenance because there is no interaction with the environment during the embryonic stage furthermore the conditions are not formulated at a 0 but at 0 a 0 ab this value a 0 is species specific and has to be fixed by trail and error it is a mathematical analysis parameter and not biologically motivated parameter empirical parameter values for a small a 0 can preferably be used if available the reserve energy density e becomes infinite when v 0 0 for lim a 0 v a 0 we get lim a 0 e a while e 0 e 0 is finite this shows that is it better to formulate using a regular perturbation technique the initial conditions v a 0 and eh a 0 for a 0 small using the dynamics of the reserve energy e a in the interval 0 a a 0

volume the following special case where the and maturity reproduction and growth rates are proportional deh da dv da within the embryo and juvenile stages is studied we start with eqs 4b 4a and 5 for the variable v a e a and eh a we assume the following relationship between the two parameter k j and k m which is inspired by the work of thieme 1988 and also mentioned in kooijman 2000 page 112 29 κ

have 33 d e h a d a 0 that is the maturity density is constant eq 31 is the expression we suggested in appendix a where the partitioning relationship was valid in the small age interval 0 a 0 but here for the whole life cycle in order to get more insight in the consequences of this assumption we consider now the flow of the powers given in fig 11 which is a modified fig 1 the mobilised energy for the reserves into the growth branch and the maturity branch gives directly using eq 29 34 p j 1 κ κ p s in this case the mobilised energy is located to the various processes as follows p c κ p c 1 κ p

from the reserve p c into κ p c and 1 κ p c shown in fig 11 is given by eqns 34 and 35 the partitioning is the same for both that is the partition to maturition follows is the same partitioning as in the structure branch see fig 11 until now only the immature life stages were considered for the mature adult stage we refer to the description of the model in the main text eq 5 where we assume that k

24744,the need to follow structured populations as opposed to unstructured ones is well recognized the most detailed category of population models are the individual based population models ibms also called agent based population models abms their analysis is generally by simulation in time followed by statistical analysis of the numerical results a less detailed method is the physiologically structured population model approach pspms leading originally to continuous time partial differential equations pdes for the p opulation states such as number density with respect to time and i ndividual state such as age and or size and later to a delay equation formulation their mathematical analysis and computational methods are generally complex discrete time matrix population models mpms are much simpler to analyse in all respects but the applicability is limited due to stringent modelling assumptions made we discuss here a class of models we call the cohort projection models cpms which were formerly introduced as a special case of pspms with pulsed reproduction cpms follow cohorts of identical individuals in a lagrangian way of which the changes of their i states such as size energy reserves and maturity are described by age dependent ordinary differential equations ode s from deb theory simultaneously the p states such as number of individuals are described by time dependent odes obeying conservation laws the population is subdivided in generations on the assumption that seasonal cycles synchronize reproduction events among cohorts and all eggs that are produced by different generations are the same feedback from the environment can be included via specification of food dynamics that accommodates competition temperature follows a specified periodic trajectory in time this allows for the definition of a projection map of i states and p states from one reproduction event to the next the projection interval is typically one year for seasonal variability the properties of the map can be studied using nonlinear dynamical system theory such as existence and stability of fixed points and thereby the long term dynamics of the food population system we demonstrate this using deb parameter values from the add my pet amp collection for over 2000 animal species which were estimated from empirical data cpms are meant to match the relative simplicity of the analysis of mpms with the realism of the deb models for the dynamics of the population individuals keywords dynamic energy budget theory individual deb model physiological structured population dynamics amp tool projection map 1 introduction dynamic population models rely heavily on the modelling of the behaviour of the individuals that make up the population the physiological properties of the individuals play a crucial role in the formulation of the population model the states of the population are considered as emergent properties such as the number of individuals or total population structural volume or biomass the long term behaviour of these states such as steady state or periodic distributions and their stability can be studied under certain restrictions as long as the environment including food concentration stays constant a number of useful population traits can be assessed by solving the euler lotka equation kooijman et al 2020 if however individuals interact with their environment such as by depleting food matters rapidly become more complex we focus here on what to do in these situations many strategies have been formulated to step from individuals to populations we use here what we call cohort projection models cpms of which the formulation is presented in the context of discrete time models this approach was first introduced in persson et al 1998 for the analysis of pulsed reproduction models within the context of physiologically structured population models pspm s cohort projection models cpms are applicable only for populations where reproduction is periodical synchronous and iteroparous many temperate species such as most fish or birds have a rather short time interval in which they produce eggs we further stylize this by assuming a single reproduction event for the whole population with a typically one year period we first discuss existing methods for stepping from individuals to population to motivate the use of cpms then we summarize the standard deb model for individuals and derive the population equations for cpms step by step we illustrate application with the analysis of the dynamics of a population of marbled electric ray torpedo marmorata in the amp collection of over 2000 animal species anonymous 2019a 1 1 stepping from individuals to populations when individuals of a population are all considered to be equal we talk about an unstructured population model where the properties are lift up to the population level often just by taking the summation over all individuals however it is well recognized that there is a need to formulate structured populations where differences between individuals such as age size energy maturity as well as their stage such as embryo juvenile or adult are taken into account in these population models it is possible to distinguish between growth of individuals and growth of populations by reproduction of eggs in this type of populations it is important to distinguish the states of the individual i states for instance age size from that of the population p states such as number of individuals total population mass size distribution and so on population models can be formulated in discrete time or continuous time discrete time matrix models are described and analysed in caswell 2001 klanjscek et al 2006 formulate the elements of the projection matrix for two stages immature and mature based on deb structured populations in age structured populations webb 1985 the individuals differ in age and in size structured populations sinko and streifer 1971 in size and possibly in age as well this leads directly to partial differential equations pde models where the population number density p state is the dependent variable and the independent variables besides time also the i states age and or size for instance to include even more realistic feed backs from the environment we need pspms while individuals might differ in more than one trait dynamic energy budget deb theory was specifically designed for this purpose de roos 1997 kooijman 1993 2010c kooijman and metz 1984 metz and diekmann 1986 and can be applied to all species there is a large variety of approaches to formulate pspms cushing 1998 de roos 1997 diekmann et al 2001 2010 1998 metz and diekmann 1986 but they are typically formulated as a continuous time pdes volterra functional equations in breda et al 2013 or the delay equation formulation in diekmann and metz 2010 in the pde formulation the independent variables are besides time the age and possible other individual state variables for instance size and one dependent variable the population being a density with respect to the age variable when besides age there are more individual i state variables it is possible to formulate a set of pdes then in these pdes time and age are the independent variables in one of these the dependent variable is again the p state variable and further those where an i state variable is the dependent variable this is called the murphy trick in metz and diekmann 1986 page 111 in constant environments the analysis leads for a single population to the characteristic equation having characteristic values related to an exponential growth rate and associated age distributions metz and diekmann 1986 pages 24 25 the discrete time cohort projection model cpm described here was introduced first in persson et al 1998 for the analysis of populations with pulsed reproduction within the context of physiologically structured models implemented in the escalator boxcar train ebt software de roos 2016 as an instantaneous dynamics phenomenon the ebt method solves pdes of the mckendrick von foerster type kendrick 2014 von foerster 1959 using a lagrange method metz and diekmann 1986 p 111 to follow cohorts so integrating in time with continuous reproduction the ebt method integrates the pde in a numerically versatile way dealing with densities with respect to the age variable the murphy trick approach where cohorts are followed in time results here with the cpm approach in a finite set of odes for the i state variables and also the p state variable concentrated in one age point instead of a density the cpm is described by a finite dimensional projection map that can be analysed using nonlinear dynamical system theory analysis methods in the similar but more involved way as the analysis in caswell 2001 of the discrete time projection matrix in the mpms the idea is that seasonal cycles synchronize reproduction among individuals in the population stylized as a single event at the end of a projection interval typically one year this seasonal forcing is rather rule than exception among animals especially away from the tropics but treating the actual reproduction as an event is obviously a stylisation this however links up nicely the deb models since allocation to reproduction is treated as a continuous process which fills a reproduction buffer while the conversion of the buffer to offspring is taken to be an event we follow continuously cohorts of similar individuals over time at each moment within the projection period all individuals in a cohort have equal i states starting with a single cohort the number of new generations increases each period till the maximum age is reached thereafter the number of generations that form the population remains constant but the number of individuals in each generation can continue to change this leads to an ode for the p state here the number of equal individuals in each generation matrix projection models mpms caswell 2001 klanjscek et al 2006 and integral projection models ipms easterling et al 2000 have been based on deb structured populations klanjscek et al 2006 klok et al 2007 and liao et al 2019 smallegange et al 2017 respectively in these models within the projection period static distributions in age or size dependent are assumed and deviations can be expected in dynamic environments by working with dynamic projection maps in cpms adaptions to changing environments are possible and therefore they can be used to study transient as well as long term dynamics we here use the standard deb model to specify the performance of individuals jusup et al 2017 kooijman 2001 2012 sara et al 2014 sousa et al 2006 van der meer 2006 it delineates embryos which do not feed juveniles which do not allocate to reproduction and adults while the environment is characterized by food concentration and temperature the model amounts to a set of odes that needs to be integrated from fertilisation to death the parameter values of deb models have been estimated from empirical data of animal species anonymous 2019a the population model specifies interactions between individuals such as competition for food and predation temperature is typically treated as a forcing variable where all metabolic rate parameters of all population individuals described all by the deb model depend on temperature in the same way by the arrhenius equation kooijman 2010c page 17 with going from the individual level to the population level we will emphasise how specific deb model properties are dealt with for instance in the deb model the embryo stage is an essential life stage and this causes a delay effect since during this stage there is no interaction with the environment except temperature some of these issues are discussed in diekmann and metz 2010 the matlab code for the individual model is obtained from debtool anonymous 2019c and the amptool anonymous 2019a 2019b debtool is a software package written in matlab to facilitate applications of deb theory kooijman et al 2020 marques et al 2018 and amptool anonymous 2019b is an extension to support analysis of the amp collection of parameter values and traits for all its animal species the aim of this paper is to describe how this package can be used to analyze the dynamic behaviour of deb structured population models also for the analysis of the dynamics populations that do not comply with the restrictions periodical synchronous and iteroparous 2 the deb model for the individual the standard deb model is the simplest deb model in the family of models implied by deb theory a canonical form with one type of food one reserve one structure maturation and a reproduction buffer and where growth is isomorphic the transitions to next life stages occur when maturity thresholds are exceeded when aging is included it also needs the state variables damage inducing compounds and damage compounds animals are special among organisms by feeding on other organisms so complex substrates from a chemical perspective with the implication that a single reserve suffices in most cases three life stages are delineated embryo juvenile and adult the i state variables are structure volume v reserve density e maturity eh reproduction buffer er aging acceleration q and aging hazard h a although maturity is quantified by the cumulative energy investment it neither has mass or energy and is treated as information other deb models for animals are extensions of the standard one allowing for reproduction via fetuses rather than eggs larval stages metabolic acceleration kooijman 2014 multiple types of food etc deb models of other organisms rather than animals are further extensions to include multiple reserves and structures e g for plants we need roots and shoots using the lagrange description at the population level we will follow changes in these i state variables as functions of age a in a coupled set of odes in an embryo that starts developing maturity is almost zero and it will increase because part of the energy extracted from reserve is allocated to maturation if maturity exceeds level e h b at birth the transition from embryo to juvenile is made which initiates feeding if it exceeds level e h p at puberty the transition from juvenile to adult is made further maturation is ceased and investment in maturity is re directed to the reproduction buffer where it accumulates till a reproduction event at this event the buffer content is converted to eggs with efficiency κr which are typically removed from the body and deposited into the environment embryos start as pure reserve maturity and structure being almost zero explicit expressions will be derived in the appendix a the ages ab and ap and the other i states values except the two values for e h b and e h p at the stage transitions generally depend on the feeding history the next subsections specify the processes quantitatively in a time length energy frame but they can readily be reformulated in a time length dry mass frame see kooijman 2010c table 8 1 2 1 energy fluxes fig 1 shows the diagram of the energy fluxes in the standard deb model using the standard deb notation kooijman 2010b these powers are 1a p x p a κ x 1b p a f p a m v 2 3 if e h e h b else p a 0 1c p c e e g p a m e m v 2 3 p s κ e e g v

assumption reserve density e settles to a constant value during growth after birth in constant environments energy conductance v controls the mobilization flux p c their ratio p a m v e m represents the maximum reserve density after birth a fraction κ of the reserves is allocated to somatic processes the rest to maturation and reproduction the thresholds where the individuals change stage are expressed in the i state maturity at birth e h b and at puberty e h p in appendix b we discuss a special situation where these energy thresholds can equally be expressed in volume namely vb and vp and where size is the main i state and maturity is not calculated explicitly 2 2 structure reserve density maturity reproduction buffer the changes in structure v growth reserve density e maturity eh

efficiency κr meaning that fraction 1 κ r becomes lost the buffer handling rules are species specific reproduction is often taken as a continuous function of time as in kooijman et al 2020 which is an approximation for the rule that the buffer is emptied as soon as it is enough to produce one egg we assume that reproduction is only at the end of the projection interval so typically once per year during prolonged starvation shrinking and rejuvenation can occur with consequences for survival we refer to the comments kooijman 2010a section shrinking during starvation and rejuvenation during starvation for a detailed discussion we assume that shrinking does not occur in our case study and this was checked for all results presented 2 3 aging acceleration and hazard generally aging is neglected in population dynamic studies because the loss rate due to trophic interaction is taken to be dominant except for top predators the significance of aging is however to set a ceiling for the memory of the population and be sure that no individual survives older than some maximum age a max the aging module of deb theory kooijman 2010c van leeuwen et al 2002 is based on the idea that respiration generates ros reactive oxygen species that induces damage inducing compounds think e g of affected mitochondrial dna which generate damage compounds think e g of modified proteins the damage compounds accumulate and the hazard rate that is linked to aging is taken proportional to the density of damage compounds damage inducing compounds can produce more damage inducing compounds the latter rate is typically low in ectotherms but can be higher in endotherms birds mammals with the effect that the survival probability due to aging remains high for a long period relative to the life span but then suddenly collapses this module has 2 parameters and it turns out that two popular empirical models by weibull 1951 and gompertz 1825 are special cases of the deb aging module they also have 2 parameters each but lack a coupling to assimilation the reason is they where mostly applied to endoterms which are on the demand end of the supply demand spectrum lika et al 2014 and therefore sport a very limited range in mean food intake the deb aging model kooijman 2010c eq 6 2 states that given the specific growth rate r d d a ln v in eq 4a scaled reserve density e e e m and maximum structural volume v m κ p a m p m 3 the aging acceleration q a and aging hazard rate h a a change as 7 d q d a q v v m s g h a e v v 1 3 r r q d h a d a q r h a aging acceleration h a and gompertz stress coefficient sg are constant parameters apart from effects of temperature both q and h a should be seen as state variables that need to be integrated together with the other state variables since they depend on them the expression for the aging hazard rate h a is used in defining the survival probability s a by 8 d s d a h a s where s 0 1 in a population setting with interactions with the environment aging is just one possible cause of death and probably not the most important one but these causes are taken into account in for the change of the number n of individuals for each generation i see eq 9 below are taken to be independent so the corresponding hazards can be added 2 4 initial conditions in deb kooijman 2010c the initial conditions for the freshly laid fertilised eggs are q 0 0 h a 0 0 v 0 0 e 0 e 0 and e h 0 0 is such that e e v at birth equals that of the mother at egg formation maturation at birth equals h a b e h b which is a parameter the maternal effect starving mothers allocate less to reproduction but lay somewhat smaller eggs which partly compensates the effect of starving on reproduction this is however very inconvenient for our present cpms where we want to collect all eggs produced by all generations in a single new cohort we therefore assume that e 0 is always the value at abundant food explicit expressions for the initial conditions of the other i states are derived in appendix a where it is avoided that v 0 0 because the reserve density e is not well defined at age zero when v 0 0 generally all time dependent parameters depend on temperature so if temperature is a function of time they too become time dependent ratios of rates do not depend on time and are taken to be independent of temperature in the basic formulation this completes the formulation of the individual model the next section considers the population level where we follow cohorts in time 3 population model we assume homogeneous space and that growth and behaviour of all individuals are described by the same model and have the same parameter values but possibly different i states the implication for the deterministic model is that if two individuals have the same i state at fertilisation they remain identical lifelong we follow thereby cohorts of identical individual produced at the same time the population consists of a zero generation of the cohort generated last the cohort generated second last and so on backward in time hence a finite number of coexisting generations of adjacent cohorts denoted by n that equals the maximum age as multiple of the projection interval t 0 a max n t 0 we will distinguish age a and time t and we introduce the auxiliary time variable within the projection interval denoted by τ 0 t 0 for the sake of simplicity we assume time t 0 at the reproduction event for the population where a new cohort is created the age a of the individuals in that cohort equals zero a 0 hence at time τ t the age of these individuals is a τ in general at time t there will be n coexisting generations of adjacent cohorts indexed by i with ages τ τ i t 0 τ n t 0 the cohort of the n the generation dies at maximum age nt 0 directly after the last reproduction we follow the female sub population only meaning that all individuals produce eggs and we assume a 1 1 sex ratio on the assumption that male and female eggs are equally costly we require for equilibrium that κr is halved the temperature t t and sometimes also food concentration x t are treated as given but assumed to have the same periodicity as the reproduction process in the food population case food x t is described by the solution of an ode we use the lagrangian description in which individuals are tracked metz and diekmann 1986 p 111 it gives a direct connection with the i state survival probability s this allows us to follow a cohort as the group of individuals that start at the same time with the same i states v e h q h s of which the dynamics is described in eqs 4a 4b 5 7 8 at the population level we will describe its dynamics by introduction of the number of individuals that form the cohorts although the number of individuals in a cohort for every generation jumps at reproduction events their numbers of individuals change within the projection interval for each generation in a continuous way on time and for ni t we have 9 d n i d t h n i i 0 n where the loss rate h is the sum of all cause specific loss rates including the i state aging hazard rate h a 8 using the relationship between age and time but also p state losses due to interaction with the environment such as by thinning see kooijman et al 2020 back ground mortality predation or emigration to have a notation to describe the dynamics of the population in discrete time with projection interval of t 0 days we introduce a super index j mod t t 0 j 0 called the projection index that is the time at fertilisation hence at time just after a population reproduction event we write for the number of individuals n i j where the sub index i 1 n indicates the ith generation at that event a new cohort zero generation i 0 is created that consists of the freshly produced eggs of all reproducing generations whereby generation i n dies and is removed from the population in order to reformulate the problem in terms of the classical non linear dynamical system theory for maps we define the vector of state variables as follows 10 y v 0 e 0 h 0 s 0 v i e i h i s i v n e n h n s n n 0 n i n n x t where h e h e r the energy allocated to maturity and reproduction and environmental variables food consentration x t is appended to the list note that the generation i 0 will start at a small but positive age a 0 so v 0 v a 0 e 0 e 0 v a 0 and h 0 h a 0 discussed in appendix a the projection map φ is denoted by 11 y j 1 φ y j where j n is the index of the map indicating the discrete times where fertilisation occurs 12 the integrand terms are the right hand sides of the deb equations eqs 4a 4b 5 7 8 the tilde means evaluate just before reproduction events that is at the end of the projection interval to calculate the solution for the whole projection interval we solve this set of coupled odes eqs 4a 4b 5 7 8 for all the generations i 0 n in the deb model formulation the number of variables is 9 n 1 that is n 40 times the number of the variables vi e i hi ni s i q i and h a i and finally one environmental variable x in the calculation of the total hazard rate those of the i state si and the p state ni are added for stability analysis reasons it is important to distinguish between si and ni for the initial condition s 0 j 1 is fixed while n 0 j is a free variable it is also needed to distinguish between loss of dead individuals with detritus production in the environment and loss of living individuals terms in mass balances of the population and the environment for instance chemostat since all adult individuals reproduce at the end of the projection interval it is advantageous to introduce generations were members of a cohort move to the next one at the reproduction event a new cohort is formed at fertilisation events in generation i 0 when they have reached their maximum age at i n each cohort dies after their last reproduction event at age a max n t 0 we have furthermore the following relationships for the reproduction terms at the moment of fertilisation at the end of the projection interval 13 a population equilibrium is then given by the fixed point of the projection map and is given when the following cyclic boundary condition y j 1 y j holds we continue with a discussion of the well known euler lotka equation for the discrete time projection map φ eq 11 given in eq 12 and 13 for one time interval t 0 j j 1 14 1 κ r e 0 k 0 n n k j max 0 h k j e h p were we assume constant food x and h h a that is there is only an aging hazard rate eq 8 the expression on the right hand side of eq 14 is the number of eggs produced by the population all generations i 0 n at an reproduction event n 0 j 1 which is equal to 1 because there is equilibrium we have also n 0 j 1 there is also another interpretation of this relationship where the individual level point of view is stressed for the time interval j 0 n namely that each mother n 0 j 1 see also eq 8 should in equilibrium produce a single female offspring during her life nt 0 j j n where n 0 j 1 1 this gives 15 1 κ r e 0 l 0 n n l j l max 0 h l j l e h p equal to the expression in the right hand side of eq 14 in the result section these two interpretations are compared by numerical simulation 3 1 food dynamics the dynamics of the population is studied under constant food conditions and in a semi chemostat environment constant food is studied by taking a constant functional response value denoted as f f 0 where we assume that the food concentration allows the existence of the population in equilibrium then we study the population in equilibrium for one lifetime t 0 n t 0 the equilibrium x is given by x f k x 1 0 f 0 we assume only loss of individuals due to againg part of the deb theory the loss rate in eq 9 is given by h h a and for each generation i we have d n i d t t τ i t 0 d s d a a τ i t 0 i 1 n in a semi chemostat environment the in flowing food concentration xin is either constant or periodical annual 16 d x d t d x i n t x p x m f x t i 1 n v i 2 3 n i the second term is the feeding rate of the female population we recall that we only follow the female sub population so this is only food consumed by the females and not by the male which consume the same amount the function f x t is the scaled holling type ii functional response eq 2 generally in a chemostat reactor the individuals of the population leave the chemostat similar to the out flow of the food this can be included by a constant additional loss term d in 9 however here in a semi chemostat the individuals of the populations do not leave the reactor in the deb theory there is still a loss due to aging in this case in eq 9 the loss rate is given by h h a similar to the constant food case above 4 a case study torpedo marmorata in this section we discuss the calculated results for the marbled electric ray torpedo marmorata the amp entry for this species uses experimental data from consalvo et al 2007 fig 3b where samples were obtained from catches of bottom trawler at the trawl fishing grounds of fiumicino landing harbour italy in 2000 2001 the bi monthly evolution of maturation stages in adult females shows that early pregnant specimens were found the greatest amount in january consalvo et al 2007 fig 6 this justifies more or less our assumption that reproduction occurs in a small time window at the end of a projection interval the parameters from the amp collection anonymous 2019a are given in table 1 in the first step we calculate the life cycle dynamics of an individual during its three life stages embryo juvenile and adults in a constant food environment where f 0 8 this is the value used in amptool anonymous 2019a in the second step the development in all generations are calculated sequentially for one cohort where n 0 0 1 see also the euler lotka equation eq 15 reproduction is at the end of the projection interval here a date of the year the number of produced eggs is evaluated cumulatively changing the scaled functional response f gives the neutral equilibrium of the population f f 0 where in its lifetime of n 40 years with t 0 365 d one female egg and on male egg is produced by the individual the corresponding state vector eq 10 is called y 0 in the third step one population cohort is followed during the lifetime again under constant food conditions where n 0 0 1 see also the euler lotka equation eq 14 the population is separated into generations consisting of equal individuals these generations are followed now simultaneously the number of generations equals the age at which the individual delivers its last eggs and thereafter dies hence the time interval considered is nt 0 the value for the scaled functional response is f 0 that fixes the constant food level x such that the population is in equilibrium where the state vector eq 10 is as in the previous step y 0 now calculated using eq 11 the final step gives the transient dynamics of the population feeding on unstructured food in a semi chemostat the initial conditions for the state of the population is the vector y 0 and it deserves special attention both i state and p state variables are needed for individuals of all n generations each belonging to the adjacent n cohorts formed in the past backward in time within the time interval of the maximum age at times it 0 where i 0 n for long term dynamics there are no additional problems however for transient dynamics experimental data have to be available for this whole individual life time interval a max n t 0 4 1 amptool results individual model the results from amptool anonymous 2019a for the weight length fit of torpedo marmorata are shown in fig 2 with f 0 8 the dots in the figure form the uni variate data points on which together with zero variate data from the literature the fit is based the parameter values taken from the amp collection anonymous 2019a are given in table 1 in fig 3 curves are calculated by integrating the set of individual state equations eqs 4a 4b 5 7 8 with initial conditions for the three individuals state v e and h at ab eq 23 e a 0 e 0 28 with q a 0 0 h a a 0 0 in the left panel we used f 0 8 as in fig 2 the results in both figures show that they are in the experimental length interval almost the same while the initial conditions after fertilization were take different see the appendix a in all figures presenting results for the i states the life stages are indicated by colors embryo red juvenile blue and adult black in the right panel the calculated growth curve for the life cycle stages are shown for f f 0 the calculated value of the scaled functional response f 0 0 2793 that fixes the food level in a constant environment where the population is in a neutral equilibrium state given by x f 0 k x 1 0 f 0 32 18 fig 4 shows the simulation results for the i state variables the structural volume v a energy reserve e a maturity eh a and the reproduction buffer er a the aging survival probability s a is plotted as function of the age a in fig 5 which is important at the population level the cumulative survival probability c s a a 0 t 0 s a d a is also shown the mean life span equals lim a cs a 4 2 results at population level with constant food at the individual level as discussed in the previous section the results for the one cohort dynamics shown in fig 4c d for eh a and er a can be calculated directly by solving the odes for these two variables eqs 4c 4d formulated at the individual level as part of system eq 4 at the population level we solve however first the system eqs 4a 4b 5 7 8 i 0 n with h a e h a e r a so for the elements of vector y thereafter the results for eh a and er a separately are obtained from eq 6 fig 6 shows the n generations with the dynamics of the i state variables volume v a energy reserves e a and energy allocated to maturity h a within n projection intervals the constant food level equals that in the previous section with scaled functional response f f 0 0 2793 in fig 7 we show the results for the two energy i state variables maturity e h a τ k t 0 and the reproduction buffer e r a τ k t 0 calculated from h a shown in fig 6c using eq 6 the results in this figure shows that the dynamics is non smooth at puberty where h e h e h p while in fig 6c the solution is smooth within the projection interval the discontinuity of the projection map φ y is exclusively located at the reproduction event as described in eq 13 and the euler lotka equation eq 14 compression of these results with those obtained in the previous section shows that the solutions for the individual level in fig 4 are precisely the concatenation of the n generation cohort solutions in figs 6 and 7 at the population level we can now make a connection between this cohort dynamics taken as a function of time t 0 not only in the time interval 0 t nt 0 and the age of the individuals that make up the cohorts the time within the projection cycle is denoted by τ 0 t 0 day the super index j n denotes the time in years and the sub index i 1 n indicates the ith generation which are in the time intervals t j t 0 j n t 0 the age a of an individual in the ith generation equals a τ i t 0 in the next section the population interacts with a time dependent food in a semi chemostat reactor being a two trophic food population system the initial values for the state vector y 0 will be those for τ 0 in fig 6 4 3 results for food population dynamics in a semi chemostat to follow all generations of individuals in time in a semi chemostat reactor we have to specify their initial conditions just after the fertilisation date we used the equilibrium state values in a constant food environment from the previous section we recall that in the projection map formulation only the values of the i state and p state variables at the discrete monitoring date are needed those in the vector y eq 10 from this initial situation y 0 the calculations are performed successively over the projection intervals which can be continued after the founder population died that is t t 0 n fig 8 gives the discrete dynamics of the i state variables within the projection period this is essentially the dynamics of the projection map the initial conditions are those for the steady state i states of the single population system shown in the previous section at j 0 the value just after fertilisation is plotted and for j 0 those just before fertilisation the results show rapid convergence to a stable fixed point the results for the food population system are now presented by showing the amount of food and structural volume of the population not only the discrete time projection values here at monitoring date of the year but also the continuous time changes within the projection interval can be calculated and are shown in fig 9 fig 10 shows the continuous time results for the population structural volume for the first 10 years 17 y τ k 0 n v k τ k t 0 n k τ k t 0 τ 0 t 0 5 discussion we developed a post processor for the amp collection anonymous 2019b marques et al 2018 with parameter values of over 2000 animal species which can now be used for the numerical analysis of a population in this paper the case study was for a species with the restriction of synchronisation of their seasonal reproduction the first step in this process is to reconstruct the full life cycle of an individual energetics from the anonymous 2019a parameter values the data on which the parameter estimates are based typically does not cover the full cycle but given the deb models this is also not required and the goodness of fit with empirical data is very good the standard deb model is the basic one of 10 related deb models that are used in the amp collection these models are simple extensions to include fetal development metabolic acceleration extra life stages and so on semelparous species such as the cephalopods represent just another variation for which the cpms would work out very simply most semelparous species accelerate and are annuals i e living just a year so don t follow the standard aging module programmed death they therefore deviate in more than one respect from the standard deb model a complete analysis of the food population system and other ecosystem models is beyond the scope of this paper in these analyses the advantage to be able to analyse the finite dimensional discrete time population model can be used to perform the calculation of the equilibria and their stability as well as bifurcation analysis where dependence on parameter values is studied in kooi and van der meer 2010 this was done to calculated transcritical bifurcation curves in the so called pairwise and mutual invasibility plots in the adaptive dynamics approach for evolutionary development of populations geritz et al 1998 the cpm approach is the same as the one proposed in persson et al 1998 de roos and persson 2001 which has been used in a number of papers see chaparro pedraza and de roos 2019 and references therein the individual models in the first two papers is size structured and in the last it is related to a deb model the numerical integration is carried out using the ebt escalator boxcar train de roos 1988 originally designed for the simulation of physiologically structured populations but adapted to analyse populations where reproduction is pulse wise here we use cpm that is introduced as an alternative for the discrete time mpm and ipm approaches to restrict the problem to finite dimensional systems we assume that the population has an iteroparous reproductive strategy the numerical implementation can be done using standard matrix operations and numerical ode solvers with event handling for the calculation of birth e h b and puberty e h p time points therefore it is important that the system is smooth at these transition points especially at puberty e h p and this was the motivation to introduce the single i state variable h e h e r for h a the transition is smooth see fig 6c while for eh a and er a the rate of change in time is discontinuous see fig 7 in klanjscek et al 2006 the elements of the discrete time two by two projection matrix of the mpm approach are formulated for the two stages consisting of immature and mature individuals a constant or seasonally variable environment and birth pulse population with births occurring at the end of the projection interval similar to conditions studied here when all vital rates are constant the asymptotic growth rate of the population is given by the dominant eigenvalue of the projection matrix which is obtained by an iterative process the stable stage distribution is the eigenvector of the discrete time matrix these properties can be used to obtain sensitivities of the growth rate a very similar approach was applied in klok et al 2007 were the formulation of the matrix elements was also based on the deb theory in the ipm approach a discrete time equation from t to t 1 is an integral where the integrand is a kernel times the number density with respect to the length over the possible domain of lengths this reflects the formalism of size structured pde equations the kernel is a combination of the survival growth and reproduction functions the kernel maps the length distribution from t to t 1 the original ipm is data driven where parts of the kernels are estimated using phenomenological regression models see merow et al 2014 and generally stochasticity is taken into account in smallegange et al 2017 the ipm is used where the individual life history trajectories are described by a simplified deb model from kooijman and metz 1984 in the cpm approach the integral is over the projection intervals for all generations of adjacent cohorts reflecting an age structured formalism where individuals are followed in time described by the i state odes and one for the number of individuals being the p state of all generations forming the population where kooijman et al 2020 deals with constant environments here we first allowed cyclically changing environments and still treat temperature and food concentration as forcing variables first in equilibrium with constant food and thereafter we included feed backs from the environment in a food population system this can also be a generalized reactor with food supply to and from the reactor and where individuals do compete for food subsequent steps allow for living food and predators sporting growth and reproduction although such steps into the direction of a food chain or even an ecosystem are highly relevant the problem is that this can be done in a very large number of ways and depends strongly on the natural site under investigation in diekmann and metz 2010 a dde formulation for size structured population as a pspm and an unstructured resource is described and the existence and stability boundaries are analysed furthermore extensions and applications to the deb model are considered and it is concluded that it fits the general dde framework they mentioned however specifics of the deb model that hampers direct application but that these specifics do not give fundamental problems it is interesting to note that the removal of the variable er was one of them this is done here by the introduction of the single variable h a e h a e r a the underlying motivation in this paper is to get a smooth individual dynamics within the projection interval to avoid numerical analysis difficulties and to be able to calculated an equilibrium rigorously in the case study no special event handling techniques were needed for the numerical ode solver at the stage transition points birth and puberty however this issue will be more important with a stability analysis of the equilibrium while the partial derivatives with respect to the state variables being the elements of the jacobian matrix have to be obtained numerically the restrictions to be able to apply the mpm approach are more restrictive that those required in cpm because further simplifying assumption have to be made for calculation of the matrix elements as a result the obtained results are less reliable especially related to the calculation of the matrix elements as weighted averages of the stable age distribution than those obtained with the cpm approach in conclusion the cpm approach is better suited in all aspects application of the ipm approach is less restrictive than cpm for instance asynchronous reproduction is allowed an advantage is the integrated parametrisation of the population level parameters e g control parameters of the reactor by application of regression analysis of population experiments data the ipm is an alternative for the pspm approach where system level experimental data are used for population and environmental parameter estimation with ibm abm

acknowledgements we thank one anonymous reviewer and andré the roos for valuable suggestions and comments on the manuscript appendix a conditions at fertilisation in this appendix we formulate and analyse the individual embryo initial conditions for the set of three odes for a short period after fertilisation where 0 a ab when the development of the embryo in the egg or foetes takes place we recall that deb explicitly accounts for the embryo stage causing a delay effect since during the embryo stage there is no interaction with the environment except temperature and further that the initial i state conditions at fertilisation not at birth are deb specific although this might be less important for population dynamics in some species in the ray that we use as illustration the embryo period lasts almost a full year we use the fixed energy amount of one egg e 0 as initial condition for the reserve energy e 0 however we avoid to use v 0 h 0 0 the amount of reserve energy e 0 is used for growth of the structure accumulation of maturity and paying maintenance because there is no interaction with the environment during the embryonic stage furthermore the conditions are not formulated at a 0 but at 0 a 0 ab this value a 0 is species specific and has to be fixed by trail and error it is a mathematical analysis parameter and not biologically motivated parameter empirical parameter values for a small a 0 can preferably be used if available the reserve energy density e becomes infinite when v 0 0 for lim a 0 v a 0 we get lim a 0 e a while e 0 e 0 is finite this shows that is it better to formulate using a regular perturbation technique the initial conditions v a 0 and eh a 0 for a 0 small using the dynamics of the reserve energy e a in the interval 0 a a 0 combining eq 4a written as 18 d v d a κ p a m e m e v 2 3 k m e g v κ e e g and eq 4b with f t 0 for the embryo stage written as 19 d e d a p a m e e m v 1 3 we get for the energy reserves e a 20 d e

volume the following special case where the and maturity reproduction and growth rates are proportional deh da dv da within the embryo and juvenile stages is studied we start with eqs 4b 4a and 5 for the variable v a e a and eh a we assume the following relationship between the two parameter k j and k m which is inspired by the work of thieme 1988 and also mentioned in kooijman 2000 page 112 29 κ

have 33 d e h a d a 0 that is the maturity density is constant eq 31 is the expression we suggested in appendix a where the partitioning relationship was valid in the small age interval 0 a 0 but here for the whole life cycle in order to get more insight in the consequences of this assumption we consider now the flow of the powers given in fig 11 which is a modified fig 1 the mobilised energy for the reserves into the growth branch and the maturity branch gives directly using eq 29 34 p j 1 κ κ p s in this case the mobilised energy is located to the various processes as follows p c κ p c 1 κ p c p g p s p r p j p s κ p c p g and p j 1 κ p c p r κ 1 κ p c p r 1 κ κ p c p g p c p r 1 κ p c p g κ finally we get 35 p r 1 κ κ p g the partition into the two main branches of the mobilised energy from the reserve p c into κ p c and 1 κ p c shown in fig 11 is given by eqns 34 and 35 the partitioning is the same for both that is the partition to maturition follows is the same partitioning as in the structure branch see fig 11 until now only the immature life stages were considered for the mature adult stage we refer to the description of the model in the main text eq 5 where we assume that k j and k m are related via eq 29 at puberty 36 κ k j e h p 1 κ k m e g v p where the initial condition eq 28 has to be replaced in this special case discussed in the appendix b by 37 e h a 0 1 κ κ e g p a m 3 e m a 0 3 k m k j in that case it is not required to calculate maturity explicitly because there is a simple relationship with the structural volume
