7370,in recent years climate change and other anthropogenic factors have contributed to increased wildfire frequency and size in western united states forests this research focuses on the evaluation of spatial and temporal changes in evapotranspiration et following the 2011 las conchas fire in new mexico usa using the operational simplified surface energy balance model ssebop et evapotranspiration is coupled with soil burn severity and analyzed for 16 watersheds for water years 2001 2014 an average annual decrease of 120 mm of et is observed within the regions affected by the las conchas fire and conifers were converted to grassland a year after the fire on average the post fire annual et in high moderate and low burn severity is lower than pre fire et by approximately 103 352 mm 97 304 mm and 91 268 mm respectively the ratio of post fire evapotranspiration to precipitation et p is statistically different from pre fire conditions α 0 05 in nine of the watersheds the largest decrease in et is approximately 13 57 mm per month and is most prominent during the summer april to september the observed decrease in et contributes to our understanding of changes in water yield following wildfires which is of interest for accurately modeling and predicting hydrologic processes in semi arid landscapes keywords evapotranspiration wildfire remote sensing disturbance hydrology 1 introduction forests cover approximately 42 million km2 or 30 of the land surface in tropical temperate and boreal lands bonan 2008 and are critical regulators in the terrestrial water balance through evapotranspiration et evapotranspiration is an energy water flux that redistributes water from the soil and plant surfaces evaporation and vegetation transpiration into the atmosphere allen et al 2005 and is sensitive to vegetation characteristics and climate in temperate eucalypt forests and semiarid forests annual et accounts for 70 80 and 85 100 of precipitation respectively vertessy et al 2001 yaseef et al 2010 mitchell et al 2012 while in loblolly pine pinus taeda plantations in the southeastern u s and ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa approximately 70 sun et al 2002 and 85 respectively of annual precipitation contributes to et montes helu et al 2009 evapotranspiration influences climate through energy and water exchange making forests essential for ecological and watershed services such as flood control water quality and carbon and nitrogen storage disturbances in forests such as wildfires floods landslides and clearcutting can promote healthy tree density herbaceous and shrub production water availability and runoff nutrient availability soil characteristics and wildlife habitat covington and moore 1994 however global climate changes largely due to anthropogenic activities have led to variations in temperature and precipitation regimes altering natural wildfire patterns drought and other forest disturbances dale et al 2001 in the western u s climate change contributes to longer dry summer seasons and drier vegetation and extended wildfire durations and seasons which subsequently leads to more frequent and intense wildfires dale et al 2001 westerling et al 2006 invasive species can also impact ecosystem processes and change vegetation composition which impacts fuel properties and fire regimes such as intensity frequency and seasonality of wildfires brooks et al 2004 following wildfires lower et is expected from the loss of foliar volumes and transpiration processes also the replacement of deep rooted high profile trees by low profile grasses may contribute to lower et neary et al 2005 the reduced et means less precipitation is converted into vapor and thus more water generally is available for streamflow given the large role of et in the water budget a disturbance can shift the partitioning between dominant water fluxes such as infiltration and surface runoff thus accurate estimates of et are necessary for climate studies ecosystem modeling and agriculture and hydrologic applications especially in regions experiencing acute or chronic changes in land cover post fire watershed processes in various ecosystems have been documented including altered sediment yield keller et al 1997 lane et al 2006 soil moisture ebel 2013 peak streamflow veenhuis 2000 base flow kinoshita and hogue 2011 snow accumulation and melt patterns neary et al 2005 micheletty et al 2014 and surface water yield kinoshita and hogue 2015 bart 2016 noted a 134 increase of streamflow during the first year after fire in 12 watersheds in southern california similarly kinoshita and hogue 2015 observed an increase in low streamflow volume 118 1090 following the 2003 old fire in southern california the enhanced baseflow in the chaparral dominated watersheds was attributed to the reduction of basin wide transpiration rates due to the loss of vegetation kinoshita and hogue 2011 2015 in new mexico wine and cadol 2016 observed various post fire streamflow responses in three semi arid watersheds that were impacted by monsoon storms from 1982 to 2014 the runoff in the gila watershed 92 burned was 12 16 times greater than unburned watersheds for 3 5 post fire years wine and cadol 2016 the reduced transpiration and increased infiltration excess overland flow following monsoon storms contributed to increased streamflow some watersheds did not show an increased post fire water yield which was attributed to the inaccuracy of runoff measurements increased transpiration by remaining plants and increased evaporation as a result of reduced tree canopy wine and cadol 2016 similarly feikema et al 2013 did not observe an increase of initial post fire streamflow due to reduced canopy cover which highlights the importance of antecedent soil moisture conditions during a drought low rainfall can result in soil water deficits for example when soil moisture deficits are very large or very small feikema et al 2013 bart 2016 surface runoff may not be impacted by changes in evapotranspiration benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 noted that low runoff may be due to high antecedent soil moisture or dry soils with a higher capacity for infiltration even in high burn severity regions based on the limited literature wine and cadol 2016 noted the importance of continuing research on the impacts of wildfire on evapotranspiration to further understand post fire hydrologic and vegetation processes and improve the prediction of streamflow responses there is limited research focused on post wildfire et post fire et studies by montes helu et al 2009 and dore et al 2010 observed co2 and et using eddy covariance data applicable for an area of 176 3 m burned and 271 4 m unburned during 2006 in arizona after a severe fire in 1996 after the fire the ponderosa pine became primarily grassland and shrub with 40 vegetation coverage 50 bare soil and 10 logs and snags montes helu et al 2009 dore et al 2010 noted that post fire et was lower for 10 11 years after the fire by 76 116 mm per year another field based study in a mixed eucalypt forest located in the state of victoria australia observed that et in high and moderately burned forest are 41 and 3 lower respectively over the first two post fire years nolan et al 2014 utilizing remote sensing techniques sánchez et al 2015 applied a two source energy balance approach on two sets 6 7 years and 11 years after the fire of satellite based scenes a total of 15 landsat 5 thematic mapper and enhanced thematic mapper plus images to estimate latent heat flux heat associated with surface evaporation after a wildfire in spain sánchez et al 2015 noted a decrease of approximately 1 mm per day of et in unburned pine forest 6 7 years after fire this decrease was attributed to altered vegetation structure land surface temperature and albedo sánchez et al 2015 dore et al 2010 and nolan et al 2014 provided important insight into point scale evaporative processes after wildfire while sánchez et al 2015 provided a higher spatial resolution study with limited temporal resolution this research builds upon previous studies by incorporating remote sensing products to quantify post fire evapotranspiration at higher temporal and spatial scales evapotranspiration before and after the 2011 las conchas fire in new mexico united states was investigated utilizing the operational simplified surface energy balance model ssebop pre and post fire et patterns were compared with spatially distributed precipitation and soil burn severity for water years wy 2001 to 2014 october 1 2000 to september 31 2014 this research addresses the following questions which also provides the structural sub headings used in the following methods results and discussions sections i how well does ssebop et represent pre and post fire processes ii how does annual and seasonal et change after wildfire iii how does pre and post fire et vary spatially and temporally with respect to soil burn severity 2 data and study site 2 1 spatial actual evapotranspiration model single source energy balance models such as the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 require manually selected hot and cold reference pixels to compare climatic conditions for one satellite image the simplified surface energy balance index sseb i and operational simplified surface energy balance model ssebop senay et al 2013 omit the calculation of sensible heat flux to reduce the complexity of determining actual et ssebop also assumes that each pixel has pre defined hot and cold reference values given that reference points are stationary or the differences are small in relation to the accuracy level obtained through varying boundary conditions senay et al 2013 this approach requires a pre defined satellite derived temperature difference dt which is based on net radiation air resistance normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and air temperature 2 4 senay et al 2013 the et fraction etf is calculated from hot

this preliminary product is validated and adjusted through field measurements of ground cover ash color and depth soil structure condition of roots pre fire vegetation and water repellency for each sbs class generally almost all pre fire ground cover large trees and surface organic matter are consumed in high sbs regions leaving several centimeters in depth of white or grey ash moderate sbs indicates that up to 80 of the pre fire ground cover is consumed scorched needles and leaves may remain in the canopy that will fall to the ground low sbs regions have surface organic layers that are not completely consumed the canopy and understory vegetation are likely green and roots are generally similar to unburned conditions validated soil burn severity maps are available from the remote

the 2012 and 2014 maps were used for the thompson ridge fire 2 6 study area in june 2011 the las conchas fire burned 634 km2 in the santa fe national forest and portions of the valles caldera national preserve in the counties of sandoval los alamo and rio arriba new mexico fig 1 it was the second largest wildfire in new mexico and impacted 16 subwatersheds the valles caldera is characterized as semi arid with seasonally snow covered forest where the main source of runoff is from snowmelt and spring rainfall liu et al 2008 the elevation of the burned region ranged from 1570 to 3528 m based on the soil burn severity sbs classification the las conchas fire was classified as 30 low 35 moderate 21 high and 14 unchanged fig 1 rsac 2011 unaffected percentages were areas within the watershed that

percentage of high sbs whereas outlet borrego canyon id 13 was minimally affected and used as a control watershed there were several significant wildfires during the study period that may potentially influence this study and were considered during watershed selection and analysis fig 1 table 2 3 methods 3 1 ameriflux and ssebop et comparison 2013 thompson ridge fire the comparison was conducted from 2007 to 2014 between ground based et and ssebop et for the thompson ridge fire which included a total of 77 pre fire and 19 post fire months standard statistical metrics correlation r2 mean bias error mbe and root mean squared error rmse were used to evaluate the ssebop et product correlation r2 represented the degree of relationship between ssebop et and ameriflux ground based et the root mean squared error rmse was used to predict the accuracy between the ssebop et model and ground based et derived from ameriflux mean bias error mbe quantified the difference between ssebop and fluxnet et results were also compared with previous studies at the unburned forest and grassland regions done by senay et al 2013 velpuri et al 2013 and savoca et al 2013 3 2 annual and seasonal et 2011 las conchas fire ssebop monthly actual et was analyzed at 1 km resolution from wy 2001 2014 to match the resolution of ssebop et prism precipitation was disaggregated from 4 km to 1 km and was used as a proxy of available water and climate conditions before and after the fire annual precipitation and ssebop et for both pre and post fire were averaged within each watershed to minimize the influence of precipitation on et estimates a ratio of et to precipitation et p was calculated and statistically tested using a two tail t test α 0 05 to identify watersheds with variations in the means due to the

ameriflux and ssebop comparison 2013 thompson ridge fire to evaluate the performance of post fire ssebop et was compared with two ameriflux towers located in valles caldera which were burned by the thomas ridge fire may 2013 at the mixed conifer site ssebop had a pre fire correlation of 0 78 and rmse of 9 14 mm month and a post fire correlation of 0 56 and rmse of 26 48 mm month with ameriflux et fig 2 a the pre and post fire mbe were 22 58 and 13 3 mm month respectively indicating that ssebop overestimated before and after the thompson ridge fire at the ponderosa pine site pre and post fire correlations were 0 77 and 0 74 with rmse values of 18 19 and 25 46 mm month respectively fig 2b ssebop underestimated at this site where the pre fire mbe was 8 7 mm month and post fire mbe was 17 95 mm month fig 2b which was in contrast to the mixed conifer site 4 2 annual and seasonal et 2011 las conchas fire the pre and post fire precipitation and et were estimated for each watershed within the las conchas fire fig 3 supplementary figs 1 16 five watersheds id 3 id 4 id 8 id 15 and id 16 had an annual et that was greater than precipitation before the fire and the et decreased below the total precipitation after the fire two of the five watersheds had an annual post fire et that was greater than the post fire precipitation id 1 and id 16 post fire et decreased approximately 60 250 mm yr in all watersheds fig 3 the monthly et p for all watersheds ranged from 0 4 to 2 5 supplementary figs 1 16 and were sensitive to annual precipitation and the fire in wy 2002 the ratios of et p were consistently larger than the other water years for all watersheds following the las conchas fire 2011 2012 and 2013 had smaller et p ratios supplementary figs 1 16 the two tail t test of annual et p indicated that 9 of the 16 watersheds 15 affected and the control watershed were statistically different after fire at a 0 05 significance level table 3 outlet borrego canyon id 13 control watershed had a pre fire wy 2001 2011 average annual precipitation of 549 96 mm and annual et of 442 45 mm the annual post fire wy 2012 2014 precipitation was 482 29 mm and post fire et was 377 20 mm the relationship of et and p et p decreased by 0 03 between the pre and post fire periods table 3 in general et p following the wildfire was constant with a minimal increase of 0 02 from 2011 to 2014 fig 4 seasonally the et difference between pre and post fire was greatest during april to june by approximately 14 mm month fig 5 left column while october march had a minimal decrease of 3 mm month not shown in fig 5 rio chiquito id 9 high severity watershed had a mean annual precipitation before the las conchas fire of 612 120 mm and post fire precipitation of 552 45 mm the annual pre fire et average was 565 57 mm which substantially decreased after the fire to 395 11 mm a decline in et p of 0 21 for 2 years following the fire was caused by the increase of precipitation and decrease of et supplementary fig 9 fig 4 the difference of et p averages was 0 24 p value 0 026 indicating that the pre and post fire et p were statistically different seasonally there was a minimal decrease of et 4 mm month in the winter and spring a greater decrease of et during the summer seasons was noted for all burn severity types 30 mm month fig 5 within rio chiquito the highest annual relative difference of et burned versus unaffected areas was 51 6 in the low severity regions while there was only a relative change of 14 6 in the high burn severity areas table 4 headwaters san antonio creek id 16 mixed soil burn severities had a mean pre fire precipitation of 453 90 mm from wy 2001 2011 and a similar average post fire precipitation of 402 32 mm from wy 2012 2014 however the post fire annual et decreased by 200 mm for the whole watershed from 634 42 mm to 437 24 mm consequently et p was reduced by 0 51 1 4 to 0 9 immediately following the wildfire and was statistically different fig 4 table 3 similar to the other watersheds the highest difference in pre and post fire et was between april to june where a decrease of 24 44 49 and 57 mm month for unaffected low moderate and high severity areas was noted respectively fig 5 peralta canyon id 10 moderate and low burn severity watershed had a pre and post fire annual precipitation of 639 30 mm and 574 29 mm respectively there was a notable decrease of approximately 100 mm of annual et after the fire from 538 40 mm to 438 41 mm the trends of et and precipitation following the fire 2011 2014 were similar resulting in a constant et p that resembled the control watershed supplementary fig 10 fig 4 the change of mean annual et p before and after the fire was 0 09 and not significant at a 5 level table 3 seasonally et decreased during april to september for the whole watershed 20 mm month for unaffected 23 mm for moderate and 28 mm month for low burn severity areas fig 5 in rio del oso id 2 unaffected and mostly moderate severity watershed the average annual precipitation before and after the fire was 300 82 and 271 24 mm respectively the pre fire averaged annual et from unaffected areas was 349 35 mm and the post fire annual et was 296 31 mm similar to headwaters san antonio creek watershed the annual et p significantly declined immediately after the fire from 1 3 to 0 8 supplementary fig 2 fig 4 the moderately burned area pre fire annual et was 328 41 mm and the mean post fire annual et was 230 36 mm similar to the control watershed the largest decrease in et occurred between april to june with 13 mm month for moderate and 7 mm month for unaffected areas during the summer seasons there was a large decrease of 21 7 in et in moderate areas and 13 0 in unaffected areas within rio del oso fig 5 4 3 spatial evapotranspiration 2011 las conchas fire within each watershed the regions unaffected by the fire were compared to each sbs level to observe the change in post fire et after the las conchas fire lower annual post fire et in high soil burn severities were observed compared to the unaffected rio chiquito low headwaters san antonio creek and moderate rio del oso severities these watersheds contained the most high and moderate sbs areas and the largest declines in et table 4 while peralta canyon had larger post fire et in high and moderate burned areas compared to low burn severity areas table 4 rio del oso showed the smallest difference in annual et for all sbs areas table 4 it had a difference of 102 mm between pre and post fire annual et in the high sbs 98 mm in the moderate sbs 91 mm in the low sbs and 65 mm in the unaffected areas post fire et was 20 lower in high sbs 17 lower in moderate sbs 11 lower in low sbs when compared to unaffected areas table 4 similarly headwaters san antonio creek generally decreased in which the average post fire annual et was 24 lower in high sbs and 15 lower in moderate sbs annual et in rio chiquito had the largest percentage differences across various sbs high moderate and low sbs areas had lower et than the unaffected regions by 36 34 and 29 contrary to the above watersheds peralta canyon post et difference was greatest in low sbs regions 22 and smallest in high sbs areas 19 high sbs areas had a greater post fire average annual et 405 mm than low burn severity 390 mm table 4 the ratio δ between the et difference of sbs regions and unaffected regions 10 showed the magnitude of decrease of each watershed rio del oso and headwaters san antonio creek were similar where et had a larger magnitude of decrease with increasing sbs table 4 the δ s for rio del oso ranged from 1 4 to 1 57 whereas δ s for headwaters san antonio creek ranged from 1 97 to 2 57 the highest δ values amongst all watersheds although rio chiquito had the greatest ratio difference of et within the watershed the low sbs had an unexpectedly higher decline of et 602 to 375 mm than the other sbs levels further the δ s from peralta canyon showed mixed results the magnitude of decrease was lowest in moderate sbs areas 1 02 and highest in high sbs areas 1 37 the percentage difference 11 between the pre and post fire et et estimates was noted with respect to the vegetation within a sbs region fig 6 in the burned regions of the four fire affected watersheds all major vegetation types conifer hardwood and shrubland decreased except grassland the amount of vegetation decreased from 3 8 to 62 7 in conifer 0 2 to 24 4 in hardwood and 0 1 to 3 7 in shrubland the increase in grassland across all burn severities was approximately 4 5 to 69 1 the sum of the decrease in conifer and hardwood closely represented the increase of grassland within all affected regions however there was no direct relation between the percentage change in et and amount of vegetation converted to grassland fig 6 the et ranged from 22 6 to 51 2 high 20 4 to 39 9 moderate and 18 3 to 44 8 low across the watersheds at unburned regions of the fire affected watersheds minimal changes across vegetation types and a slight decrease in et 14 7 to 23 6 were observed fig 6 at outlet borrego canyon the control watershed the amount of conifer decreased by 27 5 3 7 and 0 7 at moderate low and unburned regions respectively similar to other watersheds the amount of grassland increased by 27 5 3 9 and 0 7 in moderate low and unburned areas respectively the et decreased minimally and ranged from 5 6 to 12 8 within the watershed 5 discussion 5 1 ameriflux and ssebop comparison 2013 thompson ridge fire ssebop et was evaluated under post fire conditions within the thompson ridge fire in general ssebop performed well compared to the ameriflux towers where the pre and post fire correlations ranged from r2 0 56 0 78 and the rmse ranged from 9 to 26 mm month fig 2 generally the post fire values of ssebop and ameriflux fall within the range of the pre fire values however there were less data points from the post fire period 19 months which contributes to uncertainty in the correlation in the mixed conifer site ssebop tended to overestimate et by 13 to 22 mm month fig 2a while the ponderosa pine site underestimated by 8 7 to 18 mm month fig 2b these differences are attributed to the variability of vegetation types within the landfire conifer classification systematic errors from the model algorithm modis pixel size heterogeneous composition within the pixel and uncertainty in ameriflux measurements chen et al 2016 velpuri et al 2013 the r2 values from this analysis 0 56 0 78 are similar to those reported by savoca et al 2013 where ssebop and fluxnet correlations ranged from 0 75 to 0 82 for grassland and forests additionally the root mean squared error 9 26 mm month in this analysis is similar to senay et al 2013 and performs better than the observed rmse 25 32 mm month in eddy covariance towers by velpuri et al 2013 based on these observations the ssebop et product provides reasonable pre and post fire et estimates and is readily available without the need to perform image post processing i e cloud filtering or hot and wet pixel selection which allows an efficient analysis of spatial and temporal patterns of monthly et 5 2 annual and seasonal et 2011 las conchas fire there was a statistically significant decrease in et which was attributed primarily to the las conchas fire fig 3 a control watershed and the addition of precipitation provided context for the impacts of climate on the observed et processes the annual et for the control watershed id 13 decreased by 13 6 from the pre to post fire period which was attributed to the declines of precipitation fig 4 and two small fires bear springs fire 2012 and 2014 that burned a total of 1 6 of the watershed however the trend of et p following the fire remained relatively constant which was expected in the control watershed as the relation between et and p was not altered highlighting altered et regimes in burned watersheds in six of the burned watersheds et was greater than precipitation before the fire section 4 2 fig 3 where antecedent conditions such as groundwater storage and snow processes may contribute additional available water for evapotranspiration processes the et p noticeably increased in wy 2002 due to lower precipitation across all burned watersheds supplementary figs 1 16 this demonstrates that there was an availability of water for vegetation transpiration processes other uncertainties in this et analysis can include errors from the ssebop algorithm where errors of each variable in the model may contribute up to an overall error of 20 chen et al 2016 burn severity also influenced the observed temporal patterns of et prior to the las conchas fire et p was relatively constant for all the watersheds there was an observed decline in et p for the more severely burned watersheds following wy 2011 despite increased annual precipitation supplementary figs 1 10 15 and 16 the burned watersheds had similar precipitation patterns to the control watershed outlet borrego canyon from wy 2001 2014 yet there was still an observed decrease in post fire annual et by approximately 97 352 mm per year fig 3 of the 16 watersheds analyzed 15 affected and the control watershed nine watersheds id 3 9 15 16 had statistically different α 0 05 mean annual post fire et thus the decrease in post fire et is attributed to the wildfire induced landscape changes rather than the amount of available water from precipitation snowmelt and groundwater supplies the observations from the current research corresponds with montes helu et al 2009 who noted that sensible and latent heats energy associated with et were lower for 10 years after wildfire the fire induced vegetation change i e transformation of ponderosa pine to grassland reduced the availability of energy for heating the air soil and evaporating water and limits evapotranspiration montes helu et al 2009 the observed annual and seasonal changes in et trends corroborates with previous studies the 120 mm yr decrease in the average annual et for the entire area affected by the las conchas fig 3 is similar to observations from dore et al 2010 who noted that post fire et was lower for 10 11 years after fire by 76 116 mm yr sánchez et al 2015 observed a decrease in et by 1 mm day after the fire which is comparable to the seasonal decrease of roughly 13 57 mm month observed in this study the range observed in this study is due to varying burn severity sánchez et al 2015 and montes helu et al 2009 noted that unburned et estimated by latent heat fluxes were greater than burned et from mid april to december and the largest differences occurred in may and july comparable seasonal patterns in et are observed during this 14 year study period fig 5 and are similar to ecosystem processes modeled by atchley and maxwell 2011 who showed that canopy loss and decreased shading in riparian areas increase surface evaporation decrease transpiration and results in an overall decrease in et 5 3 spatial et 2011 las conchas fire evapotranspiration trends vary spatially after wildfire and are impacted by burn severity as hypothesized higher sbs areas generally had greater decreases in et table 4 rio chiquito headquarters san antonio creek and rio del oso watersheds field based measurements in a mixed eucalypt forest by nolan et al 2014 observed that the average et was 41 lower in high burn severity 662 mm yr and 9 lower in moderate burn severity 1066 mm yr compared to unburned forests with et of 1097 mm yr following the black saturday fires in melbourne australia although the vegetation type cannot be directly compared the et difference in this study table 4 dif following the las conchas fire is similar dore et al 2010 observed annual et differences in ponderosa pine forests in flagstaff arizona after a wildfire the fire destroyed all trees and transformed the site to grasses forbs and shrubs post fire et was lower 365 3 mm in 2006 441 15 mm in 2007 compared to an unburned site 481 3 mm in 2006 525 12 mm in 2007 and resulted in approximately 12 30 lower et dore et al 2010 2012 this study also noted a shift in vegetation type from conifer to grassland after the las conchas fire fig 6 and a corresponding decrease in et the sum of the decrease in conifer and hardwood closely represented the increase of grassland within all affected regions however the percentage change in et did not have a direct relationship to the amount of vegetation converted to grassland fig 6 the et fig 6 is similar to dore et al 2010 but the current study provides more insight into patterns related to varying burn severity utilizing remote sensing models can improve the quantification and analysis of post fire et at greater spatial and temporal scales observations from previous ground based studies were limited by the number of field measurements and data sets sánchez et al 2015 investigated a total of 15 satellite images which may not fully capture seasonal and annual patterns in vegetation and et using ssebop 1 km monthly et from wy 2001 2015 for an entire burned region augments traditional analyses and improves our understanding of spatial and temporal variability after wildfire furthermore the coupling of vegetation and remotely sensed et can benefit post fire runoff modeling especially in catchments where actual et is not dominated by equilibrium zhou et al 2013 it is important to note that there are potential errors and uncertainty that may arise from aggregating burn severity from 30 m to 1 km pixels to match the resolution of ssebop which may misclassify some of the burn severities due to the size and number of watersheds analyzed in this study the potential effect of misclassified burn areas is expected to be minimal 5 4 further implications utilizing remote sensing techniques can improve our ability to assess relative changes in et after large wildfires at higher temporal resolutions although there are limitations and associated uncertainties with satellite based estimates this study is the first to apply an et product at high spatial and temporal resolution to understand the relative impacts of wildfire on et processes with respect to burn severity and vegetation type these results have significant implications for water resources provide insight into post fire et trends and advances remote sensing for disturbance applications approximately 20 50 of the rio grande river in new mexico is depleted due to riparian et dahm et al 2002 the current study estimates a decrease of approximately 120 mm year within all the watersheds affected by the las conchas fire which is about 10 16 of the average annual growing season et 74 122 cm yr dahm et al 2002 in the rio grande region this can have substantial impacts on regional water supplies especially as large catastrophic wildfires can potentially augment runoff available for downstream ecological communities and urban populations however there are also potentially negative impacts on water quality such as increased suspended sediment transport and increased total nitrogen phosphorus and heavy metal fe mn as cr al ba and pb concentrations smith et al 2011 in light of ongoing drought and increasing wildfire activities there is not only potential to degrade air and water quality change biochemical processes and nutrient cycling and alter watershed processes but also potential to alter the long term exchange between water and energy fluxes choromanska and deluca 2002 lane et al 2006 kinoshita and hogue 2011 nolan et al 2014 de sales et al 2015 therefore it is critical to predict and quantify post fire watershed processes for ecosystem and resources management in semi arid landscapes declines in streamflow following wildfire have also been documented because of antecedent soil moisture conditions and drought feikema et al 2013 nolan et al 2015 suggesting a nonlinear correspondence of et and surface runoff considering the emerging wildfire and drought nexus there is a need to further investigate the threshold between the hydrologic components of the water balance physical and climactic factors on a region s resistance and recovery to disturbance for example the magnitude of influence from et recovery on streamflow as a function of seedling regeneration and rates of transpiration from surviving trees following wildfires at regional scales requires further investigation 6 conclusion this research investigates evapotranspiration after the las conchas fire using remote sensing models and techniques to improve our understanding of spatial and temporal et processes first we observed that the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop et model can be suitable for pre and post fire analysis based on a comparison with ground based observations ameriflux second annual and seasonal et trends were altered after fire compared to pre fire et the average post fire annual et decreased from 102 6 to 352 2 mm yr 97 2 303 9 mm yr and 90 9 267 7 mm yr in high moderate and low sbs the most prominent decrease in et was during the summer with 13 57 mm month despite regular summer monsoon storms third we compared post fire et between various soil burn severities and unaffected areas generally post fire et was 19 9 36 1 15 34 1 and 8 7 29 1 lower in high moderate and low sbs areas respectively for all the watersheds within our study domain lastly a shift of vegetation from mostly conifer to grassland was observed which resulted in a general decrease in et from 18 to 51 this work has significant implications for water resources and encourages the integration of remote sensing techniques with traditional methods to enhance our knowledge of the complex hydrologic interactions in a disturbed environment as wildfire activities increase through anthropogenic activities and climate change understanding post fire et patterns can improve modeling of hydrological responses following wildfires in semi arid landscapes acknowledgement this research was supported by nasa headquarters under the nasa earth and space

7370,in recent years climate change and other anthropogenic factors have contributed to increased wildfire frequency and size in western united states forests this research focuses on the evaluation of spatial and temporal changes in evapotranspiration et following the 2011 las conchas fire in new mexico usa using the operational simplified surface energy balance model ssebop et evapotranspiration is coupled with soil burn severity and analyzed for 16 watersheds for water years 2001 2014 an average annual decrease of 120 mm of et is observed within the regions affected by the las conchas fire and conifers were converted to grassland a year after the fire on average the post fire annual et in high moderate and low burn severity is lower than pre fire et by approximately 103 352 mm 97 304 mm and 91 268 mm respectively the ratio of post fire evapotranspiration to precipitation et p is statistically different from pre fire conditions α 0 05 in nine of the watersheds the largest decrease in et is approximately 13 57 mm per month and is most prominent during the summer april to september the observed decrease in et contributes to our understanding of changes in water yield following wildfires which is of interest for accurately modeling and predicting hydrologic processes in semi arid landscapes keywords evapotranspiration wildfire remote sensing disturbance hydrology 1 introduction forests cover approximately 42 million km2 or 30 of the land surface in tropical temperate and boreal lands bonan 2008 and are critical regulators in the terrestrial water balance through evapotranspiration et evapotranspiration is an energy water flux that redistributes water from the soil and plant surfaces evaporation and vegetation transpiration into the atmosphere allen et al 2005 and is sensitive to vegetation characteristics and climate in temperate eucalypt forests and semiarid forests annual et accounts for 70 80 and 85 100 of precipitation respectively vertessy et al 2001 yaseef et al 2010 mitchell et al 2012 while in loblolly pine pinus taeda plantations in the southeastern u s and ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa approximately 70 sun et al 2002 and 85 respectively of annual precipitation contributes to et montes helu et al 2009 evapotranspiration influences climate through energy and water exchange making forests essential for ecological and watershed services such as flood control water quality and carbon and nitrogen storage disturbances in forests such as wildfires floods landslides and clearcutting can promote healthy tree density herbaceous and shrub production water availability and runoff nutrient availability soil characteristics and wildlife habitat covington and moore 1994 however global climate changes largely due to anthropogenic activities have led to variations in temperature and precipitation regimes altering natural wildfire patterns drought and other forest disturbances dale et al 2001 in the western u s climate change contributes to longer dry summer seasons and drier vegetation and extended wildfire durations and seasons which subsequently leads to more frequent and intense wildfires dale et al 2001 westerling et al 2006 invasive species can also impact ecosystem processes and change vegetation composition which impacts fuel properties and fire regimes such as intensity frequency and seasonality of wildfires brooks et al 2004 following wildfires lower et is expected from the loss of foliar volumes and transpiration processes also the replacement of deep rooted high profile trees by low profile grasses may contribute to lower et neary et al 2005 the reduced et means less precipitation is converted into vapor and thus more water generally is available for streamflow given the large role of et in the water budget a disturbance can shift the partitioning between dominant water fluxes such as infiltration and surface runoff thus accurate estimates of et are necessary for climate studies ecosystem modeling and agriculture and hydrologic applications especially in regions experiencing acute or chronic changes in land cover post fire watershed processes in various ecosystems have been documented including altered sediment yield keller et al 1997 lane et al 2006 soil moisture ebel 2013 peak streamflow veenhuis 2000 base flow kinoshita and hogue 2011 snow accumulation and melt patterns neary et al 2005 micheletty et al 2014 and surface water yield kinoshita and hogue 2015 bart 2016 noted a 134 increase of streamflow during the first year after fire in 12 watersheds in southern california similarly kinoshita and hogue 2015 observed an increase in low streamflow volume 118 1090 following the 2003 old fire in southern california the enhanced baseflow in the chaparral dominated watersheds was attributed to the reduction of basin wide transpiration rates due to the loss of vegetation kinoshita and hogue 2011 2015 in new mexico wine and cadol 2016 observed various post fire streamflow responses in three semi arid watersheds that were impacted by monsoon storms from 1982 to 2014 the runoff in the gila watershed 92 burned was 12 16 times greater than unburned watersheds for 3 5 post fire years wine and cadol 2016 the reduced transpiration and increased infiltration excess overland flow following monsoon storms contributed to increased streamflow some watersheds did not show an increased post fire water yield which was attributed to the inaccuracy of runoff measurements increased transpiration by remaining plants and increased evaporation as a result of reduced tree canopy wine and cadol 2016 similarly feikema et al 2013 did not observe an increase of initial post fire streamflow due to reduced canopy cover which highlights the importance of antecedent soil moisture conditions during a drought low rainfall can result in soil water deficits for example when soil moisture deficits are very large or very small feikema et al 2013 bart 2016 surface runoff may not be impacted by changes in evapotranspiration benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 noted that low runoff may be due to high antecedent soil moisture or dry soils with a higher capacity for infiltration even in high burn severity regions based on the limited literature wine and cadol 2016 noted the importance of continuing research on the impacts of wildfire on evapotranspiration to further understand post fire hydrologic and vegetation processes and improve the prediction of streamflow responses there is limited research focused on post wildfire et post fire et studies by montes helu et al 2009 and dore et al 2010 observed co2 and et using eddy covariance data applicable for an area of 176 3 m burned and 271 4 m unburned during 2006 in arizona after a severe fire in 1996 after the fire the ponderosa pine became primarily grassland and shrub with 40 vegetation coverage 50 bare soil and 10 logs and snags montes helu et al 2009 dore et al 2010 noted that post fire et was lower for 10 11 years after the fire by 76 116 mm per year another field based study in a mixed eucalypt forest located in the state of victoria australia observed that et in high and moderately burned forest are 41 and 3 lower respectively over the first two post fire years nolan et al 2014 utilizing remote sensing techniques sánchez et al 2015 applied a two source energy balance approach on two sets 6 7 years and 11 years after the fire of satellite based scenes a total of 15 landsat 5 thematic mapper and enhanced thematic mapper plus images to estimate latent heat flux heat associated with surface evaporation after a wildfire in spain sánchez et al 2015 noted a decrease of approximately 1 mm per day of et in unburned pine forest 6 7 years after fire this decrease was attributed to altered vegetation structure land surface temperature and albedo sánchez et al 2015 dore et al 2010 and nolan et al 2014 provided important insight into point scale evaporative processes after wildfire while sánchez et al 2015 provided a higher spatial resolution study with limited temporal resolution this research builds upon previous studies by incorporating remote sensing products to quantify post fire evapotranspiration at higher temporal and spatial scales evapotranspiration before and after the 2011 las conchas fire in new mexico united states was investigated utilizing the operational simplified surface energy balance model ssebop pre and post fire et patterns were compared with spatially distributed precipitation and soil burn severity for water years wy 2001 to 2014 october 1 2000 to september 31 2014 this research addresses the following questions which also provides the structural sub headings used in the following methods results and discussions sections i how well does ssebop et represent pre and post fire processes ii how does annual and seasonal et change after wildfire iii how does pre and post fire et vary spatially and temporally with respect to soil burn severity 2 data and study site 2 1 spatial actual evapotranspiration model single source energy balance models such as the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 require manually selected hot and cold reference pixels to compare climatic conditions for one satellite image the simplified surface energy balance index sseb i and operational simplified surface energy balance model ssebop senay et al 2013 omit the calculation of sensible heat flux to reduce the complexity of determining actual et ssebop also assumes that each pixel has pre defined hot and cold reference values given that reference points are stationary or the differences are small in relation to the accuracy level obtained through varying boundary conditions senay et al 2013 this approach requires a pre defined satellite derived

the total precipitation after the fire two of the five watersheds had an annual post fire et that was greater than the post fire precipitation id 1 and id 16 post fire et decreased approximately 60 250 mm yr in all watersheds fig 3 the monthly et p for all watersheds ranged from 0 4 to 2 5 supplementary figs 1 16 and were sensitive to annual precipitation and the fire in wy 2002 the ratios of et

average was 565 57 mm which substantially decreased after the fire to 395 11 mm a decline in et p of 0 21 for 2 years following the fire was caused by the increase of precipitation and decrease of et supplementary fig 9 fig 4 the difference of et p averages was 0 24 p value 0 026 indicating that the pre and post fire et p were statistically different seasonally there was a minimal decrease of et 4 mm month in the winter and spring a greater decrease of et during the summer seasons was noted for all burn severity types 30 mm month fig 5 within rio chiquito the highest annual relative difference of et burned versus unaffected areas was 51 6 in the low severity regions while there was only a relative change of 14 6 in the high burn severity areas table 4 headwaters san antonio creek id 16 mixed soil burn severities had a mean pre fire precipitation of 453 90 mm from wy 2001 2011 and a similar average post fire precipitation of 402 32 mm from wy 2012 2014 however the post fire annual et decreased by 200 mm for the whole watershed from 634 42 mm to 437 24 mm consequently et p was reduced by 0 51 1 4 to 0 9 immediately following the wildfire and was statistically different fig 4 table 3 similar to the other watersheds the highest difference in pre and post fire et was between april to june where a decrease of 24 44 49 and 57 mm month for unaffected low moderate and high severity areas was noted respectively fig 5 peralta canyon id 10 moderate and low burn severity watershed had a pre and post fire annual precipitation of 639 30 mm and 574 29 mm respectively there was a notable decrease of approximately 100 mm of annual et after the fire from 538 40 mm to 438 41 mm the trends of et and precipitation following the fire 2011 2014 were similar resulting in a constant et p that resembled the control watershed supplementary fig 10 fig 4 the change of mean annual et p before and after the fire was 0 09 and not significant at a 5 level table 3 seasonally et decreased during april to september for the whole watershed 20 mm month for unaffected 23 mm for moderate and 28 mm month for low burn severity areas fig 5 in rio del oso id 2 unaffected and mostly moderate severity watershed the average annual precipitation before and after the fire was 300 82 and 271 24 mm respectively the pre fire averaged annual et from unaffected areas was 349 35 mm and the post fire annual et was 296 31 mm similar to headwaters san antonio creek watershed the annual et p significantly declined immediately after the fire from 1 3 to 0 8 supplementary fig 2 fig 4 the moderately burned area pre fire annual et was 328 41 mm and the mean post fire annual et was 230 36 mm similar to the control watershed the largest decrease in et occurred between april to june with 13 mm month for moderate and 7 mm month for unaffected areas during the summer seasons there was a large decrease of 21 7 in et in moderate areas and 13 0 in unaffected areas within rio del oso fig 5 4 3 spatial evapotranspiration 2011 las conchas fire within each watershed the regions unaffected by the fire were compared to each sbs level to observe the change in post fire et after the las conchas fire lower annual post fire et in high soil burn severities were observed compared to the unaffected rio chiquito low headwaters san antonio creek and moderate rio del oso severities these watersheds contained the most high and moderate sbs areas and the largest declines in et table 4 while peralta canyon had larger post fire et in high and moderate burned areas compared to low burn severity areas table 4 rio del oso showed the smallest difference in annual et for all sbs areas table 4 it had a difference of 102 mm between pre and post fire annual et in the high sbs 98 mm in the moderate sbs 91 mm in the low sbs and 65 mm in the unaffected areas post fire et was 20 lower in high sbs 17 lower in moderate sbs 11 lower in low sbs when compared to unaffected areas table 4 similarly headwaters san antonio creek generally decreased in which the average post fire annual et was 24 lower in high sbs and 15 lower in moderate sbs annual et in rio chiquito had the largest percentage differences across various sbs high moderate and low sbs areas had lower et than the unaffected regions by 36 34 and 29 contrary to the above watersheds peralta canyon post et difference was greatest in low sbs regions 22 and smallest in high sbs areas 19 high sbs areas had a greater post fire average annual et 405 mm than low burn severity 390 mm table 4 the ratio δ between the et difference of sbs regions and unaffected regions 10 showed the magnitude of decrease of each watershed rio del oso and headwaters san antonio creek were similar where et had a larger magnitude of decrease with increasing sbs table 4 the δ s for rio del oso ranged from 1 4 to 1 57 whereas δ s for headwaters san antonio creek ranged from 1 97 to 2 57 the highest δ values amongst all watersheds although rio chiquito had the greatest ratio difference of et within the watershed the low sbs had an unexpectedly higher decline of et 602 to 375 mm than the other sbs levels further the δ s from peralta canyon showed mixed results the magnitude of decrease was lowest in moderate sbs areas 1 02 and highest in high sbs areas 1 37 the percentage difference 11 between the pre and post fire et et estimates was noted with respect to the vegetation within a sbs region fig 6 in the burned regions of the four fire affected watersheds all major vegetation types conifer hardwood and shrubland decreased except grassland the amount of vegetation decreased from 3 8 to 62 7 in conifer 0 2 to 24 4 in hardwood and 0 1 to 3 7 in shrubland the increase in grassland across all burn severities was approximately 4 5 to 69 1 the sum of the decrease in conifer and hardwood closely represented the increase of grassland within all affected regions however there was no direct relation between the percentage change in et and amount of vegetation converted to grassland fig 6 the et ranged from 22 6 to 51 2 high 20 4 to 39 9 moderate and 18 3 to 44 8 low across the watersheds at unburned regions of the fire affected watersheds minimal changes across vegetation types and a slight decrease in et 14 7 to 23 6 were observed fig 6 at outlet borrego canyon the control watershed the amount of conifer decreased by 27 5 3 7 and 0 7 at moderate low and unburned regions respectively similar to other watersheds the amount of grassland increased by 27 5 3 9 and 0 7 in moderate low and unburned areas respectively the et decreased minimally and ranged from 5 6 to 12 8 within the watershed 5 discussion 5 1 ameriflux and ssebop comparison 2013 thompson ridge fire ssebop et was evaluated under post fire conditions within the thompson ridge fire in general ssebop performed well compared to the ameriflux towers where the pre and post fire correlations ranged from r2 0 56 0 78 and the rmse ranged from 9 to 26 mm month fig 2 generally the post fire values of ssebop and ameriflux fall within the range of the pre fire values however there were less data points from the post fire period 19 months which contributes to uncertainty in the correlation in the mixed conifer site ssebop tended to overestimate et by 13 to 22 mm month fig 2a while the ponderosa pine site underestimated by 8 7 to 18 mm month fig 2b these differences are attributed to the variability of vegetation types within the landfire conifer classification systematic errors from the model algorithm modis pixel size heterogeneous composition within the pixel and uncertainty in ameriflux measurements chen et al 2016 velpuri et al 2013 the r2 values from this analysis 0 56 0 78 are similar to those reported by savoca et al 2013 where ssebop and fluxnet correlations ranged from 0 75 to 0 82 for grassland and forests additionally the root mean squared error 9 26 mm month in this analysis is similar to senay et al 2013 and performs better than the observed rmse 25 32 mm month in eddy covariance towers by velpuri et al 2013 based on these observations the ssebop et product provides reasonable pre and post fire et estimates and is readily available without the need to perform image post processing i e cloud filtering or hot and wet pixel selection which allows an efficient analysis of spatial and temporal patterns of monthly et 5 2 annual and seasonal et 2011 las conchas fire there was a statistically significant decrease in et which was attributed primarily to the las conchas fire fig 3 a control watershed and the addition of precipitation provided context for the impacts of climate on the observed et processes the annual et for the control watershed id 13 decreased by 13 6 from the pre to post fire period which was attributed to the declines of precipitation fig 4 and two small fires bear springs fire 2012 and 2014 that burned a total of 1 6 of the watershed however the trend of et p following the fire remained relatively constant which was expected in the control watershed as the relation between et and p was not altered highlighting altered et regimes in burned watersheds in six of the burned watersheds et was greater than precipitation before the fire section 4 2 fig 3 where antecedent conditions such as groundwater storage and snow processes may contribute additional available water for evapotranspiration processes the et p noticeably increased in wy 2002 due to lower precipitation across all burned watersheds supplementary figs 1 16 this demonstrates that there was an availability of water for vegetation transpiration processes other uncertainties in this et analysis can include errors from the ssebop algorithm where errors of each variable in the model may contribute up to an overall error of 20 chen et al 2016 burn severity also influenced the observed temporal patterns of et prior to the las conchas fire et p was relatively constant for all the watersheds there was an observed decline in et p for the more severely burned watersheds following wy 2011 despite increased annual precipitation supplementary figs 1 10 15 and 16 the burned watersheds had similar precipitation patterns to the control watershed outlet borrego canyon from wy 2001 2014 yet there was still an observed decrease in post fire annual et by approximately 97 352 mm per year fig 3 of the 16 watersheds analyzed 15 affected and the control watershed nine watersheds id 3 9 15 16 had statistically different α 0 05 mean annual post fire et thus the decrease in post fire et is attributed to the wildfire induced landscape changes rather than the amount of available water from precipitation snowmelt and groundwater supplies the observations from the current research corresponds with montes helu et al 2009 who noted that sensible and latent heats energy associated with et were lower for 10 years after wildfire the fire induced vegetation change i e transformation of ponderosa pine to grassland reduced the availability of energy for heating the air soil and evaporating water and limits evapotranspiration montes helu et al 2009 the observed annual and seasonal changes in et trends corroborates with previous studies the 120 mm yr decrease in the average annual et for the entire area affected by the las conchas fig 3 is similar to observations from dore et al 2010 who noted that post fire et was lower for 10 11 years after fire by 76 116 mm yr sánchez et al 2015 observed a decrease in et by 1 mm day after the fire which is comparable to the seasonal decrease of roughly 13 57 mm month observed in this study the range observed in this study is due to varying burn severity sánchez et al 2015 and montes helu et al 2009 noted that unburned et estimated by latent heat fluxes were greater than burned et from mid april to december and the largest differences occurred in may and july comparable seasonal patterns in et are observed during this 14 year study period fig 5 and are similar to ecosystem processes modeled by atchley and maxwell 2011 who showed that canopy loss and decreased shading in riparian areas increase surface evaporation decrease transpiration and results in an overall decrease in et 5 3 spatial et 2011 las conchas fire evapotranspiration trends vary spatially after wildfire and are impacted by burn severity as hypothesized higher sbs areas generally had greater decreases in et table 4 rio chiquito headquarters san antonio creek and rio del oso watersheds field based measurements in a mixed eucalypt forest by nolan et al 2014 observed that the average et was 41 lower in high burn severity 662 mm yr and 9 lower in moderate burn severity 1066 mm yr compared to unburned forests with et of 1097 mm yr following the black saturday fires in melbourne australia although the vegetation type cannot be directly compared the et difference in this study table 4 dif following the las conchas fire is similar dore et al 2010 observed annual et differences in ponderosa pine forests in flagstaff arizona after a wildfire the fire destroyed all trees and transformed the site to grasses forbs and shrubs post fire et was lower 365 3 mm in 2006 441 15 mm in 2007 compared to an unburned site 481 3 mm in 2006 525 12 mm in 2007 and resulted in approximately 12 30 lower et dore et al 2010 2012 this study also noted a shift in vegetation type from conifer to grassland after the las conchas fire fig 6 and a corresponding decrease in et the sum of the decrease in conifer and hardwood closely represented the increase of grassland within all affected regions however the percentage change in et did not have a direct relationship to the amount of vegetation converted to grassland fig 6 the et fig 6 is similar to dore et al 2010 but the current study provides more insight into patterns related to varying burn severity utilizing remote sensing models can improve the quantification and analysis of post fire et at greater spatial and temporal scales observations from previous ground based studies were limited by the number of field measurements and data sets sánchez et al 2015 investigated a total of 15 satellite images which may not fully capture seasonal and annual patterns in vegetation and et using ssebop 1 km monthly et from wy 2001 2015 for an entire burned region augments traditional analyses and improves our understanding of spatial and temporal variability after wildfire furthermore the coupling of vegetation and remotely sensed et can benefit post fire runoff modeling especially in catchments where actual et is not dominated by equilibrium zhou et al 2013 it is important to note that there are potential errors and uncertainty that may arise from aggregating burn severity from 30 m to 1 km pixels to match the resolution of ssebop which may misclassify some of the burn severities due to the size and number of watersheds analyzed in this study the potential effect of misclassified burn areas is expected to be minimal 5 4 further implications utilizing remote sensing techniques can improve our ability to assess relative changes in et after large wildfires at higher temporal resolutions although there are limitations and associated uncertainties with satellite based estimates this study is the first to apply an et product at high spatial and temporal resolution to understand the relative impacts of wildfire on et processes with respect to burn severity and vegetation type these results have significant implications for water resources provide insight into post fire et trends and advances remote sensing for disturbance applications approximately 20 50 of the rio grande river in new mexico is depleted due to riparian et dahm et al 2002 the current study estimates a decrease of approximately 120 mm year within all the watersheds affected by the las conchas fire which is about 10 16 of the average annual growing season et 74 122 cm yr dahm et al 2002 in the rio grande region this can have substantial impacts on regional water supplies especially as large catastrophic wildfires can potentially augment runoff available for downstream ecological communities and urban populations however there are also potentially negative impacts on water quality such as increased suspended sediment transport and increased total nitrogen phosphorus and heavy metal fe mn as cr al ba and pb concentrations smith et al 2011 in light of ongoing drought and increasing wildfire activities there is not only potential to degrade air and water quality change biochemical processes and nutrient cycling and alter watershed processes but also potential to alter the long term exchange between water and energy fluxes choromanska and deluca 2002 lane et al 2006 kinoshita and hogue 2011 nolan et al 2014 de sales et al 2015 therefore it is critical to predict and quantify post fire watershed processes for ecosystem and resources management in semi arid landscapes declines in streamflow following wildfire have also been documented because of antecedent soil moisture conditions and drought feikema et al 2013 nolan et al 2015 suggesting a nonlinear correspondence of et and surface runoff considering the emerging wildfire and drought nexus there is a need to further investigate the threshold between the hydrologic components of the water balance physical and climactic factors on a region s resistance and recovery to disturbance for example the magnitude of influence from et recovery on streamflow as a function of seedling regeneration and rates of transpiration from surviving trees following wildfires at regional scales requires further investigation 6 conclusion this research investigates evapotranspiration after the las conchas fire using remote sensing models and techniques to improve our understanding of spatial and temporal et processes first we observed that the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop et model can be suitable for pre and post fire analysis based on a comparison with ground based observations ameriflux second annual and seasonal et trends were altered after fire compared to pre fire et the average post fire annual et decreased from 102 6 to 352 2 mm yr 97 2 303 9 mm yr and 90 9 267 7 mm yr in high moderate and low sbs the most prominent decrease in et was during the summer with 13 57 mm month despite regular summer monsoon storms third we compared post fire et between various soil burn severities and unaffected areas generally post fire et was 19 9 36 1 15 34 1 and 8 7 29 1 lower in high moderate and low sbs areas respectively for all the watersheds within our study domain lastly a shift of vegetation from mostly conifer to grassland was observed which resulted in a general decrease in et from 18 to 51 this work has significant implications for water resources and encourages the integration of remote sensing techniques with traditional methods to enhance our knowledge of the complex hydrologic interactions in a disturbed environment as wildfire activities increase through anthropogenic activities and climate change understanding post fire et patterns can improve modeling of hydrological responses following wildfires in semi arid landscapes acknowledgement this research was supported by nasa headquarters under the nasa earth and space

7371,this study treats the catchment as a block box system with considering the rainfall input and runoff output being a stochastic process the temporal rainfall runoff relationship at the catchment scale is described by a convolution integral on a continuous time scale using the fourier stieltjes representation approach a frequency domain solution to the convolution integral is developed to the spectral analysis of runoff processes generated by temporal non stationary rainfall events it is shown that the characteristic time scale of rainfall process increases the runoff discharge variability while the catchment mean travel time constant plays the role in reducing the variability of runoff discharge similar to the behavior of groundwater aquifers catchments act as a low pass filter in the frequency domain for the rainfall input signal keywords spectral analysis runoff discharge variability low pass filters temporal non stationary processes 1 introduction heterogeneity is inherent in a natural process such as a rainfall process most hydrologic systems are essentially random because their major input is rainfall consequently stochastic analysis plays a large role in hydrological analysis of the rainfall runoff generation process e g franchini et al 1996 goel et al 2000 jones et al 2016 note that nonlinear dynamical systems may produce time series indistinguishable from random noise by typical stochastic methods methods using the concepts from nonlinear deterministic dynamic and chaos theories have been established to identify and characterize them e g gershenfeld and weigend 1993 sivakumar 2004 2009 the applications of such methods to various hydrologic systems processes and problems are provided in sivakumar 2016 when hydrological observations are available and catchment properties parameters are known throughout a region the response to a particular rainfall event would be completely determined in advance in general because of the complexity of natural catchment structures such complete information will never be available and therefore high uncertainty is anticipated in the prediction of runoff discharge as such quantification of uncertainty involved in runoff discharge prediction is essential for planning and managing river systems the purpose of the present study is to provide an analytical stochastic framework for understanding the influence of controlling parameters in the rainfall runoff model on the variability uncertainty of runoff discharge in the circumstances of limited available data lumped conceptual models in prediction of runoff are preferred over the distributed hydrological models e g littlewood 2002 khan et al 2011 prieto sierra et al 2013 toward the above mentioned goal a convolution integral on a continuous time scale is used to describe interaction between rainfall an input and runoff discharge an output where the rainfall process is modeled as a non stationary process a frequency domain solution to the convolution integral will provide a simple analytical result to the spectral analysis of the rainfall runoff process gelhar 1993 noted that in most situations the spectral relationship is more useful because more objective statistical inference can be carried out in the spectral domain the spectral analysis approach to groundwater or transport models demonstrates that relatively simple linear models can be used to extract useful information from times series for hydrologic variables e g gelhar 1974 duffy et al 1984 duffy and gelhar 1985 jin and duffy 1994 zhang and schilling 2004 mclin 2012 the present work addresses the problem of random rainfall runoff process in temporal non stationary flow fields the problem is solved analytically using the continuous convolution integral and the theory of spectral analysis of time series the closed form solutions in the frequency domain are then used to analyze the influence of the parameters in the rainfall runoff model on the variability of runoff discharge to our knowledge the analysis of variability of runoff discharge has not been presented so far using the continuous time convolution integral with a non stationary input output time series 2 statement of the problem in study of the rainfall runoff process from the systematic point of view we regard the catchment as a block box system with a stochastic rainfall input and therefore a stochastic runoff output spatial variations of flow rates through the system can be ignored focus is placed on the class of input output systems which can be approximated as linear time invariant dynamic systems a linear system has the property that the system response to a linear combination of some basic inputs can be constructed as the same linear combination of the responses to each of the basic inputs time invariance refers to that if the inputs are delayed by some amount of time then the outputs will be simply delayed by that same amount of time as such in a linear time invariant system the system response can be represented as a linear combination of delayed and scaled basic inputs the general form of a linear time invariant system with a variable input x t and an output y t can be expressed by the convolution integral on a continuous time scale e g liang and nash 1988 kirchner et al 2000 as 1 y t 0 t h t s x s ds where h t is the response or transit time function that is completely determined by physical characteristics of the system and t s is the time lag since the input was applied the transit time water spends traveling subsurface through a catchment to the stream network is a physical measure that integrates flow path heterogeneity and is directly related to internal catchment processes mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 the distribution of transit times describes how catchments retain and release water the field evidence indicates very irregular patterns of rainfall in time and in turn very complex runoff production on a catchment during a hydrologic event we therefore consider here that the rainfall is a temporal random process and the only input to the determination of the catchment runoff discharge through the use of eq 1 for simplicity of the analysis the response function in eq 1 is treaded deterministically eq 1 is then regarded as a stochastic equation with a stochastic input and therefore a stochastic output it should be noted that linearity involved in modelling of the rainfall runoff response of a catchment increases with the catchment area e g minshall 1960 wang et al 1981 robinson et al 1995 where this implies that the linear rainfall runoff transformation eq 1 prevails in large catchments the stochastic eq 1 suggests that the temporal heterogeneity in rainfall rate results in temporal random perturbations in runoff discharge as such eq 1 might constitute a basis for characterizing the evolutionary spectrum of runoff discharge using the representation theorem which is the focus of this work to do that we further consider that the rainfall perturbation process can be quantified completely by the langevin equation of the form e g north and cahalan 1981 north et al 1993 2a dq dt q τ 0 ξ t subject to the initial condition 2b q 0 0 where q is the rainfall perturbation τ 0 is the characteristic time scale and ξ t is a zero mean random forcing which is stationary in the section that follows the stochastic analysis of runoff discharge builds on the spectral representation approach of priestley 1965 3 response spectrum following priestley 1965 the perturbed random quantities in eq 1 are represented as fourier stieltjes representations 3 q t θ q t ω e i ω t dz ξ ω 4 q t θ q t ω e i ω t dz ξ ω where q is the fluctuations in runoff discharge ω is the frequency θq t ω and θq t ω denote the modulating functions of the rainfall and runoff discharge processes respectively and zξ ω is an orthogonal random process with 5 e dz ξ 2 s ξ ξ ω d ω in eq 5 sξξ ω is defined as the spectrum of ξ process note that the representation of q or q does not impose the restriction on stationary assumption substitution of eqs 3 and 4 into convolution integral eq 1 yields 6 θ q t ω e i ω t dz ξ ω 0 t h t s θ q s ω e i ω s dz ξ ω ds interchanging the order of integration and by the uniqueness of the representation theorem the modulating functions of the discharge variation and the rainfall perturbations are related by 7 θ q t ω 0 t h t s θ q s ω e i ω t s ds it follows from using representation theorem for q eq 4 along with eq 7 that 8 σ q 2 t e q t q t θ q t ω 2 e dz ξ t dz ξ t s qq t ω d ω where represents the complex conjugate sqq t ω denotes the evolutionary power spectrum of q process priestley 1965 a generalization of the power spectrum for a stationary random process defined by 9 s qq t ω θ q t ω 2 s ξ ξ ω which states that once h t for the linear system is known the output spectrum can be forecasted for any given input spectrum the θq t ω 2 expression in eq 9 which is termed the transfer function priestley 1965 describes the amount of amplitude damping attenuation between input and output at any given frequency stationarity homogeneity of a noise process in eq 2a implies that each realization can be represented by e g lumley and panofsky 1964 priestley 1965 10 ξ t e i ω t dz ξ ω the modulating function of rainfall process can then be evaluated by substituting eqs 3 and 10 into eq 2 as 11 θ q t ω τ 0 υ 1 e υ τ λ where υ 1 iλ λ ωτ 0 and τ ωt as such the rainfall perturbation admits a representation of the form 12 q t τ 0 υ e i τ e τ λ dz ξ ω by the orthogonality of zξ ω in eq 3 and use of eq 11 the evolutionary power spectrum of rainfall process sqq ω can be written as 13 s qq t ω θ q t ω 2 s ξ ξ ω τ 0 2 1 2 e τ λ cos τ e 2 τ λ 1 λ 2 s ξ ξ ω the behavior of rainfall spectrum with respect to dimensionless time for different values of characteristic rainfall time scale constant τ 0 implied by eq 13 is demonstrated in fig 1 the figure shows that the rainfall rate approaches an asymptotic value faster for small values of τ 0 than for larger values which therefore produces a small rainfall spectrum variability for small values of the characteristic time scale in addition stochastic rainfall processes become stationary at large times and the asymptotic value of the power spectra are related to the characteristic time scales of the processes the implication of this is that the stationary assumption may provide a good approximation for rainfall process at large time to evaluate eq 9 explicitly the response function h t must be specified for this analysis two types of response functions are used namely the exponential response function in maloszewski and zuber 1982 14 h t 1 τ m exp t τ m and the gamma response function in kirchner et al 2000 2001 and godsey et al 2010 15 h t α τ m α t α 1 γ α exp α t τ m where τm represents the catchment mean travel time constant α is the shape parameter and γ x denotes the incomplete gamma function of argument x the catchment travel time is referred to as the time spent by water particles injected through rainfall in traveling through a catchment up to a control section 3 1 exponential response function the exponential response function is the most commonly employed in practical applications by far mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 substituting eqs 11 and 14 into eq 7 produces 16 θ q t ω τ 0 υ 1 ρ 1 e ρ t λ λ μ e ρ t e υ τ λ which leads eq 9 eventually to 17 s qq t ω τ 0 2 1 γ 1 γ 2 1 2 cos τ η 2 η 2 2 2 λ λ μ γ 1 γ 2 η 2 η 1 cos τ μ sin τ η 2 2 η 1 η 2 λ 2 λ μ 2 γ 1 η 1 η 2 2 s ξ ξ ω where ρ 1 iμ μ ωτm t t τm γ 1 1 λ 2 γ 2 1 μ 2 η 1 exp τ λ η 2 exp t the spectrum of runoff discharge derived in eq 17 is plotted against the dimensionless frequency in fig 2 for various values of the ratio of mean travel time τm to rainfall characteristic time scale τ 0 which shows the strong decay of the runoff spectrum with high frequencies the figure indicates that the runoff spectrum is insensitive to low frequency variations in the rainfall and high frequency variations are attenuated in the runoff discharge series implying that the convolution integral eq 1 or a linear reservoir system behaves as a low pass filter this kind of high frequency filtering for groundwater flow systems subject to recharges was reported in the literature e g gelhar 1974 duffy and gelhar 1985 jin and duffy 1994 molénat et al 1999 zhang and schilling 2004 jimenez martınez et al 2013 fig 2 also indicates that for a system with a small mean travel time a quick response to the input the variation in rainfall will induce high variation in runoff discharge this implies that the mean travel time decreases the persistence of runoff discharge fluctuations it can be shown an increase in runoff discharge spectrum with a larger value of τ 0 through eq 17 eq 7 reveals that the modulating functions of rainfall and runoff processes are positively correlated a larger value of τ 0 parameter leads to a larger spectrum variability of the rainfall field see fig 1 and in turn a larger spectrum variability of runoff discharge field 3 2 gamma response function the shape parameterα in eq 15 reflects the heterogeneity in the flow path lengths and velocities of catchments godsey et al 2010 note that the forms of eqs 14 and 15 are precisely equivalent in the case when α 1 it is therefore of interest to investigate the influence of shape parameter on the runoff discharge spectra by comparing results obtained from using the exponential and gamma response functions for simplicity we choose α 2 e g godsey et al 2010 in eq 15 i e 18 h t 4 τ m 2 t exp 2 t τ m for evaluating the runoff discharge spectrum in eq 9 combining this with eqs 11 and 7 gives 19 θ q t ω 4 τ 0 υ e ϕ t ψ 1 ψ 2 and correspondingly through eq 9 20 s qq t ω 16 τ 0 2 γ 1 e 4 t ψ 3 2 2 t 1 ψ 4 2 τ ψ 5 ψ 2 ψ 2 2 4 μ 2 ψ 4 8 μ ψ 5 s ξ ξ ω where ϕ 2 iμ and expressions for ψ 1 ψ 5 are given respectively in the appendix the runoff discharge spectra resulting from the exponential and gamma response functions are display in fig 3 as a function of frequency the figure indicates the reduction in runoff discharge spectrum variability with an increasing α this implies that the temporal variability of runoff discharge induced by a non stationary rainfall process persists longer for small values of the shape parameter 4 concluding remarks in study of the rainfall runoff process at the catchment scale the catchment is viewed as a block box system the random non stationary input fluctuating quantities in rainfall to the system can be described by a stochastic differential equation of the langevin type and the output to the system runoff discharge is related to the input by a convolution integral on a continuous time scale based on fourier stieltjes representation approach a frequency domain solution is developed to describe the spectral response characteristics of catchments subject to temporal fluctuations in rainfall this allows to the evaluation of the influence of controlling parameters such as the characteristic time scale of rainfall process and mean travel time constant on the variability of runoff discharge it is found that since the characteristic time scale of rainfall process is sensitive to rainfall rate the rainfall rate will be reached a constant value fast for a small characteristic time scale which reduce the variation of rainfall and in turn the variation of runoff discharge in addition the catchment mean travel time plays the role in smoothing out the runoff discharge variability the catchment exhibits a low pass filter in the frequency domain which attenuates high frequency variations in the rainfall input acknowledgements the work underlying this

while the catchment mean travel time constant plays the role in reducing the variability of runoff discharge similar to the behavior of groundwater aquifers catchments act as a low pass filter in the frequency domain for the rainfall input signal keywords spectral analysis runoff discharge variability low pass filters temporal non stationary processes 1 introduction heterogeneity is inherent in a natural process such as a rainfall process most hydrologic systems are essentially random because their major input is rainfall consequently stochastic analysis plays a large role in hydrological analysis of the rainfall runoff generation process e g franchini et al 1996 goel et al 2000 jones et al 2016 note that nonlinear dynamical systems may produce time series indistinguishable from random noise by typical stochastic methods methods using the concepts from nonlinear deterministic dynamic and chaos theories have been established to identify and characterize them e g gershenfeld and weigend 1993 sivakumar 2004 2009 the applications of such methods to various hydrologic systems processes and problems are provided in sivakumar 2016 when hydrological observations are available and catchment properties parameters are known throughout a region the response to a particular rainfall event would be completely determined in advance in general because of the complexity of natural catchment structures such complete information will never be available and therefore high uncertainty is anticipated in the prediction of runoff discharge as such quantification of uncertainty involved in runoff discharge prediction is essential for planning and managing river systems the purpose of the present study is to provide an analytical stochastic framework for understanding the influence of controlling parameters in the rainfall runoff model on the variability uncertainty of runoff discharge in the circumstances of limited available data lumped conceptual models in prediction of runoff are preferred over the distributed hydrological models e g littlewood 2002 khan et al 2011 prieto sierra et al 2013 toward the above mentioned goal a convolution integral on a continuous time scale is used to describe interaction between rainfall an input and runoff discharge an output where the rainfall process is modeled as a non stationary process a frequency domain solution to the convolution integral will provide a simple analytical result to the spectral analysis of the rainfall runoff process gelhar 1993 noted that in most situations the spectral relationship is more useful because more objective statistical inference can be carried out in the spectral domain the spectral analysis approach to groundwater or transport models demonstrates that relatively simple linear models can be used to extract useful information from times series for hydrologic variables e g gelhar 1974 duffy et al 1984 duffy and gelhar 1985 jin and duffy 1994 zhang and schilling 2004 mclin 2012 the present work addresses the problem of random rainfall runoff process in temporal non stationary flow fields the problem is solved analytically using the continuous convolution integral and the theory of spectral analysis of time series the closed form solutions in the frequency domain are then used to analyze the influence of the parameters in the rainfall runoff model on the variability of runoff discharge to our knowledge the analysis of variability of runoff discharge has not been presented so far using the continuous time convolution integral with a non stationary input output time series 2 statement of the problem in study of the rainfall runoff process from the systematic point of view we regard the catchment as a block box system with a stochastic rainfall input and therefore a stochastic runoff output spatial variations of flow rates through the system can be ignored focus is placed on the class of input output systems which can be approximated as linear time invariant dynamic systems a linear system has the property that the system response to a linear combination of some basic inputs can be constructed as the same linear combination of the responses to each of the basic inputs time invariance refers to that if the inputs are delayed by some amount of time then the outputs will be simply delayed by that same amount of time as such in a linear time invariant system the system response can be represented as a linear combination of delayed and scaled basic inputs the general form of a linear time invariant system with a variable input x t and an output y t can be expressed by the convolution integral on a continuous time scale e g liang and nash 1988 kirchner et al 2000 as 1 y t 0 t h t s x s ds where h t is the response or transit time function that is completely determined by physical characteristics of the system and t s is the time lag since the input was applied the transit time water spends traveling subsurface through a catchment to the stream network is a physical measure that integrates flow path heterogeneity and is directly related to internal catchment processes mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 the distribution of transit times describes how catchments retain and release water the field evidence indicates very irregular patterns of rainfall in time and in turn very complex runoff production on a catchment during a hydrologic event we therefore consider here that the rainfall is a temporal random process and the only input to the determination of the catchment runoff discharge through the use of eq 1 for simplicity of the analysis the response function in eq 1 is treaded deterministically eq 1 is then regarded as a stochastic equation with a stochastic input and therefore a stochastic output it should be noted that linearity involved in modelling of the rainfall runoff response of a catchment increases with the catchment area e g minshall 1960 wang et al 1981 robinson et al 1995 where this implies that the linear rainfall runoff transformation eq 1 prevails in large catchments the stochastic eq 1 suggests that the temporal heterogeneity in rainfall rate results in temporal random perturbations in runoff discharge as such eq 1 might constitute a basis for characterizing the evolutionary spectrum of runoff discharge using the representation theorem which is the focus of this work to do that we further consider that the rainfall perturbation process can be quantified completely by the langevin equation of the form e g north and cahalan 1981 north et al 1993 2a dq dt q τ 0 ξ t subject to the initial condition 2b q 0 0 where q is the rainfall perturbation τ 0 is the characteristic time scale and ξ t is a zero mean random forcing which is stationary in the section that follows the stochastic analysis of runoff discharge builds on the spectral representation approach of priestley 1965 3 response spectrum following priestley 1965 the perturbed random quantities in eq 1 are represented as fourier stieltjes representations 3 q t θ q t ω e i ω t dz ξ ω 4 q t θ q t ω e i ω t dz ξ ω where q is the fluctuations in runoff discharge ω is the frequency θq t ω and θq t ω denote the modulating functions of the rainfall and runoff discharge processes respectively and zξ ω is an orthogonal random process with 5 e dz ξ 2 s ξ ξ ω d ω in eq 5 sξξ ω is defined as the spectrum of ξ process note that the representation of q or q does not impose the restriction on stationary assumption substitution of eqs 3 and 4 into convolution integral eq 1 yields 6 θ q t ω e i ω t dz ξ ω 0 t h t s θ q s ω e i ω s dz ξ ω ds interchanging the order of integration and by the uniqueness of the representation theorem the modulating functions of the discharge variation and the rainfall perturbations are related by 7 θ q t ω 0 t h t s θ q s ω e i ω t s ds it follows from using representation theorem for q eq 4 along with eq 7 that 8 σ q 2 t e q t q t θ q t ω 2 e dz ξ t dz ξ t s qq t ω d ω where represents the complex conjugate sqq t ω denotes the evolutionary power spectrum of q process priestley 1965 a generalization of the power spectrum for a stationary random process defined by 9 s qq t ω θ q t ω 2 s ξ ξ ω which states that once h t for the linear system is known the output spectrum can be forecasted for any given input spectrum the θq t ω 2 expression in eq 9 which is termed the transfer function priestley 1965 describes the amount of amplitude damping attenuation between input and output at any given frequency stationarity homogeneity of a noise process in eq 2a implies that each realization can be represented by e g lumley and panofsky 1964 priestley 1965 10 ξ t e i ω t dz ξ ω the modulating function of rainfall process can then be evaluated by substituting eqs 3 and 10 into eq 2 as 11 θ q t ω τ 0 υ 1 e υ τ λ where υ 1 iλ λ ωτ 0 and τ ωt as such the rainfall perturbation admits a representation of the form 12 q t τ 0 υ e i τ e τ λ dz ξ ω by the orthogonality of zξ ω in eq 3 and use of eq 11 the evolutionary power spectrum of rainfall process sqq ω can be written as 13 s qq t ω θ q t ω 2 s ξ ξ ω τ 0 2 1 2 e τ λ cos τ e 2 τ λ 1 λ 2 s ξ ξ ω the behavior of rainfall spectrum with respect to dimensionless time for different values of characteristic rainfall time scale constant τ 0 implied by eq 13 is demonstrated in fig 1 the figure shows that the rainfall rate approaches an asymptotic value faster for small values of τ 0 than for larger values which therefore produces a small rainfall spectrum variability for small values of the characteristic time scale in addition stochastic rainfall processes become stationary at large times and the asymptotic value of the power spectra are related to the characteristic time scales of the processes the implication of this is that the stationary assumption may provide a good approximation for rainfall process at large time to evaluate eq 9 explicitly the response function h t must be specified for this analysis two types of response functions are used namely the exponential response function in maloszewski and zuber 1982 14 h t 1 τ m exp t τ m and the gamma response function in kirchner et al 2000 2001 and godsey et al 2010 15 h t α τ m α t α 1 γ α exp α t τ m where τm represents the catchment mean travel time constant α is the shape parameter and γ x denotes the incomplete gamma function of argument x the catchment travel time is referred to as the time spent by water particles injected through rainfall in traveling through a catchment up to a control section 3 1 exponential response function the exponential response function is the most commonly employed in practical applications by far mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 substituting eqs 11 and 14 into eq 7 produces 16 θ q t ω τ 0 υ 1 ρ 1 e ρ t λ λ μ e ρ t e υ τ λ which leads eq 9 eventually to 17 s qq t ω τ 0 2 1 γ 1 γ 2 1 2 cos τ η 2 η 2 2 2 λ λ μ γ 1 γ 2 η 2 η 1 cos τ μ sin τ η 2 2 η 1 η 2 λ 2 λ μ 2 γ 1 η 1 η 2 2 s ξ ξ ω where ρ 1 iμ μ ωτm t t τm γ 1 1 λ 2 γ 2 1 μ 2 η 1 exp τ λ η 2 exp t the spectrum of runoff discharge derived in eq 17 is plotted against the dimensionless frequency in fig 2 for various values of the ratio of mean travel time τm to rainfall characteristic time scale τ 0 which shows the strong decay of the runoff spectrum with high frequencies the figure indicates that the runoff spectrum is insensitive to low frequency variations in the rainfall and high frequency variations are attenuated in the runoff discharge series implying that the convolution integral eq 1 or a linear reservoir system behaves as a low pass filter this kind of high frequency filtering for groundwater flow systems subject to recharges was reported in the literature e g gelhar 1974 duffy and gelhar 1985 jin and duffy 1994 molénat et al 1999 zhang and schilling 2004 jimenez martınez et al 2013 fig 2 also indicates that for a system with a small mean travel time a quick response to the input the variation in rainfall will induce high variation in runoff discharge this implies that the mean travel time decreases the persistence of runoff discharge fluctuations it can be shown an increase in runoff discharge spectrum with a larger value of τ 0 through eq 17 eq 7 reveals that the modulating functions of rainfall and runoff processes are positively correlated a larger value of τ 0 parameter leads to a larger spectrum variability of the rainfall field see fig 1 and in turn a larger spectrum variability of runoff discharge field 3 2 gamma response function the shape parameterα in eq 15 reflects the heterogeneity in the flow path lengths and velocities of catchments godsey et al 2010 note that the forms of eqs 14 and 15 are precisely equivalent in the case when α 1 it is therefore of interest to investigate the influence of shape parameter on the runoff discharge spectra by comparing results obtained from using the exponential and gamma response functions for simplicity we choose α 2 e g godsey et al 2010 in eq 15 i e 18 h t 4 τ m 2 t exp 2 t τ m for evaluating the runoff discharge spectrum in eq 9 combining this with eqs 11 and 7 gives 19 θ q t ω 4 τ 0 υ e ϕ t ψ 1 ψ 2 and correspondingly through eq 9 20 s qq t ω 16 τ 0 2 γ 1 e 4 t ψ 3 2 2 t 1 ψ 4 2 τ ψ 5 ψ 2 ψ 2 2 4 μ 2 ψ 4 8 μ ψ 5 s ξ ξ ω where ϕ 2 iμ and expressions for ψ 1 ψ 5 are given respectively in the appendix the runoff discharge spectra resulting from the exponential and gamma response functions are display in fig 3 as a function of frequency the figure indicates the reduction in runoff discharge spectrum variability with an increasing α this implies that the temporal variability of runoff discharge induced by a non stationary rainfall process persists longer for small values of the shape parameter 4 concluding remarks in study of the rainfall runoff process at the catchment scale the catchment is viewed as a block box system the random non stationary input fluctuating quantities in rainfall to the system can be described by a stochastic differential equation of the langevin type and the output to the system runoff discharge is related to the input by a convolution integral on a continuous time scale based on fourier stieltjes representation approach a frequency domain solution is developed to describe the spectral response characteristics of catchments subject to temporal fluctuations in rainfall this allows to the evaluation of the influence of controlling parameters such as the characteristic time scale of rainfall process and mean travel time constant on the variability of runoff discharge it is found that since the characteristic time scale of rainfall process is sensitive to rainfall rate the rainfall rate will be reached a constant value fast for a small characteristic time scale which reduce the variation of rainfall and in turn the variation of runoff discharge in addition the catchment mean travel time plays the role in smoothing out the runoff discharge variability the catchment exhibits a low pass filter in the frequency domain which attenuates high frequency variations in the rainfall input acknowledgements the work underlying this

7372,as a key policy tool water diplomacy offers greater political engagement in the cooperative management of shared water a range of initiatives has been dedicated to this end almost invariably oriented around the interactions of nation states crucially however practitioners of water diplomacy also need to address water governance at sub state levels as a political multi level and normative field peace and conflict research offers a pluralism of approaches designed to bring actors together at all levels drawing upon this research this paper offers new focal points for water diplomacy that can enhance its policy effectiveness and enrich its underlying academic current more specifically it presents three hitherto undervalued tools for water diplomacy at the interstate level to uncover the rich body of political norms that bind states to shared understandings of acceptable practice around water at the intrastate level to incorporate ethnography of water users and civil society groups responses to state led waterworks projects and at the communal level to employ disaggregated georeferenced data on water resources in conflict prone areas taken together these analytical tools provide a multi faceted political gauge of the dynamics of water diplomacy and add vital impetus to develop water diplomacy across multiple levels of policy engagement keywords water diplomacy peace conflict policy tools 1 introduction water is the lifeblood of human civilisation upon which core physiological functioning agriculture and industry depend water has also been the facilitator of nation building and regional cooperation for all its worth however water is not immune to diplomatic tensions water transcends borders and groups of people be they located at the international intrastate or communal levels indeed 310 river basins cross boundaries of two or more nation states as such it is a politically precarious resource while cooperation has been the norm around transboundary water at the interstate level sub state levels have witnessed rising tensions among water users as non state actors and civil society groups oppose one another and the central government over waterworks projects and as communal groups compete for dwindling water supplies in pastoral areas water diplomacy the dynamic practice of negotiating ways to manage shared water resources promises a means to uphold cooperation and preclude water tensions from escalating into armed conflict three characteristics of water diplomacy are imperative to this end yet too often undervalued in research and practice first water diplomacy is inherently political diplomacy as conventionally understood is the art of managing interpersonal relations typically international relations by government officials this intimately ties it to politics to date however there is a relative dearth of scholarly insight on water diplomacy in the social sciences with much literature deriving instead from the natural and physical sciences second in theory water diplomacy is relevant to all levels of water management given that negotiations over shared water occur at multiple levels yet in practice existing policy tools of water diplomacy focus primarily on interstate interactions while undeniably important the interstate level should be complemented with lower sub state levels of analysis particularly when water diplomacy pertains to non state actors third water diplomacy is fundamentally normatively driven in that it aims not simply to understand water cooperation and conflict but rather to cultivate sustainable and peaceful solutions for all water users this characteristic is frequently overlooked in more technical approaches to water diplomacy peace and conflict research speaks directly to the three core characteristics of water diplomacy as a field peace and conflict research is normatively driven to contribute knowledge of relevance for the prevention of violence and building sustainable peace the field thus contributes to water diplomacy in three key ways 1 it enhances knowledge of existing political facets of water diplomacy near to all theories and empirical strategies employed by peace researchers place primacy on politics and are well versed in highlighting the linkages between politics peace and water to illustrate since 2000 at least 30 articles appearing in the main journal of the field journal of peace research explicitly addressed the link between water and peace or conflict in their theoretical or empirical focus 1 we searched the journal s electronically accessible articles using nine phrases river river cooperation water water cooperation drought drought related violence river conflict river basin conflict water conflict results were excluded where water was only mentioned in passing without being a major focus 1 2 as a multidisciplinary and multilevel field it is equipped to analyse the politics of water across a range of levels from interstate to intrastate and communal interactions its theoretical assumptions and policy recommendations incorporate multidisciplinary insights from political science and international relations sociology anthropology geography and economics resulting in a rich view of the multifaceted socio political and ecological landscape of water diplomacy adopting peace and conflict insights thereby contributes to the inclusiveness of water diplomacy 3 the field can advance the tools of water diplomacy in a normative direction towards more sustainable and robust peace around water initiatives for conflict prevention conflict resolution and environmental peacebuilding are frequently endorsed in the field to which efforts to strengthen mechanisms for water sharing are a fitting complement in light of the many possible contributions of peace and conflict research this paper proposes three tools that collectively speak to the political multilevel and normative nature of water diplomacy the first tool is to compile a norm inventory of existing political norms around water governance this is recommended for the interstate level of water diplomacy with a focus on better understanding the political operational codes by which nation states behave so as to strengthen cooperation between them the second tool is to use ethnography and field data which illuminates the political social and cultural backgrounds of sub state water users this speaks to political relations at an intrastate level of state society interactions that is between the central government and non state actors representing sub state groups understanding the local contexts and underlying issues of water sharing is vital to creating more sustainable water cooperation at the intrastate level the third tool is to use disaggregated and georeferenced data to shed light on variations of water and conflict risk within countries through greater levels of empirical disaggregation we can better identify specific locations of tension and protest around water and so try to forestall potential conflict in communal areas this paper aims to provide a review of relevant scholarly and policy approaches to water diplomacy and to widen and deepen the practice through insights from peace and conflict research as such the paper is structured around a key question how can peace and conflict research inform and advance existing approaches to water diplomacy the first section reviews scholarly literature on water diplomacy as derived from different theoretical and methodological approaches that highlights the need for political and multilevel approaches the following section unpacks the existing policy tools of water diplomacy building on this toolbox we subsequently introduce three tools essential to advancing water diplomacy 2 existing scholarship on water diplomacy prevailing literature on water conflict cooperation and security has been foundational to the birth of water diplomacy this literature has sought to establish that water is a vital yet diminishing resource which risks increasing competition over its quality quantity and control water diplomacy is considered a key instrument to achieve water security a common goal of both policy and research yet much of the academic literature is conceptually expansive and at times apolitical in its understanding of conflict and cooperation this is perhaps unsurprising given that the majority of water scholarship both generally and that which looks to the security side of water derives from the physical and applied sciences cook and bakker 2012 clearly highlight this distribution in their study of 95 articles on water security strikingly their findings convey that a water security discourse is most salient in the fields of water resources environmental science and engineering these studies approach water from a hydrological or technical perspective with focus on the quantity and quality of water supply and the adaptability of water infrastructure for flood protection waste water treatment or hydropower generation water security also features to a lesser extent in geoscience agronomy geography social science and public health the limited number of social science articles is especially intriguing given that the very process of securitizing water and the ensuing diplomacy needed to avert possible conflict is inherently political in character 2 1 bringing the politics into water diplomacy perhaps in recognition of this lacuna water diplomacy is slowly being informed by a critical hydropolitics literature which problematizes apolitical approaches and highlights the power asymmetries of many river basins transboundary water discourse is of growing interest here in part reflecting the foucauldian idea of observing power relations through language this body of literature departs from the earlier work of turton and henwood 2002 to be particularly critical of viewing water as a technical managerial problem that can be improved through apolitical interventions earle et al 2015 rather power asymmetries and politics should not be neglected as interstate politics often suppress the potential for cooperation where states capture a disproportionate control of a watercourse or maintain asymmetry zeitoun and warner 2006 critical hydropolitics acknowledges the complexities of power in transboundary water governance where a basin hegemon may bend internationally accepted legal principles of cooperation to wield power cascão and zeitoun 2010 mirumachi and allan 2007 an institutional approach to water diplomacy also brings in a political dimension to focus on mandates and functions of river basin organisations rbos and legal mechanisms the approach assumes that organisations with political legal and managerial mandates would be best equipped to govern transboundary water where human financial and technical capacities are needed schmeier 2012 emphasises that institutional designs and mechanisms matter in determining the effectiveness of rbos interstate politics as shaped by the national interest of basin states can overshadow the work of well functioning and technically capable rbos as illustrated in the case of the mekong river commission dore et al 2012 suhardiman et al 2012 hence when hydropolitics and other complexities in international basins emerge water diplomacy interventions should approach institution building and rbos carefully norm based studies offer further insight into the politico legal workings of water diplomacy to date most scholarship that has considered norms around water derive from law in peacetime and in conflict mccaffrey 2001 mcintyre 2007 rieu clarke et al 2017 and rocha loures and rieu clarke 2013 among others have offered excellent and systematic analyses of the various legal norms of cooperation that encase transboundary water sources as enshrined in frameworks such as the un and unece watercourse conventions salman 2001 traces the influence of such frameworks on transboundary water agreements these studies present a thorough overview of the legal normative landscape of transboundary water governance and principles of international water law iwl that can be applied in water diplomacy but they place only limited focus on non iwl norms as found in rights declarations and general principles of law as well as the non codified intersubjective beliefs embedded in state discourse and military manuals which are temporally more variable than law as we illustrate later expanding norm analysis beyond iwl uncovers a rich body of moral standards for water sharing which can be invoked by practitioners during water negotiations 2 2 the multi level nature of water diplomacy there is a long standing scholarly divide between opening and closing the arena of water diplomacy to actors at different levels some problematize the overcrowding of water negotiations while others call for broader participation huntjens et al 2015 the framework of integrated water resource management iwrm has long advocated multi level multi stakeholder dialogue that is inclusive of a broad range of actors such as third party mediators non state actors academics and civil society groups mitchell 1990 in analysing three cases of multi stakeholder dialogue huntjens et al 2015 illustrate the benefit of an actor inclusive approach to the negotiation process through introducing deadlines and public pressure to complement more official diplomatic track i engagements on the mekong river basin dore 2014 p 208 similarly affirms that an infusion of high quality multi track deliberation would improve water governance by complementing the track i negotiations a multi level multi stakeholder approach is not however without its shortcomings warner 2006 p 19 cautions that while msps multi stakeholder platforms may usefully settle disputes in the author s experience msps do not generally solve conflicts in fact msps themselves can even be a player in conflict through producing multi sectoral coalitions actors willingness to participate in dialogue and the quality of that participation are highly variable and contingent on the circumstances of each negotiation process warner 2006 as we convey later using ethnographic research to discern the salient demands of sub state actors is of great value here in improving the efficacy of multi stakeholder dialogue 2 3 the quantitative peace literature on water much of the existing peace and conflict literature on water conflict and cooperation employs large n research that is cross case analysis of a large number of cases usually involving statistical analysis tools as with any methodological approach quantitative analysis alone is no panacea to existing deficiencies in water diplomacy research yet it provides valuable political insights into water diplomacy by testing factors that facilitate violent conflict and or peaceful cooperation recent research has even started to incorporate subnational units into the analysis such as political organisations communal groups and other non state actors several high quality datasets on water conflict and cooperation have emerged in the last two decades the transboundary freshwater dispute database wolf 1999 and other data projects based at oregon state university e g yoffe wolf and giordano 2003 have set the foundation here complementing these are other datasets that examine different units of analysis the ircc for instance describes yearly water related conflictive and cooperative events between riparian countries kalbhenn and bernauer 2012 and the waricc codes distinct domestic water related events by different actors bernauer et al 2012 other data collection efforts cover issues related to water disputes more indirectly for example social unrest salehyan et al 2012 non state conflict von uexkull and pettersson 2013 and territorial disagreements between countries frederick hensel and macaulay 2017 numerous quantitative studies show that violent conflict between countries is not related to water issues although sharing rivers and groundwater can generate tensions between countries or regional stakeholders such incompatibilities usually lead to bilateral or multilateral agreements instead of armed conflicts enhanced data quality has led to a nuanced understanding of this dynamic demonstrating that interstate disputes over water seldom turn violent gleditsch et al 2006 furlong et al 2006 tir and ackerman 2009 while many interstate conflicts involve border disputes country borders that follow rivers or watersheds are less likely to be contested goemans and schultz 2017 even upstream downstream power asymmetries have little to no effect on conflict behaviour beck et al 2014 this is in line with other studies that find no support for water wars bernauer and böhmelt 2014 devlin and hendrix 2014 although water scarcity does increase the probability of river claims i e explicit contention between riparian states the majority of such claims lead to diplomatic settlements and future negotiation and cooperation brochmann and hensel 2009 dinar et al 2015 that is peacefully sharing a river is the norm between states in particular international third party involvement is crucial in facilitating diplomatic success around river claims owsiak and mitchell 2017 these findings reinforce water diplomacy as an important tool that is lifting bilateral interstate disagreements to the international or regional stage brings them to an arena where agreements and institutionalised peaceful norms have been established moving beyond the interstate level studies on intrastate conflict place strong emphasis on water availability intrastate conflict refers to an incompatibility between the government of a state and another actor within a country cross case research at this level focuses on disputes with a persistent incompatibility between the actors involved and which also generate fatalities ranging from a rebellion with a small number of fatalities to a civil war with a high number allansson et al 2017 when combined with data on rivers or country statistics on water scarcity there are no clear empirical links between water and intrastate conflict raleigh and urdal 2007 furthermore there is evidence that democratic institutions are important buffers through periods of scarcity and thereby potentially prevent the outbreak of violent disputes gizelis and wooden 2010 sadoff et al 2017 tir and stinnett 2012 utilising various precipitation measures recent quantitative research has taken an even more disaggregated approach to study the relationship between water access and intrastate civil conflict as well as communal conflict significant water shortages are not related to the risk of violent intrastate wars in africa theisen et al 2012 or asia wischnath and buhaug 2014 to the contrary hendrix and salehyan 2012 find that increased rainfall is linked to a higher risk of fighting more recent research on drought however contends that water scarcity is associated with violent conflict when important infrastructure is lacking detges 2016 or when drought stricken areas largely depend on agriculture as their main source of income von uexkull et al 2016 von uexkull 2014 still evidence from analyses of communal conflict is more mixed while some studies indicate that unfavourable rainfall deviation is a potential driver of communal conflict fjelde and von uexkull 2012 others are more careful about establishing links between shocks in precipitation patterns and violent conflict böhmelt et al 2014 o loughlin et al 2014 to reach greater consensus future quantitative studies especially on communal conflict would benefit from more reliable and varied hydrological data given the findings from the quantitative peace literature on water there are three main avenues for enhancing the data that informs water diplomacy first research using disaggregated measures needs to address data problems in regard to reliability and validity and collaborate more closely with other more hydrologic based water research second focusing only on precipitation data will not suffice instead water access needs to be analysed from several entry points such as rivers dams or other irrigation solutions like boreholes to understand the various locations of possible contention that water negotiations need to consider lastly while peace research typically focuses on links between conflict and water scarcity more studies need to address the potential for cooperation and peace building these shortcomings notwithstanding as we highlight later in the paper a quantitative based policy tool holds promise for advancing water diplomacy and providing deeper political analysis of water conflict and cooperation 3 unpacking the existing toolbox for water diplomacy existing policy tools dedicated to interstate water diplomacy face great challenges with rising demand and dwindling supply of fresh water exacerbating the problem is the threat of global climate change which has already begun to undermine existing interstate sharing arrangements of international rivers gleick 2009 swain 2012 clearly tools for sharing water among countries cannot be guided by a single golden rule as the value demand and supply of water varies greatly between regions swain 2004 this given a one size fits all approach to water diplomacy is simply not feasible in spite of water s vital significance for peace security and development united nations security council 2016 available tools on how to transform tensions over transboundary waters into cooperation remain quite weak and limited in range earle et al 2010 external financial and technical assistance can facilitate interstate water diplomacy the funding and technical support offered by international agencies is regularly used as an incentive for disputing states to agree on water cooperation priscoli 1994 indeed many developing countries lack sufficient financial resources and technical knowledge to unilaterally undertake large water projects a weakness which encourages basin countries to cooperate in order to increase the benefits of shared water with external support disputing states hope to further develop irrigation hydropower and or flood control projects with greater net benefits than that which could have been achieved through state centric development alone to prevent conflicts over water international agencies also invest in efforts to provide enhanced systematic training to water professionals in developing countries sadoff et al 2017 the deutsche gesellschaft für internationale zusammenarbeit giz a leading donor agency in this sector identifies water cooperation and governance as one of its main strategic areas and supports the development of the water resource knowledge base giz 2014 institutional training programs take officials away from their usual context to see water issues from a new and more cooperative perspective these professionals are later asked to help facilitate negotiations over disputed water resources in their home countries home grown actors not only help external negotiators but can also set an example for their colleagues on how to best cooperate over shared water pohl et al 2014 for international agencies and other actors to be more effective in interstate water negotiations they need to coordinate and mutually demonstrate credible long term commitment to cross sector and transnational cooperation the multitude of international stakeholders in negotiations can sometimes inhibit efforts to bring disputing countries together in the absence of an overarching international organisation willing and able to coordinate this task an informal network of international agencies engaged in inter state water sharing issues could fulfil a similar role such coordinated international engagement should act early as interstate water sharing disputes become harder to diffuse once they gain traction and are securitised at present it is difficult for the international community to gather sufficient political support among states to set up anticipatory water conflict management mechanisms facilitating future interstate water cooperation necessitates greater awareness of the importance of shared water resources among high ranking foreign and development policy makers pohl and swain 2017 and a recognition of existing norms that bind them together to this end while international agencies can play an instrumental role in facilitating behaviour over shared water resources they hold only limited engagement in intrastate water conflicts which are not only more common but also more violent in nature allansson et al 2017 for reasons of national security almost all the countries in the world resist external engagement in their internal water sharing issues further the inherent insecurity of post colonial states in asia africa and the middle east does not provide much scope for existing water diplomacy tools to flourish in intrastate water disputes there is an apprehension in these countries that international agencies may insert so called outside or western agendas that are not in the best interest of their nation such as by putting global environmental concerns above domestic economic development the dominant tool to address intrastate water disputes at present is through the judiciary of a state the judiciary is often tasked with adjudicating disputes as it is hard for the central government to choose between different water users in a country without being seen as partial to one of the users judicial decisions promise more impartiality but have nonetheless been regularly challenged by domestic stakeholders in countries like india and pakistan this has borne intractable water disputes this given international agencies try to play a supportive role in building the capacity of domestic water institutions to improve water governance they also contribute by training water professionals in water scarce countries not only on the complexities of water development but also the fundamentals of negotiation and mediation beyond institution building and knowledge transfer however international agencies would profit greatly from better data both ethnographic and quantitative on the political dynamics of water interactions within a state 4 politicising the toolbox introducing three peace and conflict tools for water diplomacy drawing insights from peace and conflict research we expand the toolbox of water diplomacy to place sharper focus on the political mechanisms underpinning water conflict and cooperation in the following section we introduce three political tools across three levels at the interstate level to compile a norm inventory that exposes the underlying political expectations that guide state behaviour around water sharing and at the intrastate and communal levels to incorporate ethnographic data to elucidate the everyday lives and needs of water users and disaggregated georeferenced data to advance quantitative insights respectively all tools aim to more proactively build capacity and knowledge of risk prone areas for water diplomacy rather than addressing water tensions after they erupt 4 1 interstate tool a norm inventory for water at the interstate level of water diplomacy there exists a rich body of norms that dictate acceptable behaviour around shared water this body hereby termed a normative code has progressively evolved around water in the past sixty years to prescribe high standards for water sharing and denounce conflict around water as morally objectionable fig 1 illustrates the main sources from which this code derives as organised into two spheres a juridical sphere of international water law general principles of law and rights declarations and a discursive sphere of leader discourse ministerial reports and military documents any effort to comprehensively understand the context in which water diplomacy is conducted should take stock of operative norms from all sources and across both spheres the discursive sphere is located at the core of the code as norms around water are not necessarily contingent on law but rather may pre exist any formal codification the juridical sphere on the other hand typically builds off existing normative beliefs thus is depicted as an outer sphere 4 1 1 the juridical sphere of norms norms of international water law iwl are commonly acknowledged by water diplomacy initiatives three of the most salient iwl norms include 1 equitable and reasonable use using water in an equitable manner based on existing and potential uses alternative water sources and population needs of riparians 2 no significant harm responsible water use that does not adversely impact others and 3 peaceful water dispute resolution resolving potential conflict through joint negotiation or conciliation by a third party these three norms hold influence in a significant array of basin wide agreements and are recognised as an important legal institutional instrument of water diplomacy conca et al 2006 pohl et al 2014 complementing norms of iwl however are the often undervalued general and rights based legal norms two of the most promising here for water diplomacy are good neighbourliness a general disposition to be affable to others and reconcile the national interest with those of neighbouring states united nations 1979 yale law journal 1973 pop 1991 and the right to life the notion that all humans have an inalienable right to life of which water is a vital requirement the strength of general and rights based norms for water diplomacy derives less from their legal status which is often disputed and more from their normative underpinnings good neighbourliness is a confidence building norm emphasising the longstanding track record of neighbourliness around water offers both inspiration and political pressure for riparian states in their water sharing indeed the historical record has been remarkably silent on armed conflict over water especially at the international level brochmann and gleditsch 2012 barnaby 2009 if a country were to deviate from good neighbourliness around water a water diplomat could reasonably employ moral persuasion and or shaming to prompt it to reinstate good water sharing and uphold its image as a civilised and neighbourly member of the international community risse ropp and sikkink 1999 likewise the need to protect water for life is deeply embedded in what constitutes a respected or civilised state water features in a range of human rights instruments implicitly if not explicitly as indispensable to life and its many essentials un 1983 1989 un cescr 1995 un cescr 2000 scanlon et al 2004 in february 2017 pope francis of the holy see endorsed this view declaring that t he right to water is essential for the survival of persons and decisive for the future of humanity pope francis 2017 as spiritual leader to 1 3 billion people the pope holds moral power in shaping popular sentiment water negotiations would do well to draw upon the legal and popular connection between water and rights 4 1 2 the discursive sphere of norms moving beyond law an obvious indicator for norms is discourse the way people talk about managing shared water practitioners of water diplomacy would benefit from taking stock of public statements by key decision makers notably political and military leaders and their representatives as well as ministerial reports within a river basin the aim is to detect whether decision makers feel there are normative constraints on how they manage water with other states and if so to emphasise such constraints in future negotiations for instance the landmark un security council 2016 debate on water peace and security featured clear normative rhetoric among state representatives that conflict around water was unacceptable discourse can also provide early warning signs of changing beliefs around water which more formal and temporally fixed legal instruments cannot immediately capture in 2015 the prime minister of india narendra modi spoke to a meeting of the indus plenary declaring that blood and water cannot flow together at the same time this was a firm ultimatum toward pakistan that unless the latter halted its involvement in the kashmir territorial violence india would stop the flow of the indus river such discourse diverged from the usual good neighbourliness between the two countries over water in this way discourse can reveal much about the emotional state of leaders and more accurately reflect the current normative climate of a basin military manuals including rules of engagement roes provide a valuable means to discern underlying military attitudes toward water roes in the early 20th century typically included water as a possible method of sabotage for e g us office of strategic services 1944 by contrast the more recent rules of engagement for operation iraqi freedom explicitly condemned the targeting of public works such as dams us department of defense 2005 roes are important for water diplomacy under the assumption that if militaries view water resources as warranting protection then that may affect their decisions around water that said not all bureaucracies within a state have equal say on water diplomacy legro 1997 37 contends that a bureaucracy s influence varies according to its organizational salience militaries he claims have high salience on matters of security as they generally have monopoly control over expertise in the use of force and the time periods for altering prearranged plans are limited as such their doctrines and rules are important to consider as part of a norm inventory for water diplomacy especially where water negotiations occur in the context of armed conflict 4 2 intrastate tool ethnography to inform multi track dialogue moving to the intrastate level there is an enduring tension between state centric track i diplomacy and inclusive multi track dialogue over whether the opening up of water diplomacy to multi stakeholder forums is beneficial and or necessary it is impossible to assert the superiority of one approach over another in all cases of water diplomacy however intrastate multi stakeholder tools have clear advantages for one intrastate tools for water diplomacy employ knowledge and methods designed to acquire greater insights into intra basin politics and social and economic instabilities historical current and prospective water disputes in a river basin often involve non state actors that lie beyond the conventional water sector of state agencies for instance the fierce civil society opposition to large dams in nepal in the mid 1990s can be better understood as a product of the divisive political context that drove the country into civil war dixit and gyawali 2010 in this way domestic politics can shape the prevailing narrative on dams and development likewise a conspicuous absence of community responses to large dams in lao pdr can be understood as a product of the stringent restrictions on civil liberties human rights watch 2016 ethnography and other forms of qualitative data from fieldwork speak directly to the need to understand intrastate politics and instabilities thick description and field data gained through interviews participant observation and surveys are indispensable to this end participant observation the core method of ethnography involves an immersive approach to research that entails cultural social and linguistic proficiency within the field of study and close familiarity with the research subjects whom the researcher aims to observe applying this to water participant observation grants researchers access to the everyday lives of water users and their social groups such immersion enables a researcher to gain new perspectives that may not be obvious to outsiders water users as with individuals in other social contexts often have layered relationships that overlap along material cultural and kinship lines the ideal norms and practices of each layer can challenge individuals in times where one of their relationships overlays or clashes with another bourdieu 1990 understanding these complex relationships can be important in the face of or to prevent intrastate conflict over water at a broader level ethnographic fieldwork has gained traction in peace and conflict research to explain the interpersonal interactions and micro foundations of conflicts such studies require deep understanding of civilians and combatants including their daily lives within peace and conflict research serious efforts are made to unpack the different actors influencing a state s foreign policy making instead of treating the state as a unitary actor hudson 2005 singer 1961 adopting an ethnographic tool for water diplomacy thus promises greater insights into the underlying motivations and incompatibilities within a state which may not be obvious with a state centric approach to water diplomacy alone ethnographic research on social and political groups within a state including non state armed actors can be useful to map out the various stakeholders in multi track dialogue the security situation in some international river basins requires an examination of the role of non state actors who are either militant or political particularly in river basins that have experienced armed contestation suhardiman et al 2017 to illustrate navigating the water sector in myanmar has benefited from understanding its fragmented local governance and intrastate conflict dynamics social groups are divided along ethnic and religious lines with each group holding its own vision for waterworks projects in their respective region kachin news group 2010 karen rivers watch 2016 the international finance corporation 2017 a leading supporter of developing myanmar s hydropower potential included a chapter in its annual report on the relevance of the country s peace efforts for its hydropower in myanmar more than 20 non state armed groups are currently in operation some actively rebel against the state while others no longer rebel but still hold arms international crisis group 2011 the relationships between rebel groups and the state should be studied in relation to the development of large scale waterworks projects in order to inform dialogue in the water sector simpson 2013 addressing the concerns of non state actors who often represent the needs of farming and fishing communities in developing countries reflects the normative nature of water diplomacy public participation has been promoted in water diplomacy as empowering river communities by strengthening their capacity and engagement ethnographic field research can provide valuable input for practitioners on how to best accommodate groups and their particular visions for instance empirics from fieldwork in the mekong river basin reveal the development and environmental challenges facing river communities which are coupled with social and environmental risks posed by large dams on the main stream of the mekong river these challenges are one of the main reasons for international and local resistance to hydropower projects in the region öjendal et al 2012 the mekong river commission the rbo mandated with governing the mekong has allowed a limited level of grass roots participation as part of its informal consultation process which enables civil society groups to provide input to the higher decision making body the council of ministers gerlak and haefner 2017 in similar fashion the nile basin initiative a multilateral body for water cooperation among nile riparians and the lake victoria basin commission a rbo for lake victoria in east central africa facilitate public participation through various activities schmeier 2012 4 3 communal tool disaggregated georeferenced data to identify sub state water tensions water disputes have neither led to violence between states nor have such disputes ignited civil wars peace research can offer much needed tools for water diplomacy when moving to a more disaggregated level of analysis such as the communal level the most robust empirical evidence for an association between armed disputes and water issues relates to cases involving subnational political actors such analysis requires a focus on highly disaggregated data as peace and conflict scholarship moves to more fine grained water events data collection efforts should be made to incorporate available hydrologic data moreover there is enormous potential for greater collaboration on data between peace scholars and water experts particularly on the communal level of water related conflict and cooperation research and policy analysis alike often employ country level indicators to inform discussions on water diplomacy cross case comparisons and single case studies while such an approach has many positive aspects this type of analysis should ideally be complemented by more disaggregation to illustrate figs 2 and 3 employ identical data on upstream water risk gassert et al 2014 and instances of protest over food and water salehyan et al 2012 while fig 2 depicts country averages of the data fig 3 disaggregates the water data to sub basin level units which allow for a more magnified analysis when conducting research on the links between water risk and protests over water or food security country statistics are valuable but miss a lot of sub state variation that is needed to detect and address the exact communal location of a dispute rather much more information can be gleaned when moving to smaller levels of analysis kenya is frequently identified as an example of high investment in rural and urban water provision yet the country has frequently witnessed violent communal conflict such as conflicts between farmers and pastoralists and between members of different ethnic groups in fig 4 the location of wells or boreholes is overlaid with conflict events involving two ethnic groups in north eastern kenya every conflict event indicates at least one fatality and some include more than ten fatalities although the exact links between such conflicts and water shortages ought to be studied further the figure makes apparent that peace research offers potential insights that can already now support policy makers to identify regions that require more focus on within country differences for example as we see in fig 4 there are several areas in this region without any boreholes but a large number of violent communal conflict events likewise there are a few conflict events located near to boreholes that said however practitioners should be wary of interpreting this figure as an empirical reality peace researchers require better water data to enhance their studies and eventually improve the understanding of possible links between water scarcity and conflict of course several dimensions are not covered in fig 4 for instance there is no information about the status of the wells possible problems with pollution other forms of water access and the nature and temporal aspects of the data provided furthermore it is possible that complete data on boreholes and wells is missing these empirical deficiencies make it only more apparent that peace research would greatly benefit from more involvement in projects that collect hydrologic data with better exchange between the natural and social sciences research can more effectively address the questions raised by policymakers moreover in providing insights into conflicts georeferenced data adds a more clearly political dimension to water research 5 conclusion much of the existing hydrological literature overlooks the politics of water even when the political sphere is addressed it often remains secondary in focus theories and empirical strategies in peace and conflict research place primary importance on politics and are adept at highlighting the linkages between politics peace and the environment they also recognise the plurality of actors in the social world by adding to knowledge through qualitative and quantitative lenses peace and conflict research s multi disciplinary and multi method approach contributes to deeper understanding of water issues such as by mapping out important political state and non state actors as well as the interaction between these actors and the international community such insights are needed to support water diplomacy rather than bundling all levels of actors together as one uniform multi stakeholder category there is value in focusing on each constituent level of actors and dynamics in detail much of the existing policy tools on water diplomacy are dedicated to the interstate level adding to this water diplomats would do well to tap into existing norms across both the juridical and discursive spheres of water governance compiling a norm inventory of the river basin in which diplomacy takes place allows diplomats to capitalise and strengthen existing cooperative norms and engage in persuasion or shaming of states who do not live up to prevailing expectations to safeguard water an inventory also enables diplomats to better understand and adapt their activities to changing norms and emotional climates that influence water negotiations one of the core premises of multi level water diplomacy is that water issues cut across different levels of society and affect a number of groups and communities as well as the state yet intergovernmental water negotiations often reflect a disjuncture between state centric water diplomacy and the everyday lives of water users local realities and intrastate conflict are not always considered in interstate water diplomacy this disconnect is all the more amplified when a state conflicts with its society within as is the case during civil wars and protracted insurgencies peace and conflict research acknowledges these social and political dynamics despite taking very different approaches both ethnographic and quantitative data improve the understanding of sub state contexts and dynamics which is imperative for a well coordinated inclusive water diplomacy covering multiple scales of water governance better data within a state can help policy makers ngos and local actors to take more targeted actions clearly more accurate and reliable data can enhance research and policy making future statistical data collection efforts on water issues would especially profit from greater collaboration between peace research and more hydrological studies where applied such synergies will be fruitful in enhancing evidence based policy a key ingredient for successful water diplomacy acknowledgements research for this article has been supported by the unesco category ii international centre for water cooperation stockholm sweden 
7372,as a key policy tool water diplomacy offers greater political engagement in the cooperative management of shared water a range of initiatives has been dedicated to this end almost invariably oriented around the interactions of nation states crucially however practitioners of water diplomacy also need to address water governance at sub state levels as a political multi level and normative field peace and conflict research offers a pluralism of approaches designed to bring actors together at all levels drawing upon this research this paper offers new focal points for water diplomacy that can enhance its policy effectiveness and enrich its underlying academic current more specifically it presents three hitherto undervalued tools for water diplomacy at the interstate level to uncover the rich body of political norms that bind states to shared understandings of acceptable practice around water at the intrastate level to incorporate ethnography of water users and civil society groups responses to state led waterworks projects and at the communal level to employ disaggregated georeferenced data on water resources in conflict prone areas taken together these analytical tools provide a multi faceted political gauge of the dynamics of water diplomacy and add vital impetus to develop water diplomacy across multiple levels of policy engagement keywords water diplomacy peace conflict policy tools 1 introduction water is the lifeblood of human civilisation upon which core physiological functioning agriculture and industry depend water has also been the facilitator of nation building and regional cooperation for all its worth however water is not immune to diplomatic tensions water transcends borders and groups of people be they located at the international intrastate or communal levels indeed 310 river basins cross boundaries of two or more nation states as such it is a politically precarious resource while cooperation has been the norm around transboundary water at the interstate level sub state levels have witnessed rising tensions among water users as non state actors and civil society groups oppose one another and the central government over waterworks projects and as communal groups compete for dwindling water supplies in pastoral areas water diplomacy the dynamic practice of negotiating ways to manage shared water resources promises a means to uphold cooperation and preclude water tensions from escalating into armed conflict three characteristics of water diplomacy are imperative to this end yet too often undervalued in research and practice first water diplomacy is inherently political diplomacy as conventionally understood is the art of managing interpersonal relations typically international relations by government officials this intimately ties it to politics to date however there is a relative dearth of scholarly insight on water diplomacy in the social sciences with much literature deriving instead from the natural and physical sciences second in theory water diplomacy is relevant to all levels of water management given that negotiations over shared water occur at multiple levels yet in practice existing policy tools of water diplomacy focus primarily on interstate interactions while undeniably important the interstate level should be complemented with lower sub state levels of analysis particularly when water diplomacy pertains to non state actors third water diplomacy is fundamentally normatively driven in that it aims not simply to understand water cooperation and conflict but rather to cultivate sustainable and peaceful solutions for all water users this characteristic is frequently overlooked in more technical approaches to water diplomacy peace and conflict research speaks directly to the three core characteristics of water diplomacy as a field peace and conflict research is normatively driven to contribute knowledge of relevance for the prevention of violence and building sustainable peace the field thus contributes to water diplomacy in three key ways 1 it enhances knowledge of existing political facets of water diplomacy near to all theories and empirical strategies employed by peace researchers place primacy on politics and are well versed in highlighting the linkages between politics peace and water to illustrate since 2000 at least 30 articles appearing in the main journal of the field journal of peace research explicitly addressed the link between water and peace or conflict in their theoretical or empirical focus 1 we searched the journal s electronically accessible articles using nine phrases river river cooperation water water cooperation drought drought related violence river conflict river basin conflict water conflict results were excluded where water was only mentioned in passing without being a major focus 1 2 as a multidisciplinary and multilevel field it is equipped to analyse the politics of water across a range of levels from interstate to intrastate and communal interactions its theoretical assumptions and policy recommendations incorporate multidisciplinary insights from political science and international relations sociology anthropology geography and economics resulting in a rich view of the multifaceted socio political and ecological landscape of water diplomacy adopting peace and conflict insights thereby contributes to the inclusiveness of water diplomacy 3 the field can advance the tools of water diplomacy in a normative direction towards more sustainable and robust peace around water initiatives for conflict prevention conflict resolution and environmental peacebuilding are frequently endorsed in the field to which efforts to strengthen mechanisms for water sharing are a fitting complement in light of the many possible contributions of peace and conflict research this paper proposes three tools that collectively speak to the political multilevel and normative nature of water diplomacy the first tool is to compile a norm inventory of existing political norms around water governance this is recommended for the interstate level of water diplomacy with a focus on better understanding the political operational codes by which nation states behave so as to strengthen cooperation between them the second tool is to use ethnography and field data which illuminates the political social and cultural backgrounds of sub state water users this speaks to political relations at an intrastate level of state society interactions that is between the central government and non state actors representing sub state groups understanding the local contexts and underlying issues of water sharing is vital to creating more sustainable water cooperation at the intrastate level the third tool is to use disaggregated and georeferenced data to shed light on variations of water and conflict risk within countries through greater levels of empirical disaggregation we can better identify specific locations of tension and protest around water and so try to forestall potential conflict in communal areas this paper aims to provide a review of relevant scholarly and policy approaches to water diplomacy and to widen and deepen the practice through insights from peace and conflict research as such the paper is structured around a key question how can peace and conflict research inform and advance existing approaches to water diplomacy the first section reviews scholarly literature on water diplomacy as derived from different theoretical and methodological approaches that highlights the need for political and multilevel approaches the following section unpacks the existing policy tools of water diplomacy building on this toolbox we subsequently introduce three tools essential to advancing water diplomacy 2 existing scholarship on water diplomacy prevailing literature on water conflict cooperation and security has been foundational to the birth of water diplomacy this literature has sought to establish that water is a vital yet diminishing resource which risks increasing competition over its quality quantity and control water diplomacy is considered a key instrument to achieve water security a common goal of both policy and research yet much of the academic literature is conceptually expansive and at times apolitical in its understanding of conflict and cooperation this is perhaps unsurprising given that the majority of water scholarship both generally and that which looks to the security side of water derives from the physical and applied sciences cook and bakker 2012 clearly highlight this distribution in their study of 95 articles on water security strikingly their findings convey that a water security discourse is most salient in the fields of water resources environmental science and engineering these studies approach water from a hydrological or technical perspective with focus on the quantity and quality of water supply and the adaptability of water infrastructure for flood protection waste water treatment or hydropower generation water security also features to a lesser extent in geoscience agronomy geography social science and public health the limited number of social science articles is especially intriguing given that the very process of securitizing water and the ensuing diplomacy needed to avert possible conflict is inherently political in character 2 1 bringing the politics into water diplomacy perhaps in recognition of this lacuna water diplomacy is slowly being informed by a critical hydropolitics literature which problematizes apolitical approaches and highlights the power asymmetries of many river basins transboundary water discourse is of growing interest here in part reflecting the foucauldian idea of observing power relations through language this body of literature departs from the earlier work of turton and henwood 2002 to be particularly critical of viewing water as a technical managerial problem that can be improved through apolitical interventions earle et al 2015 rather power asymmetries and politics should not be neglected as interstate politics often suppress the potential for cooperation where states capture a disproportionate control of a watercourse or maintain asymmetry zeitoun and warner 2006 critical hydropolitics acknowledges the complexities of power in transboundary water governance where a basin hegemon may bend internationally accepted legal principles of cooperation to wield power cascão and zeitoun 2010 mirumachi and allan 2007 an institutional approach to water diplomacy also brings in a political dimension to focus on mandates and functions of river basin organisations rbos and legal mechanisms the approach assumes that organisations with political legal and managerial mandates would be best equipped to govern transboundary water where human financial and technical capacities are needed schmeier 2012 emphasises that institutional designs and mechanisms matter in determining the effectiveness of rbos interstate politics as shaped by the national interest of basin states can overshadow the work of well functioning and technically capable rbos as illustrated in the case of the mekong river commission dore et al 2012 suhardiman et al 2012 hence when hydropolitics and other complexities in international basins emerge water diplomacy interventions should approach institution building and rbos carefully norm based studies offer further insight into the politico legal workings of water diplomacy to date most scholarship that has considered norms around water derive from law in peacetime and in conflict mccaffrey 2001 mcintyre 2007 rieu clarke et al 2017 and rocha loures and rieu clarke 2013 among others have offered excellent and systematic analyses of the various legal norms of cooperation that encase transboundary water sources as enshrined in frameworks such as the un and unece watercourse conventions salman 2001 traces the influence of such frameworks on transboundary water agreements these studies present a thorough overview of the legal normative landscape of transboundary water governance and principles of international water law iwl that can be applied in water diplomacy but they place only limited focus on non iwl norms as found in rights declarations and general principles of law as well as the non codified intersubjective beliefs embedded in state discourse and military manuals which are temporally more variable than law as we illustrate later expanding norm analysis beyond iwl uncovers a rich body of moral standards for water sharing which can be invoked by practitioners during water negotiations 2 2 the multi level nature of water diplomacy there is a long standing scholarly divide between opening and closing the arena of water diplomacy to actors at different levels some problematize the overcrowding of water negotiations while others call for broader participation huntjens et al 2015 the framework of integrated water resource management iwrm has long advocated multi level multi stakeholder dialogue that is inclusive of a broad range of actors such as third party mediators non state actors academics and civil society groups mitchell 1990 in analysing three cases of multi stakeholder dialogue huntjens et al 2015 illustrate the benefit of an actor inclusive approach to the negotiation process through introducing deadlines and public pressure to complement more official diplomatic track i engagements on the mekong river basin dore 2014 p 208 similarly affirms that an infusion of high quality multi track deliberation would improve water governance by complementing the track i negotiations a multi level multi stakeholder approach is not however without its shortcomings warner 2006 p 19 cautions that while msps multi stakeholder platforms may usefully settle disputes in the author s experience msps do not generally solve conflicts in fact msps themselves can even be a player in conflict through producing multi sectoral coalitions actors willingness to participate in dialogue and the quality of that participation are highly variable and contingent on the circumstances of each negotiation process warner 2006 as we convey later using ethnographic research to discern the salient demands of sub state actors is of great value here in improving the efficacy of multi stakeholder dialogue 2 3 the quantitative peace literature on water much of the existing peace and conflict literature on water conflict and cooperation employs large n research that is cross case analysis of a large number of cases usually involving statistical analysis tools as with any methodological approach quantitative analysis alone is no panacea to existing deficiencies in water diplomacy research yet it provides valuable political insights into water diplomacy by testing factors that facilitate violent conflict and or peaceful cooperation recent research has even started to incorporate subnational units into the analysis such as political organisations communal groups and other non state actors several high quality datasets on water conflict and cooperation have emerged in the last two decades the transboundary freshwater dispute database wolf 1999 and other data projects based at oregon state university e g yoffe wolf and giordano 2003 have set the foundation here complementing these are other datasets that examine different units of analysis the ircc for instance describes yearly water related conflictive and cooperative events between riparian countries kalbhenn and bernauer 2012 and the waricc codes distinct domestic water related events by different actors bernauer et al 2012 other data collection efforts cover issues related to water disputes more indirectly for example social unrest salehyan et al 2012 non state conflict von uexkull and pettersson 2013 and territorial disagreements between countries frederick hensel and macaulay 2017 numerous quantitative studies show that violent conflict between countries is not related to water issues although sharing rivers and groundwater can generate tensions between countries or regional stakeholders such incompatibilities usually lead to bilateral or multilateral agreements instead of armed conflicts enhanced data quality has led to a nuanced understanding of this dynamic demonstrating that interstate disputes over water seldom turn violent gleditsch et al 2006 furlong et al 2006 tir and ackerman 2009 while many interstate conflicts involve border disputes country borders that follow rivers or watersheds are less likely to be contested goemans and schultz 2017 even upstream downstream power asymmetries have little to no effect on conflict behaviour beck et al 2014 this is in line with other studies that find no support for water wars bernauer and böhmelt 2014 devlin and hendrix 2014 although water scarcity does increase the probability of river claims i e explicit contention between riparian states the majority of such claims lead to diplomatic settlements and future negotiation and cooperation brochmann and hensel 2009 dinar et al 2015 that is peacefully sharing a river is the norm between states in particular international third party involvement is crucial in facilitating diplomatic success around river claims owsiak and mitchell 2017 these findings reinforce water diplomacy as an important tool that is lifting bilateral interstate disagreements to the international or regional stage brings them to an arena where agreements and institutionalised peaceful norms have been established moving beyond the interstate level studies on intrastate conflict place strong emphasis on water availability intrastate conflict refers to an incompatibility between the government of a state and another actor within a country cross case research at this level focuses on disputes with a persistent incompatibility between the actors involved and which also generate fatalities ranging from a rebellion with a small number of fatalities to a civil war with a high number allansson et al 2017 when combined with data on rivers or country statistics on water scarcity there are no clear empirical links between water and intrastate conflict raleigh and urdal 2007 furthermore there is evidence that democratic institutions are important buffers through periods of scarcity and thereby potentially prevent the outbreak of violent disputes gizelis and wooden 2010 sadoff et al 2017 tir and stinnett 2012 utilising various precipitation measures recent quantitative research has taken an even more disaggregated approach to study the relationship between water access and intrastate civil conflict as well as communal conflict significant water shortages are not related to the risk of violent intrastate wars in africa theisen et al 2012 or asia wischnath and buhaug 2014 to the contrary hendrix and salehyan 2012 find that increased rainfall is linked to a higher risk of fighting more recent research on drought however contends that water scarcity is associated with violent conflict when important infrastructure is lacking detges 2016 or when drought stricken areas largely depend on agriculture as their main source of income von uexkull et al 2016 von uexkull 2014 still evidence from analyses of communal conflict is more mixed while some studies indicate that unfavourable rainfall deviation is a potential driver of communal conflict fjelde and von uexkull 2012 others are more careful about establishing links between shocks in precipitation patterns and violent conflict böhmelt et al 2014 o loughlin et al 2014 to reach greater consensus future quantitative studies especially on communal conflict would benefit from more reliable and varied hydrological data given the findings from the quantitative peace literature on water there are three main avenues for enhancing the data that informs water diplomacy first research using disaggregated measures needs to address data problems in regard to reliability and validity and collaborate more closely with other more hydrologic based water research second focusing only on precipitation data will not suffice instead water access needs to be analysed from several entry points such as rivers dams or other irrigation solutions like boreholes to understand the various locations of possible contention that water negotiations need to consider lastly while peace research typically focuses on links between conflict and water scarcity more studies need to address the potential for cooperation and peace building these shortcomings notwithstanding as we highlight later in the paper a quantitative based policy tool holds promise for advancing water diplomacy and providing deeper political analysis of water conflict and cooperation 3 unpacking the existing toolbox for water diplomacy existing policy tools dedicated to interstate water diplomacy face great challenges with rising demand and dwindling supply of fresh water exacerbating the problem is the threat of global climate change which has already begun to undermine existing interstate sharing arrangements of international rivers gleick 2009 swain 2012 clearly tools for sharing water among countries cannot be guided by a single golden rule as the value demand and supply of water varies greatly between regions swain 2004 this given a one size fits all approach to water diplomacy is simply not feasible in spite of water s vital significance for peace security and development united nations security council 2016 available tools on how to transform tensions over transboundary waters into cooperation remain quite weak and limited in range earle et al 2010 external financial and technical assistance can facilitate interstate water diplomacy the funding and technical support offered by international agencies is regularly used as an incentive for disputing states to agree on water cooperation priscoli 1994 indeed many developing countries lack sufficient financial resources and technical knowledge to unilaterally undertake large water projects a weakness which encourages basin countries to cooperate in order to increase the benefits of shared water with external support disputing states hope to further develop irrigation hydropower and or flood control projects with greater net benefits than that which could have been achieved through state centric development alone to prevent conflicts over water international agencies also invest in efforts to provide enhanced systematic training to water professionals in developing countries sadoff et al 2017 the deutsche gesellschaft für internationale zusammenarbeit giz a leading donor agency in this sector identifies water cooperation and governance as one of its main strategic areas and supports the development of the water resource knowledge base giz 2014 institutional training programs take officials away from their usual context to see water issues from a new and more cooperative perspective these professionals are later asked to help facilitate negotiations over disputed water resources in their home countries home grown actors not only help external negotiators but can also set an example for their colleagues on how to best cooperate over shared water pohl et al 2014 for international agencies and other actors to be more effective in interstate water negotiations they need to coordinate and mutually demonstrate credible long term commitment to cross sector and transnational cooperation the multitude of international stakeholders in negotiations can sometimes inhibit efforts to bring disputing countries together in the absence of an overarching international organisation willing and able to coordinate this task an informal network of international agencies engaged in inter state water sharing issues could fulfil a similar role such coordinated international engagement should act early as interstate water sharing disputes become harder to diffuse once they gain traction and are securitised at present it is difficult for the international community to gather sufficient political support among states to set up anticipatory water conflict management mechanisms facilitating future interstate water cooperation necessitates greater awareness of the importance of shared water resources among high ranking foreign and development policy makers pohl and swain 2017 and a recognition of existing norms that bind them together to this end while international agencies can play an instrumental role in facilitating behaviour over shared water resources they hold only limited engagement in intrastate water conflicts which are not only more common but also more violent in nature allansson et al 2017 for reasons of national security almost all the countries in the world resist external engagement in their internal water sharing issues further the inherent insecurity of post colonial states in asia africa and the middle east does not provide much scope for existing water diplomacy tools to flourish in intrastate water disputes there is an apprehension in these countries that international agencies may insert so called outside or western agendas that are not in the best interest of their nation such as by putting global environmental concerns above domestic economic development the dominant tool to address intrastate water disputes at present is through the judiciary of a state the judiciary is often tasked with adjudicating disputes as it is hard for the central government to choose between different water users in a country without being seen as partial to one of the users judicial decisions promise more impartiality but have nonetheless been regularly challenged by domestic stakeholders in countries like india and pakistan this has borne intractable water disputes this given international agencies try to play a supportive role in building the capacity of domestic water institutions to improve water governance they also contribute by training water professionals in water scarce countries not only on the complexities of water development but also the fundamentals of negotiation and mediation beyond institution building and knowledge transfer however international agencies would profit greatly from better data both ethnographic and quantitative on the political dynamics of water interactions within a state 4 politicising the toolbox introducing three peace and conflict tools for water diplomacy drawing insights from peace and conflict research we expand the toolbox of water diplomacy to place sharper focus on the political mechanisms underpinning water conflict and cooperation in the following section we introduce three political tools across three levels at the interstate level to compile a norm inventory that exposes the underlying political expectations that guide state behaviour around water sharing and at the intrastate and communal levels to incorporate ethnographic data to elucidate the everyday lives and needs of water users and disaggregated georeferenced data to advance quantitative insights respectively all tools aim to more proactively build capacity and knowledge of risk prone areas for water diplomacy rather than addressing water tensions after they erupt 4 1 interstate tool a norm inventory for water at the interstate level of water diplomacy there exists a rich body of norms that dictate acceptable behaviour around shared water this body hereby termed a normative code has progressively evolved around water in the past sixty years to prescribe high standards for water sharing and denounce conflict around water as morally objectionable fig 1 illustrates the main sources from which this code derives as organised into two spheres a juridical sphere of international water law general principles of law and rights declarations and a discursive sphere of leader discourse ministerial reports and military documents any effort to comprehensively understand the context in which water diplomacy is conducted should take stock of operative norms from all sources and across both spheres the discursive sphere is located at the core of the code as norms around water are not necessarily contingent on law but rather may pre exist any formal codification the juridical sphere on the other hand typically builds off existing normative beliefs thus is depicted as an outer sphere 4 1 1 the juridical sphere of norms norms of international water law iwl are commonly acknowledged by water diplomacy initiatives three of the most salient iwl norms include 1 equitable and reasonable use using water in an equitable manner based on existing and potential uses alternative water sources and population needs of riparians 2 no significant harm responsible water use that does not adversely impact others and 3 peaceful water dispute resolution resolving potential conflict through joint negotiation or conciliation by a third party these three norms hold influence in a significant array of basin wide agreements and are recognised as an important legal institutional instrument of water diplomacy conca et al 2006 pohl et al 2014 complementing norms of iwl however are the often undervalued general and rights based legal norms two of the most promising here for water diplomacy are good neighbourliness a general disposition to be affable to others and reconcile the national interest with those of neighbouring states united nations 1979 yale law journal 1973 pop 1991 and the right to life the notion that all humans have an inalienable right to life of which water is a vital requirement the strength of general and rights based norms for water diplomacy derives less from their legal status which is often disputed and more from their normative underpinnings good neighbourliness is a confidence building norm emphasising the longstanding track record of neighbourliness around water offers both inspiration and political pressure for riparian states in their water sharing indeed the historical record has been remarkably silent on armed conflict over water especially at the international level brochmann and gleditsch 2012 barnaby 2009 if a country were to deviate from good neighbourliness around water a water diplomat could reasonably employ moral persuasion and or shaming to prompt it to reinstate good water sharing and uphold its image as a civilised and neighbourly member of the international community risse ropp and sikkink 1999 likewise the need to protect water for life is deeply embedded in what constitutes a respected or civilised state water features in a range of human rights instruments implicitly if not explicitly as indispensable to life and its many essentials un 1983 1989 un cescr 1995 un cescr 2000 scanlon et al 2004 in february 2017 pope francis of the holy see endorsed this view declaring that t he right to water is essential for the survival of persons and decisive for the future of humanity pope francis 2017 as spiritual leader to 1 3 billion people the pope holds moral power in shaping popular sentiment water negotiations would do well to draw upon the legal and popular connection between water and rights 4 1 2 the discursive sphere of norms moving beyond law an obvious indicator for norms is discourse the way people talk about managing shared water practitioners of water diplomacy would benefit from taking stock of public statements by key decision makers notably political and military leaders and their representatives as well as ministerial reports within a river basin the aim is to detect whether decision makers feel there are normative constraints on how they manage water with other states and if so to emphasise such constraints in future negotiations for instance the landmark un security council 2016 debate on water peace and security featured clear normative rhetoric among state representatives that conflict around water was unacceptable discourse can also provide early warning signs of changing beliefs around water which more formal and temporally fixed legal instruments cannot immediately capture in 2015 the prime minister of india narendra modi spoke to a meeting of the indus plenary declaring that blood and water cannot flow together at the same time this was a firm ultimatum toward pakistan that unless the latter halted its involvement in the kashmir territorial violence india would stop the flow of the indus river such discourse diverged from the usual good neighbourliness between the two countries over water in this way discourse can reveal much about the emotional state of leaders and more accurately reflect the current normative climate of a basin military manuals including rules of engagement roes provide a valuable means to discern underlying military attitudes toward water roes in the early 20th century typically included water as a possible method of sabotage for e g us office of strategic services 1944 by contrast the more recent rules of engagement for operation iraqi freedom explicitly condemned the targeting of public works such as dams us department of defense 2005 roes are important for water diplomacy under the assumption that if militaries view water resources as warranting protection then that may affect their decisions around water that said not all bureaucracies within a state have equal say on water diplomacy legro 1997 37 contends that a bureaucracy s influence varies according to its organizational salience militaries he claims have high salience on matters of security as they generally have monopoly control over expertise in the use of force and the time periods for altering prearranged plans are limited as such their doctrines and rules are important to consider as part of a norm inventory for water diplomacy especially where water negotiations occur in the context of armed conflict 4 2 intrastate tool ethnography to inform multi track dialogue moving to the intrastate level there is an enduring tension between state centric track i diplomacy and inclusive multi track dialogue over whether the opening up of water diplomacy to multi stakeholder forums is beneficial and or necessary it is impossible to assert the superiority of one approach over another in all cases of water diplomacy however intrastate multi stakeholder tools have clear advantages for one intrastate tools for water diplomacy employ knowledge and methods designed to acquire greater insights into intra basin politics and social and economic instabilities historical current and prospective water disputes in a river basin often involve non state actors that lie beyond the conventional water sector of state agencies for instance the fierce civil society opposition to large dams in nepal in the mid 1990s can be better understood as a product of the divisive political context that drove the country into civil war dixit and gyawali 2010 in this way domestic politics can shape the prevailing narrative on dams and development likewise a conspicuous absence of community responses to large dams in lao pdr can be understood as a product of the stringent restrictions on civil liberties human rights watch 2016 ethnography and other forms of qualitative data from fieldwork speak directly to the need to understand intrastate politics and instabilities thick description and field data gained through interviews participant observation and surveys are indispensable to this end participant observation the core method of ethnography involves an immersive approach to research that entails cultural social and linguistic proficiency within the field of study and close familiarity with the research subjects whom the researcher aims to observe applying this to water participant observation grants researchers access to the everyday lives of water users and their social groups such immersion enables a researcher to gain new perspectives that may not be obvious to outsiders water users as with individuals in other social contexts often have layered relationships that overlap along material cultural and kinship lines the ideal norms and practices of each layer can challenge individuals in times where one of their relationships overlays or clashes with another bourdieu 1990 understanding these complex relationships can be important in the face of or to prevent intrastate conflict over water at a broader level ethnographic fieldwork has gained traction in peace and conflict research to explain the interpersonal interactions and micro foundations of conflicts such studies require deep understanding of civilians and combatants including their daily lives within peace and conflict research serious efforts are made to unpack the different actors influencing a state s foreign policy making instead of treating the state as a unitary actor hudson 2005 singer 1961 adopting an ethnographic tool for water diplomacy thus promises greater insights into the underlying motivations and incompatibilities within a state which may not be obvious with a state centric approach to water diplomacy alone ethnographic research on social and political groups within a state including non state armed actors can be useful to map out the various stakeholders in multi track dialogue the security situation in some international river basins requires an examination of the role of non state actors who are either militant or political particularly in river basins that have experienced armed contestation suhardiman et al 2017 to illustrate navigating the water sector in myanmar has benefited from understanding its fragmented local governance and intrastate conflict dynamics social groups are divided along ethnic and religious lines with each group holding its own vision for waterworks projects in their respective region kachin news group 2010 karen rivers watch 2016 the international finance corporation 2017 a leading supporter of developing myanmar s hydropower potential included a chapter in its annual report on the relevance of the country s peace efforts for its hydropower in myanmar more than 20 non state armed groups are currently in operation some actively rebel against the state while others no longer rebel but still hold arms international crisis group 2011 the relationships between rebel groups and the state should be studied in relation to the development of large scale waterworks projects in order to inform dialogue in the water sector simpson 2013 addressing the concerns of non state actors who often represent the needs of farming and fishing communities in developing countries reflects the normative nature of water diplomacy public participation has been promoted in water diplomacy as empowering river communities by strengthening their capacity and engagement ethnographic field research can provide valuable input for practitioners on how to best accommodate groups and their particular visions for instance empirics from fieldwork in the mekong river basin reveal the development and environmental challenges facing river communities which are coupled with social and environmental risks posed by large dams on the main stream of the mekong river these challenges are one of the main reasons for international and local resistance to hydropower projects in the region öjendal et al 2012 the mekong river commission the rbo mandated with governing the mekong has allowed a limited level of grass roots participation as part of its informal consultation process which enables civil society groups to provide input to the higher decision making body the council of ministers gerlak and haefner 2017 in similar fashion the nile basin initiative a multilateral body for water cooperation among nile riparians and the lake victoria basin commission a rbo for lake victoria in east central africa facilitate public participation through various activities schmeier 2012 4 3 communal tool disaggregated georeferenced data to identify sub state water tensions water disputes have neither led to violence between states nor have such disputes ignited civil wars peace research can offer much needed tools for water diplomacy when moving to a more disaggregated level of analysis such as the communal level the most robust empirical evidence for an association between armed disputes and water issues relates to cases involving subnational political actors such analysis requires a focus on highly disaggregated data as peace and conflict scholarship moves to more fine grained water events data collection efforts should be made to incorporate available hydrologic data moreover there is enormous potential for greater collaboration on data between peace scholars and water experts particularly on the communal level of water related conflict and cooperation research and policy analysis alike often employ country level indicators to inform discussions on water diplomacy cross case comparisons and single case studies while such an approach has many positive aspects this type of analysis should ideally be complemented by more disaggregation to illustrate figs 2 and 3 employ identical data on upstream water risk gassert et al 2014 and instances of protest over food and water salehyan et al 2012 while fig 2 depicts country averages of the data fig 3 disaggregates the water data to sub basin level units which allow for a more magnified analysis when conducting research on the links between water risk and protests over water or food security country statistics are valuable but miss a lot of sub state variation that is needed to detect and address the exact communal location of a dispute rather much more information can be gleaned when moving to smaller levels of analysis kenya is frequently identified as an example of high investment in rural and urban water provision yet the country has frequently witnessed violent communal conflict such as conflicts between farmers and pastoralists and between members of different ethnic groups in fig 4 the location of wells or boreholes is overlaid with conflict events involving two ethnic groups in north eastern kenya every conflict event indicates at least one fatality and some include more than ten fatalities although the exact links between such conflicts and water shortages ought to be studied further the figure makes apparent that peace research offers potential insights that can already now support policy makers to identify regions that require more focus on within country differences for example as we see in fig 4 there are several areas in this region without any boreholes but a large number of violent communal conflict events likewise there are a few conflict events located near to boreholes that said however practitioners should be wary of interpreting this figure as an empirical reality peace researchers require better water data to enhance their studies and eventually improve the understanding of possible links between water scarcity and conflict of course several dimensions are not covered in fig 4 for instance there is no information about the status of the wells possible problems with pollution other forms of water access and the nature and temporal aspects of the data provided furthermore it is possible that complete data on boreholes and wells is missing these empirical deficiencies make it only more apparent that peace research would greatly benefit from more involvement in projects that collect hydrologic data with better exchange between the natural and social sciences research can more effectively address the questions raised by policymakers moreover in providing insights into conflicts georeferenced data adds a more clearly political dimension to water research 5 conclusion much of the existing hydrological literature overlooks the politics of water even when the political sphere is addressed it often remains secondary in focus theories and empirical strategies in peace and conflict research place primary importance on politics and are adept at highlighting the linkages between politics peace and the environment they also recognise the plurality of actors in the social world by adding to knowledge through qualitative and quantitative lenses peace and conflict research s multi disciplinary and multi method approach contributes to deeper understanding of water issues such as by mapping out important political state and non state actors as well as the interaction between these actors and the international community such insights are needed to support water diplomacy rather than bundling all levels of actors together as one uniform multi stakeholder category there is value in focusing on each constituent level of actors and dynamics in detail much of the existing policy tools on water diplomacy are dedicated to the interstate level adding to this water diplomats would do well to tap into existing norms across both the juridical and discursive spheres of water governance compiling a norm inventory of the river basin in which diplomacy takes place allows diplomats to capitalise and strengthen existing cooperative norms and engage in persuasion or shaming of states who do not live up to prevailing expectations to safeguard water an inventory also enables diplomats to better understand and adapt their activities to changing norms and emotional climates that influence water negotiations one of the core premises of multi level water diplomacy is that water issues cut across different levels of society and affect a number of groups and communities as well as the state yet intergovernmental water negotiations often reflect a disjuncture between state centric water diplomacy and the everyday lives of water users local realities and intrastate conflict are not always considered in interstate water diplomacy this disconnect is all the more amplified when a state conflicts with its society within as is the case during civil wars and protracted insurgencies peace and conflict research acknowledges these social and political dynamics despite taking very different approaches both ethnographic and quantitative data improve the understanding of sub state contexts and dynamics which is imperative for a well coordinated inclusive water diplomacy covering multiple scales of water governance better data within a state can help policy makers ngos and local actors to take more targeted actions clearly more accurate and reliable data can enhance research and policy making future statistical data collection efforts on water issues would especially profit from greater collaboration between peace research and more hydrological studies where applied such synergies will be fruitful in enhancing evidence based policy a key ingredient for successful water diplomacy acknowledgements research for this article has been supported by the unesco category ii international centre for water cooperation stockholm sweden 
7373,as two key threats to receiving water bodies the generation mechanisms and processes of urban and agricultural nonpoint sources npss show clear differences which lead to distinct characteristics of water quality responses with mixed land uses catchments compared to single land use ones however few studies have provided such insights in these characteristic or quantified different water environment responses to nps pollution in this study an integrated modelling approach was developed for those complex catchments by combining three commonly used models swmm storm water management model swat soil and water assessment tool and mike 11 a case study was performed in a typical urban rural catchment of chao lake china the simulated results indicated that urban nps pollution responded sensitively to rainfall events and was greatly affected by the antecedent dry days compare to urban nps agricultural nps pollution was characterized with the time lag to rainfall depended on soil moisture and the post rain season emissions carried by lateral flows and were also affected by the local farm practice schedule with comprehensive impacts from urban rural land uses the time interleaved urban and agricultural nps pollution emissions and more abundant pollution accumulation both led to a decrease in the responsive time and an increase in the frequency of peak pollution concentration values even during the dry season these obtained characteristics can provide guidance for drafting watershed management plans in similar mixed land use catchments keywords nonpoint source pollution water environment response urban rural mixed catchment swmm swat mike11 1 introduction nonpoint source nps pollution has become a major contributor to water related problems such as river contamination aquatic ecology deterioration and serious eutrophication xiang et al 2017 with rapid urbanization the land use change brings an increase in the complexity of nps pollution as the pollution generation mechanisms and transport processes differ with land use generally agricultural nps pollutants are typically derived from fertilizers or pesticides and are transported through the soil by lateral movement and percolating water which is associated closely with climatic factors and site specific land characteristics such as soil types soil moisture land management and topography ritter and shirmohammadi 2000 the development of urban catchments increases impervious surfaces and human activity intensities resulting in the accumulation of pollutants derived from more complex sources such as commerce production and transportation on land surfaces novotny 2002 shen et al 2016 and the reduction of rainfall infiltration and surface storage with the development of artificial drainage which conveys runoff through more efficient pathways lead to an increase in storm runoff and a more flashy response of nps pollution miller and hess 2017 studying the characteristics of nps pollutions and their water environment responses has drawn wide attention to aid in the drafting of pollution control plans in situ monitoring and model prediction are two major methods used for these researches previous studies have monitored the rainfall runoff emissions and the water quality response near and far from the source location revealing the influence of the nps pollution by comparing the variability of water quality schock et al 2014 with the popularization of geographic information system gis some studies tried to develop the correlation between the landscape metrics and measured water quality indicators and thus explored the water quality responses to the nps pollutions huang et al 2016b shen et al 2016 however the time and cost that involved in monitoring process usually resulted in the scarcity of monitored data and thus limited such researches for the sake of saving monitoring efforts more and more studies tried to employ a variety of model for quantifying the water quality responses to nps pollution distributed models have been developed as essential tools for providing insights into the spatial distribution of nps pollution chen et al 2013a liu et al 2015 commonly used watershed models can be classified into urban and agricultural tools according to their functions and applicability for different land use types chen et al 2016b neitsch et al 2002 yao et al 2016 these models such as storm water management model swmm storage treatment overflow runoff model storm and soil and water assessment tool swat can simulate the impact of land management practices on water sediment and chemical yields with various land use and management conditions over long periods of time these models can simulate processes from the generation of runoff to the entry of nutrients to various water bodies as well as predict flow volume sediment levels and the amounts of nutrients leaving the sub basins of a watershed instead water environment models are widely used for aquatic systems including rivers lakes and reservoirs and represent pollutant transport and degradation processes based on hydrodynamic conditions to support environmental assessment and management dhi 2003 hamrick 1992 it should be noted that no single model can fully describe the processes of nps pollution and their water quality responses for some models such as swat and hspf transport and fate processes in the in stream were usually ignored or simplified and described using partially revised equations of established water environmental models qual2e ce qual riv1 which may affect modeling accuracy therefore integrated models have become increasingly popular for these studies migliaccio et al 2007 shi et al 2017 however existing studies have mainly focused on nps pollution from a single land use and the results are not relevant for the management of water quality in catchments with mixed land uses chinen et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 besides the present studies based on integrated models usually ignored unifying temporal resolutions of the individual models but used relatively coarser time series data such as yearly or monthly steps dadhich and nadaoka 2012 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 this assumption neglects the dynamic characteristic of nps pollution and their corresponding water environment response leading to an ignorance of the critical timings for water quality management the storm hydrograph was shown to provide the most suitable means for comparing hydrological response braud et al 2013 miller and hess 2017 however few study has provide such insight in the nps graph and their water quality response in this study the nps emissions from complex land uses and their impacts on water quality were quantified for the management of water quality under the comprehensive impacts from urban rural nps pollution a case study was performed in one of the upstream catchment shiwuli river watershed of chao lake china the specific objectives of this paper are 1 to develop the integrated model system by combining three commonly used models swmm swat and mike 11 2 to compare the temporal characteristics of nps pollution from different land uses 3 to quantify the dynamic water quality responses to the mixed nps pollution and summarize the implications for watershed management 2 materials and method 2 1 study area chao lake which locates in the east of china is one of the country s five largest freshwater lakes xu et al 2017a the lake has nearly 33 tributaries around and the whole watershed covers an area of 13 555 km2 xi et al 2015 during the last few decades excessive nutrient loads deteriorated the water quality of chao lake and resulted in severe algal blooms huang et al 2016a as one of the three major nutrient load contributors identified by the local authority the water quality of the shiwuli river has drawn much attention and was therefore took as the study area of this study the shiwuli river in hefei city east china was selected as the study area the studied river basin which is downstream of the swan lake dam flows through both urban and rural areas and covers an area of 133 km2 that includes 120 6 km2 of urban drainage area 90 68 and 12 4 km2 of agricultural area 9 32 fig 1 eleven land use types are identified fig 2 the subtropical monsoon climate brings an average annual rainfall of approximately 1000 mm into this area and the water level in the shiwuli river varies considerably during the wet june september normal march may october november and dry december february of the next year seasons zong et al 2014 the nps pollution is mainly derived from urban surface runoff drained by sewer systems agricultural land livestock and aquaculture and uncollected rural domestic sewage rainfall runoff inputs point source discharges and branch inflows constitute 43 41 and 16 of the stream water of the shiwuli river point source discharges are collected by sewage plants and the tn and nh3 n emissions are treated to meet the effluent discharge standards gb 18918 2002 which set the concentration limits of 15 mg l and 5 mg l respectively for tn and nh3 n despite of the small portion of the whole watershed the agricultural land is located as the nearby upstream catchment to chao lake which make it as a critical threat to the water quality of chao lake thus the combined impacts from both upstream urban and rural npss further deteriorated the water quality of the shiwuli river especially at the outlet of the watershed in a more complex way based on our previous measurements during 2009 2016 the tn and nh3 n concentrations of the shiwuli river at the downstream section generally exceeded 2 mg l especially during the wet season which is the worst score specified by the water quality standards gb3838 2002 zong et al 2014 2 2 model selection and data collection 2 2 1 model selection 1 swmm in this study the swmm is used to predict the urban nps load from the urban areas the swmm which was developed by the usepa is a dynamic hydrology hydraulic water quality model that replicates physical processes wijesiri et al 2016 the core modelling process includes rainfall runoff processes and tracking excess rainwater to catchment outlets through sewer networks at single event or continuous simulation steps gironás et al 2010 yao et al 2016 to date swmm has been widely and successfully used in many urban catchments in china and abroad chen et al 2013b ma et al 2012 2 swat model in this study the swat is used to simulate the agricultural nps from the rural areas the swat model is a distributed hydrological model developed by the united states department of agriculture usda neitsch et al 2002 two major components of the model are the land phase which controls the amount of water sediment and pollutant loadings in each sub basin and the routing phase defined as the movement of water sediments and other materials through the channel network of the watershed to the outlet neitsch et al 2002 swat has been widely used in simulations of agricultural nps pollution in china gassman et al 2014 3 mike 11 according to the geometry and dynamic condition of the shiwuli river a one dimension model dhi mike 11 was selected to quantify the impact of nps pollution on the receiving waters among the abundant modules available in mike 11 the hydrodynamic hd module is widely used for computing unsteady flow discharge and water level in rivers and channels using a one dimensional implicit finite difference scheme for the numerical solution of the saint venant equations doulgeris et al 2012 the advection dispersion ad module which is based on the equation of mass conservation can simulate water quality along a channel under the action of advection dispersion dhi 2003 in addition the boundary condition file bnd11 of mike 11 is used not only to specify common boundary conditions such as water levels and inflow hydrographs but also for the specification of lateral flows and their solute concentrations thus providing an interface for the swmm and the swat model to be coupled dhi 2003 specifically lateral flows along river reaches such as point source and nps boundaries were insert into the boundary editor with their type descriptions locations or domains their detailed flow and solute concentration values calculated by the swmm and the swat model were organized as external time series files which could be obtained by mike 11 through their storage path 2 2 2 data collection 1 spatial geographical data in this study an 8 m resolution digital elevation model dem land use data at 1 100000 scale and soil type data at 1 100000 scale were obtained from the geographical information monitoring cloud platform which was launched by the beijing digital view technology co ltd figs 1 and 2 topographical data of the river channel geometrical data of the cross sections and the parameters of eight overflow weirs located at different distances along the channel were collected from the water conservancy department of hefei city 2 monitoring data in this study four meteorological stations were set up along the shiwuli river watershed fig 1 basic meteorological data including series of rainfall air temperature and other weather data were obtained at five minute and daily intervals all the data were compiled and used as model inputs point source discharges from the sewage plants were monitored from sep 1st to 7th 2015 based on local eutrophication characteristics the daily samples were collected and the mean concentrations of tn and nh3 n were tested the sample processing occurred within 6 h of collection and followed standard methods sepa 2002 the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method and the salicylic acid spectrophotometric method were used to test tn and nh3 n respectively nps pollution monitoring was undertaken at a sewer network outfall a2 located upstream of the shiwuli river watershed fig 1 discharge flow was derived from depth velocity readings taken using a current meter combined with a water level sensor installed in the sewer the runoff emission samples were collected at intervals of 2 min during rainfall events on july 23rd 2015 nh3 n and tn were tested sample processing occurred within 6 h of collection and followed standard methods sepa 2002 water level at hourly interval were monitored during jun dec of 2015by three hydrometric stations consisting of staff gauges water level sensors digital transmission and related terminal display equipment fig 1 water quality were monitored by collecting daily samples at a downstream river section during oct dec in 2015 fig 1 these samples were also processed within 6 h after collection and tested for tn and nh3 n concentrations with the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method and the salicylic acid spectrophotometric method respectively in addition monthly grab samples were analysed for a range of chemical parameters including tn and nh3 n in the state controlled section the state controlled cross section was located at the end stretch of the shiwuli river the inlet to lake chao where the water quality was expected to be controlled under the limit of 2 0 mg l 2 3 model setup and calibration 2 3 1 model setup fig 3 shows the detailed framework of the integrated modelling method the simulated flows and nps loads from swmm and the swat model were used as inputs into the mike 11 model as boundary conditions pollution sources specifically agricultural nps pollution was simulated by swat for the entirety of 2015 the daily flows and tn and nh3 n concentrations for each sub basin were calculated and used as inputs for the mike 11 model the runoff flows and water qualities at the outfalls of the sewer network were also simulated for 2015 using swmm the simulated results included flow nh3 n and tn concentrations at 15 minute intervals in order to match the temporal resolutions of the two set of time series data the swmm results were converted into daily interval series using weighted average method before being input into the mike 11 the calibrated integrated model was run to calculate the daily river water quality under the impacts of nps pollution the detailed modelling process is now described 1 swmm setup in swmm the urban catchment was divided into 1311 sub catchments for each sub catchment land use types were categorized as green land factory land and commercial and residential areas the sub catchments were further subdivided based on imperviousness the horton equation was selected to calculate the infiltration rainwater losses from pervious surfaces and dynamic wave theory was adopted for the flow routing computations gironás et al 2010 the water quality module was used for simulating nps processes in which exponential equations were selected for both pollutant build up and wash off calculations critical parameters such as drainage area flow width and imperviousness were derived from the geographic information system gis layer in addition drainage data were input to determine the inlet locations of the sewer network and conduit parameters finally the flow rates and depths and pollution concentrations and loads were tracked to the outlets of the urban pipe system to then serve as mike inputs 2 swat setup for the swat model the agricultural watershed was delineated into 13 sub catchments and 69 hydrological response units hrus digital elevation data fig 1 land use fig 2 soil data fig 1 climate data and agricultural management practices were collected and used as swat inputs the climate data including the daily temperatures precipitation levels wind speeds relative humidity and solar radiation levels were obtained from the meteorological stations and input into the swat model as driving data farming management information was gathered through surveys and statistics soil data including information on soil reactions conductivities water capacities and flood frequencies were collected at a scale of 1 10000 swat was then run with a daily step size to simulate the water quantity and quality parameters for all the stream segments from the agricultural watershed as mike inputs 3 mike 11 setup for mike 11 the river network was digitized using a topographical map derived from the dem considering that the weixi river branch had been diverted into another watershed for a water environment project only one major branch the xuxiao river and the 22 64 km long main stream were generated fig 5 bed resistances in the form of manning n were applied for different channel segmentations whereas uniform dispersion coefficients and decay constants were applied throughout the river channel fifty available surveyed river sections were employed within the model to define the river geometry eight water control structures located along the main channel were represented as weirs fig 4 due to the constriction of the upstream swan lake dam zero flow boundary conditions were applied to the upstream open ends of the mike 11 river network the downstream boundary at the state controlled section was set to an open q h boundary based on the relationships between the monitored discharge and the water level with the annual mean tn and nh3 n concentrations swmm and the swat model were coupled with mike 11 at the boundary editor interface by inputting the swmm and swat simulated time series data as pollution sources for mike 11 a total of 79 point source inflow boundaries were set including the discharge from sewage plants and urban nps pollution drained by the storm water sewer system according to the populations of the villages the amounts of domestic sewage were estimated and input to the model as point source pollution 2 3 2 calibration of the integrated model model calibration which is the process of estimating model parameters using a pair wise comparison between the predicted and measured points is the key and critical step in model application in this study a two phase step was conducted when constructing the integrated model first the watershed model swmm was calibrated based on the monitoring data at the drainage outlet and then used as inputs for the stream model mike11 for swmm the flow and water quality observation data were obtained during a rainfall event on july 23rd 2015 at an outfall a2 that was located in a typical upstream sub catchment mike 11 was then calibrated by fitting the simulated and measured data collected in the stream sections including the water levels monitored at a midstream hydrometric station from june 26th to october 1st in 2015 and water quality observation data from october 1st to december 20th in 2015 at a downstream cross section besides the hydrological parameters were calibrated prior to the water quality parameters and important parameters of each model were identified via a sensitivity analysis to fully calibrate the integrated model an auto calibration platform was developed by the authors the platform provided a free cloud computing environment that enabled the speeding up of calibration a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii was used to search for better parameters bekele and nicklow 2007 the mean relative error was used as the objective function to evaluate the models adaptabilities and the formula was as follows 1 e mr i 1 n o i p i o i n where o is the observed value p is the predicted value and n is the number of data points the closer mean relative error approximates to 0 the more reliable the model is the nsga ii calibration program specified value ranges for each calibrated model parameter and regarded these value groups as chromosomes which were coded with decision variables a random population was initialized at first for each model running the simulation results were compared with observed data and the fitness for the non domination levels were evaluated by calculation the objective function new generation of chromosomes were then created based on the fitness evaluation chromosomes would reproduce until the maximum generation number was achieved xie et al 2017 in this study after 10 000 model running the most optimized group of parameters were then be selected by ranking all the groups according to the order of the mean relative error values regarding swmm some sensitive parameters were picked out by the sensitivity analysis the calibration results of these parameters are illustrated in fig 6 at the monitored drainage network outfall the variation trends of the observed and simulated pollution concentrations were generally consistent fig 5 during the calibration period the mean relative error values for nh3 n and tn were 0 26 and 0 147 respectively demonstrating the relatively good performance of the simulation the calibrated parameters and their values are listed in table 1 regarding the integrated model the variation trends of the observed water level and water quality in the shiwuli river and the simulated values from the integrated model were generally consistent fig 6 during the calibration period the mean relative error of the simulated water level compared to the observed value was 0 002 supporting the good performance for the hydrodynamic simulation for the ad module the mean relative error values of the simulated tn and nh3 n concentrations compared to the observed values were 0 26 and 0 45 respectively which indicated acceptable performance of water quality module ahmed 2010 eisakhani et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation of nps pollution the simulated nps results are shown in fig 7 according to the simulation results the runoff flow per unit area from urban surface showed a more sensitive response to the rainfall due to the high imperviousness of urban land surfaces and efficiently conveyance by drainage network novotny 2002 by contrast the agricultural runoff responded to rainfall differently during different hydrological periods during january may when light rain dominants the precipitation events agricultural runoff generation usually occurred after several rainfall events and the flow volumes were apparently less compared to urban sources indicating the time lag and reduction of rainfall runoff caused by soil infiltration during wet season jun sep agricultural runoff increased with more frequent and intensive rainfall as the soil moisture increased by accumulating more rain water and the rainfall infiltration accordingly decreased penna et al 2015 ritter and shirmohammadi 2000 after that even when the rainfall decreased sharply during october to december there was still a continuous runoff generation from agricultural lands attributing to the lateral flow from the rain water stored in soil during wet season regarding the nps pollution concentration situations varied for each sewer outfall in urban area their annual mean concentrations ranged from 0 11 to 15 31 mg l for tn and 0 075 11 01 mg l for nh3 n the largest event mean concentration emc even reached 46 73 mg l for tn and 32 891 mg l for nh3 n while both were much higher than the water quality standard required for the shiwuli river indicating serious upstream nps pollution during the whole simulation period the exceeding standard rate of each outfall ranged from 6 3 to 88 3 regarding tn and 5 76 8 regarding nh3 n as one of the major nps pollution contributor the sewer outfall a2 was taken as an example for detailed analysis at outfall a2 the daily mean concentrations of nh3 n ranged from 0 15 to 36 81 mg l and the annual mean concentration was 7 84 mg l fig 8 as the generation mechanism of urban nps pollution is mainly based on the pollutant build up and wash off the runoff could be regard as a major factor affecting urban nps pollution therefore the fluctuation trends of tn and nh3 n concentration at a2 outfall almost matched the hydrograph of urban runoff flow fig 8 besides the concentrations of nps pollution are influenced greatly by the antecedent dry days of rainfall events which determined the amounts of pollutants built up on land surfaces adams and chen 2006 and the peak values of daily mean concentrations usually occurred at the beginning of rainfall periods due to the relatively lower rainfall intensity and the first flush effect alfonso et al 2014 in the agricultural area the peak value of the simulated nh3 n at the outlet could reach 10 mg l and the average concentration was 0 54 mg l fig 8 the simulated maximum daily mean concentration of tn was 60 mg l and the average concentration reached 11 mg l which was much higher than for nh3 n serious agricultural nps pollution mainly occurred in spring feb april and autumn sep nov during these periods the relatively low rainfall runoffs and stream flows were insufficient to attenuate the pollutant loads chen et al 2011 in addition the key farming timings for this watershed occurred during these periods which applied heavy nutrient loads to the soils by fertilization and led to the high tn concentrations xu et al 2017b the simulated annual tn and nh3 n nps pollution loads were 421 55 t a and 180 24 t a respectively from these values the urban source category contributed 216 49 t a tn and 166 41 t a nh3 n accounting for 51 26 and 92 25 respectively table 2 nh3 n emissions were almost dominated by urban nonpoint sources and could represent the characters of urban nonpoint source pollution to a certain extent as for tn agricultural sources contributed a comparable portion as urban sources because of the application of no3 n base fertilizer 3 2 river water quality response the simulated results of the hydrodynamic condition in the shiwuli river showed a serious water shortage problem characterized by low stream discharges in the channel under dry weather fig 9 a under rainy weather with the supplements of rainwater and surface runoff the river discharge could even rise to 284 73 m3 s and the water level rose accordingly increasing 0 5 5 0 m which helped promote water flows and natural pollution remediation mechanisms such as the mixing transport and degradation of pollutants campolo et al 1999 however serious nps pollution followed and led to a deterioration of water quality the maximum tn concentration at the state controlled cross section could reach 12 0 mg l in rainy weather and the maximum nh3 n concentration was 4 0 mg l fig 9 fig 9 showed different water quality responses of tn and nh3 n concentrations to the nps pollution as for nh3 n the concentration was contributed mainly by the urban npss thus representing the water quality response of nps pollution to nps from urban land use to some extents the variation trend of nh3 n concentration was shown to be more according with the river hydrograph and rainfall however comparing to the responses of nps pollutions to rainfall the river water quality response lagged obviously as the peak values of nh3 n concentrations usually occurred after a few continuous days of nps pollution emissions fig 9 c indicating that the improved hydrodynamic conditions in rainy days could alleviated water quality deterioration effectively by the natural pollution remediation mechanisms by contrast the water quality response of tn was more complicated under the comprehensive impacts from both urban and agricultural npss fig 9 b urban and urban and agricultural nps pollution emissions were both remarkable during september december and they are time interleaved due to the different generation mechanisms thus the abundant and lasting accumulation of tn weakened the natural remediation ability of the river pollution compared to the situation of nh3 n bach and ostrowski 2013 mcgrane et al 2017 therefore the water quality response of tn during this period was more quickly than nh3 n and the frequency of the peak values of tn concentration increased correspondingly besides the background tn concentration during dry days rose slightly as the pollutant enrichment after the wet season the overlapped continuous post rain nps pollution transported by lateral flow and the decreased river water discharge weakened timely dilution and dispersion of pollutants in addition the fertilization applied during this period further intensified the water quality deterioration 3 3 implications for watershed management based on the above simulated results the characteristics of nps pollution and water quality response in the urban rural mixed catchment could be summarized as follows the mechanisms of rainfall runoff processes and nps pollution emissions of urban and agricultural lands were different especially for the temporal dynamics of emissions urban nps pollution responded more sensitively to rainfall and its concentration especially of the first flush was greatly affected by the rainfall intensity and antecedent dry days this is consistent with previous studies chai et al 2017 wang et al 2011 in agricultural area the infiltration and store of rain water depending on the soil moisture the transportation between rainfall soil and plant made the agricultural nps pollution more complicated hashemi et al 2016 it is clear that a continuous emission contributed by the lateral flow occurred after the rain season which would lead to serious and lasting nps pollution if coupled with fertilization wu et al 2017 zia et al 2013 water quality also responded differently under the comprehensive impacts from both urban and agricultural land uses compared to a single land use in urban nps dominated areas the improved hydrodynamic condition could effectively postpone the water quality response by the natural pollution remediation chen et al 2015 by contrast with the comprehensive nps pollution contribution of both urban and agricultural land uses the water quality responded more sensitively due to the more abundant and time interleaved urban rural emissions on basis of the above characteristics and problems implications for drafting watershed plans can be drawn within urban rural mixed catchments nps pollutions management measures should be distinguished and targeted for different land uses based on their different generation mechanisms and influence factors surface sweeping in urban area during antecedent dry days and efficient fertilization management could be effective measures to control the urban and agricultural nps pollution at the source level respectively besides temporal distributions and critical generation periods of nps pollutions from different land use types should be extracted for arranging the schedule of management measures in addition improved hydrodynamic conditions were helpful to postpone and attenuate the river water quality response which could be used as another important supplement of source level measures 3 4 uncertainty analysis of simulation results it should be noted that the establishment of an integrated model involves a great amount of human effort and time consuming model setup thus simulation uncertainty would be major concern and should be routinely incorporated as a key part of integrated model deletic et al 2012 generally integrated modeling involves two kinds of uncertainty 1 uncertainty due to inaccurate input and calibration data 2 systematic model uncertainty regardless of each correct model kumar et al 2017 wijesiri et al 2016 thus simulation uncertainty should be considered in the future by considering the high complexity and associated computational effort of the integrated model in this study some simplifications were assumed that might have introduced prediction errors for example because of the high cost and human resources flow and water quality data were measured only for one year at the drainage outlet of the upstream urban catchment so the influence of data processing may lead to partially or completely missing data in time series which causes much difficulty in swmm calibration krebs et al 2014 even more due to the lack of monitoring data at the outlet of the agricultural catchment the swat model was not individually calibrated and the parameters of the swat were generated from the regionalization from a nearby catchment of chao lake which would also bring in uncertainty to the simulation results of the swat model roth et al 2016 swain and patra 2017 thus more measurements are suggested in the future as an attempt to enrich the calibration data of ungauged catchment and also the impacts of missing data in time series are worth investigating in the impacts of nps pollution in such complex catchment an accompanying concern is the prediction confidence of the integrated model at which any model can be assumed to be with uncertainty many researchers have focused on prediction uncertainty specifically addressing the sources of uncertainty uncertainty propagation evaluation methods uncertainty expression and the control of uncertainty chen et al 2016a wardropper et al 2017 future studies should the prediction accuracy and uncertainty propagation may be explained via the mechanism of swmm swat and mike11 4 conclusions in this study the nps pollutions were qualified by an integrated modelling system including swmm swat with mike 11 the temporal variation characteristics of different nps emissions and their water quality responses were extracted within an urban rural mixed catchment the results indicated that the nps pollution and its impact from mixed land uses are totally different from those single land uses catchment comparatively urban nps pollution responded sensitively to rainfall and was greatly affected by the rainfall intensity and antecedent dry days the agricultural nps pollution was characterized as time lag continuous emission during post rain season period with comprehensive impacts from urban rural land uses the time interleaved emissions and more abundant pollution accumulation from both urban and agricultural areas would lead to a decrease in the responsive time and an increase in the frequency of peak pollution concentration values even during the dry season these results would be extended to other catchments especially for those mixed land use catchments as references for water quality management acknowledgements this research was funded by the state key program of national natural science of china no 41530635 innovative research group

7373,as two key threats to receiving water bodies the generation mechanisms and processes of urban and agricultural nonpoint sources npss show clear differences which lead to distinct characteristics of water quality responses with mixed land uses catchments compared to single land use ones however few studies have provided such insights in these characteristic or quantified different water environment responses to nps pollution in this study an integrated modelling approach was developed for those complex catchments by combining three commonly used models swmm storm water management model swat soil and water assessment tool and mike 11 a case study was performed in a typical urban rural catchment of chao lake china the simulated results indicated that urban nps pollution responded sensitively to rainfall events and was greatly affected by the antecedent dry days compare to urban nps agricultural nps pollution was characterized with the time lag to rainfall depended on soil moisture and the post rain season emissions carried by lateral flows and were also affected by the local farm practice schedule with comprehensive impacts from urban rural land uses the time interleaved urban and agricultural nps pollution emissions and more abundant pollution accumulation both led to a decrease in the responsive time and an increase in the frequency of peak pollution concentration values even during the dry season these obtained characteristics can provide guidance for drafting watershed management plans in similar mixed land use catchments keywords nonpoint source pollution water environment response urban rural mixed catchment swmm swat mike11 1 introduction nonpoint source nps pollution has become a major contributor to water related problems such as river contamination aquatic ecology deterioration and serious eutrophication xiang et al 2017 with rapid urbanization the land use change brings an increase in the complexity of nps pollution as the pollution generation mechanisms and transport processes differ with land use generally agricultural nps pollutants are typically derived from fertilizers or pesticides and are transported through the soil by lateral movement and percolating water which is associated closely with climatic factors and site specific land characteristics such as soil types soil moisture land management and topography ritter and shirmohammadi 2000 the development of urban catchments increases impervious surfaces and human activity intensities resulting in the accumulation of pollutants derived from more complex sources such as commerce production and transportation on land surfaces novotny 2002 shen et al 2016 and the reduction of rainfall infiltration and surface storage with the development of artificial drainage which conveys runoff through more efficient pathways lead to an increase in storm runoff and a more flashy response of nps pollution miller and hess 2017 studying the characteristics of nps pollutions and their water environment responses has drawn wide attention to aid in the drafting of pollution control plans in situ monitoring and model prediction are two major methods used for these researches previous studies have monitored the rainfall runoff emissions and the water quality response near and far from the source location revealing the influence of the nps pollution by comparing the variability of water quality schock et al 2014 with the popularization of geographic information system gis some studies tried to develop the correlation between the landscape metrics and measured water quality indicators and thus explored the water quality responses to the nps pollutions huang et al 2016b shen et al 2016 however the time and cost that involved in monitoring process usually resulted in the scarcity of monitored data and thus limited such researches for the sake of saving monitoring efforts more and more studies tried to employ a variety of model for quantifying the water quality responses to nps pollution distributed models have been developed as essential tools for providing insights into the spatial distribution of nps pollution chen et al 2013a liu et al 2015 commonly used watershed models can be classified into urban and agricultural tools according to their functions and applicability for different land use types chen et al 2016b neitsch et al 2002 yao et al 2016 these models such as storm water management model swmm storage treatment overflow runoff model storm and soil and water assessment tool swat can simulate the impact of land management practices on water sediment and chemical yields with various land use and management conditions over long periods of time these models can simulate processes from the generation of runoff to the entry of nutrients to various water bodies as well as predict flow volume sediment levels and the amounts of nutrients leaving the sub basins of a watershed instead water environment models are widely used for aquatic systems including rivers lakes and reservoirs and represent pollutant transport and degradation processes based on hydrodynamic conditions to support environmental assessment and management dhi 2003 hamrick 1992 it should be noted that no single model can fully describe the processes of nps pollution and their water quality responses for some models such as swat and hspf transport and fate processes in the in stream were usually ignored or simplified and described using partially revised equations of established water environmental models qual2e ce qual riv1 which may affect modeling accuracy therefore integrated models have become increasingly popular for these studies migliaccio et al 2007 shi et al 2017 however existing studies have mainly focused on nps pollution from a single land use and the results are not relevant for the management of water quality in catchments with mixed land uses chinen et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 besides the present studies based on integrated models usually ignored unifying temporal resolutions of the individual models but used relatively coarser time series data such as yearly or monthly steps dadhich and nadaoka 2012 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 this assumption neglects the dynamic characteristic of nps pollution and their corresponding water environment response leading to an ignorance of the critical timings for water quality management the storm hydrograph was shown to provide the most suitable means for comparing hydrological response braud et al 2013 miller and hess 2017 however few study has provide such insight in the nps graph and their water quality response in this study the nps emissions from complex land uses and their impacts on water quality were quantified for the management of water quality under the comprehensive impacts from urban rural nps pollution a case study was performed in one of the upstream catchment shiwuli river watershed of chao lake china the specific objectives of this paper are 1 to develop the integrated model system by combining three commonly used models swmm swat and mike 11 2 to compare the temporal characteristics of nps pollution from different land uses 3 to quantify the dynamic water quality responses to the mixed nps pollution and summarize the implications for watershed management 2 materials and method 2 1 study area chao lake which locates in the east of china is one of the country s five largest freshwater lakes xu et al 2017a the lake has nearly 33 tributaries around and the whole watershed covers an area of 13 555 km2 xi et al 2015 during the last few decades excessive nutrient loads deteriorated the water quality of chao lake and resulted in severe algal blooms huang et al 2016a as one of the three major nutrient load contributors identified by the local authority the water quality of the shiwuli river has drawn much attention and was therefore took as the study area of this study the shiwuli river in hefei city east china was selected as the study area the studied river basin which is downstream of the swan lake dam flows through both urban and rural areas and covers an area of 133 km2 that includes 120 6 km2 of urban drainage area 90 68 and 12 4 km2 of agricultural area 9 32 fig 1 eleven land use types are identified fig 2 the subtropical monsoon climate brings an average annual rainfall of approximately 1000 mm into this area and the water level in the shiwuli river varies considerably during the wet june september normal march may october november and dry december february of the next year seasons zong et al 2014 the nps pollution is mainly derived from urban surface runoff drained by sewer systems agricultural land livestock and aquaculture and uncollected rural domestic sewage rainfall runoff inputs point source discharges and branch inflows constitute 43 41 and 16 of the stream water of the shiwuli river point source discharges are collected by sewage plants and the tn and nh3 n emissions are treated to meet the effluent discharge standards gb 18918 2002 which set the concentration limits of 15 mg l and 5 mg l respectively for tn and nh3 n despite of the small portion of the whole watershed the agricultural land is located as the nearby upstream catchment to chao lake which make it as a critical threat to the water quality of chao lake thus the combined impacts from both upstream urban and rural npss further deteriorated the water quality of the shiwuli river especially at the outlet of the watershed in a more complex way based on our previous measurements during 2009 2016 the tn and nh3 n concentrations of the shiwuli river at the downstream section generally exceeded 2 mg l especially during the wet season which is the worst score specified by the water quality standards gb3838 2002 zong et al 2014 2 2 model selection and data collection 2 2 1 model selection 1 swmm in this study the swmm is used to predict the urban nps load from the urban areas the swmm which was developed by the usepa is a dynamic hydrology hydraulic water quality model that replicates physical processes wijesiri et al 2016 the core modelling process includes rainfall runoff processes and tracking excess rainwater to catchment outlets through sewer networks at single event or continuous simulation steps gironás et al 2010 yao et al 2016 to date swmm has been widely and successfully used in many urban catchments in china and abroad chen et al 2013b ma et al 2012 2 swat model in this study the swat is used to simulate the agricultural nps from the rural areas the swat model is a distributed hydrological model developed by the united states department of agriculture usda neitsch et al 2002 two major components of the model are the land phase which controls the amount of water sediment and pollutant loadings in each sub basin and the routing phase defined as the movement of water sediments and other materials through the channel network of the watershed to the outlet neitsch et al 2002 swat has been widely used in simulations of agricultural nps pollution in china gassman et al 2014 3 mike 11 according to the geometry and dynamic condition of the shiwuli river a one dimension model dhi mike 11 was selected to quantify the impact of nps pollution on the receiving waters among the abundant modules available in mike 11 the hydrodynamic hd module is widely used for computing unsteady flow discharge and water level in rivers and channels using a one dimensional implicit finite difference scheme for the numerical solution of the saint venant equations doulgeris et al 2012 the advection dispersion ad module which is based on the equation of mass conservation can simulate water quality along a channel under the action of advection dispersion dhi 2003 in addition the boundary condition file bnd11 of mike 11 is used not only to specify common boundary conditions such as water levels and inflow hydrographs but also for the specification of lateral flows and their solute concentrations thus providing an interface for the swmm and the swat model to be coupled dhi 2003 specifically lateral flows along river reaches such as point source and nps boundaries were insert into the boundary editor with their type descriptions locations or domains their detailed flow and solute concentration values calculated by the swmm and the swat model were organized as external time series files which could be obtained by mike 11 through their storage path 2 2 2 data collection 1 spatial geographical data in this study an 8 m resolution digital elevation model dem land use data at 1 100000 scale and soil type data at 1 100000 scale were obtained from the geographical information monitoring cloud platform which was launched by the beijing digital view technology co ltd figs 1 and 2 topographical data of the river channel geometrical data of the cross sections and the parameters of eight overflow weirs located at different distances along the channel were collected from the water conservancy department of hefei city 2 monitoring data in this study four meteorological stations were set up along the shiwuli river watershed fig 1 basic meteorological data including series of rainfall air temperature and other weather data were obtained at five minute and daily intervals all the data were compiled and used as model inputs point source discharges from the sewage plants were monitored from sep 1st to 7th 2015 based on local eutrophication characteristics the daily samples were collected and the mean concentrations of tn and nh3 n were tested the sample processing occurred within 6 h of collection and followed standard methods sepa 2002 the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method and the salicylic acid spectrophotometric method were used to test tn and nh3 n respectively nps pollution monitoring was undertaken at a sewer network outfall a2 located upstream of the shiwuli river watershed fig 1 discharge flow was derived from depth velocity readings taken using a current meter combined with a water level sensor installed in the sewer the runoff emission samples were collected at intervals of 2 min during rainfall events on july 23rd 2015 nh3 n and tn were tested sample processing occurred within 6 h of collection and followed standard methods sepa 2002 water level at hourly interval were monitored during jun dec of 2015by three hydrometric stations consisting of staff gauges water level sensors digital transmission and related terminal display equipment fig 1 water quality were monitored by collecting daily samples at a downstream river section during oct dec in 2015 fig 1 these samples were also processed within 6 h after collection and tested for tn and nh3 n concentrations with the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method and the salicylic acid spectrophotometric method respectively in addition monthly grab samples were analysed for a range of chemical parameters including tn and nh3 n in the state controlled section the state controlled cross section was located at the end stretch of the shiwuli river the inlet to lake chao where the water quality was expected to be controlled under the limit of 2 0 mg l 2 3 model setup and calibration 2 3 1 model setup fig 3 shows the detailed framework of the integrated modelling method the simulated flows and nps loads from swmm and the swat model were used as inputs into the mike 11 model as boundary conditions pollution sources specifically agricultural nps pollution was simulated by swat for the entirety of 2015 the daily flows and tn and nh3 n concentrations for each sub basin were calculated and used as inputs for the mike 11 model the runoff flows and water qualities at the outfalls of the sewer network were also simulated for 2015 using swmm the simulated results included flow nh3 n and tn concentrations at 15 minute intervals in order to match the temporal resolutions of the two set of time series data the swmm results were converted into daily interval series using weighted average method before being input into the mike 11 the calibrated integrated model was run to calculate the daily river water quality under the impacts of nps pollution the detailed modelling process is now described 1 swmm setup in swmm the urban catchment was divided into 1311 sub catchments for each sub catchment land use types were categorized as green land factory land and commercial and residential areas the sub catchments were further subdivided based on imperviousness the horton equation was selected to calculate the infiltration rainwater losses from pervious surfaces and dynamic wave theory was adopted for the flow routing computations gironás et al 2010 the water quality module was used for simulating nps processes in which exponential equations were selected for both pollutant build up and wash off calculations critical parameters such as drainage area flow width and imperviousness were derived from the geographic information system gis layer in addition drainage data were input to determine the inlet locations of the sewer network and conduit parameters finally the flow rates and depths and pollution concentrations and loads were tracked to the outlets of the urban pipe system to then serve as mike inputs 2 swat setup for the swat model the agricultural watershed was delineated into 13 sub catchments and 69 hydrological response units hrus digital elevation data fig 1 land use fig 2 soil data fig 1 climate data and agricultural management practices were collected and used as swat inputs the climate data including the daily temperatures precipitation levels wind speeds relative humidity and solar radiation levels were obtained from the meteorological stations and input into the swat model as driving data farming management information was gathered through surveys and statistics soil data including information on soil reactions conductivities water capacities and flood frequencies were collected at a scale of 1 10000 swat was then run with a daily step size to simulate the water quantity and quality parameters for all the stream segments from the agricultural watershed as mike inputs 3 mike 11 setup for mike 11 the river network was digitized using a topographical map derived from the dem considering that the weixi river branch had been diverted into another watershed for a water environment project only one major branch the xuxiao river and the 22 64 km long main stream were generated fig 5 bed resistances in the form of manning n were applied for different channel segmentations whereas uniform dispersion coefficients and decay constants were applied throughout the river channel fifty available surveyed river sections were employed within the model to define the river geometry eight water control structures located along the main channel were represented as weirs fig 4 due to the constriction of the upstream swan lake dam zero flow boundary conditions were applied to the upstream open ends of the mike 11 river network the downstream boundary at the state controlled section was set to an open q h boundary based on the relationships between the monitored discharge and the water level with the annual mean tn and nh3 n concentrations swmm and the swat model were coupled with mike 11 at the boundary editor interface by inputting the swmm and swat simulated time series data as pollution sources for mike 11 a total of 79 point source inflow boundaries were set including the discharge from sewage plants and urban nps pollution drained by the storm water sewer system according to the populations of the villages the amounts of domestic sewage were estimated and input to the model as point source pollution 2 3 2 calibration of the integrated model model calibration which is the process of estimating model parameters using a pair wise comparison between the predicted and measured points is the key and critical step in model application in this study a two phase step was conducted when constructing the integrated model first the watershed model swmm was calibrated based on the monitoring data at the drainage outlet and then used as inputs for the stream model mike11 for swmm the flow and water quality observation data were obtained during a rainfall event on july 23rd 2015 at an outfall a2 that was located in a typical upstream sub catchment mike 11 was then calibrated by fitting the simulated and measured data collected in the stream sections including the water levels monitored at a midstream hydrometric station from june 26th to october 1st in 2015 and water quality observation data from october 1st to december 20th in 2015 at a downstream cross section besides the hydrological parameters were calibrated prior to the water quality parameters and important parameters of each model were identified via a sensitivity analysis to fully calibrate the integrated model an auto calibration platform was developed by the authors the platform provided a free cloud computing environment that enabled the speeding up of calibration a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii was used to search for better parameters bekele and nicklow 2007 the mean relative error was used as the objective function to evaluate the models adaptabilities and the formula was as follows 1 e mr i 1 n o i p i o i n where o is the observed value p is the predicted value and n is the number of data points the closer mean relative error approximates to 0 the more reliable the model is the nsga ii calibration program specified value ranges for each calibrated model parameter and regarded these value groups as chromosomes which were coded with decision variables a random population was initialized at first for each model running the simulation results were compared with observed data and the fitness for the non domination levels were evaluated by calculation the objective function new generation of chromosomes were then created based on the fitness evaluation chromosomes would reproduce until the maximum generation number was achieved xie et al 2017 in this study after 10 000 model running the most optimized group of parameters were then be selected by ranking all the groups according to the order of the mean relative error values regarding swmm some sensitive parameters were picked out by the sensitivity analysis the calibration results of these parameters are illustrated in fig 6 at the monitored drainage network outfall the variation trends of the observed and simulated pollution concentrations were generally consistent fig 5 during the calibration period the mean relative error values for nh3 n and tn were 0 26 and 0 147 respectively demonstrating the relatively good performance of the simulation the calibrated parameters and their values are listed in table 1 regarding the integrated model the variation trends of the observed water level and water quality in the shiwuli river and the simulated values from the integrated model were generally consistent fig 6 during the calibration period the mean relative error of the simulated water level compared to the observed value was 0 002 supporting the good performance for the hydrodynamic simulation for the ad module the mean relative error values of the simulated tn and nh3 n concentrations compared to the observed values were 0 26 and 0 45 respectively which indicated acceptable performance of water quality module ahmed 2010 eisakhani et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation of nps pollution the simulated nps results are shown in fig 7 according to the simulation results the runoff flow per unit area from urban surface showed a more sensitive response to the rainfall due to the high imperviousness of urban land surfaces and efficiently conveyance by drainage network novotny 2002 by contrast the agricultural runoff responded to rainfall differently during different hydrological periods during january may when light rain dominants the precipitation events agricultural runoff generation usually occurred after several rainfall events and the flow volumes were apparently less compared to urban sources indicating the time lag and reduction of rainfall runoff caused by soil infiltration during wet season jun sep agricultural runoff increased with more frequent and intensive rainfall as the soil moisture increased by accumulating more rain water and the rainfall infiltration accordingly decreased penna et al 2015 ritter and shirmohammadi 2000 after that even when the rainfall decreased sharply during october to december there was still a continuous runoff generation from agricultural lands attributing to the lateral flow from the rain water stored in soil during wet season regarding the nps pollution concentration situations varied for each sewer outfall in urban area their annual mean concentrations ranged from 0 11 to 15 31 mg l for tn and 0 075 11 01 mg l for nh3 n the largest event mean concentration emc even reached 46 73 mg l for tn and 32 891 mg l for nh3 n while both were much higher than the water quality standard required for the shiwuli river indicating serious upstream nps pollution during the whole simulation period the exceeding standard rate of each outfall ranged from 6 3 to 88 3 regarding tn and 5 76 8 regarding nh3 n as one of the major nps pollution contributor the sewer outfall a2 was taken as an example for detailed analysis at outfall a2 the daily mean concentrations of nh3 n ranged from 0 15 to 36 81 mg l and the annual mean concentration was 7 84 mg l fig 8 as the generation mechanism of urban nps pollution is mainly based on the pollutant build up and wash off the runoff could be regard as a major factor affecting urban nps pollution therefore the fluctuation trends of tn and nh3 n concentration at a2 outfall almost matched the hydrograph of urban runoff flow fig 8 besides the concentrations of nps pollution are influenced greatly by the antecedent dry days of rainfall events which determined the amounts of pollutants built up on land surfaces adams and chen 2006 and the peak values of daily mean concentrations usually occurred at the beginning of rainfall periods due to the relatively lower rainfall intensity and the first flush effect alfonso et al 2014 in the agricultural area the peak value of the simulated nh3 n at the outlet could reach 10 mg l and the average concentration was 0 54 mg l fig 8 the simulated maximum daily mean concentration of tn was 60 mg l and the average concentration reached 11 mg l which was much higher than for nh3 n serious agricultural nps pollution mainly occurred in spring feb april and autumn sep nov during these periods the relatively low rainfall runoffs and stream flows were insufficient to attenuate the pollutant loads chen et al 2011 in addition the key farming timings for this watershed occurred during these periods which applied heavy nutrient loads to the soils by fertilization and led to the high tn concentrations xu et al 2017b the simulated annual tn and nh3 n nps pollution loads were 421 55 t a and 180 24 t a respectively from these values the urban source category contributed 216 49 t a tn and 166 41 t a nh3 n accounting for 51 26 and 92 25 respectively table 2 nh3 n emissions were almost dominated by urban nonpoint sources and could represent the characters of urban nonpoint source pollution to a certain extent as for tn agricultural sources contributed a comparable portion as urban sources because of the application of no3 n base fertilizer 3 2 river water quality response the simulated results of the hydrodynamic condition in the shiwuli river showed a serious water shortage problem characterized by low stream discharges in the channel under dry weather fig 9 a under rainy weather with the supplements of rainwater and surface runoff the river discharge could even rise to 284 73 m3 s and the water level rose accordingly increasing 0 5 5 0 m which helped promote water flows and natural pollution remediation mechanisms such as the mixing transport and degradation of pollutants campolo et al 1999 however serious nps pollution followed and led to a deterioration of water quality the maximum tn concentration at the state controlled cross section could reach 12 0 mg l in rainy weather and the maximum nh3 n concentration was 4 0 mg l fig 9 fig 9 showed different water quality responses of tn and nh3 n concentrations to the nps pollution as for nh3 n the concentration was contributed mainly by the urban npss thus representing the water quality response of nps pollution to nps from urban land use to some extents the variation trend of nh3 n concentration was shown to be more according with the river hydrograph and rainfall however comparing to the responses of nps pollutions to rainfall the river water quality response lagged obviously as the peak values of nh3 n concentrations usually occurred after a few continuous days of nps pollution emissions fig 9 c indicating that the improved hydrodynamic conditions in rainy days could alleviated water quality deterioration effectively by the natural pollution remediation mechanisms by contrast the water quality response of tn was more complicated under the comprehensive impacts from both urban and agricultural npss fig 9 b urban and urban and agricultural nps pollution emissions were both remarkable during september december and they are time interleaved due to the different generation mechanisms thus the abundant and lasting accumulation of tn weakened the natural remediation ability of the river pollution compared to the situation of nh3 n bach and ostrowski 2013 mcgrane et al 2017 therefore the water quality response of tn during this period was more quickly than nh3 n and the frequency of the peak values of tn concentration increased correspondingly besides the background tn concentration during dry days rose slightly as the pollutant enrichment after the wet season the overlapped continuous post rain nps pollution transported by lateral flow and the decreased river water discharge weakened timely dilution and dispersion of pollutants in addition the fertilization applied during this period further intensified the water quality deterioration 3 3 implications for watershed management based on the above simulated results the characteristics of nps pollution and water quality response in the urban rural mixed catchment could be summarized as follows the mechanisms of rainfall runoff processes and nps pollution emissions of urban and agricultural lands were different especially for the temporal dynamics of emissions urban nps pollution responded more sensitively to rainfall and its concentration especially of the first flush was greatly affected by the rainfall intensity and antecedent dry days this is consistent with previous studies chai et al 2017 wang et al 2011 in agricultural area the infiltration and store of rain water depending on the soil moisture the transportation between rainfall soil and plant made the agricultural nps pollution more complicated hashemi et al 2016 it is clear that a continuous emission contributed by the lateral flow occurred after the rain season which would lead to serious and lasting nps pollution if coupled with fertilization wu et al 2017 zia et al 2013 water quality also responded differently under the comprehensive impacts from both urban and agricultural land uses compared to a single land use in urban nps dominated areas the improved hydrodynamic condition could effectively postpone the water quality response by the natural pollution remediation chen et al 2015 by contrast with the comprehensive nps pollution contribution of both urban and agricultural land uses the water quality responded more sensitively due to the more abundant and time interleaved urban rural emissions on basis of the above characteristics and problems implications for drafting watershed plans can be drawn within urban rural mixed catchments nps pollutions management measures should be distinguished and targeted for different land uses based on their different generation mechanisms and influence factors surface sweeping in urban area during antecedent dry days and efficient fertilization management could be effective measures to control the urban and agricultural nps pollution at the source level respectively besides temporal distributions and critical generation periods of nps pollutions from different land use types should be extracted for arranging the schedule of management measures in addition improved hydrodynamic conditions were helpful to postpone and attenuate the river water quality response which could be used as another important supplement of source level measures 3 4 uncertainty analysis of simulation results it should be noted that the establishment of an integrated model involves a great amount of human effort and time consuming model setup thus simulation uncertainty would be major concern and should be routinely incorporated as a key part of integrated model deletic et al 2012 generally integrated modeling involves two kinds of uncertainty 1 uncertainty due to inaccurate input and calibration data 2 systematic model uncertainty regardless of each correct model kumar et al 2017 wijesiri et al 2016 thus simulation uncertainty should be considered in the future by considering the high complexity and associated computational effort of the integrated model in this study some simplifications were assumed that might have introduced prediction errors for example because of the high cost and human resources flow and water quality data were measured only for one year at the drainage outlet of the upstream urban catchment so the influence of data processing may lead to partially or completely missing data in time series which causes much difficulty in swmm calibration krebs et al 2014 even more due to the lack of monitoring data at the outlet of the agricultural catchment the swat model was not individually calibrated and the parameters of the swat were generated from the regionalization from a nearby catchment of chao lake which would also bring in uncertainty to the simulation results of the swat model roth et al 2016 swain and patra 2017 thus more measurements are suggested in the future as an attempt to enrich the calibration data of ungauged catchment and also the impacts of missing data in time series are worth investigating in the impacts of nps pollution in such complex catchment an accompanying concern is the prediction confidence of the integrated model at which any model can be assumed to be with uncertainty many researchers have focused on prediction uncertainty specifically addressing the sources of uncertainty uncertainty propagation evaluation methods uncertainty expression and the control of uncertainty chen et al 2016a wardropper et al 2017 future studies should the prediction accuracy and uncertainty propagation may be explained via the mechanism of swmm swat and mike11 4 conclusions in this study the nps pollutions were qualified by an integrated modelling system including swmm swat with mike 11 the temporal variation characteristics of different nps emissions and their water quality responses were extracted within an urban rural mixed catchment the results indicated that the nps pollution and its impact from mixed land uses are totally different from those single land uses catchment comparatively urban nps pollution responded sensitively to rainfall and was greatly affected by the rainfall intensity and antecedent dry days the agricultural nps pollution was characterized as time lag continuous emission during post rain season period with comprehensive impacts from urban rural land uses the time interleaved emissions and more abundant pollution accumulation from both urban and agricultural areas would lead to a decrease in the responsive time and an increase in the frequency of peak pollution concentration values even during the dry season these results would be extended to other catchments especially for those mixed land

7374,the application of global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis techniques to groundwater models of deep sedimentary basins are typically challenged by large computational burdens combined with associated numerical stability issues the highly parameterized approaches required for exploring the predictive uncertainty associated with the heterogeneous hydraulic characteristics of multiple aquifers and aquitards in these sedimentary basins exacerbate these issues a novel patch modelling methodology is proposed for improving the computational feasibility of stochastic modelling analysis of large scale and complex groundwater models the method incorporates a nested groundwater modelling framework that enables efficient simulation of groundwater flow and transport across multiple spatial and temporal scales the method also allows different processes to be simulated within different model scales existing nested model methodologies are extended by employing joining predictions for extrapolating prediction salient information from one model scale to the next this establishes a feedback mechanism supporting the transfer of information from child models to parent models as well as parent models to child models in a computationally efficient manner this feedback mechanism is simple and flexible and ensures that while the salient small scale features influencing larger scale prediction are transferred back to the larger scale this does not require the live coupling of models this method allows the modelling of multiple groundwater flow and transport processes using separate groundwater models that are built for the appropriate spatial and temporal scales within a stochastic framework while also removing the computational burden associated with live model coupling the utility of the method is demonstrated by application to an actual large scale aquifer injection scheme in australia keywords prediction uncertainty groundwater transport modelling upscaling 1 introduction the development of the on shore unconventional gas industry has been rapidly increasing in australia and worldwide over the last decade currently coal seam gas csg is the most targeted of the unconventional gas resources in australia with widespread commercial production of csg already commenced in the surat and bowen basins in queensland coal seam gas development often involves large scale extraction of groundwater from coal seams to reduce hydrostatic pressure this depressurization is necessary before desorption of the gas from the coal matrix can occur and may be sustained for up to 40 to 50 years depending on the productive life of the csg field the disposal of this produced water from csg wells is also a significant challenge and the re injection of this water into aquifers above or below the coal seam is one disposal method commonly considered the hydraulic and geochemical impacts of such depressurization and subsequent csg water reinjection on receptors such as springs and drinking water wells are critical for the assessment of the environmental impacts of large scale csg reinjection projects assessment of these impacts involves development of flow and transport models at multiple scales and undertaking prediction uncertainty analysis using these complex models this paper presents a novel and efficient modelling methodology for the simulation and prediction uncertainty analysis of groundwater flow and transport processes in multiple spatio temporal scales the applicability of the method is demonstrated using a realistic example for the assessment of impacts associated with csg water reinjection predicting the cumulative groundwater impacts of csg development involves development of large scale basin wide groundwater models as the csg extraction wells are distributed over large areas of sedimentary basins the large scale of these operations are challenging for model based risk assessments which are required to support the resource management decisions in this context sreekanth et al 2017 part of the challenge relates to the computational burden of large scale models sreekanth and datta 2011 2013 sreekanth et al 2016 with their associated long model run times which can undermine the model calibration and uncertainty analysis efforts required of a decision support model one approach used to manage this burden is through significant simplification of model detail although this can inflate model errors there is always a trade off between predictive accuracy and computational tractability that becomes more troublesome when predictions are sensitive to small scale parameter detail this is exacerbated when historical observations of flow and transport processes occur across multiple scales all of which must be simulated within the model calibration phase if the maximum information content of data is to be harnessed we focus here on the assessments of the cumulative impacts of aquifer water injection since these represent a particularly extreme example of modelling across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales and processes the modelling project will typically consider regional sub regional and local hydrogeological and geochemical data including groundwater levels stream flows aquifer water and rock chemistry aquifer property testing and aquifer tracer tests balancing the accuracy of the simulated impacts in areas and times of interest with computational tractability is complex the computational tractability side of this balance considers the model s spatial and temporal discretization the processes being modelled and the parameterization detail employed within the model this paper describes the development and implementation of a novel hierarchical patch dynamic modelling methodology used to address these challenges the method deploys a nested groundwater modelling framework that enables efficient simulation of groundwater flow and transport across multiple spatial and temporal scales and allows different processes to be simulated within different model scales existing local grid refinement lgr methods provide a satisfactory solution to the issue of spatial discretization mehl and hill 2002 promoted locally refining the spatial discretization of finite difference grids of groundwater models to increase prediction accuracy initial lgr with structured grids e g modflow resulted in large numbers of surplus nodes and hence de coupled parent and child models were proposed as an alternative implementation however de coupled versions only provide for the transfer of information from coarse scale parent models to establish the boundary conditions in the child models akbar et al 1972 mrosovsky and ridings 1974 graham and smart 1980 ward et al 1987 leake et al 1998 leake and claar 1999 more recent direct embedding of child models within the parent models has enabled the information transfer in both directions across the parent and child models mehl and hill 2002 2004 2006 gedeon and mallants 2012 furthermore the recent developments of modflow usg panday et al 2013 and modflow6 langevin et al 2017 which implement a generalized control volume finite difference formulation have enabled local grid refinement without the surplus node problem of earlier local grid refinement methods the examples above discuss model spatial discretization discretization of the model into finer time steps and stress periods at targeted locations is also important when simulating groundwater transport including csg water injection impacts for example smaller time steps may be essential for meeting convergence criteria like the courant friedrichs lewy condition for transport modelling or may be driven by the requirement for high resolution predictions but are not required for simulating regional scale flow patterns similarly discretization of the model into fine time steps may be required if high frequency monitoring data e g hourly measurements of head from a pumping test are used for calibrating the model the need to discretize parts of a model domain with time steps or stress periods at a greater level of detail from the wider model domain adds another challenge to the discretization and computational efficiency despite the recent developments in lgr implementation and unstructured grid modelling there is still a requirement for consistent time discretization between parent and child models because the information being represented in the regional and local scale models are relevant to very different time scales e g years to hours this inflexibility of existing parent child model construction methodologies for a constant time discretization creates too great a computational burden in terms of model run times in the csg context furthermore this burden is unnecessary in terms of extracting the maximum information content from the available data and in terms of predictive accuracy the local grid refinement is typically considered in terms of spatial discretization and largely neglects temporal discretization as described above however another restriction of the current lgr framework occurs when running transport simulations for transport simulations parent and child models must be simulated independently and only one way coupling of concentration initial and boundary conditions from the parent to the child model heywood 2013 is possible this one way coupling precludes the effective information transfer from small scale tests to the larger scale predictions together the temporal and transport simulation limitations of current lgr methods undermine their effectiveness in the csg reinjection context furthermore even in terms of spatial discretization the current structure of lgr leads to unnecessarily long model run times when considering the multiple coupled model runs that are required for model calibration and uncertainty analysis to address this unnecessary and sometimes prohibitive inflation of computational effort we developed a novel computationally efficient and simplified alternative to the hierarchical patch dynamics paradigm hpdp wu and loucks 1995 wu and david 2002 the hierarchical patch dynamic paradigm was developed in ecological studies as a way of accounting for the heterogeneity observed in ecological responses in time and space and the hierarchical linkages across different scales of space and time li et al 2006a developed a methodology to implement hpdp for solving complex groundwater modelling problems across multiple spatial scales to solve the curse of dimensionality problem with its attendant computational burden while li s work provided an important improvement in terms of reducing the computational burden of large scale models with associated salient small scale details the computational burden of the method remained too great in our study we propose an efficient patch modelling pm method to extend the hpdp for modelling multiple groundwater flow and transport processes across varying spatial and temporal scales within a stochastic framework the extension employs joining predictions which extrapolate the salient information from one model scale to the next establishing a feed back mechanism supporting the transfer of knowledge from child models to parent models very simply and computationally efficiently the flexibility of this feedback mechanism ensures that while the salient small scale features influencing larger scale prediction are transferred back to the larger scale this does not require the live coupling of models this essentially removes the computational burden associated with live model coupling the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows section 2 describes the methodology for multi scale groundwater flow and transport modelling using hpdp and feedback mechanisms section 3 describes application of this methodology for the stochastic prediction of concentration changes in a well field and groundwater head changes in a regional aquifer system in the surat basin in queensland australia section 4 presents and discusses the results and section 5 gives a summary of the conclusions obtained from this work 2 methodology in this study we use the patch modelling pm method to simulate regional scale flow and transport changes in an injection well field using a range of information scales and data types to inform these simulations the dynamics of different groundwater flow and transport processes are often evident in distinct spatial and temporal scales for example while large pressure changes in confined aquifers are almost instantaneously felt across hundreds of meters mass transport in groundwater systems over the same distance may occur in a time span of many years to decades flow process in regional scale deep aquifer systems that extend over hundreds of kilometers often take a time span of hundreds or thousands of years similar disparities also often exist in the resolution of data available for calibrating groundwater models aquifer pumping tests and groundwater tracer tests conducted in areas of interest result in fine scale measurements of groundwater head and or concentration data with measurements on a minute hourly or daily time scale across a small area on the other hand monitoring of regional scale flow is often limited to sparse measurements of groundwater head with limited measurement frequencies thus spatial and temporal resolution of data collected even for the same process are often collected and represent a range of different aquifer scales fig 1 illustrates multiple spatiotemporal scales involved in the simulation of groundwater flow and transport processes the pmm method enables the breaking down of a complex model of a system with multiple processes into multiple patch models where each patch model is of an appropriate spatiotemporal scale to enhance the extraction of information from the dataset and or to enhance the accuracy of the prediction the use of these patch models helps to overcome the curse of dimensionality incurred in modelling complex systems li et al 2006a as the spatial and temporal extent of each patch model and the processes simulated within it need only be sufficient in extent to allow extraction of information from available data and to transfer the salient components of this information to the prediction the proposed stochastic modelling approach using pm method has three essential components i identification of the patch boundaries and grid resolution ii development of calibration specific and prediction specific patch models with feed back mechanism and defining relevant joining predictions and iii stochastic predictive simulations it is the novel use of joining predictions as a feedback mechanism that provides the advances in computational efficiency in the calibration and stochastic context these components are now described 2 1 identification of patch model domain extents boundaries and spatiotemporal resolution two important considerations drive identification of patch model domain extent model boundaries and model resolution the first consideration relates to the process characteristics to be simulated the associated data densities in space and time and the predictions to be simulated the model resolution and density of parameterization affect both the degree to which information can be extracted from available data and the accuracy with which a prediction can be simulated for example simulation of transport processes and or steep gradient flow near an injection well field demands fine spatial and temporal discretization of the model grid in practice higher data densities also occur where there is an increased focus on the process details this is because groundwater availability usage potential for impacts from industrial activities monitoring densities tend to be spatially and temporally correlated and are clustered around areas of interest the increased focus and data densities necessitate the development of patch models with finer spatial scales for such areas of interest appropriate grid resolution is then determined based on the process requirements density of data and computational tractability of patch models the proposed pm method provides the flexibility to choose one or more temporal scales for a chosen patch model defining multiple temporal discretization schemes for a chosen patch model enables optimal use of monitoring data available in different temporal scales a patch model can be run thrice in batch processing mode each time using a distinct temporal discretization to calibrate the model parameters using three separate sets of data in different scales for example hydraulic properties of the patch model can be constrained by yearly head measurements from a regional monitoring network hourly head measurements from a pump test and monthly concentration measurements not requiring any lumping of finer scale data the second major factor that guides the delineation of patch boundaries is the sensitivity of the outputs from calibration and predictive simulations to the patch model boundary conditions uncertainty of any simulation using a patch model decreases with decreasing sensitivity of solutions to boundary conditions hence patch boundary identification aims to avoid solutions which are overly sensitive to boundary conditions therefore selection of patch model domains and their boundaries also involve the quantification of the contribution to prediction uncertainty from these boundary conditions and efforts are made to avoid any significant boundary effects the remaining boundary condition uncertainty is incorporated into the stochastic simulation step refer to section 2 3 2 2 development of patch models with feed back mechanism and defining relevant joining predictions patch model development follows a two way hierarchical approach starting from the coarsest scale parent model at the highest level to the finest scale model at the lowest level li et al 2006a the parent model at the highest level is developed for the entire areal extent and time horizon of interest the spatial and temporal discretization of the model at the highest level is often determined primarily on the basis of computational tractability then patch model boundaries are identified within the parent model based on the considerations described in the previous section representation of process complexities and increased solution accuracy are achieved through development of patch models in the lower levels the finest scale model s at the lowest level are primarily used to extract fine scale information that will be upscaled to larger scale patch models that will be used for predictive simulations this approach facilitates transfer of knowledge between patch models in both directions the two way information transfer across patch models is based on the premise that models in different scales hold different types of information based on the data types used to constrain them for example a coarse scale flow model calibrated to regional head observations holds information on flux volumes and flow directions this regional scale model is suitable to constrain the lateral fluxes in a patch model nested within this parent model on the other hand a fine scale model calibrated to pump test or tracer test holds information on hydraulic properties in the vicinity of the well furthermore this fine scale information is useful for constraining the hydraulic properties in a cluster of model cells corresponding to this area in a coarser model thus while the higher level patch models provide boundary conditions and regional scale information to the models at the lower levels the models from the lower levels provide information that is then upscaled and fed back to models at higher levels this implementation is essentially that of li et al 2006a and requires running the larger and smaller patch models in a coupled and iterative framework however this fully coupled iterative use of the hpdp methodology as detailed in li et al 2006a still results in a significant computational burden the need to address this computational burden led to the implementations of joining predictions as a mechanism for decoupling models within the calibration while accounting for prediction uncertainty dynamic patch modelling proposed in li et al 2006a would be more challenging although not impossible if prediction uncertainty is to be accounted in the workflow our simplified method provides a pragmatic solution to this problem that can be readily implemented using widely used modelling software note that the use of the joining prediction used to achieve this computational efficiency passes on prediction salient information from a patch model to a prediction model if a new prediction is being made the practitioner has only to make the required new joining predictions for each model prediction that is required this approach is therefore infinitely flexible these joining predictions build on previous work which decouple large and small data and model scales and processes in a stochastic framework as developed and implemented in moore et al 2015 and moore et al 2010 in a csg and virus transport context respectively the former paper used response functions as a version of a joining prediction and the second used nested variograms based on tracer tests and regional pumping tests respectively this paper combines these process simplification and scale data stochastic representation aspects of stochastic joining predictions the joining prediction has two parts firstly the local scale patch model is calibrated to the data available at that scale secondly a prediction of the type being made to assess the larger scale impacts is made with the small scale model at a time and location that can used as a calibration constraint in the prediction model it is via these two steps that the knowledge transfer continues to be made in two directions despite the decoupling of the model runs this joining prediction extrapolates the simulated behavior of the system to the scale of the patch model at the higher level the sole purpose of the joining prediction is to extract salient information from calibrating to fine scale data but without the computational burden that would usually be required to do so this is achieved by using the joining prediction as a calibration target for coarser models extrapolation of the prediction is intended to make it tenable for the coarser model scale because this joining prediction is an extrapolation within the calibrated patch model it is accompanied by uncertainty which can be incorporated in the weighting of the observation in the larger model calibration to the joining prediction if stationarity in fine scale hydraulic property heterogeneity can be assumed then the upscaled feedback is not only to the specific area where the fine scale field testing has been undertaken but to anywhere within this heterogeneous strata within a stochastic framework where model domain boundary conditions and joining predictions are optimally defined then an iterative solution with fully coupled patch models can be avoided yet still achieve full two way knowledge transfer this full coupling of models to facilitate two way knowledge transfer does incur additional computational time compared to solving models with knowledge transfer occurring in only one direction however there may be cases where simultaneous or fully coupled models may be needed to facilitate the two way knowledge transfer between patch models this may require solution of patch models iteratively with mutually constraining information to ensure consistency in the simulated variables across patch models given the distinct spatial and temporal scales at which groundwater flow and transport processes occur it is often possible to carefully define patch model boundaries to avoid iterative solution for example in our case study a fine scale patch model is developed for interpreting concentration data obtained from injection tracer tests by choosing the model boundary sufficiently far from the injection well where the groundwater head is not influenced by the low injection rate and a constant head boundary condition can be assumed thus lateral boundary conditions from the coarser patch model are not required for constraining this fine scale transport model instead the information transfer is unidirectional being from the fine scale model to the patch model at the next higher level thus by carefully choosing the spatial disposition of the patch models and their boundary conditions circumstances which lead to the requirement of iterative solution of patch models can often be avoided finally it is noted that models developed using the proposed hpdp can be classified into two broad classes viz i data information input patch models or calibration models and ii prediction patch models which are defined on the basis of the scale of the prediction required and an acceptable level of predictive accuracy the input patch models provide information for constraining the prediction patch models which are used for undertaking the prediction analysis the input patch models that have only one way knowledge transfer need not be iteratively solved in the case study presented in this work the models at the highest and lowest levels are used as input models 2 3 stochastic predictive simulation as outlined above the extended hpdp methodology accounts for the real world data complexity without sacrificing computational efficiency by building a suite of patch models each designed to optimally extract information from the available data in multiple scales similarly the prediction models can be built at appropriate complexity levels and spatial and temporal discretization that ensure the computational tractability for undertaking uncertainty analysis and also where possible a minimum predictive error by breaking up the predictive models into different patches for different processes separate uncertainty analyses for these separate processes can be undertaken most efficiently calibration constrained uncertainty analysis using null space monte carlo nsmc approach tonkin and doherty 2009 is used for stochastic predictive simulations in this study uncertainty contributed by the lateral boundary conditions and upscaled parameters obtained from input models can be quantified with this approach by appropriately parameterizing them in the prediction models the reader is directed to tonkin and doherty 2009 and doherty et al 2011 for implementations of this method a brief description of the theoretical basis of the nsmc approach is given in the following implementation of monte carlo methods uses a parameter covariance matrix c p can be constructed to characterize the spatial variability of the hydrologic properties random parameter fields p r can then generated by using this parameter covariance matrix of innate parameter variability however very few model runs using these randomly generated parameter fields will result in an acceptable value of the calibration objective function implementation of the nsmc method uses a posterior approximation of the parameter covariance matrix instead of where calibration constraints have been imposed on the parameter covariance structure e g or depending on which implementation of the nsmc method is deployed refer to tonkin and doherty 2009 and doherty et al 2011 for further details 3 case study the pm method as described in previous section was applied to a case study where groundwater flow and transport processes were simulated to assess groundwater impacts from a proposed large scale csg water injection scheme the proposed csg water production is from the walloon coal measures wcm which is the target formation for csg extraction in the surat basin queensland australia the water reinjection is into the precipice sandstone deep freshwater aquifer which is stratigraphically lower than the wcm refer to fig 2 for schematic description of local stratigraphy in addition to the csg extraction from the wcm there is large scale groundwater extraction from interconnected aquifers above and below the wcm for uses including large scale irrigation stock and domestic and urban water supply a suite of numerical groundwater models were developed to simulate both i predicted groundwater head changes occurring on a regional scale and ii predicted concentration of potential conservative contaminants mobilized by the proposed injection of csg water the possible groundwater head increase impact represents a potential positive impact should the injection cause raised heads sufficiently such that artesian conditions return within the region and allow stock and domestic bores to flow as they once did on the other hand the possible mobilization of contaminants is considered a potential negative impact as insufficient dilution may result in contamination of stock and domestic bores in the vicinity of the injection well field a total of 3400 data points were available for calibrating the models represented different scales and processes including i groundwater head observations from 1541 regional monitoring bores in the basin and ii aquifer drawdown measurements from pumping tests and iii concentration measurements resulting from injection tracer tests conducted for the injection well field the suite of groundwater flow and transport models constructed cover four different spatial and temporal scales extents shown in fig 3 each patch model except the largest regional model was nested within another patch model at the next higher level horizontal and vertical discretization of these four models as well as their respective uses is illustrated in fig 2 all of these models were calibrated using the parameter estimation software pest and its utility software doherty 2016 the first and coarsest scale model in this group is called the regional model qwc 2012 which has the purpose of enabling the identification of appropriate model domain extents and boundary locations and conditions for the nested patch models the second model the sub regional model was built and calibrated specifically for predictive simulation of groundwater head increases and flow changes that may occur with the csg water injection within the sub regional model domain the precipice sandstone layer is steeply dipping from its outcrop in the north of the model domain to a depth of around 2000 m in the south of the model domain the third model the well field water quality model was developed for running the predictive simulations which examine the range of contaminant concentrations that may occur at increasing distances from the well field the injection well field is located at the center of the well field water quality model domain the elevation of the top of precipice sandstone aquifer is also contoured in the map depicted in fig 3 it can be observed from the elevation contours that within the extent of the well field model the precipice sandstone is relatively flat the fourth model the 2d radial transport model is very small and located within the well field domain and was built to model the flow and transport in the immediate vicinity of an injection trial bore in such a way as to extract as much information regarding the and transport processes associated with injected csg water this model was also used to provide joining predictions that were used to transfer this information to the well field scale model these models and how they are interact are now described in detail 3 1 the regional model the regional model was originally developed by qwc 2012 for the assessment of cumulative drawdown impacts caused by csg groundwater extraction in coal seams of the wcm fig 2 it simulates all of the current abstraction stresses within the region which is essential for characterization of the flow system within which reinjection scheme will occur a preliminary analysis of the injection scenario was undertaken using this model this preliminary analysis involved simulating the groundwater flow and particle tracks resulting from injecting 30 ml d of csg produced water for 30 years through 20 injection wells the advection transport observation adv2 package of modflow was used for simulating the particle tracks both the groundwater flow and particle tracking simulations were undertaken within the stochastic modelling framework provided by nsmc analysis two hundred sets of equally plausible calibration constrained parameter sets were from the nsmc analysis which incorporated long term steady state groundwater head observations as calibration targets from 1541 bores screening different aquifers in the great artesian basin this stochastic analysis informed the selected extent of the sub regional model domain and its boundaries the model boundaries were chosen such that they were located at a buffer distance of at least 5 km away from the areas of head change simulated by the regional model similarly the well field water quality model boundaries were chosen such that they were located at least 2 km beyond the distance travelled by particle tracks these buffer distances were used in selecting the nested model boundary locations to ensure that the model predictions made by the patch or nested models are less sensitive to the boundary conditions 3 2 the sub regional model the primary purpose of the sub regional model was to predict the regional changes in the groundwater head in the precipice sandstone and other overlying aquifer systems resulting from the proposed injection scheme this model has 10 layers the model domain s spatial extent covers 169 5 km by 151 km see fig 2 the sub regional model has a reduced spatial extent and finer spatial discretization than the regional model with grid cells of 500 m by 500 m the model layer or depth discretization also differs from the regional model with the precipice sandstone being represented by two model layers as compared with a single layer representation in the regional model in order to represent the heterogeneity evident within bore logs and geophysics data furthermore the sub regional model only includes sufficient layers for the simulation of flow and pressures within the precipice sandstone and its neighboring aquifers the hydrostratigraphy and model layer relationship represented in the sub regional model is shown in fig 2 groundwater stresses within the sub regional model were consistent with those in the regional model the lateral boundaries for the sub regional model were represented as flux boundaries based on the gradient of flow from the calibrated regional model and were represented using modflow ghb package these lateral fluxes represent the joining predictions which link the regional model to the sub regional model the sub regional model was calibrated to the long term head observations and the lateral boundary fluxes as quantified from the regional model using the parameter estimation software pest and its suite of utilities doherty 2016 the calibration parameters that were estimated included the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities and ghb conductance values of the boundary cells a total of 991 parameters were used across the 10 model layers to implement spatially varying parameterization scheme based on pilot points the distribution of the pilot points for one model layer is shown in fig 4 all model layers used the same pilot point parameterization although the spatial density of these points was significantly greater than that used in the regional model parameterization of these ghb boundaries using pilot points also enabled varying these parameters in the uncertainty analysis of the sub regional model described in section 2 3 the depressurization of coal seams in the wcms was represented using the modflow well package and the well extraction rates were consistent with those used in the regional model thus the sub regional model simultaneously simulated csg water extraction in the wcm and injection into the precipice sandstone predictive simulation using the sub regional model was undertaken for a period of 100 years note that the dual phase nature of the drawdown within the wcm has not been represented here and that this can cause significant errors in the estimation of near well drawdown moore et al 2015 however the focus of this study was on groundwater level mounding effects which is separate from the drawdown simulation and these errors have negligible effect on the predictions of our interest 3 3 the well field water quality model the well field water quality model was built for running the field scale predictive simulations of the flow and advection dispersion transport processes resulting from the proposed csg water injection the main outputs required from this model were the predicted travel times and concentrations at increasing distances from the injection well field this model domain covers an area of 16 km by 16 km around the simulated injection well field similar to the 2d radial transport model this model was discretized vertically into two layers representing the upper part of the precipice sandstone and precipice bsf horizontally the model grid was discretized into cell sizes between 100 m and 225 m no flow boundary conditions were assumed at the top and bottom of this model this well field water quality model was also parameterized using pilot points for the hydraulic properties as well as the ghb conductance values in a similar manner to that of the sub regional model the objective function for the calibration of this model comprised four calibration data sets these were a concentration break through curves at 150 m and 300 m from the injection trial well as simulated using the calibrated 2d radial transport model e g joining predictions b groundwater fluxes across the well field water quality model domain computed using the regional model e g joining predictions c pump test and injection trial water level observations and d long term groundwater head distributions within the model domain as simulated using regional model these four components all have different temporal resolutions the pump tests have hourly drawdown measurements the concentration break through data was based on daily concentrations and the long term average head measurements were steady state representing a long term flow equilibrium calibration therefore required running the model three times each time using a distinct temporal discretization and simulation time period this approach ensured that one set of calibrated parameters matched the observations in different temporal scales also calibration of coarser scale models to match the simulated characteristics of the fine scale model served as an upscaling mechanism whereby the model parameters in the relevant regions of the coarse scale model are upscaled to achieve a match to the model outputs from the fine scale model simulations this resulted in the coarser scale model behaving identically to the fine scale model in the spatial and temporal domains overlapping with that model 3 4 2d radial transport model the 2d radial transport model was used to interpret the injection tracer test results and pump tests undertaken at the injection test well as well as making a joining prediction of concentration and travel times to use as a calibration target for the predictive well field water quality model described in the next section the pump test and tracer test data were obtained from a field injection trial conducted over a period of 6 months and this data comprises the calibration dataset the radial transport model extends 600 m from the injection well vertically the model was discretized into 2 layers layer 1 represented the upper part of the precipice sandstone with a relatively lower hydraulic conductivity and layer 2 represented a higher hydraulic conductivity zone referred to as the braided stream facies bsf the model was calibrated to measured bromide and chloride concentrations from the injection tracer test the precipice sandstone was represented as a dual porosity system to calibrate to the observed data a comprehensive analysis of the injection tracer tests is described in prommer et al 2016 the calibration parameters for this 2d radial transport model comprise the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity immobile porosity mobile porosity mass transfer coefficient specific storage and longitudinal and transverse dispersivity values for both the model layers the spatial variability of these parameter sets except the mass transfer coefficient was simulated by using the pilot point scheme in the pest suite of software doherty 2016 after calibration the model was used to simulate tracer transport corresponding to an extrapolated injection scenario with an injectate concentration of 1 kg m3 and a simulation period of 2760 days this hypothetical injection scenario was chosen such that the injection rates were higher than the rates used for the injection trials with resulting breakthrough curves extending further away from the well at distances of 150 m and 300 m the simulated break through curves of this scenario were then used as calibration targets to estimate upscaled hydraulic properties of the well field water quality model which is discussed in the following section these simulated breakthrough curves also represent joining predictions e g predictions which contain the salient features of the field scale predictions being made with the larger model that link the 2d radial transport model with the well field water quality model 3 5 stochastic predictive analysis after calibration of the patch models stochastic prediction analysis was undertaken using nsmc approach already described in section 2 the two predictive models i e the sub regional model and the well field water quality model results are described in section 4 the predictive scenario of injecting 22 ml d of treated csg produced water through 12 wells over a period of 22 years was simulated with these two predictive models the transport simulations were used to identify the peak concentration changes considering 1 unit of a conservative contaminant being released from all 12 injection wells over the entire injection period of 22 years note that such a continuous release of contaminants is not a realistic simulation but is used for conservative assessment of contamination risks to groundwater bores that are located many kilometers away from the injection bores 4 results and discussions an important advantage of the proposed patch modelling approach is that explicit coupling of different patch models can be avoided there are practical challenges to couple different patch models with varying spatial and temporal discretization within an uncertainty analysis framework the information transfer across patch models is accomplished implicitly by using model inversion or calibration in conjunction with a series simulated observations that are common to multiple model scales e g joining predictions note that for a complete analysis these observations are made stochastically the results of calibrating the patch models is discussed in the following sections 4 1 calibration of patch models the 2d radial transport model was calibrated to chloride and bromide concentration observations from the injection tracer tests the match obtained between the model simulation and observed bromide concentrations is shown in fig 5 after calibrating to the observed concentrations the extrapolation scenario e g joining predictions was simulated using the calibrated 2d radial transport model the concentration break through curves obtained for this scenario at two locations were used to provide observations joining predictions to be used in the calibration of the well field water quality model and the resulting match between the 2d radial transport model and the well field water quality model is shown in fig 6 a more detailed analysis of the injection tracer tests using reactive transport modelling is reported in prommer et al 2016 unlike the transport models the information transfer between the two flow models is achieved via observations of lateral flow in the regional model which then form part of the calibration data set when calibrating to the sub regional model s boundary conditions by modifying the lateral flux conductance values along the boundaries of the sub regional model and the well field water quality model flow in and out of these domains in all model layers was equilibrated with the corresponding fluxes simulated by the regional model the match between different components of water balance for the sub regional model domain in comparison with the water budget for the same area in the regional model is shown in fig 7 it may be observed that positive and negative lateral fluxes bound in and bound out respectively in fig 7 are relatively small compared to other components of water balance reflecting the suitability of the boundary locations for avoiding excessive boundary effects on the sub regional model predictions building the sub regional model and equilibrating it with the overlapping domain of the regional model had two advantages finer spatial and temporal discretization of the sub regional model domain resulting in improved accuracy and substantial reduction in the model run time were achieved also parameterizing the lateral boundary conditions using flux conductance values enabled quantification of the uncertainty in these fluxes constrained by the estimates from the regional model in addition to lateral flux estimates from the regional model the sub regional model s calibration targets also included the groundwater head observations in the precipice sandstone and other aquifers the match between the observed and predicted groundwater head contours for the precipice sandstone is depicted in fig 8 development of the sub regional model independent of the regional model also enabled re conceptualization of the model in a way that better suited the purpose this included splitting the precipice sandstone into two layers in the sub regional models while the regional model had one layer 4 2 comparison of hydraulic property fields in various patch models horizontal hydraulic conductivity fields for the precipice sandstone obtained from the calibration of well field water quality model and the sub regional model are compared in fig 9 it may be readily observed that in general k field distributions have similar trend in the common areas of the two models however the k field shows higher degree of variability near the injection trial well in the well field water quality model domain the increased complexity in the characterization of this k field is due to the increased grid resolution and is informed by the finer scale data available for this area the extraction of this information was made possible by the more dense pilot point parameterization in the well field water quality model another important outcome of the hpdp calibration was that different types of data could be used to constrain hydraulic properties and boundary conditions across multiple spatial and temporal domains this approach helped reduce non uniqueness in parameter estimation unique estimation of parameters is often difficult because of the presence of correlated parameter types for example correlation between recharge and hydraulic conductivity renders unique estimation of hydraulic conductivity impossible when head measurements are the only type of observation available as also noted hill and østerby 2003 by using the pm approach the ratio between recharge and hydraulic conductivity was constrained using the long term groundwater head measurements and also the ratio between hydraulic conductivity and porosity near the injection well field was constrained by the tracer tests independent constraining of hydraulic conductivity near the injection well field was also possible with the use of pump test data it must be emphasized here that the proposed approach is most useful for two situations i when data is available to constrain multiple patch models within a parent model or ii whether or not there is data if a prediction is being made that is dependent on both regional scale flow features and small scale parameter detail this patch dynamic approach can be used for a better characterization of predictive uncertainty in our study there was only one patch model at each spatial and temporal level modelled injection tracer tests were conducted in only one out of 20 injection wells because of the high field costs involved however availability of data from more wells would facilitate building of more patch models in a scale commensurate with the 2d radial transport model this would then help to better constrain the well field water quality model similarly pump test data from multiple wells would help to better constrain the flow models 4 3 stochastic prediction analysis after calibration of the sub regional model and the well field water quality model using the hpdp approach null space monte carlo analysis was undertaken for both these models at this stage these models were run independently from the regional model and the 2d radial transport model given that lateral flux boundaries of both these models were informed by the flux estimates from the regional model changes in these flux values for different realizations of the model parameterization were accounted for in the stochastic simulation this was achieved by varying the conductance value of the lateral boundaries within the nsmc analysis nsmc analysis resulted in 500 calibration constrained parameter sets for both sub regional and well field water quality models the injection induced groundwater head increase was simulated at three observation bores using the sub regional model as shown in fig 10 and observed over the entire simulation period of 100 years from 2013 to 2113 these three observation bores were located close to the injection well field groundwater head increase for these three bores simulated by the well field water quality model is shown in fig 11 the predicted maximum head increase at the nearest domestic bore was 4 3 m located around 15 km from the injection bore it may be noted that the primary objective of the well field water quality model is to predict the range of concentration changes that could be expected from the simulated head hydrographs it is evident that the head predictions with the well field water quality model has larger uncertainty compared to that of the sub regional model this is because the predictions are more sensitive to the lateral boundaries which are located closer to the injection wells compared to the sub regional model the wider range of flow velocities resulting from these simulations enabled a more comprehensive and rigorous simulation of transport process and thus a robust characterization of contamination risk it also indicates that the sub regional model has model simplification errors which are made explicit when examining the same simulations with the finer scale model and its parameterization this simplification error is discussed in detail in white et al 2014 potential water quality risks resulting from contaminant migration as a result of high pressure injection was simulated by modelling the contaminant transport scenario the peak value of contaminant concentrations realized within the each model cell of the well field water quality model was characterized as the ratio of the maximum simulated concentration over the simulation period to the injected concentration uncertainty in the predicted concentration was quantified as the standard deviation obtained from 500 nsmc simulations contours of mean value of maximum concentration simulated using the calibrated model and the corresponding uncertainty estimates are shown in fig 12 the stochastic simulations indicated that for this hypothesized extreme scenario of contaminant release maximum value of concentration would drop down to 1 100th and 1 1000th of the initial concentration within a distance of around 5 km within the well field considering that the nearest risk receptors were located at least 15 km from the injection wells and that continuous mobilization of contaminants is highly unlikely it was inferred that the proposed injection scheme posed minimal risks of contamination to the existing domestic bores the groundwater head predictions indicated a maximum head increase of up to 140 m in the observation bores close to the injection wells with a prediction standard deviation of 10 m however the predicted maximum head increase in the nearest domestic bore located at 15 km from the well field was 4 3 m the predicted increase in groundwater head in the well field indicates the positive impact from the injection scheme given the slow velocity of groundwater flow in this regional aquifer the injected water will be available for beneficial use over many decades 5 conclusion a hierarchical patch dynamics method for efficient modelling of groundwater flow and transport processes across multiple spatial and temporal scales has been developed the method has been applied for the stochastic prediction of flow and transport associated with a proposed coal seam gas production water injection scheme in the surat basin in australia high pressure injection into fresh water aquifers is considered to be a potential option for the beneficial use of water produced as a by product of csg extraction considering the high value and intensive use of great artesian basin aquifers in this region simulation of the flow and transport processes triggered by the injection scheme were needed in a risk analysis framework to quantify the potential impacts and associated risks while stochastic modelling supports the quantification of the probability of outcomes computationally this represents a challenging modelling problem given the need to simulate both small scale transport processes and large scale pressure impacts from the cumulative impacts of reinjection across the regional scheme the hierarchical patch dynamics method demonstrated in this paper enabled calibration and stochastic predictive analysis of groundwater flow and transport using four different patch models built in multiple spatial and temporal scales collectively groundwater observations from small scale pump tests and tracer tests and large scale regional monitoring networks were used to constrain these models a major advantage of developing patch models is that groundwater processes can be represented with the required level of complexity at appropriate scales in independent patch models yet still retain the advantages of information transfer of fully coupled models each patch model employed a spatial and temporal grid resolution and an associated parameterization that was appropriate for extracting the maximum information content from available data at the same time undesirable lumping or averaging of parameters and observations were successfully avoided by using this approach thus avoiding model simplification errors the information obtained from patch models at each scale was also used to constrain models of other scales through the use of extrapolated joining predictions which included boundary condition observations as well as concentrations these joining predictions were specifically designed to transfer prediction salient information from one model scale to another the use of the extrapolated joining predictions represents a step change to existing hierarchical patch dynamic implementations as they do not require fully coupled models in order to transform information between patch models instead joining predictions enable models to be run independently associated models are constrained through calibration to the prediction salient information encapsulated in the joining predictions this allows finer spatial and temporal discretization and process simulations to be adopted only in the patch models used to extract information from the data if predictions are being made at a larger regional scale this can be simulated with a larger prediction simulation model which is indirectly constrained by the fine scale information via the use of the joining predictions similarly this approach also permits the use of information gained from more complex models such as reactive transport models which are otherwise computationally intractable for stochastic prediction analysis the improved computational efficiency achieved using this approach in place of fully coupled nested models is significant stochastic prediction analysis was undertaken in our study using nsmc analysis and the uncertainty of the extrapolation or joining observations predictions are incorporated in this analysis the proposed method is generic and can be applied to a wide range of groundwater modelling problems beyond the example in the paper regarding simulation of impacts of a proposed injection scheme for csg extraction the patch modelling approach is particularly useful where multiple processes are to be modelled and when data available for constraining the model and in different spatial and temporal scales acknowledgements this research was funded by csiro s gas industry social and

7374,the application of global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis techniques to groundwater models of deep sedimentary basins are typically challenged by large computational burdens combined with associated numerical stability issues the highly parameterized approaches required for exploring the predictive uncertainty associated with the heterogeneous hydraulic characteristics of multiple aquifers and aquitards in these sedimentary basins exacerbate these issues a novel patch modelling methodology is proposed for improving the computational feasibility of stochastic modelling analysis of large scale and complex groundwater models the method incorporates a nested groundwater modelling framework that enables efficient simulation of groundwater flow and transport across multiple spatial and temporal scales the method also allows different processes to be simulated within different model scales existing nested model methodologies are extended by employing joining predictions for extrapolating prediction salient information from one model scale to the next this establishes a feedback mechanism supporting the transfer of information from child models to parent models as well as parent models to child models in a computationally efficient manner this feedback mechanism is simple and flexible and ensures that while the salient small scale features influencing larger scale prediction are transferred back to the larger scale this does not require the live coupling of models this method allows the modelling of multiple groundwater flow and transport processes using separate groundwater models that are built for the appropriate spatial and temporal scales within a stochastic framework while also removing the computational burden associated with live model coupling the utility of the method is demonstrated by application to an actual large scale aquifer injection scheme in australia keywords prediction uncertainty groundwater transport modelling upscaling 1 introduction the development of the on shore unconventional gas industry has been rapidly increasing in australia and worldwide over the last decade currently coal seam gas csg is the most targeted of the unconventional gas resources in australia with widespread commercial production of csg already commenced in the surat and bowen basins in queensland coal seam gas development often involves large scale extraction of groundwater from coal seams to reduce hydrostatic pressure this depressurization is necessary before desorption of the gas from the coal matrix can occur and may be sustained for up to 40 to 50 years depending on the productive life of the csg field the disposal of this produced water from csg wells is also a significant challenge and the re injection of this water into aquifers above or below the coal seam is one disposal method commonly considered the hydraulic and geochemical impacts of such depressurization and subsequent csg water reinjection on receptors such as springs and drinking water wells are critical for the assessment of the environmental impacts of large scale csg reinjection projects assessment of these impacts involves development of flow and transport models at multiple scales and undertaking prediction uncertainty analysis using these complex models this paper presents a novel and efficient modelling methodology for the simulation and prediction uncertainty analysis of groundwater flow and transport processes in multiple spatio temporal scales the applicability of the method is demonstrated using a realistic example for the assessment of impacts associated with csg water reinjection predicting the cumulative groundwater impacts of csg development involves development of large scale basin wide groundwater models as the csg extraction wells are distributed over large areas of sedimentary basins the large scale of these operations are challenging for model based risk assessments which are required to support the resource management decisions in this context sreekanth et al 2017 part of the challenge relates to the computational burden of large scale models sreekanth and datta 2011 2013 sreekanth et al 2016 with their associated long model run times which can undermine the model calibration and uncertainty analysis efforts required of a decision support model one approach used to manage this burden is through significant simplification of model detail although this can inflate model errors there is always a trade off between predictive accuracy and computational tractability that becomes more troublesome when predictions are sensitive to small scale parameter detail this is exacerbated when historical observations of flow and transport processes occur across multiple scales all of which must be simulated within the model calibration phase if the maximum information content of data is to be harnessed we focus here on the assessments of the cumulative impacts of aquifer water injection since these represent a particularly extreme example of modelling across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales and processes the modelling project will typically consider regional sub regional and local hydrogeological and geochemical data including groundwater levels stream flows aquifer water and rock chemistry aquifer property testing and aquifer tracer tests balancing the accuracy of the simulated impacts in areas and times of interest with computational tractability is complex the computational tractability side of this balance considers the model s spatial and temporal discretization the processes being modelled and the parameterization detail employed within the model this paper describes the development and implementation of a novel hierarchical patch dynamic modelling methodology used to address these challenges the method deploys a nested groundwater modelling framework that enables efficient simulation of groundwater flow and transport across multiple spatial and temporal scales and allows different processes to be simulated within different model scales existing local grid refinement lgr methods provide a satisfactory solution to the issue of spatial discretization mehl and hill 2002 promoted locally refining the spatial discretization of finite difference grids of groundwater models to increase prediction accuracy initial lgr with structured grids e g modflow resulted in large numbers of surplus nodes and hence de coupled parent and child models were proposed as an alternative implementation however de coupled versions only provide for the transfer of information from coarse scale parent models to establish the boundary conditions in the child models akbar et al 1972 mrosovsky and ridings 1974 graham and smart 1980 ward et al 1987 leake et al 1998 leake and claar 1999 more recent direct embedding of child models within the parent models has enabled the information transfer in both directions across the parent and child models mehl and hill 2002 2004 2006 gedeon and mallants 2012 furthermore the recent developments of modflow usg panday et al 2013 and modflow6 langevin et al 2017 which implement a generalized control volume finite difference formulation have enabled local grid refinement without the surplus node problem of earlier local grid refinement methods the examples above discuss model spatial discretization discretization of the model into finer time steps and stress periods at targeted locations is also important when simulating groundwater transport including csg water injection impacts for example smaller time steps may be essential for meeting convergence criteria like the courant friedrichs lewy condition for transport modelling or may be driven by the requirement for high resolution predictions but are not required for simulating regional scale flow patterns similarly discretization of the model into fine time steps may be required if high frequency monitoring data e g hourly measurements of head from a pumping test are used for calibrating the model the need to discretize parts of a model domain with time steps or stress periods at a greater level of detail from the wider model domain adds another challenge to the discretization and computational efficiency despite the recent developments in lgr implementation and unstructured grid modelling there is still a requirement for consistent time discretization between parent and child models because the information being represented in the regional and local scale models are relevant to very different time scales e g years to hours this inflexibility of existing parent child model construction methodologies for a constant time discretization creates too great a computational burden in terms of model run times in the csg context furthermore this burden is unnecessary in terms of extracting the maximum information content from the available data and in terms of predictive accuracy the local grid refinement is typically considered in terms of spatial discretization and largely neglects temporal discretization as described above however another restriction of the current lgr framework occurs when running transport simulations for transport simulations parent and child models must be simulated independently and only one way coupling of concentration initial and boundary conditions from the parent to the child model heywood 2013 is possible this one way coupling precludes the effective information transfer from small scale tests to the larger scale predictions together the temporal and transport simulation limitations of current lgr methods undermine their effectiveness in the csg reinjection context furthermore even in terms of spatial discretization the current structure of lgr leads to unnecessarily long model run times when considering the multiple coupled model runs that are required for model calibration and uncertainty analysis to address this unnecessary and sometimes prohibitive inflation of computational effort we developed a novel computationally efficient and simplified alternative to the hierarchical patch dynamics paradigm hpdp wu and loucks 1995 wu and david 2002 the hierarchical patch dynamic paradigm was developed in ecological studies as a way of accounting for the heterogeneity observed in ecological responses in time and space and the hierarchical linkages across different scales of space and time li et al 2006a developed a methodology to implement hpdp for solving complex groundwater modelling problems across multiple spatial scales to solve the curse of dimensionality problem with its attendant computational burden while li s work provided an important improvement in terms of reducing the computational burden of large scale models with associated salient small scale details the computational burden of the method remained too great in our study we propose an efficient patch modelling pm method to extend the hpdp for modelling multiple groundwater flow and transport processes across varying spatial and temporal scales within a stochastic framework the extension employs joining predictions which extrapolate the salient information from one model scale to the next establishing a feed back mechanism supporting the transfer of knowledge from child models to parent models very simply and computationally efficiently the flexibility of this feedback mechanism ensures that while the salient small scale features influencing larger scale prediction are transferred back to the larger scale this does not require the live coupling of models this essentially removes the computational burden associated with live model coupling the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows section 2 describes the methodology for multi scale groundwater flow and transport modelling using hpdp and feedback mechanisms section 3 describes application of this methodology for the stochastic prediction of concentration changes in a well field and groundwater head changes in a regional aquifer system in the surat basin in queensland australia section 4 presents and discusses the results and section 5 gives a summary of the conclusions obtained from this work 2 methodology in this study we use the patch modelling pm method to simulate regional scale flow and transport changes in an injection well field using a range of information scales and data types to inform these simulations the dynamics of different groundwater flow and transport processes are often evident in distinct spatial and temporal scales for example while large pressure changes in confined aquifers are almost instantaneously felt across hundreds of meters mass transport in groundwater systems over the same distance may occur in a time span of many years to decades flow process in regional scale deep aquifer systems that extend over hundreds of kilometers often take a time span of hundreds or thousands of years similar disparities also often exist in the resolution of data available for calibrating groundwater models aquifer pumping tests and groundwater tracer tests conducted in areas of interest result in fine scale measurements of groundwater head and or concentration data with measurements on a minute hourly or daily time scale across a small area on the other hand monitoring of regional scale flow is often limited to sparse measurements of groundwater head with limited measurement frequencies thus spatial and temporal resolution of data collected even for the same process are often collected and represent a range of different aquifer scales fig 1 illustrates multiple spatiotemporal scales involved in the simulation of groundwater flow and transport processes the pmm method enables the breaking down of a complex model of a system with multiple processes into multiple patch models where each patch model is of an appropriate spatiotemporal scale to enhance the extraction of information from the dataset and or to enhance the accuracy of the prediction the use of these patch models helps to overcome the curse of dimensionality incurred in modelling complex systems li et al 2006a as the spatial and temporal extent of each patch model and the processes simulated within it need only be sufficient in extent to allow extraction of information from available data and to transfer the salient components of this information to the prediction the proposed stochastic modelling approach using pm method has three essential components i identification of the patch boundaries and grid resolution ii development of calibration specific and prediction specific patch models with feed back mechanism and defining relevant joining predictions and iii stochastic predictive simulations it is the novel use of joining predictions as a feedback mechanism that provides the advances in computational efficiency in the calibration and stochastic context these components are now described 2 1 identification of patch model domain extents boundaries and spatiotemporal resolution two important considerations drive identification of patch model domain extent model boundaries and model resolution the first consideration relates to the process characteristics to be simulated the associated data densities in space and time and the predictions to be simulated the model resolution and density of parameterization affect both the degree to which information can be extracted from available data and the accuracy with which a prediction can be simulated for example simulation of transport processes and or steep gradient flow near an injection well field demands fine spatial and temporal discretization of the model grid in practice higher data densities also occur where there is an increased focus on the process details this is because groundwater availability usage potential for impacts from industrial activities monitoring densities tend to be spatially and temporally correlated and are clustered around areas of interest the increased focus and data densities necessitate the development of patch models with finer spatial scales for such areas of interest appropriate grid resolution is then determined based on the process requirements density of data and computational tractability of patch models the proposed pm method provides the flexibility to choose one or more temporal scales for a chosen patch model defining multiple temporal discretization schemes for a chosen patch model enables optimal use of monitoring data available in different temporal scales a patch model can be run thrice in batch processing mode each time using a distinct temporal discretization to calibrate the model parameters using three separate sets of data in different scales for example hydraulic properties of the patch model can be constrained by yearly head measurements from a regional monitoring network hourly head measurements from a pump test and monthly concentration measurements not requiring any lumping of finer scale data the second major factor that guides the delineation of patch boundaries is the sensitivity of the outputs from calibration and predictive simulations to the patch model boundary conditions uncertainty of any simulation using a patch model decreases with decreasing sensitivity of solutions to boundary conditions hence patch boundary identification aims to avoid solutions which are overly sensitive to boundary conditions therefore selection of patch model domains and their boundaries also involve the quantification of the contribution to prediction uncertainty from these boundary conditions and efforts are made to avoid any significant boundary effects the remaining boundary condition uncertainty is incorporated into the stochastic simulation step refer to section 2 3 2 2 development of patch models with feed back mechanism and defining relevant joining predictions patch model development follows a two way hierarchical approach starting from the coarsest scale parent model at the highest level to the finest scale model at the lowest level li et al 2006a the parent model at the highest level is developed for the entire areal extent and time horizon of interest the spatial and temporal discretization of the model at the highest level is often determined primarily on the basis of computational tractability then patch model boundaries are identified within the parent model based on the considerations described in the previous section representation of process complexities and increased solution accuracy are achieved through development of patch models in the lower levels the finest scale model s at the lowest level are primarily used to extract fine scale information that will be upscaled to larger scale patch models that will be used for predictive simulations this approach facilitates transfer of knowledge between patch models in both directions the two way information transfer across patch models is based on the premise that models in different scales hold different types of information based on the data types used to constrain them for example a coarse scale flow model calibrated to regional head observations holds information on flux volumes and flow directions this regional scale model is suitable to constrain the lateral fluxes in a patch model nested within this parent model on the other hand a fine scale model calibrated to pump test or tracer test holds information on hydraulic properties in the vicinity of the well furthermore this fine scale information is useful for constraining the hydraulic properties in a cluster of model cells corresponding to this area in a coarser model thus while the higher level patch models provide boundary conditions and regional scale information to the models at the lower levels the models from the lower levels provide information that is then upscaled and fed back to models at higher levels this implementation is essentially that of li et al 2006a and requires running the larger and smaller patch models in a coupled and iterative framework however this fully coupled iterative use of the hpdp methodology as detailed in li et al 2006a still results in a significant computational burden the need to address this computational burden led to the implementations of joining predictions as a mechanism for decoupling models within the calibration while accounting for prediction uncertainty dynamic patch modelling proposed in li et al 2006a would be more challenging although not impossible if prediction uncertainty is to be accounted in the workflow our simplified method provides a pragmatic solution to this problem that can be readily implemented using widely used modelling software note that the use of the joining prediction used to achieve this computational efficiency passes on prediction salient information from a patch model to a prediction model if a new prediction is being made the practitioner has only to make the required new joining predictions for each model prediction that is required this approach is therefore infinitely flexible these joining predictions build on previous work which decouple large and small data and model scales and processes in a stochastic framework as developed and implemented in moore et al 2015 and moore et al 2010 in a csg and virus transport context respectively the former paper used response functions as a version of a joining prediction and the second used nested variograms based on tracer tests and regional pumping tests respectively this paper combines these process simplification and scale data stochastic representation aspects of stochastic joining predictions the joining prediction has two parts firstly the local scale patch model is calibrated to the data available at that scale secondly a prediction of the type being made to assess the larger scale impacts is made with the small scale model at a time and location that can used as a calibration constraint in the prediction model it is via these two steps that the knowledge transfer continues to be made in two directions despite the decoupling of the model runs this joining prediction extrapolates the simulated behavior of the system to the scale of the patch model at the higher level the sole purpose of the joining prediction is to extract salient information from calibrating to fine scale data but without the computational burden that would usually be required to do so this is achieved by using the joining prediction as a calibration target for coarser models extrapolation of the prediction is intended to make it tenable for the coarser model scale because this joining prediction is an extrapolation within the calibrated patch model it is accompanied by uncertainty which can be incorporated in the weighting of the observation in the larger model calibration to the joining prediction if stationarity in fine scale hydraulic property heterogeneity can be assumed then the upscaled feedback is not only to the specific area where the fine scale field testing has been undertaken but to anywhere within this heterogeneous strata within a stochastic framework where model domain boundary conditions and joining predictions are optimally defined then an iterative solution with fully coupled patch models can be avoided yet still achieve full two way knowledge transfer this full coupling of models to facilitate two way knowledge transfer does incur additional computational time compared to solving models with knowledge transfer occurring in only one direction however there may be cases where simultaneous or fully coupled models may be needed to facilitate the two way knowledge transfer between patch models this may require solution of patch models iteratively with mutually constraining information to ensure consistency in the simulated variables across patch models given the distinct spatial and temporal scales at which groundwater flow and transport processes occur it is often possible to carefully define patch model boundaries to avoid iterative solution for example in our case study a fine scale patch model is developed for interpreting concentration data obtained from injection tracer tests by choosing the model boundary sufficiently far from the injection well where the groundwater head is not influenced by the low injection rate and a constant head boundary condition can be assumed thus lateral boundary conditions from the coarser patch model are not required for constraining this fine scale transport model instead the information transfer is unidirectional being from the fine scale model to the patch model at the next higher level thus by carefully choosing the spatial disposition of the patch models and their boundary conditions circumstances which lead to the requirement of iterative solution of patch models can often be avoided finally it is noted that models developed using the proposed hpdp can be classified into two broad classes viz i data information input patch models or calibration models and ii prediction patch models which are defined on the basis of the scale of the prediction required and an acceptable level of predictive accuracy the input patch models provide information for constraining the prediction patch models which are used for undertaking the prediction analysis the input patch models that have only one way knowledge transfer need not be iteratively solved in the case study presented in this work the models at the highest and lowest levels are used as input models 2 3 stochastic predictive simulation as outlined above the extended hpdp methodology accounts for the real world data complexity without sacrificing computational efficiency by building a suite of patch models each designed to optimally extract information from the available data in multiple scales similarly the prediction models can be built at appropriate complexity levels and spatial and temporal discretization that ensure the computational tractability for undertaking uncertainty analysis and also where possible a minimum predictive error by breaking up the predictive models into different patches for different processes separate uncertainty analyses for these separate processes can be undertaken most efficiently calibration constrained uncertainty analysis using null space monte carlo nsmc approach tonkin and doherty 2009 is used for stochastic predictive simulations in this study uncertainty contributed by the lateral boundary conditions and upscaled parameters obtained from input models can be quantified with this approach by appropriately parameterizing them in the prediction models the reader is directed to tonkin and doherty 2009 and doherty et al 2011 for implementations of this method a brief description of the theoretical basis of the nsmc approach is given in the following implementation of monte carlo methods uses a parameter covariance matrix c p can be constructed to characterize the spatial variability of the hydrologic properties random parameter fields p r can then generated by using this parameter covariance matrix of innate parameter variability however very few model runs using these randomly generated parameter fields will result in an acceptable value of the calibration objective function implementation of the nsmc method uses a posterior approximation of the parameter covariance matrix instead of where calibration constraints have been imposed on the parameter covariance structure e g or depending on which implementation of the nsmc method is deployed refer to tonkin and doherty 2009 and doherty et al 2011 for further details 3 case study the pm method as described in previous section was applied to a case study where groundwater flow and transport processes were simulated to assess groundwater impacts from a proposed large scale csg water injection scheme the proposed csg water production is from the walloon coal measures wcm which is the target formation for csg extraction in the surat basin queensland australia the water reinjection is into the precipice sandstone deep freshwater aquifer which is stratigraphically lower than the wcm refer to fig 2 for schematic description of local stratigraphy in addition to the csg extraction from the wcm there is large scale groundwater extraction from interconnected aquifers above and below the wcm for uses including large scale irrigation stock and domestic and urban water supply a suite of numerical groundwater models were developed to simulate both i predicted groundwater head changes occurring on a regional scale and ii predicted concentration of potential conservative contaminants mobilized by the proposed injection of csg water the possible groundwater head increase impact represents a potential positive impact should the injection cause raised heads sufficiently such that artesian conditions return within the region and allow stock and domestic bores to flow as they once did on the other hand the possible mobilization of contaminants is considered a potential negative impact as insufficient dilution may result in contamination of stock and domestic bores in the vicinity of the injection well field a total of 3400 data points were available for calibrating the models represented different scales and processes including i groundwater head observations from 1541 regional monitoring bores in the basin and ii aquifer drawdown measurements from pumping tests and iii concentration measurements resulting from injection tracer tests conducted for the injection well field the suite of groundwater flow and transport models constructed cover four different spatial and temporal scales extents shown in fig 3 each patch model except the largest regional model was nested within another patch model at the next higher level horizontal and vertical discretization of these four models as well as their respective uses is illustrated in fig 2 all of these models were calibrated using the parameter estimation software pest and its utility software doherty 2016 the first and coarsest scale model in this group is called the regional model qwc 2012 which has the purpose of enabling the identification of appropriate model domain extents and boundary locations and conditions for the nested patch models the second model the sub regional model was built and calibrated specifically for predictive simulation of groundwater head increases and flow changes that may occur with the csg water injection within the sub regional model domain the precipice sandstone layer is steeply dipping from its outcrop in the north of the model domain to a depth of around 2000 m in the south of the model domain the third model the well field water quality model was developed for running the predictive simulations which examine the range of contaminant concentrations that may occur at increasing distances from the well field the injection well field is located at the center of the well field water quality model domain the elevation of the top of precipice sandstone aquifer is also contoured in the map depicted in fig 3 it can be observed from the elevation contours that within the extent of the well field model the precipice sandstone is relatively flat the fourth model the 2d radial transport model is very small and located within the well field domain and was built to model the flow and transport in the immediate vicinity of an injection trial bore in such a way as to extract as much information regarding the and transport processes associated with injected csg water this model was also used to provide joining predictions that were used to transfer this information to the well field scale model these models and how they are interact are now described in detail 3 1 the regional model the regional model was originally developed by qwc 2012 for the assessment of cumulative drawdown impacts caused by csg groundwater extraction in coal seams of the wcm fig 2 it simulates all of the current abstraction stresses within the region which is essential for characterization of the flow system within which reinjection scheme will occur a preliminary analysis of the injection scenario was undertaken using this model this preliminary analysis involved simulating the groundwater flow and particle tracks resulting from injecting 30 ml d of csg produced water for 30 years through 20 injection wells the advection transport observation adv2 package of modflow was used for simulating the particle tracks both the groundwater flow and particle tracking simulations were undertaken within the stochastic modelling framework provided by nsmc analysis two hundred sets of equally plausible calibration constrained parameter sets were from the nsmc analysis which incorporated long term steady state groundwater head observations as calibration targets from 1541 bores screening different aquifers in the great artesian basin this stochastic analysis informed the selected extent of the sub regional model domain and its boundaries the model boundaries were chosen such that they were located at a buffer distance of at least 5 km away from the areas of head change simulated by the regional model similarly the well field water quality model boundaries were chosen such that they were located at least 2 km beyond the distance travelled by particle tracks these buffer distances were used in selecting the nested model boundary locations to ensure that the model predictions made by the patch or nested models are less sensitive to the boundary conditions 3 2 the sub regional model the primary purpose of the sub regional model was to predict the regional changes in the groundwater head in the precipice sandstone and other overlying aquifer systems resulting from the proposed injection scheme this model has 10 layers the model domain s spatial extent covers 169 5 km by 151 km see fig 2 the sub regional model has a reduced spatial extent and finer spatial discretization than the regional model with grid cells of 500 m by 500 m the model layer or depth discretization also differs from the regional model with the precipice sandstone being represented by two model layers as compared with a single layer representation in the regional model in order to represent the heterogeneity evident within bore logs and geophysics data furthermore the sub regional model only includes sufficient layers for the simulation of flow and pressures within the precipice sandstone and its neighboring aquifers the hydrostratigraphy and model layer relationship represented in the sub regional model is shown in fig 2 groundwater stresses within the sub regional model were consistent with those in the regional model the lateral boundaries for the sub regional model were represented as flux boundaries based on the gradient of flow from the calibrated regional model and were represented using modflow ghb package these lateral fluxes represent the joining predictions which link the regional model to the sub regional model the sub regional model was calibrated to the long term head observations and the lateral boundary fluxes as quantified from the regional model using the parameter estimation software pest and its suite of utilities doherty 2016 the calibration parameters that were estimated included the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities and ghb conductance values of the boundary cells a total of 991 parameters were used across the 10 model layers to implement spatially varying parameterization scheme based on pilot points the distribution of the pilot points for one model layer is shown in fig 4 all model layers used the same pilot point parameterization although the spatial density of these points was significantly greater than that used in the regional model parameterization of these ghb boundaries using pilot points also enabled varying these parameters in the uncertainty analysis of the sub regional model described in section 2 3 the depressurization of coal seams in the wcms was represented using the modflow well package and the well extraction rates were consistent with those used in the regional model thus the sub regional model simultaneously simulated csg water extraction in the wcm and injection into the precipice sandstone predictive simulation using the sub regional model was undertaken for a period of 100 years note that the dual phase nature of the drawdown within the wcm has not been represented here and that this can cause significant errors in the estimation of near well drawdown moore et al 2015 however the focus of this study was on groundwater level mounding effects which is separate from the drawdown simulation and these errors have negligible effect on the predictions of our interest 3 3 the well field water quality model the well field water quality model was built for running the field scale predictive simulations of the flow and advection dispersion transport processes resulting from the proposed csg water injection the main outputs required from this model were the predicted travel times and concentrations at increasing distances from the injection well field this model domain covers an area of 16 km by 16 km around the simulated injection well field similar to the 2d radial transport model this model was discretized vertically into two layers representing the upper part of the precipice sandstone and precipice bsf horizontally the model grid was discretized into cell sizes between 100 m and 225 m no flow boundary conditions were assumed at the top and bottom of this model this well field water quality model was also parameterized using pilot points for the hydraulic properties as well as the ghb conductance values in a similar manner to that of the sub regional model the objective function for the calibration of this model comprised four calibration data sets these were a concentration break through curves at 150 m and 300 m from the injection trial well as simulated using the calibrated 2d radial transport model e g joining predictions b groundwater fluxes across the well field water quality model domain computed using the regional model e g joining predictions c pump test and injection trial water level observations and d long term groundwater head distributions within the model domain as simulated using regional model these four components all have different temporal resolutions the pump tests have hourly drawdown measurements the concentration break through data was based on daily concentrations and the long term average head measurements were steady state representing a long term flow equilibrium calibration therefore required running the model three times each time using a distinct temporal discretization and simulation time period this approach ensured that one set of calibrated parameters matched the observations in different temporal scales also calibration of coarser scale models to match the simulated characteristics of the fine scale model served as an upscaling mechanism whereby the model parameters in the relevant regions of the coarse scale model are upscaled to achieve a match to the model outputs from the fine scale model simulations this resulted in the coarser scale model behaving identically to the fine scale model in the spatial and temporal domains overlapping with that model 3 4 2d radial transport model the 2d radial transport model was used to interpret the injection tracer test results and pump tests undertaken at the injection test well as well as making a joining prediction of concentration and travel times to use as a calibration target for the predictive well field water quality model described in the next section the pump test and tracer test data were obtained from a field injection trial conducted over a period of 6 months and this data comprises the calibration dataset the radial transport model extends 600 m from the injection well vertically the model was discretized into 2 layers layer 1 represented the upper part of the precipice sandstone with a relatively lower hydraulic conductivity and layer 2 represented a higher hydraulic conductivity zone referred to as the braided stream facies bsf the model was calibrated to measured bromide and chloride concentrations from the injection tracer test the precipice sandstone was represented as a dual porosity system to calibrate to the observed data a comprehensive analysis of the injection tracer tests is described in prommer et al 2016 the calibration parameters for this 2d radial transport model comprise the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity immobile porosity mobile porosity mass transfer coefficient specific storage and longitudinal and transverse dispersivity values for both the model layers the spatial variability of these parameter sets except the mass transfer coefficient was simulated by using the pilot point scheme in the pest suite of software doherty 2016 after calibration the model was used to simulate tracer transport corresponding to an extrapolated injection scenario with an injectate concentration of 1 kg m3 and a simulation period of 2760 days this hypothetical injection scenario was chosen such that the injection rates were higher than the rates used for the injection trials with resulting breakthrough curves extending further away from the well at distances of 150 m and 300 m the simulated break through curves of this scenario were then used as calibration targets to estimate upscaled hydraulic properties of the well field water quality model which is discussed in the following section these simulated breakthrough curves also represent joining predictions e g predictions which contain the salient features of the field scale predictions being made with the larger model that link the 2d radial transport model with the well field water quality model 3 5 stochastic predictive analysis after calibration of the patch models stochastic prediction analysis was undertaken using nsmc approach already described in section 2 the two predictive models i e the sub regional model and the well field water quality model results are described in section 4 the predictive scenario of injecting 22 ml d of treated csg produced water through 12 wells over a period of 22 years was simulated with these two predictive models the transport simulations were used to identify the peak concentration changes considering 1 unit of a conservative contaminant being released from all 12 injection wells over the entire injection period of 22 years note that such a continuous release of contaminants is not a realistic simulation but is used for conservative assessment of contamination risks to groundwater bores that are located many kilometers away from the injection bores 4 results and discussions an important advantage of the proposed patch modelling approach is that explicit coupling of different patch models can be avoided there are practical challenges to couple different patch models with varying spatial and temporal discretization within an uncertainty analysis framework the information transfer across patch models is accomplished implicitly by using model inversion or calibration in conjunction with a series simulated observations that are common to multiple model scales e g joining predictions note that for a complete analysis these observations are made stochastically the results of calibrating the patch models is discussed in the following sections 4 1 calibration of patch models the 2d radial transport model was calibrated to chloride and bromide concentration observations from the injection tracer tests the match obtained between the model simulation and observed bromide concentrations is shown in fig 5 after calibrating to the observed concentrations the extrapolation scenario e g joining predictions was simulated using the calibrated 2d radial transport model the concentration break through curves obtained for this scenario at two locations were used to provide observations joining predictions to be used in the calibration of the well field water quality model and the resulting match between the 2d radial transport model and the well field water quality model is shown in fig 6 a more detailed analysis of the injection tracer tests using reactive transport modelling is reported in prommer et al 2016 unlike the transport models the information transfer between the two flow models is achieved via observations of lateral flow in the regional model which then form part of the calibration data set when calibrating to the sub regional model s boundary conditions by modifying the lateral flux conductance values along the boundaries of the sub regional model and the well field water quality model flow in and out of these domains in all model layers was equilibrated with the corresponding fluxes simulated by the regional model the match between different components of water balance for the sub regional model domain in comparison with the water budget for the same area in the regional model is shown in fig 7 it may be observed that positive and negative lateral fluxes bound in and bound out respectively in fig 7 are relatively small compared to other components of water balance reflecting the suitability of the boundary locations for avoiding excessive boundary effects on the sub regional model predictions building the sub regional model and equilibrating it with the overlapping domain of the regional model had two advantages finer spatial and temporal discretization of the sub regional model domain resulting in improved accuracy and substantial reduction in the model run time were achieved also parameterizing the lateral boundary conditions using flux conductance values enabled quantification of the uncertainty in these fluxes constrained by the estimates from the regional model in addition to lateral flux estimates from the regional model the sub regional model s calibration targets also included the groundwater head observations in the precipice sandstone and other aquifers the match between the observed and predicted groundwater head contours for the precipice sandstone is depicted in fig 8 development of the sub regional model independent of the regional model also enabled re conceptualization of the model in a way that better suited the purpose this included splitting the precipice sandstone into two layers in the sub regional models while the regional model had one layer 4 2 comparison of hydraulic property fields in various patch models horizontal hydraulic conductivity fields for the precipice sandstone obtained from the calibration of well field water quality model and the sub regional model are compared in fig 9 it may be readily observed that in general k field distributions have similar trend in the common areas of the two models however the k field shows higher degree of variability near the injection trial well in the well field water quality model domain the increased complexity in the characterization of this k field is due to the increased grid resolution and is informed by the finer scale data available for this area the extraction of this information was made possible by the more dense pilot point parameterization in the well field water quality model another important outcome of the hpdp calibration was that different types of data could be used to constrain hydraulic properties and boundary conditions across multiple spatial and temporal domains this approach helped reduce non uniqueness in parameter estimation unique estimation of parameters is often difficult because of the presence of correlated parameter types for example correlation between recharge and hydraulic conductivity renders unique estimation of hydraulic conductivity impossible when head measurements are the only type of observation available as also noted hill and østerby 2003 by using the pm approach the ratio between recharge and hydraulic conductivity was constrained using the long term groundwater head measurements and also the ratio between hydraulic conductivity and porosity near the injection well field was constrained by the tracer tests independent constraining of hydraulic conductivity near the injection well field was also possible with the use of pump test data it must be emphasized here that the proposed approach is most useful for two situations i when data is available to constrain multiple patch models within a parent model or ii whether or not there is data if a prediction is being made that is dependent on both regional scale flow features and small scale parameter detail this patch dynamic approach can be used for a better characterization of predictive uncertainty in our study there was only one patch model at each spatial and temporal level modelled injection tracer tests were conducted in only one out of 20 injection wells because of the high field costs involved however availability of data from more wells would facilitate building of more patch models in a scale commensurate with the 2d radial transport model this would then help to better constrain the well field water quality model similarly pump test data from multiple wells would help to better constrain the flow models 4 3 stochastic prediction analysis after calibration of the sub regional model and the well field water quality model using the hpdp approach null space monte carlo analysis was undertaken for both these models at this stage these models were run independently from the regional model and the 2d radial transport model given that lateral flux boundaries of both these models were informed by the flux estimates from the regional model changes in these flux values for different realizations of the model parameterization were accounted for in the stochastic simulation this was achieved by varying the conductance value of the lateral boundaries within the nsmc analysis nsmc analysis resulted in 500 calibration constrained parameter sets for both sub regional and well field water quality models the injection induced groundwater head increase was simulated at three observation bores using the sub regional model as shown in fig 10 and observed over the entire simulation period of 100 years from 2013 to 2113 these three observation bores were located close to the injection well field groundwater head increase for these three bores simulated by the well field water quality model is shown in fig 11 the predicted maximum head increase at the nearest domestic bore was 4 3 m located around 15 km from the injection bore it may be noted that the primary objective of the well field water quality model is to predict the range of concentration changes that could be expected from the simulated head hydrographs it is evident that the head predictions with the well field water quality model has larger uncertainty compared to that of the sub regional model this is because the predictions are more sensitive to the lateral boundaries which are located closer to the injection wells compared to the sub regional model the wider range of flow velocities resulting from these simulations enabled a more comprehensive and rigorous simulation of transport process and thus a robust characterization of contamination risk it also indicates that the sub regional model has model simplification errors which are made explicit when examining the same simulations with the finer scale model and its parameterization this simplification error is discussed in detail in white et al 2014 potential water quality risks resulting from contaminant migration as a result of high pressure injection was simulated by modelling the contaminant transport scenario the peak value of contaminant concentrations realized within the each model cell of the well field water quality model was characterized as the ratio of the maximum simulated concentration over the simulation period to the injected concentration uncertainty in the predicted concentration was quantified as the standard deviation obtained from 500 nsmc simulations contours of mean value of maximum concentration simulated using the calibrated model and the corresponding uncertainty estimates are shown in fig 12 the stochastic simulations indicated that for this hypothesized extreme scenario of contaminant release maximum value of concentration would drop down to 1 100th and 1 1000th of the initial concentration within a distance of around 5 km within the well field considering that the nearest risk receptors were located at least 15 km from the injection wells and that continuous mobilization of contaminants is highly unlikely it was inferred that the proposed injection scheme posed minimal risks of contamination to the existing domestic bores the groundwater head predictions indicated a maximum head increase of up to 140 m in the observation bores close to the injection wells with a prediction standard deviation of 10 m however the predicted maximum head increase in the nearest domestic bore located at 15 km from the well field was 4 3 m the predicted increase in groundwater head in the well field indicates the positive impact from the injection scheme given the slow velocity of groundwater flow in this regional aquifer the injected water will be available for beneficial use over many decades 5 conclusion a hierarchical patch dynamics method for efficient modelling of groundwater flow and transport processes across multiple spatial and temporal scales has been developed the method has been applied for the stochastic prediction of flow and transport associated with a proposed coal seam gas production water injection scheme in the surat basin in australia high pressure injection into fresh water aquifers is considered to be a potential option for the beneficial use of water produced as a by product of csg extraction considering the high value and intensive use of great artesian basin aquifers in this region simulation of the flow and transport processes triggered by the injection scheme were needed in a risk analysis framework to quantify the potential impacts and associated risks while stochastic modelling supports the quantification of the probability of outcomes computationally this represents a challenging modelling problem given the need to simulate both small scale transport processes and large scale pressure impacts from the cumulative impacts of reinjection across the regional scheme the hierarchical patch dynamics method demonstrated in this paper enabled calibration and stochastic predictive analysis of groundwater flow and transport using four different patch models built in multiple spatial and temporal scales collectively groundwater observations from small scale pump tests and tracer tests and large scale regional monitoring networks were used to constrain these models a major advantage of developing patch models is that groundwater processes can be represented with the required level of complexity at appropriate scales in independent patch models yet still retain the advantages of information transfer of fully coupled models each patch model employed a spatial and temporal grid resolution and an associated parameterization that was appropriate for extracting the maximum information content from available data at the same time undesirable lumping or averaging of parameters and observations were successfully avoided by using this approach thus avoiding model simplification errors the information obtained from patch models at each scale was also used to constrain models of other scales through the use of extrapolated joining predictions which included boundary condition observations as well as concentrations these joining predictions were specifically designed to transfer prediction salient information from one model scale to another the use of the extrapolated joining predictions represents a step change to existing hierarchical patch dynamic implementations as they do not require fully coupled models in order to transform information between patch models instead joining predictions enable models to be run independently associated models are constrained through calibration to the prediction salient information encapsulated in the joining predictions this allows finer spatial and temporal discretization and process simulations to be adopted only in the patch models used to extract information from the data if predictions are being made at a larger regional scale this can be simulated with a larger prediction simulation model which is indirectly constrained by the fine scale information via the use of the joining predictions similarly this approach also permits the use of information gained from more complex models such as reactive transport models which are otherwise computationally intractable for stochastic prediction analysis the improved computational efficiency achieved using this approach in place of fully coupled nested models is significant stochastic prediction analysis was undertaken in our study using nsmc analysis and the uncertainty of the extrapolation or joining observations predictions are incorporated in this analysis the proposed method is generic and can be applied to a wide range of groundwater modelling problems beyond the example in the paper regarding simulation of impacts of a proposed injection scheme for csg extraction the patch modelling approach is particularly useful where multiple processes are to be modelled and when data available for constraining the model and in different spatial and temporal scales acknowledgements this research was funded by csiro s gas industry social and
